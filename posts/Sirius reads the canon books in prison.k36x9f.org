after a couple of years in Azkaban, Sirius has given up hope. Just waiting to die, suddenly a book materializes in front of him. He must be getting crazy already, for the title of the book is "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone".

Now, with all seven books read, he escapes Azkaban with a mission. First, save a little boy from an abusive home, and then save the world in his stead.

Warn Harry about the visions being lies from Voldemort, explain the communication mirror, teach Harry the messenger patronus thing, or just go smash the prophecy rather than guarding it, all of these could be done with far less foreknowledge.

With the knowledge he has he'd even be able to get Kreacher to not hate him and therefore not happily sell him out like that, all that takes is destroying a locket.

To say nothing of the fact that unless we've got one hell of a boring stations of canon story there's no reason for it to even come up, it's dependent on so many other events which would go differently.

Some things can be kept the same, of course, but there would need to be a valid reason for that, such as a character having personal motivation and means to 'put things back on track', or the event being too unrelated for butterflies to affect (yet).

**** Eh, I could see Sirius knowing something about them. Like they exist, a general description, are evil, and Herpo the Foul is involved.

Him being a Black, I see him grabbing a few books and hiding whenever he pissed off his mother. The Blacks having a copy of /Magick Moste Evile/ would be par for the course. And I see Dumbledore removing that book from the library in canon.

And Sirius continuing the hiding and reading when he eventually moves in with the Potters. I could see them playing around, getting in trouble and Sirius hides, this time with Potter books. The Potters had a few Aurors over the years, so detection spells and the like could be part of them.

If you had this knowledge at the diary part, it would scream horcrux. The Diadem itself would stand out because of the way it was pointed out and described in book5. When I first read that part I instantly thought "that is important, we are coming back to this later." And I was right. He doesn't have to go "its a horcrux lolololol", he would still go back and inspect it. Insert flashback of Lily explaining Chekov's Gun.

He goes back home and casts a detection spell and almost craps his pants when the locket shows up.

Hell, you could even throw in a story arc where he goes to Greece to hunt down Herpo's lair. He had to have destroyed his own horcrux, or returned it to his body or something, as he's obviously still not around. or you could go the wtf route and make Nicholas Flamel Herpo.

******** But young Dumbledore was from a poor, socially weak family living on the outskirts of a muggle village. His friendship with GG guy only lasted for a relatively short time, and when he had limited access to educational resources. Normal education? Sure. Some salvaged bits of dark magic? Yes, as well as the few bits Grindewald shared before the Arianna's murder and him rapidly vacating the premises.

It should be noted however that while a brilliant academic, Dumbledore had a deep aversion to the darker spectrum since his sister's murder, and when he later gained power and influence by defeating his ex-friend, he was already unwilling to use it for the sake of power, which getting esoteric, secret knowledge would count as. There are not many magics that deal with soul mentioned in books and even in fanfiction for a good reason - most people do not use those at all. It is after all an ill-researched, thin branch of magic that few even acknowledge exists.

TLDR: Dumbledore had neither means nor motive to do something like that. By the time he got proof of horcrux, it was too late to hunt down the rare bits of soul lore and discover/make a spell from scratch.

And it's likely such exists, given the lack of egyptian warlords popping up every month or so.

**** If he tampers with the timeline, then his future knowledge becomes, essentially, worthless. That's why they follow the timeline in most time travel plots because otherwise you get to a point where you're no better off than you were before.

I recently just finished (what's written of) The Gates of Azkaban which isn't exactly a time travel fic but shares many similarities. Hermione and Snape change so many things that they basically turn James and Lily's wedding into the Battle of Hogwarts. But they haven't got all the Horcruxes at this point and Voldemort's still got so essentially they just get everyone killed for no reason at all... although Dumbledore has half-blinded Voldemort. The next action set piece is the mass breakout which is even worse for the Aurors and the Order than the Wedding. They've got no idea where the Cup is and as of the last chapter, Voldemort knows the horcruxes aren't safe. So... basically, they're in a much, much worse position than they ever were in canon. Of course, with that particular fic they travel back so far timeline preservation is less their problem than terrible strategic decision making, but it's the same principle.

That being said, depending when Sirius gets the books, he's got one big reason to ignore the timeline... if Pettigrew /hasn't/ rejoined Voldemort, then all the horcruxes have known locations and no resurrected Voldemort to either defend or replenish them. The problem is, Sirius would read no further than POA before escaping since he'd gun for Peter literally as soon as he figures out who Scabbers is. It is, in fact, possible he'd stop reading the first time Scabbers is described. And I suspect most fanfics with this premise would have Sirius escape as soon as he realises where Harry ended up.

***** That was them being incautious and/or author playing up the trope. Too many people watch Star Trek uncritically...

The very point of writing a time travel fic of any kind is to change the timeline. The lazy option involves killing off a score of characters to keep the cast within the Dunbar's number.

It should also be noted that the 'preserve the timeline' option relies on perfect reset - where every other event has/will proceed in the same fashion, the assumption that can not be in any way justified (like any other absolute concept).

Much of the angst in those kinds of fic is caused by characters trying to play chessmaster without prior experience or relying on their foreknowledge instead of using it as a reference guide and updating their model as events progress. In fact, the books' most important contribution would not be the timeline of events, but instead the look inside of heads of several characters, showing their habits, capabilities, methodologies and opinions which can the be planned around.

​

My solution to such a situation would be to wait only as long as it would take me to assemble a list of critical requirements (or my victory condition, such as Sirius and Harry are alive, healthy, reasonably happy. the end), what would need to be achieved for that to happen, and the most efficient way to achieve that. Not trying to save everyone from the get go (the arrogance!), but achieving the minimal win foirst, then help out according to my availability and my morals.

******* In The Back to the Future time travel was explictly a hobby that could cause problems with the timeline (no paradox protection), so the plot was fixing that up - which by itself was a change (I mean, it was basically observing as through some means, like a moment of carelessness, the timeline A was turned into timeline B, and then taking overt action to change it 'back', creating a timeline C resembling timeline A. Or, an A' if you will). Even then, sometimes the fix was not perfect and small changes persisted.

While I am not as familiar with Dr. Who, one of the plot points in the series was the Timelord species locking the time continuum of the universe (otherwise they would be just another hi-tech civ, not Timelords). That means it's not a viable example of interation with a default set up, as theirs was clearly artificial.

I also figured that was just Time Lord cultural taboo, but early on in the reboot they address it. Turns out if you change a fixed point, monsters show up to fix it. (Or...eat people? It's been a good long while since I watched that episode.)

It is, in fact, possible he'd stop reading the first time Scabbers is described. And I suspect most fanfics with this premise would have Sirius escape as soon as he realises where Harry ended up.

These are very good points to consider.

**** Because it could change the future of the series. Like the domino effect, it may result in Voldemort winning if he tampers with it too much. Picture this. Sirius tries to avoid his death, which means Harry will live with him, but then because he isn't under his mother's protection charm, they get attacked

***** Then it would be a one shot where he reads the books only to realize that he can't interfere and so stays in Azkaban.

My point is very simple: Sirius escaping early leads to massive changes that make the canon plot moot. If he doesn't escape early, then what's the point of writing the fic? No one in any state of mind would stay a moment longer in Azkaban than they have to, no one. Reading the books will drive him to escape, since the books will tell him exactly where Pettigrew is.

*** Screw the timeline, things went horribly for most of the good guys there and very little positive depends on it.

All he really needs to keep the same is that Voldemort must return with Harry's blood and hit him with a killing curse, and there's no reason it has to be the same people doing it.\\
Hard part is going to be getting Dumbledore to believe him (because it's all rather unbelievable), then you just have Snape do that ritual potion and have Dumbledore and the Order on hand to kick Voldemort's arse once he's mortal.

**** And even that is not certain.

There exists possibility that the Scarcrux could be removed in some other way (such as cutting out a bunch of skin and bone then dumping it in Fiendfyre), and once Voldemort has no anchors... well I see three options: one, he dies now that there is nothing keeping him in the land of the living. two, he stays around, but he's vulnerable to exorcism. Three, he needs to be reincorporated and killed... Which could be achieved by feeding Quirrel a Befuddlement Draught and letting Riddle take full control.

Heck, as much as I dislike the "sealed evil in a can" trope, getting Voldieplasm into an unbreakable jar and dropping the jar in the Locket Cave would be a sufficient solution. At the very least, it would buy time until he needed to be dealt with permanently.

***** Sealing him in the Cave is almost worse than death + far more fitting way to deal with him imo, he wants to be immortal, have him spend his entire existance trapped in a place he can't escape, where he cant feel nor see, he would probably go insane after a few years.

****** I read one fic which had him placed in cryopod and his wand cuffed to him, but encased in some kind of transparent supermaterial. The stasis held until the Earth was nearing the end of its life cycle, with athmosphere long gone and Sun about to go boom. He was the last human-ish in the system as others left generations ago. It was in response to a Voldemort who Fideliused his horcrux and dropped it into Mariana Trench.

**** Tons of time travel movies have this plot. If you are able to know what to do to save somebody before their death, wouldn't you do it? For example, Sirius might want to try and save Lupin. But that relies on him staying alive in the Department of Mysteries, which might cause other events to happen
