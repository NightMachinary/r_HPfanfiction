What was your biggest "why the hell would you... oh... OH! okay, yeah that works" moment?

As an example, I've frequently seen the name Hadrian in fics and for the longest time assumed it was someone who was simply bored with, or too cool for, Harry or Harold. Then someone pointed out that there is in fact a Hadrian's Wall in Britain, and it all made more sense to me (not to imply that the authors all intended that, just that I suddenly felt a lot less irritated reading the name)


** Just because there is a Hadrian's wall doesn't make Hadrian make sense. Harry is not a short form of Hadrian. Hadrian isn't even a posh name, the two Hadrian's I've known were both from mining families. Harry is however a short form of Harold and Henry which do make sense but I still don't like them.

**** There is a extension that does something like that: [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-replacer/djakfbefalbkkdgnhkkdiihelkjdpbfh][Word Replacer]]

I use Word Filter to replace annoying typos I can't stand (eg. Slitherin), but it wasn't on the store anymore.

***** yeah but theres this one harry/daphne story that's pretty up there in reviews/favorites/follows - but the fucker is named hadrian. I mean, there has to be something alright about it if so many people like it. Or maybe, everyone thats not retarded noped out the moment they saw hadrian, so the only people left to favorite/leave good reviews are the people that'll read anything

My immediate suspicion as well. Plus, reviews sorta mean shit when figuring out if a fic is worth reading. I pretty much only go off rec sites.

** For me, it's in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] when you wonder why Year 3 is starting up and Sirius hasn't escaped from Azkaban.

Then you realize [[/spoiler][that he never saw the picture of Peter with the Weasleys in Egypt, because the Weasleys never went to Egypt, because Ginny died in the Chamber]]
