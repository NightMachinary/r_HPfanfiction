Since I've first started reading fanfiction years and years ago, for some reason or another I've always been drawn to these stories. If you know any, I'd love to hear them!

I just finished reading Timely Errors. I'm looking fo one that has some better writing than that one, hopefully--though anyhing on the same level isn't terrible.

I'm fine if harry/the gang is OP, that can be fun to read too sometimes :)

thanks friends!


** I always loved this idea too but hate how it always seem to revolve around Harry going back to meet his parents except he can't tell them who he really is and has to go back to the present eventually and let them get killed by Voldemort. Like really? I highly doubt a Harry who managed to get sent back in time could really resist trying to save his parents. Anyway, rant over. I'll watch this thread too and hope to see some new good suggestions.
