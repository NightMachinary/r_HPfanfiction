I'd love a fic with John Constantine in it.


** John Constantine had been outside this plane of existence for awhile and needed a drink. His cousin had married Old Money, and her husband James always had a respectable supply of fire whiskey on hand he wouldn't have to trade his soul for. Again.

His search brought him to a memorial and a destroyed house. Further investigation led him to suburbia. "Fucking amateurs." was muttered as he crossed, of all things, blood wards. Petunia's shriek of recognition as she answered the door was met with a flicked fag to the face, "Where's the kid?"

** The only one I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1980013/1/Hellblazer-Hogwarts][Hellblazer: Hogwarts]] in which John gets knocked into the Harry Potter universe and is hired as the Defense professor. It's well written and a fun read, but unfortunately it's long dead.

  Sometimes, life bashes you upside the head with a brick in a sock. Hogwarts is about to get its latest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, a man cast adrift from his native world- a man named John Constantine.
