** I am 100% down to read something like this. Manipulative!Dumbledore always leads to bashing in any fic i've read so it'd be a nice change of pace.

*** And the bashing usually undercuts how smart Dumbledore actually is and paints him almost like a Scooby Doo villain.

**** A crackfic based on this would be funny. Harry can be Fred, Daphne Greengrass is, well, Daphne, Hermione can be Velma, Ron can be Shaggy, and a creature companion can be Scooby doo.

****** Now that you mention this, I remember a (semi-?)crack fic where a super OP harry does to kill voldemort. Pretends to be the scooby gang then hunts down voldie and kills him. Don't remember the name, but it was on ffn. Think it was a collection of oneshots

******* I wrote a comment a while back showing that Shaggy and Scooby were the AU version of Harry and Sirius if they left at the end of 3rd year. Sirius stays in dog form to avoid drawing attention, and Harry has a history of apparating in distress. The chase scenes are canon.

They always believe the monster of the week is actually a monster because they're used to it being an actual monster, they're scared because they can't do proper defensive magic without being caught by the government, and two people with experience with long-term starvation are going to hoard every bit of food they find. Also, Harry's hair is messy. Scraggly. Maybe even Shaggy.

******* Pretty sure that's in 'Pranking of the Multiverse'? As far as I rememeber, it's a cracky version of Lone Traveller.

  Harry Potter has achieved immense power, a large bit of craziness, and a desire to seek amusement where he can. This will be a series of stories of him traversing the multiverse solving problems through ways that amuse him. Various crossovers planned.

  Harry Potter is back in time at the end of his third year at Hogwarts. The list of people he trusts is short, and he knows how badly things can go, but he doesn't know where all the Horcruxes are. He's broken, and he's been charged with saving the world.

** This is slightly the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore in “Honour Thy Blood by The Black's Resurgence” linkffn(12155794). It seems a bit condescending, but otherwise rather persuasive. And aside from that I really appreciated the real magical war (the Grindewald one).

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
