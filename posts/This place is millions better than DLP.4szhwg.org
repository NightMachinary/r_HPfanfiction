** DLP is a bit harsh at times. However, if you wanna go for really productive criticism, you'll get it there.

** The sub is awesome, for sure. DLP is too. Don't let the snark get you down.

If you ever feel like they be playing you for a sucka, just remember to tell them to put some Respek on your name. 'Cause you could've pulled up on them, but that wouldn't have been gangsta, now would it?

Anyways, I digress. DLP isn't for anyone, but if you haven't noticed, there's a fair bit of crossover between the two communities. Whatever behaviours you found disagreeable might end up following you here, and vice versa.

Still, it's cool that you're loving it. Rec us a good fic some time :)

** DLP seems exclusive and pretentious. I've never been interested.
