Rank them starting from number 5, and remember that the Weasley twins count as one spot.


** Harry, the twins, Sirius, Remus, James/Lily

** I'm sad to see such few replies but this actually interests me, so I'll give it a shot.

1) Sirius, 2) Dumbledore, 3) the Crouches, 4) Snape and 5) Regulus Black.

Too many minor characters for my liking but thus is life.

*** Seamus Finnigan is a weird choice, even for a minor character; may I ask why?

** 1. Dumbledore : I think he is the most complex character of the serie, and I'm a big fan of the "old and wise mentor" in general.
2. Harry : the hero, really liked how he often seemed out of his depth in a war between Voldemort and Dumbledore.
3. Tom Riddle : I like vilains and he is an excellent one.
4. Ron : I'll protect my boy to the end.
5. I'm not sure about my 5th, maybe Pettigrew : I find it funny how a "miserable" man, mocked by both side, was arguably the most succesfull Death Eater in term of damages done.

** Snape, Hagrid, Luna, Ron, Dumbledore. Honorable mention to Lord Voldemort, though he's more fun to speculate about than to actually read.
