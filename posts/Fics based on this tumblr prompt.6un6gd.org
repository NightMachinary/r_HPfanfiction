** I am... very confused. This premise /is/ interesting, but, uhm...

- Wasn't Regulus quite a bit older than what you'd call a "boy" when he died?
- Why would Regulus assume James knew what a Horcrux was, or even be on a first-name basis with him? As far as I can tell, canon Regulus never turned full turncoat like Snape, merely found out about the Locket Horcrux and ran off on his own to destroy it.
- Why would Regulus think James and Sirius hated Dumbledore? Last I checked, adult-James and Dumbledore were very good friends.

*** 1) I believe Regulus was two years younger than Sirius and the marauders. We know Regulus was 16 when he joined the death eaters, and he died a few years later. Given that James & Lily were 20-21 when they died, and that Regulus died before them, it absolutely makes sense that he'd only be a year or two older than Harry.

2) Regulus assumes James knows what a horcrux is because the scene is taking place where a horcrux was kept. There's really no other reason for someone to be there unless they're hunting the horcrux. As for a first name basis, there's a lot more guesswork there. We have no information on their relationship, though we can reasonably assume they know each other's first names. In the stress of the situation(horxrux hunting, being revived from a like of inferi, etc), it's easy enough to pass it off as a Regulus just acting on instinct, without any judgment of their relationship. However, lots of people do assume that Sirius & Regulus' relationship was a lot better than Sirius' with the rest of the family. This leads some fanfictions to conclude that Regulus would've been a friendly-ish acquaintance of the marauders(which might be where the author of this post is coming from).

3) This is also the creation of fanfiction to a degree. Basically, the fandom has to come up with an idea to explain why James & Lily didn't tell Dumbledore about the secret keeper bluff with Peter/Sirius. Even if they didn't want to use Dumbledore as the secret keeper, it still makes sense to tell him as a precaution against the events of cannon unfolding. One of the most common explanations is that James & Lily discover that Dumbledore lies/misleads/manipulates something regarding the prophecy, which drives a wedge in the relationship. "Hate" probably stretches it too far for comfort, as we know they still follow Dumbledore's lead and work with him on the fight against Voldemort, but it's not too hard to get to a sense of distrust, etc.

I agree with your assessment though, this has potential as an extremely interesting story. I would love to read it in the hands of a good author.

**** Ah, I see. I rarely touch Marauders-era fanfics, so I was unfamiliar with these 'givens'. My headcanon on 2) was actually completely different --- I always assumed Regulus and Sirius hated each other, increasingly so as the years went by and their morals/politics drifted further and further apart. As for 3), I see, but I don't really like Manipulative!Dumbledore so it didn't cross my mind --- my explanation for them not telling him would be more that it was automatic Marauder thinking at play: "Dumbledore's our friend but he's still a teacher, we just /don't/ tell him about our oh-so-clever secret plan".

***** I actually tend to agree with you on number 2. I think the Sirius/Regulus relationship would be at least very strained, if not outwardly antagonistic. Sirius despised his family's beliefs and it's hard to see him still being close to a brother who embraced it fully by becoming a death eater.

You're interpretation on #3 is just as plausible as any other. 20 year olds, especially those 20 year olds, are definitely likely to get caught up in the cleverness of their plan. I'm not really a Manipulative!Dumbledore fan either, so I may have to start thinking along your lines!

** It doesn't /quite/ answer the prompt, but on AO3, LullabyKnell has an ongoing WIP called "face death in the hope" where Harry travels back in time after the Battle of Hogwarts and saves Regulus from the Inferi, and from there it's a Time-Travel fix-it fic.

*** there are plenty of fics where regulus comes back somehow or is saved through time-travel shenanigans mate, i think he asks for this exact circumstance.
