Imagine blinding your opponent with a ridiculously overpowered Lumos in the middle of a duel? Imagine using a simple concussion hex to deafen them, then use the Eat Slugs curse to make them think you're casting the Killing Curse (both are green; no way to determine which is which unless you can hear the incantation), forcing them to dive into an overpowered cutting curse or Stunner. Why don't we see more of this?


** Depends what you consider "more often". I see these fairly commonly. The school-yard jinx dueling repertoire doesn't feel that rare, but I will admit that it's mostly in older fanfics.

** I could be wrong about this, but I don't think there's really any evidence for overpowered spells being a thing in canon. That's not to say that no one should do it in fics, but it probably is why more people don't.

*** Aren't Levitation Charms proof that you can put more power behind a spell, though? Like, you need more power to lift the rubbles of an entire five-storey building than for a simple feather.

**** Ron was able to lift the Troll's club but not a feather, and I don't believe there was any mention of him being exhausted afterwards. As far as I can recall, there aren't any other instances in canon of levitation charms being used in a particularly impressive way.

Yes, it makes sense for it to be harder to lift the rubble of a building than a feather. But "harder" is very ill-defined. Does it mean it takes more magic, more concentration, more willpower, or some other thing that we muggles can't understand?

The only canon examples of spells being too hard for someone to cast that I can think of (and not just a matter of getting the words and/or motions wrong) are the Patronus and the unforgivables, and with both of those, the difficulty came from the emotional component, not the power required.

But even if we assume that some spells do need more power than others, and that a spell may fail when not given enough power, that doesn't mean overpowering it means anything. Even if it takes 1 unit of magic to levitate a feather and 20 units to levitate a boulder, that doesn't mean that trying to use 20 units to levitate the feather will do anything special, or that it's even possible. That extra energy might just be wasted, like trying to put out a match by pouring a bucket of water on it.

But I really don't have a problem with anyone deciding that overpowered spells should be a thing in their stories. I just think that we don't see it in canon because Rowling decided to not make it a thing in her stories, and many fanfic authors follow her lead. Of course, the magic system in Harry Potter is so ambiguous that you can justify it working pretty much however you want.

****** In the books, it was the combination of his, Hermione's, and Ron's (iirc, it may have been one of the adults instead of Ron), that lifted Snape and made him hit the wall so hard he got knocked out. We do have proof of more than 1 spell being stronger than just one (see McGonagall getting stunned in Book 5).

** Because you're opening quite the can of worms by making this possible.

It's difficult enough to write a sensible, coherent plot and society while keeping in mind the capabilities of magic.

What are the limits and what does the world look like when everybody can do that?

Can Voldemort overpower a bombarda and flatten Hogwarts?

Can Snape overpower an accio to summon Sirius' shirt, dragging him into the castle to be executed?

Can you overpower a homenum revelio charm to reveal the location of everyone in a city?

** Well, I assume that these are probably a bit harder to cast, messier than and more difficult to control than just using a spell the way it's designed. A bit like using a sledgehammer as a screwdriver - sure you can swing at it until the screw is in the wood and it'll probably hold, or you can just use a specialized tool and have a much easier time.

** People don't really think about it because they are taught to not really hurt people. It's all Dumbledore's fault for not wanting to train soldiers and teach the children how to kill.

Any spell can be used to kill if you are creative about it... but only a rare few have the guts and determination to actually do it.

No one wants to just wreck havok on everything when fighting. It's all stunning, disarming and pathetic jinxs that do little more than irritate the other person. In the real world, I'd be going for high powered blasting and cutting curses... cant fight back if I cut your wand arm off.. or your head.

** Well firstly, the Killing Curse is pretty easily noticed by the wind that follows it/wooshing etc... (also highly illegal especially in an official duelling setting). Also, there are countercurses and spells you can use to take the effects of a Hex off of you. Lumos is also a wand-lighting charm and is typically only /so/ powerful. There is no evidence that you can make a Charm act with more power than it typically has, it's only about mastering the spell and at that point, it just is what it is.

That's why Wizards use different fire spells/Fiendfyre instead of Incendio.

**** I'd still say you could probably distinguish it. The Killing Curse is an incredibly dark curse, and it should have a unique energy and color and feel to it that probably can't really be replicated.

There might be an "oh shit" moment in anyone, and most people would dodge it, but I'd say people like Moody or Dumbledore or most of the major Death Eaters would be able to recognize it.
