60k+ would be preferable.

Romance / smut are cool.

Preferably no male/male slash (If it's a minor part of the story and it's not HP/DM, HP/LM, HP/LV or HP/SS then I can deal with it).

I prefer action-y stuff but any type of story is fine...

**** Well, it is:

1. The rational!protagonist is Hermione, which makes a lot more sense than Harry, since you basically have to rewrite Harry's personality and temperament from scratch [[/spoiler][,which is pretty much what actually happened in HPMOR,]] to make him one, whereas Hermione requires a few tweaks.
2. The protagonist is highly intelligent and brings some knowledge that wizards don't have; but she is also shown to be ignorant in consequential ways, and she is not afraid to actually admit it.
3. The protagonist is clever and reflective, but she is also inexperienced and makes a lot of mistakes that actually have significant negative consequences for herself --- she actually loses for real, as opposed to HPMOR's "throw an escalating tantrum until they give you what you want because you're the author avatar".
4. The protagonist doesn't just get handed freebies like Time-Turners and Invisibility Cloaks. Quite to the contrary, a series of events (in addition to her own mistakes) conspire to get her into deep trouble, and she is only beginning to think about how to climb out.
5. Far more respect for canon characters and setting is shown. Adults aren't useless.
6. Generally, I find the quality of writing to be better: less gimmicky, and characters actually feel like plausible people rather than character archetypes in a commedia dell'arte.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

** Well, it's not the most unknown of fanfics, but “Biting the Hand That Feeds You” (linkffn(10287864)) is only recommended occasionally. It contains ridiculousness, squibs, action scenes, and /the godfather/.

Then there is “Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer” (linkffn(7866134)). I have no idea how often recommended this story is, but it might be something you have not yet read and it is, in its own way, quite glorious.

The final of the three I will give is “Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina” (linkffn(8895954)). It may or may not be to your liking because it is not a Harry-centric story, but it does contain Regulus being awesome which I found entertaining.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

Foolish linkffn(7181871) - Kinda AU wasn't really into it when i started but as it went on i really liked it.

****** I know many people like the angst/comfort/hurt genre. But I don't think our main characters going broke immediately following the Battle would be canon compliant. They didn't just lead happy lives 20 years later, but RULED magical Britain, and that would not have been achieved if they had drown themselves in PTSD misery for years!

They were after all mentally extremely strong. They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on power immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best. They knew they COULDN'T AFFORD to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

Their decision to send Harry and Ron into auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional demands. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls recruiting more followers at Hogwarts.

We know Ron and Neville spent only a few years as Aurors, which meant that Death Eater threats were mostly gone by that point. Harry needed only 8 years to make it to the Head Auror, which implied that he was very successful at this job. He spent a further decade as Head Auror before becoming the director of DMLE. Another implication of those canon facts was that Harry had the loyalty of Magical Britain's military force.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?

--------------

Another problem with 'weak' Ginny is that Harry was INCAPABLE of consoling hurting girls. Hermione already experienced that in the Tent. He dumped Cho mainly because her mopping over Cedric. Harry, being the Vanquisher of the Immortal Dark Lord, Ministry's hottest new hire, sole heir to two Ancient Houses, and generally a charismatic young man, would be besieged by suitors. A mopping Ginny would most likely lose Harry.

****** What I liked about both, and especially Ghost of You, is it made me question the very idea of OOC in a post-war, canon compliant fic.

Ginny is tough in canon, but in both stories she is a bit of an emotional wreck. But I found it believable in both. She is still a young woman who has experienced the trauma of her brother dying and thinking Harry, the presumed love of her life, also dying. Then when you add in the press, not seeing Harry during her final year at school, reliving the trauma of the previous year, and everyone whispering about her, it made complete sense for her to behave that way.

Thoughts? What did you think of the whole mental breakdown plot in Ghost of You?

******* Yeah i agree, once you get past the events of DH, Canon Compliance opens up for me, i find it completely plausible for any of the characters to go through some sort of depression/PTSD, and still go on to live happy lives by the epilogue.

Ginny more so perhaps for everything you said, but also when you factor in the events of CoS, we never know how she responds to that, does she potential unresolved issues from that period?, which we don't know how she reacted/overcame those issues.... by all accounts - at least to me by the end of DH Ginny should have some issues she needs to deal with. Its impossible for someone to go through events like that and not have some sort of emotional damage done.

Its one of the complaints i saw in a few reviews for Ghost of You was how OOC Ginny was, and she is, at times in that story she is not very likable, but she is in a very bad place. Like, she is supposed to be OOC, in the sense that she has changed, War and Trauma have changed her, its whether or not she can overcome that is what makes these two stories great. I really like how in both Harry, is a mix of the cure and cause, which makes their relationship far more interesting.

******** True, and the fact remains even in canon, we don't know for sure exactly who Ginny is. There is a general perception she is a tough-as-nails badass who is almost immune to negative feelings. She is a bad ass, and she is tough. But she is also fragile at times, like any human would be. For example, when Harry breaks up with her, she remains stoic because that's what he needs. But when they all go home, Ron mentions to Harry how torn up she's been about it. I think Ginny portrays a very tough, resilient person to the outside world, but when she often breaks down, not that I'd blame her.

********* Absolutely! I like to think she has a front she puts up to the world, and that deep down she is a fairly emotional person, I mean think about how honest she probably was with Tom Riddles diary it makes sense that she would be wary of 1. letting people know what she really feels, and 2. Being controlled - we kinda saw that with Dean and how she reacted being helped through the portrait hole, but that is likely a smaller example, Harry not letting her join the battle probably angered her far more ... at least that's what I like to think of Ginny her underdevelopment kinda allows everyone to form their own ideas of her.

I loved how she was treated in both of these fics most other post war stories are far too easy, and her and Harry live happily ever after from the morning after the battle and I just don't see it being that easy for them. I mean really they were only together for a short period before DH their relationship is relativly young, it also annoys me that Harry says I love you far to quickly in most fics, he never says it to anyone in the series and although it's clear he loves Ginny it should be a big deal for him to say it, which in turn should annoy Ginny.

But anyway I'm ranting...

********** No, please keep ranting. I'm right there with you.

Everything you mentioned is why fanfiction is perfectly suited for a character like Ginny. I never actually thought of the fact that her views on Dean helping her could be traced to the diary. Good point!

I honestly feel like Harry trying to keep her locked away would've been something that could have destroyed them as a couple and is something Harry would really need to work on. In that moment, he was denying one of the core attributes that makes Ginny who she is. Ginny willingly accepted Harry breaking it off to go kill Voldemort. He was not willing to give her the same respect, though I understand his rationale.

I did a re-reading of the story a week ago and thought Ginny wasn't as temperamental and frustrating as I remembered her being in the story. Did you find her difficult to root for?

I thought Harry had overreacted when he broke things off? And all the bad things people said Ginny did were a bit overblown. Like how she "strung" Neville along. Agree or disagree?

*********** This conversation has literally promoted me to start a re-read myself It's been awhile an iv read it and I've been through alot of stories since so I hope I don't jumble things up in my head, but I don't remember ever feeling like I was against her at all it just seemed clear that Harry and Hermione were kinda devoted to keeping her on track, which she didnt seem to appreciate, and that she never seemed interested in anyone else's life (apologies of this is wrong like I said it's been awhile) and all of that is completely understandable considering what she is going through.

If I remember correctly i could see that she was stringing Neville along but it wasn't intentional to me it was more that she didn't realise she was doing it, I dunno it's something I'm going to watch out for on my read through. I do remember thinking at one point that Neville would probably have been a healthier relationship for her though.

Like I said one of the things that I really liked was that Harry is part of her problem iv just read the first chapter and everytime she looks into his eyes she is reminded of the battle and Fred and it causes her to become hysterical again. If i remember the one part where Harry bringing her back to his flat after qudditch match (again like I side it's been awhile this could be when that breakup happens) and it seems he was very selfish at that point as she repetdily said she didn't want to go, and yes I do belive he overreacted but that is also another thing I loved about this fic - Harry was portrayed in a really interesting way at that point he was fairly stressed but it's clear he has trust issues, his reaction was way over the top and it newly undone all of her recovery until that point .. i also remember feeling that Harry taking care of her also helped him to overcome his own problems if only by distracting him and that he was really selfish alot of he time.

It's like they damage each other but they need each other at the same time which make it really cool dynamic

Sorry If some of that makes no sense it's been awhile and I kinda have some Inner Demons moments mixed up in my head too, they are really similar after all!

************ Actually, Harry's presence overall was one of the only things that didn't cause her to break down in hysterics.

Harry comes across pretty good for taking care of her, but at first it does come across a bit too much as being overprotective, whereas Neville tries to treat her like nothing is wrong. I guess the author wanted to plant the idea of Neville being who she should be with in your head before you realize that no, Harry actually was far more in tuned with Ginny than anyone thought, and he actually sacrifices a lot for her, which is something unique about them.

I think what I liked about their dynamic was that it was a product of the environment so much. Ginny having these health issues, both of them being away from each other, and then this addition of Neville and the fact he has a close relationship with Ginny wholly separate from Harry created serious tension. But what makes them work is that their feelings for each other are just that strong. It's not that Harry is bad for Ginny and the relationship is toxic. But the connection is just so powerful that they can't just break it off as soon as it becomes difficult. I enjoy stories like this that take this angle.

I think the Neville storyline is incredibly unique (i mean, essentially its a Neville-bashing fic which is almost unheard of) yet also not at all difficult to believe.

We don't realize exactly how much they went through together leading the DA and how close that would make the pair. It really isn't explored in canon, but I'd love for a short story from Rowling on this subject.

As you said, Neville would seem on paper to be the better choice for Ginny. Which also makes the story very realistic since despite the logic of the two, Harry is the one for Ginny. You can't fight feelings. And despite Matthew Lewis being considered very attractive, nothing in canon suggests Neville is someone that Ginny would obviously be attracted to. And at the end of the day, you can't help who you find attractive or unattractive.

On the flip side, I didn't find it OOC at all for Neville to fall for Ginny. This seemed like your typical "friend zone" situation, amplified by war. I remember in an earlier discussion on this fic, a lot of people took issue with the very idea that Neville would fall for Ginny and then try to make a move on her. Why not? He was single. Ginny is canonically very attractive. They spent a lot of time together. Why wouldn't Neville be attracted to her? Truth is we know rather little about Neville, yet we assume he is this paragon of virtue, that he wouldn't be attracted to Ginny or make a move when she was broken up with Harry. I agree everything after he basically admits his feelings for her is OOC. But the very idea he could like her is perfectly plausible.

**** I'm glad you enjoyed it - it doesn't get the attention it deserves in my opinion. The premise is a little crazy but it really grabbed me after a chapter or two. And it is defiantly one of the better written fics out there.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
