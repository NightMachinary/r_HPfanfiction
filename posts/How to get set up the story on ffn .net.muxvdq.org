I'm having trouble setting up my story that I want to make. Is there a video to get started with? Thanks


** I don't believe there's a video, but I'll give a quick walkthrough.

1.  Open [[https://www.fanfiction.net/]].
2.  Log in to your account. (If you don't have an account, create one, then log in)
3.  On the top right of the main page on desktop, click on your username.
4.  On the left bar, click on 'Publish'. This will open a drop down.
5.  In that drop down, click on 'Doc Manager'
6.  About halfway down this page, fill in the details of 'Create New Document'
7.  This will require naming the document, and uploading a file. I personally upload .rtf files. You can also copy-paste text. Select 'Story' for format, and click Submit Document.
8.  Back on the left sidebar, click 'New Story'. You'll probably have to agree to some guidelines. Do that, then return to 'New Story'.
9.  If your story is a crossover, select crossover. If not, click on 'Select Category' and navigate to the fandom your story is in.
10. Fill in the requested information, including selecting the document that you uploaded earlier.
11. Click 'Publish New Story'.

Hopefully that works. As I do not have a story to publish right now, I can't be quite sure that's accurate, but it's mostly just a system clicking buttons. Also I probably skipped some really simple step, so use your common sense.

*** Can you create the story over time, like a chapter a week, and can you do it on the website?

**** You can upload later chapters at any point, by following more-or-less the same system:

Upload a document, Go to manage stories edit add new chapter select document profit
