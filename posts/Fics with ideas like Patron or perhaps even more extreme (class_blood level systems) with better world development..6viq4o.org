Just read Patron linkffn(11080542), and while I enjoyed it, I was more intrigued with the OC world itself then the journey in the story that Harry/Hermione (and friends) take. However I also felt the world was under developed considering the length of the story.

I am looking for stories with developed OC worlds similar to Patron. Ones where Muggleborns, or Halfbloods, or Women/Men or whatever group of people (by blood or gender) are considered a sub class in the culture and dependent upon a higher class to progress, live, or even survive. This can be in the form Patron takes (as the title implies), or perhaps even darker (Slavery or otherwise).

Other notes: I am hoping to find ones that have great world building along with a story (not just a story). I prefer ones with romance or at least pairings developed, and prefer mature rated or higher fics (Darker fics fine). Lemons and similar things are fine. No slash or at least no main character slash please.

Edit: Really confused why people are down voting this so hard. Its kind of an asshole move since if you are not interested in such a thing just ignore it. Not to mention Its not even that controversial or anything a Fic idea and there are fics with it like Patron.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is the first in a series. It is AU with non-purebloods banned from studying at Hogwarts. This is the main basis of the plot, and the state of different classes is explored through the experiences of the main character.

*** Ive heard of this, but was a little concerned about the idea of a girl pretending to be a boy and how the premise would work out. Not to mention if it would even have any pairings because of it. Shes The Man is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ;)

**** The premise definitely checks out. Currently the story is at the fourth year. The author said she doesn't have any pairings yet because the characters are too young, but there are undercurrents of romance throughout. The review section of the story is filled with many shipping wars if that indicates anything.

** The whole Sacrifices arc by Lightning on the Wave has pretty awesome world building and absolutely fascinating magical rituals. It does turn into Harry/Draco fairly quickly from what I remember, but I think it's low on actual physical scenes for awhile (she does all 7 books)... though I could be wrong since it's been a long time since I read it. Sacrifices does not have a strict caste system in relation to muggles/halfbloods/etc.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
