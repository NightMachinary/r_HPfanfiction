I saw another fic search for "Harry kills the Dementors" and was reminded of this one, and for the life of me I can't remember the name!

Things I know:

- The group that was working to get rid of the dementors met in secret in some room hidden high in the castle

- They concocted an elaborate plan to infiltrate Azkaban

- They divided themselves into subteams working on different parts of the project - some on the process of getting rid of them, some on the strategy of the infiltration

- Draco, Pansy, and maybe some other Slytherins were also helping with the project

Things I'm not entirely sure about:

- There was probably a cliche "good guy helps the reformed Death Eater produce a Patronus" scene

- I think it was an 8th year fic

- It was probably either Drarry or Dramione

- For some reason I have this idea that they end up finding a man chained at the bottom of Azkaban, but I might be confusing that scene with a different story
