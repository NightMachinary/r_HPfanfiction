You are inserted into a person who would not have existed otherwise, their natural talents are pretty much the same as yours, you have all their memories, but they dont influence your personality.

You can choose at what point in time you enter the fic.

You can choose how old you are when you enter it.

You look mostly the same as you would considering your age.

You are a half-blood wizard and middle-class, no special heritage or anything like that.

â€‹

So which fanfics would you want to live in and what would you do once you go there?


** Easy enough, one of the ones where there are clear paths godhood.

Preferably one's where I can also transit to other universes.

Core Threads is tempting, but IIRC I'm slotted to end up as an agent of Death, who I am sworn to slay in every continuity I can.

I'd probably grab a Gamer fic, those usually have obvious Munchkin-paths to godhood.

**** Most gamer give always have a party system. While cannon to the gamer it's also a trope and f the genre. Though the gamer should show that you shouldn't belong in the universe. Though if you retain regular knowledge you can grind and learn quickly. Harry Potter and the gamer of death for example have quests give party members exp for quests. Each Horcroux is a separate quest. It's set in year three. You basically grab the Diadem and the pocket and destroy it with the sword while partied with Harry. You have Dumbledore grab the ring(good Dumbledore in this story) and try and get the cup which only leaves Harry as a Horcroux. It hasn't been shown yet if eating books is a thing(basically learning let's say all spells in third year charms) or easily gaining stats.

Hmmmm.....

I can't remember the fics, but there's quite a few that mention the Japanese "technomancers". That'd be neat to have both technology AND magic. Maybe learn alchemy and sneak into landfills and alchemically separate the garbage and sell the components back to the muggles. I would be a hero.

** I would play it safe and insert myself in that one fic where the potters travel to Harry's universe after the war. The one where Harry ends up making a new hat. It's after the war, so no Voldemort. There would be a precedent of dimensional travellers, so I know that I wouldnt be experimented on if someone would find out I'm one. I'd show up at the age of 11, what's the point of living in the potterverse if you can't learn to use magic. I would not be sorted in Gryffindor since I'm too much of a coward to insert myself earlier in the timeline just to help people I don't know.

Harry and Hermione were extremely well respected in the fix and were working on reforming the ministry if I'm not mistaken. So the world be quite a bit better. I'd be kind enough to appear at the beginning of the fic and warn Harry of what was happening.

**** Holy shit, this got huge! But hey, you asked!

It depends a lot on on just /who/ I am. Personally, I'd prefer a Half-blood. It gets me immediate access to a wand and the Wizarding world, while also the anonymity of being just another name on a long list. No media attention, no Death Eater legacy, no Order connections. Just a random Joe.

Now, from the moment I get born, I immediately try to get a hold on my magic. Small, wandless stuff, but also start working instantly on Occlumency and Legilimency. At the first moment I get hold of my magical parent's wand, I place both of them under the Imperius, though upgraded by a mixture of regular Obliviations, Legilimency, and perhaps later on, potions. I'd essentially turn them into human House-elves. Then I'd order my magical parent to go on raids across the city. Apparate into muggle homes at night, rob them blind, then set up a Gringotts vault in my name where all the profits go.

Next on the list is enhancement stuff. Order my parents to find me books on rituals. Things to boos my magical prowess, my memory, reflexes, strength. The regular package. With a steady supply of money at hand, I'm sure I can get my hand on whatever is needed for these things. And yeah, I'd also do cosmetic rituals, because if i'm in a world where magic exists, why the hell not. Until my Hogwarts letter arrives, I plan to already master most of the Hogwarts curriculum, both by regular learning and by pulling the knowledge from my parent's head via Legilimency. But also, get as many House-elves in my possesion as possible. Depending on just how advanced I am in my magical studies, get the Horcrux hunt going. The Gaunt ring would be easy, especially with the Elves at my command. The Locket... oh, boy. That's gonna be an early Christmas present for me. I see two options. Either summon Kreacher by convincing him how set I am on finishing Regulus's work, or use my Elven army to break into Grimmauld. Either way, I execute Kreacher the moment im in the house, destroy the Horcrux, then move absolutely everything from that place to my home. Keep the books, find out what more rituals I can do to myself, then send the rest to my vault at Gringotts.

Now, here starts Hogwarts. Mostly, I'd try to have fun tbh. Get laid, dwarf Merlin's accomplishments as a student, sneak into the Forbidden Section, train like crazy, explore the forest, the castle. Oh, and kill the Diadem-Horcrux. When it comes to the whole Stone business, I'd just wait until Dumbledore had placed the stone and the mirror at the end of the obstacle course. Then, I'd breeze through the defences and then I see two options again. Either A. I have one of my elves stand in front of the mirror and order him to wish for the stone but never to use it, or B. if A doesn't work, steal the Mirror entirely, get it out of Hogwarts, store it at Gringotts, and go back to seeing how to break the wards myself, in the following years. I may execute Quirrel just for the fun of it. Like, walk behind him in an empty hallway and shout /Tom Riddle?/ then fire an AK on his deformed, undead, noseless head. Oh, almost forgot. I'd do my utmost to get myself sorted into Ravenclaw. You probably noticed I'm a Slytherin through and through. And going to actual Hogwarts and not being a Serpent would bother me for life. But a half-blood prodigy like me would just attract way too much attention in Slytherin. Since I could theoretically make a good Ravenclaw also (ironically, that's where Pottermore sent me too), I'd convince the hat to put me there.

Second year, is easier. Steal the diary at the first opportunity, but this time, I don't kill the horcrux. I figure out what ritual to use to bring the teenager Tom Riddle back to life. Once I do, I stun him, put him under the Imperius, the draught of living death, magical binding bracelets, and a 24/7 house-elf guard, all in my own house. Once the time is ripe, my new minion will prove quite useful. At one point, I'll just Imperius someone to fire an AK on Harry too. I won't do it myself, because I'm lowkey worried Lily's protection would kill me. And I wont fyiendfire the kid, because I really wish he lives. But about this, idk exactly when. Probably when I can capitalize the most politically, so later on, I think.

Third year, I don't really care. I'd probably kill Pettigrew, simply because I don't want him to run to Voldemort and help him while I have my own Tom Riddle in stasis, waiting usage. And handing Pettigrew over to the Ministry is not something I'd do, because those idiot lackeys would lose him. I hope Sirius gets a better deal than in canon, but its not my problem. Oh, and I suppose I should start my evil lair about now. I can think of a few small islands in the Mediterranean I would purchase, or otherwise commandeer, have them warded to hell and back, and have a castle built. Well, it would be more akin to Vader's fortress on Mustafar, just without the lava. Once it's done, get it under a Fidelius with me as secret keeper.

***** Fourth year, get myself into the TriWiz. Kill the dragon like the glory hound that I am, and use very spectacular magic in general. I'd probably win it easily. In the meantime, I'd have already started working on an important project. Namely, a more efficient form of mind control. Either some kind of enchanted inhibitor chip, straight up cloning and alter the mind of the clones so that they are obedient, or ritually change the appearance of my house elves. Idk, but somehow get important people under my unwavering control. And the heirs of the Sacred 28 are first on the list. The next generation of the Wizengamot would be mine. Speaking of, I'd start working on my 'Clone Army'. Either upgrade my Elves, make them larger, more agressive, more resilient, etc, clone powerful wizards, Idk. But start filling /Korriban Castle/ with soldiers.

Fifth year is, I think, when my 'Voldemort' would be back. I'd make sure Tom Riddle starts a new, highly brutal campaign. And I don't mean his old attempt to rule the Wizarding world. I mean, he would try to exterminate the Wizarding world. And with me behind the scenes, I would manage to easily become a hero of the war, being almost the only one capable of thwarting Voldemort. By now, I hope the real Voldie is dead or still a wraith, and that I have a lot of Pureblood heirs under my control. I would have either them or Tom get me possesion of all the Sacred 28 family libraries, and take them to my castle. I would remove as much knowledge from the Wizards as possible. Even steal the Hogwarts library if the chance ever arises. The wizarding world will be not only weak, it will also be on the brink of extinction, with me the only thing keeping Riddle from ending it all. Once I finish Hogwarts and my minions have a tight grip over the Wizengamot, I'd stage a spectacular duel with Riddle. I'd win, obviously, then quickly have myself proclaimed minister. Maybe have Draco take Dumbledore's job. As for Dumbledore... Depending on what kind of universe im in, he is either worse than Voldie and Grindelwald combined, or a naive fool. Either or, I'm sure a Hellfire missile fired straight into his tower at Hogwarts would be more than enough to handle him. Or some other form of Muggle explosive. Once the old man is out, I'd have Hogwarts under my own people, and really take most of the library with me, if I haven't already.

In the following years, I'd replace the most proeminent people in the Ministry with my clones, and eventually disband the Auror Corp and reveal to the world my own, slave army. Once that happens, I'd disband the Ministry entirely and establish the first Sith Empire. As decades pass, I would use a combination of infiltration via clones and open warfare to take over all Magical nations in Europe. Once my dominion is secure, I'd abolish all magical schools, and open one, Sith Academy. The kids would be taken since birth and indoctrinated into being Acolytes, loyal servants to their Dark Lord. Now, you may notice, my plan mostly leaves me in charge of a ruin. Yes. I'd do my utmost to discreetly lead Wizardkind into extinction. Only I and my most loyal would be tolerated as magic users. Well, the clones too, but they don't count.

This is because those backward fools in the Magical world are a small fish. The real prize is Europe. Muggle Europe, that is. Once my Empire is strong enough, we would launch a coordinated attack across all of Europe, and annihilate their political and military structure in one single swoop. In just a few days, the Sith Empire would be in total control of Europe. Now, believe it or not, I'm confident the people would actually love the new management. Unless I killed some of their relatives, I guess. But still, curing almost all diseases known to man, abolishing hunger, lessening social discrepancies, reducing pollution to almost 0. This is when the Empire would really flourish. As I'd have almost all Muggle rulers under the Imperius, no foreign power would attack us in the early days, so we can consolidate. Slowly, the Imperial administration would switch from magical to muggle, and once I have Europe in my grasp, I would really allow the wizarding world to go extinct. Muggleborns, and perhaps my own creations would be the only magic users left (except for the army), and they would all becomes indoctrinated servants in the Sith Academy.

In the following years, the Empire would expand and not stop until the entire planet is under my rule. In the long run, the plan would be to expand beyond Earth, and bring the whole galaxy under heel.

Random things I'd do along the years: 1. break into Azkaban, or otherwise have Bellatrix freed. I need her to get into her vault, after all. 2. Create new life forms. Entirely new species. Animals, beings, plants, you name it. 3. Get an apprentice. No imperius, no legilimency, no tricks. The old fashioned way. But if the prick thinks he can pull a Rule of 2 on me, they have another thing coming. Realistically, my apprentice would probably be the person I'd also take as wife. 4. Establish a cult around myself. And I don't mean some inane personality cult a la Stalin or Hitler. I mean an actual religion with me as their god. Probably something I'd plant the seeds of while still in Hogwarts.
