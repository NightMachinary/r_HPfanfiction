I've been reading since 14 (26 now) back during my aol days. I was the first one of my friends to get high speed internet (dsl lol) so they would load up their hard drives at my house to read when they went home. My favorite right now is to convert like 10 fics to epub and read a chapter each on my nook with a cup of coffee.


** i never have enough forethought to do the epub convert put it on iPad. i end up just reading them on my iPhone at night when i can't sleep.

*** If you just past the website onto [[http://www.flagfic.com][www.flagfic.com]] it converts it right away. Super easy.

The best way to read fanfiction in my opinion :)

** I've been reading since I was 13 or 14 (21 now). My mom use to get mad at me because we didn't have DSL and I'd tie up the phone line reading fic all day in the summer and on weekends haha. Now, my favorite way to enjoy it is to make myself comfy on rainy days and read to my little heart's content. I read it on my phone when I can't fall asleep too.

** I've been reading fanfiction since 2005. I only read the series that year and needed book 7 speculation stories to keep me from losing my mind during the wait for the end.

I also convert fics to epub for my nook. I generally read at night before I go to bed.

** I've been reading Hp fanfiction since at least grade 7 and I'm in grade 11 now. My favourite way to enjoy fanfiction is to make a pot of tea,usually chai and pile my bed up with blankets and pillows before I hunker down and binge read.

** Ive been reading it since i was 15 or 16(23 now). I was so excited when i discovered fanfiction even existed lol. I use to print a bunch of it off at school to read at home cuz my dad was a huge control freak and wasnt allowed to get on our computer at home. I usually just read on my phone now or my computer. Yay! for being an adult and having my own computer/ phone to look at whatever i want. :) that just so happens to be fanfiction lol. kinda nerdy but im cool with it.

** I've been reading since I was 13, I'm now 21 and still going strong. I still sit and read at my computer sometimes, but I mostly find a good fic then convert it to an ebook so I can read it on my Kindle.

** I've been reading HP fanfiction for 7 years now, which seems crazy. I was writing fanfiction before I knew what it was called.

Before I had a laptop, I would cut and paste them onto a word doc and print them out 16 sheets to a page. I still have a binder full of them somewhere in my parent's house. Good times.

Now my favorite way to enjoy a good fanfic is when I'm supposed to be doing something else. I've been known to tear through 250k words in one sitting.
