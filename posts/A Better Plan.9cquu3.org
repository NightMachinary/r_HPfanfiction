For want of a nail, significant canon divergent from book 4 onward.

Neville is a more central part of Harry's group, as he always should have been. When the second task rolls around. He is much faster to suggest the gilliweed, leaving Harry time to practice and work with Ron and Hermion on strategy.

Optional, Cedric draws the Hungarian Horntail and Harry wins the first task by a landslide.

When it comes to the third task, Harry enters with a significant lead and reaches the cup first, alone.

In the graveyard, all goes the same until the end, when Voldemort is just a little faster and hits Harry with his killing curse.

After recovering from the feedback of unknowingly killing one of his own horcruxes, Voldemort wakes up to see Harry also walking up.

Before Voldemort can try to kill Harry again, Wormtail suggests a different plan.

Wormtail takes Harry's place using polyjuice potion and 3 years of close contact knowledge. He hides Voldemort's return and takes Harry's place.

Can be as dark or as crack as desired. Can last as long as needed.


** I, too, despise Vildemort, Voldemort's younger and overeager brother.
