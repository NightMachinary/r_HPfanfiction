Some stories have good writing, some are enjoyable to read. The best fics are both. I'd love to know what you consider the biggest difference between the ratings you would give a fic for its quality vs how much you enjoyed it.

This could be a guilty pleasure fic that you adore but know the writing is awful or it could be the best written fic in the fandom but does absolutely nothing for you, after all, enjoyment is far more subjective.

For me a contender has to be Unatoned. Agreed by many to be one of the best written stories the Harry Potter fanfiction scene has but I dislike it. I find it dull and every character unlikeable. I can understand it has vast technical merit but that doesn't make me like it.


** The Alexandra Quick series. It is known for being very high quality but I never could get into it. It simply does absolutely nothing for me. I fought my way through the first part because I really wanted to understand the all around love for the series and wanted to like it but had to give up around halfway through out of boredom and because I found the MC very unlikeable.

On the other side of the spectrum is "Harry Crow". A fic deservedly bashed on for being shock full with overused tropes and plotpoints seen thousands of times before. Coupled with mediocre quality writing. But I enjoyed it. So I guess it could be called a guilty pleasure fic of mine. I know I should objectively not like it, but I did :D

*** I am still reading the Alexandra Quick series, and I agree with you about Alexandra being unlikable. I'd go a bit further and say that every major character except perhaps four is unlikable or very difficult to like, and one of those four is dead.

** I've found that over the course of the last year or so, I shifted from reading for the story and ignoring grammar and spelling mistakes to reading for the writing. Like actually caring more about the language and style than the story. A good story is a close second, but the key to my heart is words. Even if the premise is good, bad grammar = delete. Probably comes from studying literature for two years.

This is a shame, really, because some fics I remember enjoying are now completely unreadable and I guess I'll have to content myself with the first-time memories.

It was maybe like the third or fourth fic I ever read so I wasn't picky at all. I've only read it once and I don't think I'd be able to do it again. But props for dealing with the goblins. Since then I've seen so many fics that have goblins bending over backward for Harry that I've really come to dislike them. I'd really love to see a fic where Harry tries to go independent and begs the goblins for help only for them to say something like "We are a respected bank, Mr. Potter. Not a hotel, apothecary, hospital, travel agents, illegal document makers, etc."
