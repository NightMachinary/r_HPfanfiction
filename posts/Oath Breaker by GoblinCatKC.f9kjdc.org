Okay. Idk if anybody has talked about this fic, but can I just say how effing good it is? It's Draco/Harry with more of a focus on Draco. The writing is spectacular and creates this whole other perspective on the Harry Potter Universe. I sorta wish that there was a third fic to the first two. I go back all the time to read it when I can't find good HP fics and every time I'm blown away.
