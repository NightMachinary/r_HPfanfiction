I'm looking for something that drastically changes the universe, like a Space AU, Steampunk AU, Medieval AU, Voldemort wins AU, No Magic AU, that kind of stuff, not minor things like Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Soulmate AU, ABO, etc. (unless there are other world-changing elements in the story).

Crossovers are ok, I guess.

Preferably longer stories :)


** My all-time favorite AU, and one of my favorite fics ever, is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) and it JUST UPDATED.

Thank you [[/u/Ihateseatbelts][u/Ihateseatbelts]].

EDIT: And Ascended Vices updated? This is a good fanfiction day for me.

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** No Magic AU:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] obviously.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is very good too.

--------------

Space AU can get into crossover territory, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), is a decent crossover with Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Atlantis. Canon plot rails were shot in all universes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]], linkffn(10784770), crosses with Mass Effect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]], linkffn(9264843), has Jedi quitter Ahsoka Tano raising Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), contains elements of Star Wars and crosses with Stargate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), is plain vanilla HPverse and even DH compliant, but goes into deep space colonization soon. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7882249/1/This-Crude-Matter][This Crude Matter]], linkffn(7882249), becomes a Star Wars crossover and has a quite well written Emperor Palpatine and Grand Admiral Thrawn.

--------------

Other extreme AUs:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]], linkffn(9860311): fem!Harry time travels through different eras in history.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Muggle world was AU too as nuclear weapons were never developed. In magic world, James and Lily got the drop on Voldemort, so there was no BWL, Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, and everything became totally different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort, Bellatrix became an auror and got together with Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy came out as the biggest winner of the Halloween 1981 event. But Dumbledore and his minions were plotting a comeback in 1999. First step in his plan: resurrect Voldemort who promptly went after that traitor Malfoy.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

** Reign of the Serpent is definitely my favourite large-scale AU. It's got a radically different wizarding world where an immortal Salazar Slytherin rules as its immortal emperor, where everyone is split into castes based on the old Hogwarts houses, where a disgruntled Rom Ridddle is the Headmaster of Hogwarts, where Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix are notorious rebels and freedom fighters... and where Hermione after being abducted from her Muggle home starts on her long journey to escape her "Mudblood" caste status and ultimately overthrow the entire system.

Great story, really thought-out worldbuilding, and old familiar characters in sometimes surprising new roles.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Linkffn(pureblood pretense)

Riddle took a more subtle approach in achieving his goals. The result was a world where Light a Dark pureblood families split and had no real contact in terms of official society outings. Hogwarts is forbidden for muggleborns and halfbloods.

Linkffn(the darkness within by kurinoone)

Harry grew up with Voldemort. Potters are alive, no bashing, amazing complexity.

Linkffn(riddled universe) Harry got transported to an AU where Tom Riddle is a good person. That one is absolutely a must read in my opinion.
