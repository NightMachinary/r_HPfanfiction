Preferably with some actual challenges along the way instead of Harry just steamrolling everyone.

Please, no slash or Death Eater revisionism.


** What do you mean by Death Eater revisionism? Like, changing their attitudes and beliefs to suit the story?

**** The worst ones are where Death Eaters are shown to have some sort of deep political vision, or even are portrayed as brave libertarians fighting against the evil light statists led by Dumbledore. There is nothing in canon to suggest any of this stuff, they're pretty much a cult of crazy terrorists, not to mention their idea of a society is the most invasive shit imaginable given that they threw people in Azkaban for being mudbloods.

I'm not against making a whole AU and imagining how a competent blood supremacist ideology would affect the wizarding world, but there is a whole ton of fics where the DE are just unceremonously changed to be reasonable and it's a really annoying cliche to me.

***** Good grief, if anything Dumbledore's Army could /maybe/ be seen as libertarians, but not the Death Eaters.

And not even the DA really. Libertarianism is relatively recent as far as widely-known political ideologies go, and I doubt Rowling had modern, third-party /American/politics in mind when writing her books.

****** But, didn't you know? Tom Riddle was actually an aspiring political figure, making fiery speeches against the antiquated policies of the Ministry, and gained many supporters based on his proposed reforms to creature rights and restrictions on practicing Magic. But then the poor guy went crazy due to a dark spell, and the fascist Dumbledore rewrote the history books to delegitimize his movement. Now nobody talks about it anymore... It's just like 1984, dude!

Definitely disagree with that. They are a pretty organised organisation with political influence while they are the street muscle, making them almost a carbon copy of the Sturmabteilung or Schutzstaffel (SA and SS).

The UDA, for example, or Hamas, or to a lesser extent Irgun (Irgun itself didn't have as much political influence, although its members later went on to be highly influential).

****** I don't really see it, personally. Assuming that Voldemort won the final battle in Deathly Hallows, I can't really picture a stable society built by Death Eaters. What would they do after eradicating everyone they don't like, go after the goblins next? The remaining population of Wizarding Britain would be pretty tiny, and the international Wizarding community has to get its shit together /eventually/, particularly if DE start attacking Muggles systematically and risk breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Since we see in canon that they couldn't sustain a siege on Hogwarts, they sure as hell don't have the manpower to invade foreign countries. I guess the worst case scenario is that there are already sleeper agents waiting to take over in other ministries, but we just don't have enough information on what was happening internationally.

*** Turning them into misunderstood politicians instead of depicting them as the magical Nazi Brownshirt equivalent they were. Or downplaying their atrocities to make them more sympathetic. There are quite a few fics where Draco's crimes are glossed over despite his various transgressions which, for all intents and purposes, are nothing short of war crimes like attacking civilians, not wearing a uniform, hiding behind civilians and so on. Hell, the lack of a uniform or, at the very least, an unit patch usually is punished with summary execution.

  Again on October 19, 1960 (almost two years after the Batista regime was deposed by the Cuban Revolution) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American-owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation. On February 7, 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports.
