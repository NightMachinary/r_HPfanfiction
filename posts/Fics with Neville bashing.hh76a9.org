This idea just popped into my head, and I love Neville --- most people do which is what made me think of this request. I've never read any fanfiction where Neville is a bad person. In bashing fics he is often the only Gryffindor left that is "good" to Harry or he is non-existent. I have never ever seen a fic where people hate on Neville except when it was a WBWL fic and even then he was kinda shitted on, but not bashed.

Any length, completion status, pairings, and other bashing.... I just want to know if Neville haters exist!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492), paints Neville in a fairly negative light.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), bashes almost everyone, Neville included.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams-Part-One][Screams Part One]], linkffn(3548714), casts him as a traitor.

**** Honestly democracy just made me dislike Hermione because as told from Neville's perspective she is both incredibly unreasonable as well as a sneering know-it-all intent on getting people killed because she feels she isn't immediately agreed with.

The one caveat as a story is that she is never compared to an anti-voldemort. She goes from anti monopoly policy straight to I want a system of government that will ensure me and my teenage friends all become leaders of the country and are willing to slaughter the current administration to get it.

And before people say well obviously Neville is not being reasonable and Hermione is actually right.

No. That's not true, it's portrayed like Hermione is actually in the right but she's never shown to be anything but the instigater and the first one to start Rally's and calls for violence. She makes one attempt at a bill Neville tells her is unreasonable on her first day then never does anything but attempt to dissolve parliament by threat of force of arms when they don't capitulate to her ultimatum.

***** Yeah, but I think purely by going up against an aristocracy she's the hero. Overall I liked it because I agreed with most of the policies she put forward. Breaking up monopolies, encouraging democratic principles... and I think that's it. But still, all good.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** linkffn(9631998) The Thorny Rose has some relatively minor Neville-bashing, in the form of "he's a hanger-on of Severely Bashed Ron". He grows out of it in the second part of the trilogy.

I personally think Neville-bashing is as rare as it is because it feels kind of like kicking a puppy - same goes for Luna-bashing, which I also never see.

** linkffn(The odds were never in my favour)

He's definitely more arrogant, more or less the typical jerkish WBWL. However Ron and an original character, Leo Black, son of Sirius Black, are shown as worse.

Writing's a little jarring because the author is French. Overall enjoyable and extensive worldbuilding, but a LOT of bashing.

I've made Neville slightly antagonistic in linkffn(12745758) mostly because I was annoyed by him being a "better Ron" in every other fanfic. I don't mind him in canon, but the "Potter Longbottom alliance" has long since become a reason to close the tab.
