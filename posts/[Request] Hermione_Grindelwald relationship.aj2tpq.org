Recently, I've been reading a fic called The Pretender linkffn (13128779), and it has a very rare pairing, Hermione/Grindelwald, and it has left me wanting more. I don't mind dark stories. I don't know how you do it, but this community always manages to give me an answer and several new fics, so I thank you beforehand for your recs. Edit: Please, I'm against pedophilia, so could the fics be AUs or time travel stories where they are about the same age?


** I mean, my story has a Hermione/Grindelwald /friendship/... would that be of interest to you?

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Hermione was by no means an expert in Dark Magic, what she needed was someone who was. Gellert Grindelwald, one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time, was certainly no fan of this 'Voldemort'. Maybe they could reach an agreement.
