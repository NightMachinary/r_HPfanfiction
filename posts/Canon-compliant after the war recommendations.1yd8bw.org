I was wondering if anyone knew of any really good canon-compliant after the war fics? My preference is Harry/Ginny but any of the other canon pairings will work as well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] is a favorite of mine. Also, I'm working on one as well...if I ever get off the ground, I'll post in here in the future. :)

** Wouldn't canon-compliant sorta... /require/ Harry/Ginny?

Anyway, see the collected works of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. The author only does canon-compatible stories, and they are well worth a look.

*** Your right, however, I meant it like I would prefer a fic that mainly focused on Harry/Ginny instead of some of the other canon pairings.

Thanks, I'll be sure to take a look.
