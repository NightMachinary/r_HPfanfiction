Kinda tired of reading crossovers where Harry is getting his ass handed to him by a single demon or two hunters.


** Oh also,

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/18947]]

Super long series of both in same universe, pretty gen (some canon relationships, romance not a focus)

Sam and dean run in to dementors, and Harry as adult Auror with clout and responsibilities. Bad shit still happens instead of one fandom being hella OP.

I really enjoyed the interactions of dean and Malfoy, and Bobby and Hermione. and also when Sam and Dean teach a seminar at Hogwarts without people realizing that they're muggles.

*** That actually looks really good. Know any other HP/Supernatural crossovers? I really like SPN and the idea of a crossover has crossed my mind, but anytime I search through them it seems like a sea of slash pairings that don't interest me at all.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

Distraught, Erika decides enough is enough and returns to a hobby she was forced to give up in exchange for magic... ballet.

*** I gotchu fam. You just do linkffn then the title/story code in parentheses.

So linkffn(8957424) and boom. Bot handles the rest. There's a full tutorial in the sidebar that shows how to link from other sites- hpfanficarchive, ao3, etc, and a few other helpful things like how to link more than one story and how to narrow down the bots search by adding the author, which is helpful when searching by a common title.

  After a bad camping trip that left Vernon and Dudley dead because of a Wendigo, Harry decides on his chosen career path as a Hunter. There's just one small catch...he has to survive his fifth year long enough to escape Britain! With the help of a mischievous god, a pair of no-good twins, and the help of his friend will Hogwarts survive him? Brotherly!Loki/Gabriel

HP in the supernatural universe, he joins Sam and Dean and learns how to hunt/ is pretty proficient for a newbie. Also has elder wand master of death stuff going on that he's trying to keep under wraps. I think at one point he mock-duels Castiel and does pretty good/wins?

There's some romance which I think I recall being kind of eye-rolly, but I liked the rest of the fic. (I think, it's been a while since I read it)
