** Favs or follows don't make a story good.

HPMOR also has good stats and yet has a lot of issues. As does Cadmean Victory (however that is spelled) and a lot of +Anne Frank/Heinrich Himmler+ HP/LV is beyond 5k favs as well.

No one will shame you for liking Robst, but if you recommend it here, people will disagree. S

*** I agree with you. But favs and follows mean a lot of people are enjoying the story.

As you say about HPMOR. It has a lot of stats, but as a story I didn't enjoy it very much. But if someone recommended it, I wouldn't comment and say how terrible it is.

I appreciate your points.

**** But this sub lives from those commitments. For example, someone asks for Bellamoine, Person A recommends a story because he liked how X was done. Then someone else says that (they think that) the story is shit because of Y. Due to that discussion, people can judge whether the recommendation is something they would enjoy or not.

And the discrepancy between likes on FFN and here is due to different demographics. On FFN, 80% are Americans (at least according to my reader statistics) whereas Europeans are a lot better represented here. Starfox is Swiss I think, we have plenty of Brits and a couple of Germans. And these people have different tastes than the average FFN user. A lot of the popular stories on FFN are trope heavy bashing fics, none of which is popular here.

***** I think that actually makes sense. Very good point. I also agree with the opinions on here. My Main gripe is for example, someone recommended a Robst story. And the very first comment is "How can you read that trash". I've seen a lot of that on reddit regarding Robst and that to me isn't in any way conducive to finding a fanfic to read. Or even necessary at all. But someone saying something like, "yeah, but I don't like the Weasley bashing in this Robst fic" offers an actual opinion that can help someone make a informed decision.

**** No, he's a viral YouTuber that gets into the news every other day for doing dumb stunts. He's widely recognized as a bad influence and a stain on society. Despite all that, he still has a growing fanbase and is currently one of YouTube's premier content creators.

My point is, the number of people that like someone/something in no way reflects on that thing's qualities.

I'm not giving an opinion for or against Robst. I'm just saying your statistics don't prove he's a good author. It just proves he's a popular author.

***** Oh OK. Yeah I agree with your post. I'm not saying that Robst is good or bad or even popular. My main point is that in terms of fanfiction.net the stats show that he is popular and many people enjoy(fav) or eagerly await(follow) his fics. Based on the number of people who enjoy that. I think that people shouldn't just be negative for negatives sake. In reddit if someone asks for a recommendation for something to read. I've seen people recommend a Robst story and the comments are along the lines of "how can you read that trash". That's in no way a review that is helping anyone make an opinion. If you think it's trash. Don't read it. There are 20 000 people who don't think it's trash. If there's something specific you dislike then mention that. For example. "I don't like the crack or bashing or ooc of this story". That's helping people find fics to read.

** It's criticized more because it has more exposure. We don't hear loud complaints about other things so much because they're not as well-known. I like reading some messed-up shit, and I can guarantee that if my favorite stories had as many faves/follows as Robst, we'd be seeing just as many complaints about them, too!

** It's interesting that your defence of Robst doesn't mention his capability as a writer, instead it's just an [[https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/40/Appeal-to-Popularity][Appeal to Popularity]].

Robst isn't promoted here because he writes generic popcorn fics, his work is anything but "different". Sure they might be fun to read but there's no substance to them. Add in a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryCrow][host of fanon additions]] that this sub is just tired of and you have the current situation.

This sub is already a refuge from the absolute glut of Harry/Malfoy stories. Why should we bother with Robst work when it's so boilerplate. I come here for obscure works that don't get the attention their quality deserves.

Finally, the fact that Robst is /already/ so popular is reason enough to ignore him on this sub. Anyone can search by most favourites or most reviews on Fanfiction.net and get their fill of Robst. So why does he need promotion here?

*** Thanks for the response

I'm not concerned about any show of popularity. I am also not trying to "sway" anyone to like Robst stories.

Me personally, I like his writing. I have read many stories that are just as popular where the writing to me, is very unstable. Where there is definite assistance needed.

Im not trying to generate and popularity to his writing.

My whole point boils down to this:

*When Robst stories are recommended here. There is often a reply immediately saying this or that Robst is rubbish.*

That is a poor response. If someone recommends a Robst story, and you as a Redditor disagree with that rec, an appropriate response would be, "I don't like this or that in this story" as a sub where the name of the game is recommendations, surely that makes more sense. Rather then a denigration of a author or a work without any basis on why you dislike it.

** I like robst stories because I really like h/hr stories, the one I like the most is “A different Halloween “. I would like to see more of this kind of stories where Harry can grow up with his parents in a loving home and also a childhood sweetheart. (Bonus if it is Hermione)

*** You misunderstood the point. I have no problem with critique. My problem is that so many people only comment and say, this author is rubbish or his stories are terrible, or even worse, condemn someone for reading and enjoying the stories.

Critique is actually adding some input. This is bad because A, B, C, D. etc. Or good because of this and that.

*** Author here. I am salty because a lot of horrible stories are popular, but Robst is not on that list. I mean, compared to Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Snape or Hermione/Death Eaters, Robst writes literary masterpieces.

*** That could be a reason. I mean one of the things I like about Robst is that even though he uses a common base to his stories, that being Harry/Hermione, common bashing of Weasley and Dumbledore etc, the plot outlines are all unique and different. Which I think makes him stand out as an author.
