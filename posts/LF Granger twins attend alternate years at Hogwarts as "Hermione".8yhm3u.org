It was a one-shot, probably in a collection.

Story highlighted differences in canon Hermione's behavior across different books, so imagining that two different people played the part of "Hermione" was a nice touch.

**** Indeed. I think that Hermione would be largely immune to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues][Cloning Blues]] (though I think that, contrary to fiction, most people wouldn't actually have a problem with that)... In fact...

/[HBP, about midway through.]/

*Hermione:* So, after seeing how well drawing inspiration from Dark Marks to enable DA to communicate worked out, I asked myself, "What else can we copy?" Anyway, I read up on the Potion that Voldemort used to give himself a new body, and I realised that with some tweaks, it can be used to make copies of a whole person instead.

*Harry:* Have you tested this?

*Hermione:* Of course I did! I don't brew recklessly, unlike /some/ people. Anyway, I can now spare the time to figure out what Draco has been up to.

*Harry:* Spare the time? How many times did you copy yourself?!

*Hermione:* Well, I'm the me that volunteered to help you with Draco; there's another me in the library, researching the Half-Blood Prince; a me in the Gryffindor tower working on the McGonagall's essay; two more mes in an unused classroom, sorting out if all of me can use Legilimency to resynchronise our knowledge and mental state; and one last me, setting up the next round of copying. I haven't checked in with that me in a while, so there might be more of me by now. In fact, the hardest part is finding wands for everyone. Even the Potion is simpler, because you can use your own bone and flesh, though blood still has to come from an enemy.

*Ron:* Is that why Malfoy has been looking even more pale than usual?

*Hermione:* ... Yes, probably. Oh, and Ron, how do you feel about having a harem?

***** Year 6? The cloning might be too advanced for her. They could do that in Year 7. Instead of hunting for Horcruxes, they were building an army of clones.

****** Depends on how hard the magic is, I guess. Of course, if it's not too hard, that raises a question of why there isn't a dozen Dumbledores running around, fixing the world.

On the other hand, clones of Hermione or Harry have never be explored in fanfics (as far as I know).

  Everything went horribly, massively wrong. So Hermione went through time to fix it, although that went arguably worse. So there was nothing left but to try again, and that time ran into errors nobody expected.
