I'm putting this out there as a request for someone to make a fanfic where Harry ends up in the witcher verse somehow and starts building his own settlement/base/kingdom (whichever you fancy) like ffn(An Avalanche) or ffn(The Difference One Man Can Make)


** Having Haggrid transported in the Witcher universe could be awesome I think. Maybe along with Harry and Ron or Luna. Or Harry and Draco.

*** I like the idea of Haggrid in the witcher universe for a short story, any witchers reaction to Haggrids veiw of 'aww, that Griffin is so cuddly and safe.'

***** yeah, I can see that going two ways, either the Griffin acts cute and cuddly or it attacks and Haggrid just shrugs it off and keeps petting it.

*** Yeah, I thought so, there's a rich and varied background with lots of interesting characters in the witcher series and I think if someone good at writing fanfiction did it the story could be amazing

  Fem!Harry. Heather wants to hide in the bottom of the ocean. Hermione wants to change the world. Draco wants to be seen as himself and not his father. And Luna? Well...she's Luna. An idea starts a chain of events and none of them regret it.
