Just a bunch of requirements: - Well written. Really irks me when someone tries to write a [fan]fiction while clearly not being capable to string two words together. - Without enormous amount of fluff. Some romance is OK, but this shouldn't be the the main topic - Long and completed! I know, it's already hard, and it probably makes the set smaller still :) - Not H/G. Please.


** I'd be pleasantly surprised if such a story exists, I've enjoyed A Black Comedy a lot and never seen anything quite like it. But if you're willing to make some concessions...

"An Old and New World" by Lens of Sanity. This one has lots of action and humor and is borderline crack. It's a bit rougher around the edges compared to Black Comedy in terms of punctuation, etc. But I honestly enjoyed this story more.

Then there's "Sword of Gryffindor" by cloneserpents. I hated it myself, but I saw some people saying they liked it better than ABC, so maybe there's something there.

** I think linkffn(A Black Comedy) is pretty much the pinnacle and I'm assuming you've read nonjon's other stuff so I'll recommend linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes).

** Chapter 14 of A Black Comedy is my single favorite chapter of fanfiction that I've ever read. It also contains most of my favorite quotes.

Sirius Black: "So? What does that matter? I thought we were just making up random shit because we're irritable from all the sores on our crusty old vaginas."

Harry Potter: "I'm not a parseltongue, I'm a parselmouth. The language I can speak and understand is parseltongue. And if you've ever seen an anaconda you can understand why I sometimes get called a parselcrotch."

And his follow up quote: "I'm just floating it out there, you ladies make of it what you will. Well, except for you Lord Burke."

Absolutely priceless.
