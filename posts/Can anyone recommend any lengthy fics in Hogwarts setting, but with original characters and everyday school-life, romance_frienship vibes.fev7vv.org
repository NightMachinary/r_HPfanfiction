Hello everybody) this is my first time posting here.

I'm looking for a long, cute and ideally funny romantic fic about life in Hogwarts with some interesting OCs set in any era. Harry and the gang can be there, but not as main characters. Just want something with everyday school-life vibes, not packed with action and adventures.

Hope y'all are having a great day)


** I don't have any recs, but I think the term for what you're looking for is a 'slice of life' fic. Might help you find what you want. :)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Amidst a struggling Muggle economy, two children are delivered letters by a bizarre woman with a pointy hat and broomstick. Could it be true? Could there really be an entire Magical world hidden just out of sight, offering a chance at a another life? Or do the same mechanisms that steer the Muggle world remain, regardless of wherever you go?

** Here's an easy way to find some, especially if you enjoy fanfics of another fandom as well- search on AO3 in the HP category and then select "only crossovers." For example, I also like Teen Wolf fanfic (even though I watched the show only once) and love reading those characters in an HP setting. However, I've also read crossover fics of fandoms I barely know anything about but still immensely enjoyed it.

** Try Etc Etc -- and Life Goes On, linkffn(7217938). Romance/humour, pretty long at just above 100k, next-gen with Albus & OCs and such.

Also try Haggis from Algernon, linkffn(3687255). It's Marauder's Era and written as a bunch of humorous diary entries from the perspectives of Lily & James. Has a lot of that school-life vibe.

  For the first time in seven years, Cedric Diggory won't be on the start-of-term Express to Hogwarts. Instead, his friends return to school for their final and most stressful year, still trying to adjust to the loss of their best mate amidst rapidly-escalating tensions in the classrooms and the corridors. Together, they must negotiate Quidditch, life, love, and learning, all while the Ministry of Magic is more intent on disrupting their education than dealing with the looming threat of the most feared dark wizard of the age - and that's without the small matter of the end-of-year exams that will affect the rest of their lives.A story about keeping on, about keeping it together. A story about keeping up.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

** Three recommendations all of then nextGen (somehow, those stories have tendency to be less crazy):

1. It is on Wattpad, but I really like exactly for being normal [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] and its sequel (unfortunately unfinished) [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][Dursley's Dilemma]]. The non-fanfiction story which came to me most (aside from some TV series like Joan of Arcadia) was Kipling's “Stalky & Co.”, just the stories from the everyday life of students at Hogwarts. I like it very much.

2. linkao3(373224) there is a bit of drama and the great adventure in the end, but most of the story is just the student story life.

3. Whole series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]. I am in the middle of the fourth rereading it, so I am temporarily very biased (aren't you also often persuaded that the thing you just finished is the best story ever written?), but I think it is one of these three best nextGen stories. And certainly the best Dudley-has-magical-daughter story, but that's misleading because aside from being such it is so much more.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** Linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay)

This one is one of my favorites. Its a creature fic but theres no drama or bashing and its generally a funny slice of life story. Theres no romance though. It's still ongoing but it'll take a while to read up to the most recent update.

Currently its at 403k words.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
