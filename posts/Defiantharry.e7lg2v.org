** There's a lot of them, as this falls in the indy!Harry category.

Some notable ones would be:

/Apprentice Potter/ [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/Prologue/]]

Harry becomes an Apprentice. Good action scenes, written before HBP so no stuff about Horcruxes.

/World in Pieces/ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333]]

Harry gets pulled into another dimension by an Order that's desperate for a victory against Voldemort...and also on their 4th Harry Potter.

/0800-Rent a Hero/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero]]

A funnier version of World in Pieces. The Order has pulled a Harry Potter from another dimension. Incomplete.
