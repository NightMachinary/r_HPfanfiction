So, I admit I come at this as the child of relatively 'hands-off' parents - I was left to my own devices most of my life and prospered well that way. A rather... involved parent like Molly Weasley is (in fanon, at least) would be a nightmare to me to start with. She also seems to be very domineering and 'my way or the highway' in her discipline, to the point that I always inferred her kids left home as fast as possible and return rarely (they mention having not seen Bill or Charlie for ages once or twice in the books, IIRC). And if anyone talked to me like she talks to Sirius in Grimmauld, I'd be bloody pissed off.

To cut this short before it becomes a litany of bitchy complaining, I really don't like the woman at all, as a person, a character, or a parent. But, I want to hear the other side. I don't entirely understand why anyone would like her in any respect, so could anyone who does weigh in with why? Again, I know I'm biased, but I really don't get it and I'd like to at least try understand the other side.

Please keep it civil, pro-Molly and anti-Molly peeps. If you wouldn't say it over marmite, don't say it over a fictional character.


** I think when I first read the books as a 12 year old, I liked her because she basically swooped in and saved Harry.

and by "saved" I mean she let him stay with her, treated him like a kid, treated him like a human person, which was miles away from how +my parents treated me+ the Dursleys treated Harry.

as an adult, I think I mostly like her fanfic portrayals, bc in the stories I read, she's a "good enough" parent. she cares about her kids (including Harry), doesn't always get it right, but does her best. and she's actually pretty magically powerful, even if it mostly shows in like. household magic, I guess? that's a theme I enjoy, that powerful magic isn't always flashy, sometimes it's quiet and understated. idk lol.

** She's a fascinating character, but certainly not a flawless one. I really have an issue with how she treats Hermione and Fleur. She believes Rita's lies about Hermione and withholds gifts and affection. Then, she assumes Fleur is only with Bill because he's...attractive? I dont know, but she's judgy and rude to Fleur up until at least their marriage. If Fleur had a reddit, she would definitely be posting on [[/r/justnomil][r/justnomil]]!

*** I think for (Molly disliking) Hermione, it's already alluded to that she's willing to accept the 'official' stories. Molly's a big fan of Lockhart at the start of book 2, right? Seems like reading a bunch of terrible gossip about Hermione later on is something that plenty of people would believe, and I don't know if Molly really had much exposure to her before that. Not that it's /good/, of course, but it's human.

Same with Fleur - I guess it's a bit of that casual british prejudice against the French, right? ;)

** Molly is a "generic mother" character and everyone seems to input the characteristics of their own mother onto Molly and love her or hate her based on that. That's why you see her overbearingness usually portrayed as either a sign of her deep love of her family or an attempt to control/limit them in some way. I haven't seen a lot of middle ground to those characterizations.

*** I think that's a big part of a lot of alternating interpretations of different characters in the Harry Potter series, since so many of us read it at formative years in our lives. Is Dumbledore a flawed but good-intentioned man who played chess with people's lives and sacrificed himself so others wouldn't have to? Or is he a manipulative bastard who manipulated a little boy into killing himself because he couldn't imagine himself being wrong? Is Molly Weasley a good mother or a controlling witch? So on and so forth.

No, she did not. She, and pretty much any adult in the HP world, knew how bad things were going to become. They remembered the First War with Voldemort. They knew that he had been on the brink of victory. They knew that it was either fight and possibly die or bend over and face deportation or random execution. The Weasleys were bound to be targeted, if only due to their feud with Lucius Malfoy.

It is commendable that they chose to fight, but they did not sacrifice their /"safety and security"/ because they would have had neither no matter what they did unless they did a 180 and accepted pureblood supremacy and collaborated. And even that would not have been a sure thing.

"Yes, You-Know-Who has wanted you dead since you were a baby. He kidnapped you specifically to make himself more powerful. He'll kill everyone around you to get to you. He's seeking more information, info that'll tell him how to proceed with you exactly, but, you're fifteen, so maybe you should stay a kid?"

Also, Dumbledore wasn't fine with child soldiers. It's why he told them not to tell him anything. And McGonagall, for all her faults, tries to send underage kids and all those 17 yr olds that don't want to fight home.

Problem with that idea is when the adults are not really competent. The Order had catastrophic casualty rates. The Ministry did not put up much of a fight either (we see exactly two non-Order members fight Voldemort).

Or when the enemy is directly targeting those children. And it was really condescending given that Harry had faced Voldemort three times by that point while Molly had not fought in the first war, which means that he had more combat experience at that point. Like, the entirety of GoF is one big murder plot against Harry directly aimed at getting him personally killed by Voldemort. If she wants to keep her own underage children out of the war, that's one thing. But for Harry, peace was never an option.

** She's supposed to seem overbearing. We're looking at her from Harry's perspective, and not only is Harry used to abusive parents, but he feels entitled as a teenager to be involved in war and Molly is the only one who says he shouldn't.

As an adult who has worked with kids ages 0 to 18, I see Molly as one of the only adults with any sense. It's our responsibility as adults to raise children into adults and to protect them until they can protect themselves. If I were faced with a teenage boy who'd been orphaned, abused, and pushed into multiple life-threatening situations every year since he was eleven, my feeling would be that the only reasonable response would be to protect him. Give him an environment to heal from his trauma while the adults deal with the gore and horror of war, because clearly adults have failed him and he deserves better.

That, and the fact that she's strong and brave makes her a good character to me. She's domineering because she has to be; she has seven children with very strong personalities, she had them during wartime, and she has a husband with a low-paying job (and it's implied that he's chosen to remain in that low-paying job despite his family's financial situation because of how much he loves it). She had to be strong and domineering in order to wrangle her kids in such a way to keep them fed, safe, and out of legal trouble (because look me in the eye and tell me that Fred and George weren't partially kept in line by a fear of their mother). Not only that, but Molly has a lot of love; she found out that Harry wasn't going to get any love during Christmas, so despite her lack of financial resources, she made eight sweaters and eight sets of fudge instead of seven of each so that a boy she never met would have Christmas presents. And she always kept it up. She saw that Harry needed a mother, and she embraced him as a mother.

I feel like a lot of a person's opinions on Molly is based on a person's opinions of what an adult owes children. Do we owe it to them to look out for their best interests even if they don't want us to? As a teacher, I believe that is a responsibility we have as adults, and I think Molly took her responsibility to her children very seriously.

*** When I said overbearing/domineering, I meant more of the 'Fred, George, your dreams are crap and nonsense, why don't you get a job in the Ministry like your respectable brother that you don't really seem to like all that much' sentiment rather than the anti-child soldier aspects. The latter I can see the sentiment in, despite the lack of pragmatism there. The former domineering 'you will get respectable jobs and not waste your time with your dreams'/'My way is the best way, you're just too young to know better' thing seems eminently... dislikeable to me. While I'm sure I'm putting a negative phrasing on something you see positively and I'm not trying to lead you into claiming yourself something negative, you seem to see that attitude as a positive? A responsibility, even? I'm just curious about your thoughts, no judgement. My opinion is my opinion, your opinion is yours and all that.

I can see the love and caring of a Harry she'd never met thing. I think that's probably the argument I understand most. All that 'do what was right instead of what was easy' stuff that the series so passionately espouses. And the strong hand on the rudder that steers the Weasley ship thing makes sense as well. I imagine Mr Weasley is rather a hands-off parent who'll support the shenanigans instead of control them (his reaction to 'we broke Harry Potter out of his house!', for example) so Mrs Weasley had to become a disciplinarian to balance that out, right?

That's a really interesting view, that our opinion of her is based on what we think adults owe children. I like it. It certainly fits our two viewpoints. I come at it from five years in youth mental health and social work services and I've seen so many young people who've been fucked over by domineering parents like that. Adulthood and parenthood doesn't automatically make you qualified to teach or guide kids to do anything, in my experience. I've only seen parents like that breed resentment in their children and relief when they finally get out of that environment. A responsibility, yes, but a responsibility so often misused. I've never really seen the positive side of that like I'm assuming you have. Do children of 'domineering'-labelled parents in your locality seem to turn out traditionally 'well', in your experience?

**** For me, it makes sense if I put myself in her shoes. She's a woman who's raised her children in poverty because her husband ‘followed his dreams', and she already has two sons in highly dangerous professions. For me, her ‘you shouldn't open a shop, you should go to the ministry' is ‘I don't want you to be poor and struggling all your life.' I think it's a mistake, and I think it's meant to be a mistake, but it comes from a place of love.

And that's the thing with any parenting style, I think. There's no one perfect kind of parent because different kids have different temperaments and needs, and there's always such a thing as overdoing it. There's a difference between having a strict curfew for your teenager and forcing them to show you their texts, just as there's a difference between giving your child unfettered internet access and not paying attention to whether or not they come home at night. I think Molly can overdo it sometimes, but I think that makes a better character and I don't find her mistakes damning as a person.

I think you were more likely to see the extreme cases than I was. For me, parents that leaned more towards domineering have, by and large, been my best ally with kids. When I say things like, “I'm concerned about your child and think they may need learning disability testing,” “Your son/daughter is bullying another kid,” “Your child isn't doing the homework and is at risk of failing,” it's the parents that lean domineering who commit to helping me fix the issue, and the parents that lean hands-off that tell me they'll do something and then never do it, and thus it's the kids with the domineering parents who are more likely to get that intervention at home that they need to succeed in school when they're struggling. It's not fun for the kids to have their parents in constant contact with me to make sure they've turned in their homework and they gave so and so an apology note for doing a nasty thing, but it's necessary to help them build habits they need for school and to learn what is and isn't acceptable. (On top of that, I've worked with a lot of kids who came from impoverished backgrounds, so it was extra important to teach them these things early because the cops wouldn't give them the leeway they'd give my richer students if they stepped out of line.)

***** That's really interesting to hear. Well, read, but you know what I mean. I've never really seen the positive end of that parenting dynamic, so it's professionally fascinating to get a view into that. I'm very glad to hear somebody is using that dynamic to help children do well in life. Short term bad for long term good, right?

I know this might skirt professional or personal confidences (I'm not sure of the legalities/policies in the US), so please feel free to tell me to bugger off if I'm nosing where you can't answer - Do you, for lack of a better term, get involved in the mechanics of that process of... repair and adjustment in the child? (ie. "Here's some ways to help your child get around bullying/talk to your child about this issue", etc) Or is it more of a 'let the parents know about it, then keep them updated about how it seems to be changing the kid in school time' experience for you?

I very much agree with your second point. There are patterns in people, sure, but we're all unique combinations of different patterns (a la Genetics) and thus each unique combination requires a unique approach to nurture and guide the child with it.

I definitely hadn't seen your first point before, though. When put that way, she really makes sense as a character. Well-meant mistakes really are a thing in Harry Potter, huh?

** I'm from parents that were more hands off as well, but just because that worked for us, doesn't mean it's good for everyone.

Harry really craves familial affection. He feels envious when he sees the loving goodbye of the Weasleys when he first takes the Hogwarts Express. Adults have always been a huge disappointment for him, but that doesn't stop him from wanting what should have been there for him to begin with.

In that sense I think Molly was very good for him. She did not beat around the bush when she expressed how much she cared for him and I think Harry benefitted from that. The small gestures of kindness, the warmth behind her constant worrying, and just the stark contrast of all the heaps of food she dropped on his plate compared to how hard it was to feed himself at the Dursleys... I don't know, I think it was like a soothing balm for Harry.

However, Harry at least subconsciously realises that Molly isn't the person he can confide in. He reaches out to Sirius or even Arthur rather than that he reaches out to Molly.

I knew that, while I was mostly left to my own devices, I still had my parents' support when I needed it. If I had a problem, I knew my parents would listen and wouldn't back down in their attempt to help me. Harry had no such security; he had been abused and left alone by any adult he encountered. He had to do everything alone for so long that I think he needed one adult to stand up and make it absolutely clear that he was receiving their affection. No subtlety that would leave him wondering if they were truly accepting of him.

That is why I like Molly's character. She contributed to something Harry needed, and she did it without fully realising how important it was, or even if it was the right approach. She did it by being her sometimes annoying, overbearing, and smothering self; she did it because she wanted to; it simply seemed right to her. And that's just it, isn't it? The perfect parent doesn't exist, but I never doubted Molly's intentions or feelings. Sure, she made me groan or be angry at her with some of her behaviour, but that's also just part of having parents. Or family in general, I suppose.

Exactly. Why can't she make a sweater colour that Ron likes instead of maroon all the time? She could buy different colours of wool, or buy white and dye it magically or non-magically, or buy it in one colour and use a Colour-Change Charm. There are so many options here as she just puts in the least amount of effort. Ron's the most vocal about it but I'm sure the others aren't too thrilled either.

You can transfigure a few tons of stuff in one go. You learn to create complex animals by year three. You can duplicate things. Canon transfiguration is permanent. You can also animate/automate the needles, which you can create out of sticks. (Hermione implies roughly 120 tons in GoF if you go with the volume of a dragon and the density of iron).

With magic, all she would have needed was a few minutes of spellwork, two sticks and one ball of wool. Whether or not she was capable of the necessary spellwork is a different debate, but unless it is food or made out of gold, you can create almost anything with magic. Hell, she could have transfigured the entire sweater in one go (still way easier than even a mouse).

****** Yeah. I'm not disputing that! My point is more that... with how poor the family is portrayed, that is /not/ a cheap way to give gifts unless magic is involved. In Canada, enough skeins for a wool sweater is $60 minimum for a tween or young teenager. This is with the cheapest yarn you can get that isn't acrylic.

******* There is no indication that canon transfiguration wears off at all AFAI. If you know more, please give me the quote from the books.

And the obvious answer would be poor management of their income. Just look at how they spent their lottery winnings. Most was gone after three months. Inherited debt would be the other easy explanation.

***** Molly in fanon is often seen as what many people think of a "perfect mother". Overbearing turns into a good quality, being present in your child's life and guiding them (ignoring how Molly may do that a little too much). Ultimately, I think what made people love Molly so much in the end (not that they didn't already, but what sealed the deal) was the famous "Not my daughter" line. Being willing to stand up to an insane murderer, dueling them and coming out on top, all for the sake of her children. Ultimately, yes, she may be overbearing, but absolutely no one can question whether or not she loves her children, something not every parent can claim, as quite often teenagers doubt that.
