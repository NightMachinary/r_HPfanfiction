** In fanfiction, Hermione is regarded as the smartest witch, the most loyal, the only one to figure things out, the one that all the guys want, and someone who never seems to face consequences when she breaks the rules/law, because it is for 'the greater good' I love book Hermione but fanfiction has raised her on an unattainable pedestal that she doesnt deserve. Book Hermione had real flaws that made her a well rounded character.

**** I absolutely agree. When the author does a good job writing hermione she can be an awesome character, but most just go full out hermione Addict mode and write her so poorly and then get upset when someone says something bad about the writing of her character,r even when given as constructive criticism in the comments.

I adore well written fics where hermione is as interesting a character as she has the potential to be, but as you said, most just don't get it right

*** Not just in fanfiction. She sent a flock of birds after Ron in book 6. Justified or not, it's a pretty shitty thing to do, and people always make excuses for her.

** All right, I sort of understand where you're coming from. However, in basically every fic of this kind I've seen, her relationship with Ron is over by the time she's dating someone else. I've personally never been a fan of Dramione, and my feelings on both HPHG and SSHG are "eh, I guess they can work sometimes". But my issues aren't the infidelity, because there usually isn't any.

IMO a much better target for something like this is Lily, who usually gets a pass for the occasional infidelity with Severus (in Severitus fics) for typically very weak reasons.

However, while fics basically never portray Hermione as unfaithful, she does get a pass for dubious activities -- take the Avis+Oppungo combination in HBP, for example.
