I know he didn't mean to, but what little Harry did was still manslaughter, right? Are there any fics where this is addressed at all?


** I think it'd be considered magical self defense, or that it gets labelled as Quirrel succumbing to the cost of his dark rituals. I mean, to the general population, how on Earth could a first year turn a man to ash without using his wand if it wasn't accidental magic or the curse of drinking unicorn blood?

There are a few where Harry gets thrown into Azkaban or something, but very few. Well, that I read anyway. Most don't mention it or gloss over it, I guess.

*** Consequences doesn't just mean legal consequences. It could have traumatized him in some way, or people could start rumours about him being the next Dark Lord, which could his second year even more isolating.

** No, it was quite certainly self-defence which in whole civilized world is considered condition for justification of his actions.

*** It's certainly self-defense... but the wizarding world is corrupt enough that it's /just/ plausible enough that someone with the power/influence that Malfoy has (or a fanfiction version that bumps up that influence a bit more) could maneuver things through so that Harry gets some consequences - or even rather dire ones.

The WW might also consider what happened to be excessive - again, that's not supported by the situation in canon/the text, but he /did/ end up dead - which is enough to start throwing some considerations around about it being fishy...

** I agree, totally self defense.

That said, a corrupt government could totally misconstrue it as needed for the plot. I wouldn't read it, but it could be done.

** It was self defense. I could see Lucius talking Fudge/Umbridge/both to try to arrest Harry for that to get him out of the way. It would be nice to see more courtroom drama in the fanfic community.

I can see it going to court > truth coming out > Death Eaters pulled out of Azkaban for veritaserum questioning > Sirius being found innocent > Chaos happening.

That's how it happened in this fanfiction: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9643914/1/][Trouble]].

** I mean the dude provably drank unicorn blood and disintegrated into actual ash, and /the/ dumbledore was there and witnessed a dark spirit emerging from the corpse - not to mention veritaserium ('what happened in the chamber?' - 'dude had a face in the back of his head and then he touched me and burned for some reason, crazy right') exists and is used to establish exactly these kinds of questions.

Not sure anything would happen without a cartoonishly evil dumbledore who pins blame noone actually has to take on harry for no reason.

** Technically, there wasn't even a body was there? First there's no body and no blood indicating a killing, wouldn't it just be handled as a missing persons case legally, if at all (since Quirrel was an adult and could go wherever he cared)?

** Quirrell only turns to ash in the movies. In the books he actually dies because Voldemort stopped possessing him.

** I doubt there would be any consequences. It was self defense for one; Quirrel was definitely gonna kill Harry at Voldemort's command. Harry also stopped Voldemort from regaining a body, which is something the bast majority of people want, including the Minister of Magic. If a detail like that came out he'd probably get an Order of Merlin, and it would get out if anyone insisted on charging Harry for Quirrel's death.

This is also a point in Harry's life where people love him. If it were Year 5 I definitely see Fudge and Umbridge salivating at the thought of charging Harry for murder, but not Year 1.

There's also the lack of information on what killed Quirrel. We know it was Lily's blood protection, but I doubt that's admissible in a court of law, even a magic one.
