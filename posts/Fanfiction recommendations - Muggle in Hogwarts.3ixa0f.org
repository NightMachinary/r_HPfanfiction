So I just wandered into the world of HPFF from /writingprompts, from the thread about a muggle accidentally getting to platform 9 3/4's. I quite enjoyed a couple there, and now I'm looking for more. Having just marathoned all 7 books, I'm keen to read some more tales of Hogwarts from another's experience. Are there any good ones out there? I'd prefer finished ones, because I'm a fast reader, but open to really good suggestions, if they are updated consistently.

I checked the side bar, and recommended ff's, but all were canon character based. I don't know what this type of fic is called here, I know for Tolkien it's called Girl/Boy in middle earth. If someone could let me know, that'd be great.

The only one I know of that comes close to what you are looking for is These Little Powerless Bones, it's about a squib who managed to wiggle their way way into Hogwarts. It's very short, possibly even a drabble, or a one-shot.

So keep looking but spare this a glance, it's heart-warming to read.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then' Originally posted here: http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/104058597984/facts-from-the-2014-uk-editions-of-harry-potter

*** Thanks! I'll check 'em out. First one sounds suspiciously like romance, which I don't do, but I'll give it a shot!
