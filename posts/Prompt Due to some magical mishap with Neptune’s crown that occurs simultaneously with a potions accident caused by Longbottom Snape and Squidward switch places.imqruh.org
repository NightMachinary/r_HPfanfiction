** ...nobody else notices.

Snape and Squidward are continually frustrated in their efforts to get back to their own bodies/homes, occasionally to the point of wondering why they're even bothering as either way they're surrounded by idiots.

The fic ends with the two meeting for drinks, and complaining long into the night. It's true love.
