Or a link to another post that has what I want to save everyone trouble.

Thanks.


** Make fun specifically, or is subversion/deconstruction okay too? "Goblins? Be helpful? What are you, an idiot?" vs "We run a bank here, Mr Potter. Not an archiving service. You'll need to go for the Ministry to get any wills."

**** Ah, okay. Well, in the case, your best bet is to probably look for 'mockfics', 'crackfics' and 'parody fics'. I don't have any links to hand at the moment, but I'll poke around and see what I can find.

I think the best known example of what you want is called Harry Potter and the Something something (That's actually the title, I'm not misremembering the latter half).

** [Harry Potter and the Something Something] ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7191459/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Something-Something]]) takes every Harry Potter cliche that a fan could think of (Abusive Dursleys, Harry being rescued from Abusive Dursleys, Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived, Neglectful James and Lily, Seer Luna, Harry being framed and sent to Azkaban, Harems, Mary Sue trying to redeem Voldemort with love, etc.) and mocks it without mercy.
