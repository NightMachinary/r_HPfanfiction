:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry is lashing out and is removed from school?(not sure, but he's definitely sent away). He's placed with an instructor who is similar to Mad eye but a different character. Very gruff not into feelings. They eventually discover the “power he knows not” Harry is very over the top in this fic, very disillusioned with the order and just everyone. Harry being able to cast from his wand while it's not in his hand is a huge portion of this fic.

I remember other spoiler pieces if those would help!


** ayyy thats one of my favorite fics

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice Potter]] and sequels [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Journeyman_Potter/index/][Journeyman Potter]] and [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Master_Potter/index/][Master Potter]]. Unfortunately the last one is abandoned.
