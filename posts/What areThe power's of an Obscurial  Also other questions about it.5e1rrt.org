I know it's a huge black cloud of destruction basically Does it have sentience?

What other power's does it have?

Can it be killed while in cloud form

How powerful is it?

Can the powers be used while it's in child form?

Thinking about writing a fic with harry as one

Yes you can groan it's a new dark power we all can use as writer's

I like dark harry stories. Their overdone yes but they are something I enjoy I always root for evil in fantasy genre they are just cooler and I only know of one universe where evil wins .


** The fact that so little is known about Obscurials means that it's just a clean slate for you to utilize as you want.\\
You want it sentient? Make it fucking sentient.

Hell, it could be a fucking parasyte growing from negative emotions and hatred, its literal manifestation, attached to a wizard and leaving in a sort of symbiotic manner, where The Obscurial feeds off from the child's anger and emotions while providing him with a mean to avenge, or more power.\\
And if the wizard failed to have a strong will, and let himself be ruled by his anger, the Obscurial could devour the child, become a mindless and abstract manifestation of negativism and run berserk, whereas on the other hand, it could also be an incredible dark tool to run amock and create controlled chaos.

It could also be what becomes of a child whose souls get sucked by a dementor.

Or the antithesis patronus spell.

*** From the new movie, a magical parasite that grows in a wizard or witch who oppresses their magic. Would be a nice fanfic where hp has an obscurial that he has a symbiotic relationship.
