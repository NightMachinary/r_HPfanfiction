Im talking bashing, harry/HAREM, super powerful and friendly goblins, lord!Harry super!harry, slytherins will totally accept harry after he roasts Professor Dumb-as-a-door and the order of fried chicken type deal.

Basically harry solves every problem by being the most obnoxious little rich boy tyrant sh**ebag you've ever seen in fanfic...

*** RobSt's work can be safely defined as "well-written but heavily clichéd stories, with inevitable Harry/Hermione pairing".

People like his stories because they're well-written for what they are - but those same stories also have a fair portion of people who catch onto the fact that if you've read one RobSt story, you've read practically all of them (and a good portion of Dumbledore/Weasley-bashing stories by other authors as well).

**** Clarifying the "well-written" descriptor:

His fics each have at least a couple of good ideas/elements that I've not seen in other stories before or since, and as you might guess from my presence on this sub, I've read a /lot/ of HP fanfic.

Also, it's very rare for characters in his stories to just act in furtherance of the plot; almost always, their choices make sense in context. Even the obvious mistakes are made for in-character reasons (at least according to his interpretation of said character, bashy though it may be at times). This is /such/ a breath of fresh air compared to canon.

On a couple of occasions, he actually got me emotionally invested enough in a story to get my heart pounding from the tension. Pulling that off with nothing but text on the page/screen is no small feat.

** The Venom Peddler is far from the worst fic I've seen but it's probably the closest fic to what you're asking for that I actually bothered to save. It holds a frankly undeserved place in my heart for being the first Harry Potter fanfic I ever read (at least that I can recall).

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

This is my go to fic when people ask for it. It has all the bad stuff. Weasley bashing. Dumbledore bashing. Goblin friends. Harry grandstanding. Harry flying off his rocker and yelling unnecessarily. Twinspeak. The twins bowing and doing jigs in praise of Harry on the tables. And my most hated thing authors do. The nicknames. Moldy shorts. Dumb as a door. Etc.

  My answer to Reptilia28's challenge. Six times has Harry Potter died young instead of killing Tom Riddle and marrying his soulmate Hermione. The seventh time that Harry's soul is sent into his younger body, Harry keeps his older memories and he has a plan. But if he fails, both his body and soul shall die. An H/Hr story that bashes Dumbledore and our most unfavourite Weasleys.

**** Even some of the reviews are trash, if you ask me. I generally avoid any fic which bashes Harry, Ron, or Hermione, because those three are the heart and soul of the books.

Man, the reviews treat Hermione like a literal goddess who can do now wrong. Every character has flaws, everyone has done wrong, and everyone tries their best to be good. That's what makes HP fun to read.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
