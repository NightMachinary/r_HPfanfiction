  Lily and James left Harry a muggle trust fund with a muggleborn trustee. This will impact Harry's childhood, leading to a more grounded Harry going to Hogwarts. Quickly runs through Pre-Hogwarts in the first few of chapters (gets the letter in chp 3). Anything recognizable belongs to JKR.

**** While I have not read the story, if it happens in 1981 that is not unlikely at all.

In 1986, average house price was Â£55,000. In 1980, prices would have been slightly cheaper.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

***** I believe that ffnbot!delete should work, but I can't seem to find any mention of the functionality. I may be confusing bot message deletion capabilities with another bot, probably the RemindMe bot. If what I suggested doesn't work, I suppose you could message a mod.

  Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione. H/Hr Rating for language and mild sexual situations.
