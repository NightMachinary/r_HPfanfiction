Looking for fics where Voldemort realises Harry is the only one that can kill him, and decides to offer Harry a truce or just leave him alone.


** There was a fanfiction I can't find where Harry invited Voldemort into his mind and offered him the deal that he'd go away forever if he left him alone. It was quite funny because his mind was a pottery place and all his memories were pieces of pottery. I wish I remembered the name.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

** There's a similar short story but it's Harry that offers the deal. Surprisingly enough the story is called The Deal by EJ Daniels

  Having had more than enough of his life, Harry Potter decided to broker the deal of the ages! What's Britain when compared to his life after all? -- This is a piece of crackfic which is only meant to be humorous and nothing more. If you're looking for good writing, a solid plot line and developed characters...look elsewhere. You've been warned. Read at your own risk! - EJ
