For some reason i got a hankering for Gabrielle pursuing Harry due to her being rescued from the lake (bond or no)

​

Bonus points if she tries for years and isn't.. you know.. like.. 8.. by the time she succeeds..


** Well, I normally prefer Harry/Fleur but for Harry/Gabrielle there's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]]. It's fairly enjoyable if a bit cliche. He has another story with that pairing too.

All the others I know are Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle.

*** Neither 12d or VP feature Gabrielle falling for Harry because of the lake. I forget if it's mentioned in VP so I'd poke [[/u/rpeh]] but in 12D she specifically refutes it.

**** The lake is mentioned as an aside during a conversation between Harry, Titus and Derrick Lunfrey but it hardly counts:

> After a productive evening they left. And although Harry wouldn't say it aloud, he was thankful that Lunfrey did not mention his young ward at all. If they even recognized that she was the sister of the champion he pulled out of the lake during the second task it wasn't brought up.

** I see someone already mentioned Hope by Jeconais, [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Happily_Ever_After/index/][Happily Ever After]] also by Jeconais is very cute. I think my favorite Harry/Gabrielle story is linkffn(5490079). I love the amount of history the author put into the story but its not a romance fic if that is what you're looking for.

*** By my own admission, this story starts out very rough, but it improves quite drastically. I'll go back and revise the early chapters once book 1 is done.

Happily Ever After is probably the closest thing to the actual request and it's decent, if a bit hyperbolized. TheEndless7's stories are probably the two best all time for this pairing.

One fic that I never see on here and have no clue why is linkffn(12731357) This is probably the third best fic I've read for this pairing, even though it is still a WIP.

  Book 1 of a Trilogy: Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong.

** I prefer this ship than Harry × Fleur because she just seems to old for him but Harry × Gabrielle it kinda makes sense if you put thought into it and I could see it happening because the fact that Harry saves Gabrielle which shows he cares for her and Gabrielle thanks Harry for that do I could see it. I'm sorry I sound like I'm answering a reading question at school Lol 😅 Well anyhow I could see it I dunno if anyone else can but it also seems like Gabrielle I'd to young because in the books it says she's 7 ( I think ) but in the films I find that she looks 10 not 7 so in the films I can see it happening because they would only be 4 years apart but in the books maybe not as they would be 7 years apart and that would just seem crazy! Feel free to correct me if Gabrielle if younger or older than 7 in the books and thanks for reading this because its been a long paragraph 😊 well that's all I have to say
