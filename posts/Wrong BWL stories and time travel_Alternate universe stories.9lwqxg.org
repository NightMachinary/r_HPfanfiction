Any good and long stories where harry is thrown aside for his brother while he grows in power enough to make Voldemort look weak in comparison? Or stories about harry in the founders or Marauders timeline of Alternate universe where he hides as a teacher or something. Non slash fics of this kind please

A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?
