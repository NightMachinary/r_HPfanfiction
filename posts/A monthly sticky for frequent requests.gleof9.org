** This is an interesting idea and it seems like a lot of others agree. Is this something the community would like to see?

If you have suggestions on a frequency or specific style of request to spotlight, comment below.

*** It'd be neat so the ones who want certain requests, don't have to submit their own threads.

** I think this is a pretty good idea and it was getting weird when I kept having to repost some links I'd already recommended. I'm kinda glad someone brought it up cause I wasn't feeling like it.

** I would love this.

I saw a request the other day for Fred and George fics. I thought I saved it, but can't find it. I really want to read fics with them as prominent characters.

But I don't want to be the fourth person to post about it this week.

Monthly sticky would be perfect.

** It would also be great to sidebar the most recent iteration of each topic if there's a way to do that

** It'll be interesting to have this as like a Weekly thing or monthly as you said.

First week (Or month): Time Travel Recommendations

Second Week (Or Month): Self Inserts

Third Week (Or Month): OP Characters, Slytherin Harry or whatever else.

Et cetra, et cetra.

**** Maybe somewhere in the middle of what you said and I said? Or not. Just depending.

I like your idea overall.
