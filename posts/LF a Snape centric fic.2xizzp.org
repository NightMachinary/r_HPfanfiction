Here a few months ago I read a story where Snape goes back in time to right before he meets Lily. He's stopped before he tells her she's a witch to see what Petunia does. Turns out she's on par to a hedge witch (sorry big Mercedes Lackey fan) not enough to get the letter but she ends up apprenticing to Sprout The Evans end up adopting Snape and he becomes a Raven so the marauders won't be threatened. Thank you in advance.
