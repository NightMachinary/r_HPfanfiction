This is my first time requesting help to find a fic, if I did anything wrong, please tell me.

The fic I want to find is one where Harry is adopted by the Malfoys ( I think thats how you write it) and is happilly betrothed to Rabastan Lestrange (and wants to have like seven children with him), doesn't like Dumbledore and isn't friends with the Weasleys and Hermione anymore because they destroyed his things repeatedly in the start of the year.

Because of being harassed by the Griffs, he doesn't live in the common room anymore, instead he lives in private rooms and is friends with some slytherins and is cordial with Draco (beacuse they are brothers now). He is also active in politics.

That is all I remember, the last time I read it was last year, the fic was still being updated.

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting for Harry sets him on a path he was never meant to travel. With his eyes opened and the struggle to control the anger inside of him at all of the lies and hidden agendas, a sudden adoption and unlikely allies work to split him from Dumbledore forever. With two Lordships and new responsibilities, how will the Wizarding world react to Lord Harry James Potter-Black, especially when he declares that he won't fight in their war?

**** Thank you, I am new. Am I supposed to right it anywhere in the comment and it will appear as a tag? Or do I have to do something else? Edit for grammar.
