** Not really but Harmony friends will likely appreciate them anyway.

** It depends. If they are before the dating age (or just not focusing on dating because of a, ya know, war), and there is no obvious ship hooks for other characters, then it is sometimes called Pre-Harmony. They are super-best friends at the moment, and it probably will get serious after they get older. (Though, not everyone count's pre-harmony as Harmony. And, if it is obvious that they will never get together, then it isn't Harmony.)

** If they don't do the two-backed beast, [[https://Portkey.org][Portkey.org]], the one-time authority on things Harmony, wouldn't consider the story.

** If UST is there, even if they never end up together in the fic, then yes. Otherwise (especially if they're shipped with others), not really. Consider this: would someone who wants to read a Harmony fic because of the ship read your fic? If, say, they have a very close friendship but Hermione ends up with Ron, then having the fic be labeled as Harmony is going to make those people very annoyed. On the other hand, if they're yet to focus on stuff like romance, and yet clearly be the closest relationship that each other have, then it could lead to Harmony in the future, which could appease those people, even if the fic doesn't go all the way. But I'd personally still not label it as Harmony myself.

(Personally I don't really care much for Harmony, but replace that ship with a ship I do like, and this is basically my opinion on the whole thing. I don't see why Harmony would be any different)

** depends? if it's a thing where one or both is aromantic and they're in a close platonic life-partner thing, then yeah, but i've never seen that for this pairing in fic.
