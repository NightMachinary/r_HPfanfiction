Featherlight Charm cast on the Deadlift just before he picks it up subtly, and then cancelled when they go to check the weight.

Spongify cast on the Jumps and then cancelled

Boxing... Enchant the Gloves to apply Stupefy when you Punch? Crazier things have been done in fanfics

Any clever ways you can see Magic being used to cheat in Olympic events subtly. No Imperio'ing everyone to lose, stuff you could subtly alter without anyone noticing. Stuff you could sneak in without risking the statute of secrecy.


** I can see a small team of hard-eyed aurors on a temporary posting with the ICW stood to at the opening ceremony and checking the athletes as they enter the arena for the opening parade. Not every olympics, but enough that they keep doing it, they quietly escort an athlete off to one side and Have A Word.

** I would take a small dosage of gillyweed to web my hands and feet and tear up the swimming, wouldn't need to breathe as often as well so would shave a few seconds off Vs muggles.

I'm pretty sure that, while it /is/ an unfair advantage, it's not actually against the rules. There are no limits on the intelligence of the horse, and nothing in the rules that says it has to be a horse /all the time/.

**** There is a debate on whether the horse counts as a horse though. It's not a horse so much as a "horse". Legal by technicality, but judges are rarely fair.

** Re'em blood is the way to go.

#+begin_quote
  The Re'em is native to the wilds of North America and the Far East. The Re'em is extremely rare, resembling giant oxen with a golden hide. Re'em blood gives immense strength to the drinker for a limited time. However, since demand far exceeds supply, and obtaining the blood in the first place is extremely difficult, it can rarely be found on the open market.
