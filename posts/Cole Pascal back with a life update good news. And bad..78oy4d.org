So my mom's bff runs an adult foster home for the disabled and she's offered me a job running it as soon as it's filled with residents. I will potentially no longer be homeless quite soon.

That was the good news obviously.

The bad news:

Someone dropped my backpack and killed my laptop. I'm down to my last ten dollars. My gran's stuff is in storage and i don't have enough to pay this month's rental or next's.

Seriously fucking awesome news:

my 15---soon to be 16---yo daughter contacted me. For the past decade and a half I didn't even know she knew of me. It's amazing. She's prettier than I thought she would be. Too pretty in fact. I nearly crushed a dude's throat when he said my gf was 'sexy af' when regarding the pic of daughter on my tablet.

Interesting news:

i'm working on a few other projects visible at [[http://colesint.blogspot.com]]

I wrote a story based on the drama of her mom leaving me back then and my daughter hunting me down which is on my blog. I want to do it as a coloring book or a watercolor storybook on tapas maybe. Very rough draft. Taking break from editing it due to how much i cried writing it.

Also available there is the worldbuilding for an ios freemium game i'm working on. Depending on how that goes, i may be putting together a studio soon to produce the game. I have some people interested and it's my most interesting project. Even depressed i can work on it.

I also started some notes on a story that's lovecraftian/power rangersesque crossover i think i mentioned before, also on the blog. A few artists are interested in it but I'm sidelining it right now due to the game being more interesting atm.

Also, if you want, i have an old story available on lulu. [[http://www.lulu.com/shop/cb-pascal/dreiblatt-gods-red-right-hand/ebook/product-2297336.html]] Buying it would really help me out.

Edit: I hope to be writing again by Christmas!


** Does this have anything to do with Harry Potter?

*** Well, he is one of the better known authors on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] and a lot of people know his account on FFN. Sooo... maybe? Not the most unrelated thread we ever had on here.
