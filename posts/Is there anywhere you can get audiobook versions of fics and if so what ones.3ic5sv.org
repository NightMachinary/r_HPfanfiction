** AO3 allow podfics, just search for podfic and it should filter them. I usually don't bother downloading anything less than 20 mins long just because by the time you've downloaded it and loaded it onto your device, you could have listened to it. Some are really crappily recorded, but some are on par with professional audiobooks. I tend to be really picky and cannot listen to something badly recorded. I've found some absolute gems on there.\\
Also try - [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com]] . The filter functionality is a bit clunky but at least you can narrow it down to fandoms and pairings.

** If you have android you can use the app VoxDox for text to speech. I've "read" many fics that way.

*** I am using moon reader coupled with googles' Text-to-Speech engine. It's surprisingly good.

*** I also use text-to-speech software when I want to listen to a story rather than reading it. Some programs will encode to an mp3 to make things more portable.

** For iPhone users I recommend voice dream. Originally I cringed at the $10 cost but it's made my fic life sooo much better. You can navigate to the in-app browser, find the fic. Switch to desktop mode (FFnet has a link at the bottom) and quickly save chapters.

The voice I chose was also purchased but I think it was worth it. Actually reading was time consuming and buying a text to speech means I can do other things like play games or work while "reading."

Disclaimer, it's a little buggy sometimes but it makes for a great commuter experience.

I also used to use NaturalReader for Desktop.

*** 100% agreement. Voice dream is a literal dream. I listened to a few hundred thousand word fic on my commute just recently. Amy by Ivona is my favorite voice.

Pocket books is similar on android.

I believe it's volunteers who voice the fics. My only complaint is that the majority of the fics seem to be very short.

Edit: Oh, my bad. I didn't realize it was already suggested. Serves me right for not reading thoroughly enough. :)
