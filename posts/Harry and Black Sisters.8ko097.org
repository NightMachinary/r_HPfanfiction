***** Y'know, I think I've actually read that.

Speaking of, there's like a surprising amount of stories - well, 3 that I've read, but that's way more than I would have expected - that make Harry Indian or grow up there.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

** Reclamation of Black Magic does this, though we haven't yet seen exactly how they raised him (it was mostly skipped over via a time skip).
