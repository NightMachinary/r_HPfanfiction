How might that work in a story?


** Generally speaking, there are too many ways this could work in different iterations (change any number of details). However, for my money a decent fic with JD characterization of Harry would need to fall into one of two categories:

1. Harry is trained from birth as a supersoldier of sorts in the magical world (or child soldier as it were), and is introduced in media res as an emotionally stunted but incredibly proficient wizard/soldier to accomplish some task (whether Voldemort related or otherwise). One noteworthy example I can think of is linkffn(Learning to Breathe by onoM), which while cheesy in some regards nevertheless accurately portrays such a dedicated soldier persona for Harry, even if his powers are a bit OP.
2. Create an almost entirely AU world similar to Mega City One: a dystopian nightmare (with or without the SoS) where certain individuals such as Harry are given extensive privilege to maintain order among the population. One could easily make a play of the Grindelwald idea of "Magic is Might" and have the wizards at the top of the pyramid in something of a caste culture, with the rest of the non-magical and non-human relegated to lesser roles. This would be even more prominent if a different past (without the SoS) means the non-magical population never developed many of the technological innovations that occurred in the least three centuries (ex. industrial revolution, green revolution, nuclear power, etc.).

Those are my thoughts, but obviously it depends on what aspect of such a characterization you want to see - whether it be how Harry acts in the world or how others see him and his behavior/abilities.

*** What about actually having Dredd in HP? Voldemort is small potatoes compared to Judge Death, Judge Fear, Judge Mortis, and Judge Fire.
