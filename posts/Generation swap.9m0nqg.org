Hi, I'm looking for any fics with a generation swap, or where characters (more than one, preferably) are of different ages, like Harry in the 1940s being prophesied to kill Grindelwald, or Ron being the eldest Weasley and Percy the youngest, or Harry and co. being older than the marauders, that kind of thing.

But, like, not because of time travel.

....does that even exist?


** They do exist. I've seen one where Harry was just born in the same year as Riddle and they were in the same orphanage... it was pretty shit though from what I remember and I act recall what it was called. Believe I dropped it after a few chapters
