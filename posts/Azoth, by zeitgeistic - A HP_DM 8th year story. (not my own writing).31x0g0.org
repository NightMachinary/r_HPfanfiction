Just wanted to throw out a recommendation for a medium-length story that was really, really well done. /It is NOT my fanfic/, just a story that I really enjoyed and wanted to pass along.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]], by zeitgeistic (faire_weather) - HP/DM, rated R

Author Summary: "Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess. There is a surplus of cats in this story. It wasn't planned, but when are cats ever?"

The story follows Harry and Hermione as they go back to Hogwarts for their 7th year, after defeating Voldemort.

The characters seem vivid, real, and alive. To me, there's a huge difference in fanfic that writes the characters well and allows them to grow and develop vs fanfic that just devolves characters into caricatures of themselves. I loved the characters in this story. Harry really comes alive as a character, rather than just a medium for storytelling. Hermione has quirks beyond just being a bookworm. Draco is similarly well developed beyond just an aloof bastard. The secondary characters in this fic shine. There were moments in this story that literally made me laugh out loud. The humor is clever, the little details make it work. The story has a lot of charm and emotion woven into the humor scenes. I've read a fair bit of fanfic, but this is my favorite 8th year fic. I thought the concept and plot were fairly fresh, creative, believable, and well written to boot. The aforementioned character development and humor and emotion really sold this for me.

If you don't mind slash pairings (there's a subtle Hermione/Millicent too), let me know what you think! I'd also love recs for fresh, creative, well-written stories like this. (:

*** Totally out of the blue and not a Drarry, but here is another of my favorite fics that is just phenomenal. WIP warning (part 3 is unwritten), but well worth reading anyway.

Living On by gyzym [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109306.html][Part 1]] [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109753.html][Part 2]]

Another fic with wonderful characterization.

**** Azoth was quite excellent, thank you again for the rec! Definitely one of those stories that I didn't want to end because I was enjoying it so much. PotionsMaster!Harry was a unique idea and very well handled, loved the Snape-style robes and hair.

** I just finished this story three days ago. I enjoyed it (excellent writing, good characterizations overall) but thought it was a bit angsty for my usual tastes. I don't think I ever read why Draco felt he was being caged in regards to Harry. I must've missed something LOL.

*** I understood it in the sense that Draco has lived by the expectations of his parents and Slytherin stereotypes and being a "Junior Death Eater" all his life. One could potentially see where Draco would feel he'd been forced into all those circumstances.

[[/spoiler][Since Harry fell in love with Draco first, for Draco to just go along with the relationship would be just living by someone else's expectations and hopes again. I think it was really important for Draco to come to terms with his feelings outside of a relationship. Harry following Millicent's advice to give Draco space allowed Draco to assess his feelings independently.]]

edited in spoiler tag, just in case.

*** A linguist I am not... that disclaimer aside, the author chose that term for it's alchemy roots.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoth][Wiki link]]

If you're planning on reading the story, I'd go through that before reading the wiki link. Some of the things on the link could be considered a mild spoiler that would enable a reader to predict a plot point.
