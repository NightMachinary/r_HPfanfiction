Lf fic where Harry is sorted into ravenclaw preferably with Hermione


** I'm pretty sure linkffn(Unsung Hero) has both Harry and Hermione on Ravenclaw and this is the pairing. Also a WBWL scenario, with shitty Potters. Not the greatest story, but fits the bill.

**** I know. I felt the same way, but did manage to read the whole thing. To be honest, it stays the same, sometimes it gets better and other times it gets way way worse. What is fun though, is the fact that the Horcruxes fight for their lives, somewhat like the diary. There's one that manages to kill even Myrtle.

*** HPMOR seems to be a fic where you either love it or hate it (and I love it).

The author definitely lets his own views leak through, but it's still possible to enjoy it even if you're right-leaning and Christian (like me).

***** The key is the HPMOR doesn't just hold a different philosophy - it veers into an outright lecture while also making every character into an OC in all but name. Plenty of people dislike both aspects.

***** Well, people approach fiction with different mindsets. Some people just want to feel good. Those people enjoy having their beliefs confirmed and generally hate lecturing or fiction that pushes a different philosophy.

To enjoy stuff outside of your ideological sphere you need to be capable of detaching yourself from your beliefs to see from the authors perspective.

**** I think this really has a lot to do with how you as an individual approach fiction and whether or not you go into it looking for the Harry Potter experience.

If you are a die hard rowling-can-do-no-wrong HP fan HPMOR will suck, since it overwrites most of the characters and nitpicks flaws in the worldbuilding nonstop.\\
Plus, many people hate being lectured, and HPMOR can come off that way if you don't have prior familiarity with LW.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
