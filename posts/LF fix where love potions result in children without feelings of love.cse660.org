:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this fic children (or firstborn really) resulting from such union would be incapable of feelings of love. Affected were Bill Weasley, Voldemort and Harry Potter. For the life of me I can't remember other details.


** That sounds like the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/592519][A Counterfeit of Love]] series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/BrilliantLady/pseuds/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady]]. It has Harry, Bill, and Voldemort all as incapable of romantic love bc their parents used love potions when having them.

*** I've started reading it and I think it's this story. Thank you very much.

The first chapter sets the stage but the parts after is really where it gets more depth.

** I do not remember the name, but this sounds familiar. I want to say that bill married a veela because she made him feel something when he couldn't feel love, and I think when he had his daughter he was happy that he could actually love her.
