Looking for a fic where Harry is there Heir of something cool, and while it would give him a lot of things like money, abilities, ect, he'd still have to work for things. For example, he wouldn't get his abilities and be instant Merlin, Power Level over 9000, obliterate Dumbledore with a flick of his wrist. He would have to actually train this ability.

Over 70k words, thanks!


** "out of the night" by raining ink. Harry claims his Peverall inheritance.

*** Does anyone have a version they could send? It seems like the fic has been abandoned and taken down, but the author is fine with people emailing each other their saved copies.

** *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569), is pretty good. Although Harry became Lord Slytherin, he inherited only a family ring and no money at all. He still faced an uphill battle.

**** I thought the same thing when i read the title and yes it is a little ridiculous but really when you consider what you asked for your standards really shouldn't be that high.

The fic isn't great but it does have its moments and it's ok to read if you're bored and have nothing better to do.

*** I don't know that I'd go so far as to say it's good...

It has it's moments, both for good and ill, but there is a lot of bad in this story. I think it's more of an interesting concept that got derailed by bad tropes and a laughable magic system.

*** Nearly didn't give this a shot, but it was better than I had expected. Not the best, but I don't regret reading it so that's at least 3/5 for me.

** The fic that came into mind were linkffn(Harry Potter and the Return of Heritage;Harry Potter and the Peverell Legacy).

The series isn't an instant power up and has proper lore behind the heir stuff.
