Hey guys, after silently reading on this sub for 4 years, i finally decided to create an account ! i am looking for a fanfic about a girl who works at Azkaban, i think she might be a Weasley (?) and she hates being pitied by her family for being a Squib. Does that ring a bell ? Thanks


** For some reason this is making me imagine a squib dementor. No aura and no ability to suck out a soul, this dementor has to wise up just to get by.

*** Not related but I really want something like Outlast but centered at Azkaban.
