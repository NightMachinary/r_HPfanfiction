I've got a bunch of travel coming up and I'm looking for some long, engrossing fics (or series) that I can put on my tablet. I read really fast, so the longer the better! And I need to be able to easily get them on my tablet -- so on AO3 or with ebook versions readily available, please.

Preferred pairings:\\
* Canon (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, etc.)\\
* Remus/Sirius\\
* Harry/Draco\\
But I'll give most things a go if they're good.

Some of my favourite stories recently have been Turn by saras_girl, Foundations also by saras_girl, Stealing Harry, and The Enemy Within by Theowyn. But, again... I'll give anything a go.

Help! Send me your best ridiculously long stories!


** Even if the ebook isn't immediately available, for most fics you can put the fic url into [[http://www.ficsave.xyz/#!][FicSave]] and it will email you a pdf version of the fic. If you have kindle, you can email it directly your Kindle's email. Edit: fixed a couple words

*** Even better: you can get an ebook copy of the fic (which is nice for nooks, ibooks, etc) or a mobi file (which is kindles natural format). I really detest reading PDFs on my kindle but ficsave lets you choose from file types that typically work a little better!

** It isn't one of your pairings but it is ridiculously long and my all time favourite. It's a Hermione/Sirius and I encourage everyone to try it because it is beautifully written and I've cried like a baby every time I've read and reread it! linkffn(The Debt of Time) by ShayaLonnie

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** For HP/DM, have you checked out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1265079/Lomonaaeren][Lomonaaeren]]? They're quite prolific, with many 1 chapter fics but also longer epics for you to pick from and create ebook files of your preference. (ficsave or the ffn bot can help you with this.)

I've linked two in particular that I've read. Lethe is an unique take on Light/Dark magics. Changing of the Guard is a fairly political fic that also features a Harry who has developed interesting coping mechanisms after the war (I think the first half of this fic is better than the second, but it's worth reading all the way through).
