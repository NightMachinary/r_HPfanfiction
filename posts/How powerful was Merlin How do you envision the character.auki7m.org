Merlin is a legendary figure in the Potterverse -- after all, it is used in everyday Wizarding phrases, e.g. Merlin's pants. He must have been powerful to have cultivated such a status in BOTH worlds.

Of course, power isn't everything, and Merlin (in our world) is well-known for being a trickster in many interpretations. In the Potterverse, it is confirmed that he was a Slytherin; therefore, maybe he was less the most powerful magical being and more someone who knew /how/ to effectively use his power. Still, Merlin must have been something special.

Personally, I view Merlin as someone who would make Voldemort (and Dumbledore, even with the Elder Wand) seem like a couple of first-years with his sheer magical prowess.

Voldemort can levitate boulder? Merlin can do the same with a mountain. Dumbledore can manipulate the water in a lake? Merlin parts the seas with minimal difficulty.

But the main facet of Merlin would be his cunning and resourcefulness, whilst still being a compassionate individual. At times, he must not interfere with the affairs of either world. I view him as a man with nigh-limitless power, yet constrained by the forces of fate and destiny, like any human.

What are your views on the character?


** I don't imagine him to be nearly as powerful as you view him. He was a powerful wizard. Maybe enough to easily defeat Dumbledore, but if that's the case I would say that's mostly because Merlin was more dedicated to magic whereas Dumbledore has had like 3 full time jobs for decades - the man probably hasn't improved significantly in a long time. Voldemort is only ~70, and he spent 10 of those years being a wraith.

Merlin's a case of the Boy-Who-Lived or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named phenomenon, but compounded over hundreds of years. A story that gained its own momentum to become myth/legend.

As for his fame in the muggle world.. well. I don't know the story well, but from what I remember there was no godly geography altering power involved.

** There's a great characterisation of Merlin in linkffn(The Long Journey Home by Rakeesh), where he's very much a human. He's powerful but becomes a wise and strong wizard thanks to his teacher.

As for him being a Slytherin, where does that come from? Hogwarts was build in the 10th century while Arthur and Merlin have their stories at the end of the 5th / start of the 6th. I've certainly seen some fanfictions that describe him as a Slytherin but that's just bad research.

  Here's a little-known fact that the other three houses don't bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth?

Canon that this is widely believed in Slytherin House, but that they're believing the arrant propaganda from the Matter of Britain rather than the historical facts of the matter, which is that Merlin died more than two hundred years, possibly as much as three hundred years, before Hogwarts was founded.

Although it's entirely plausible that Merlin - in his later life, no longer known as Myrddin Wyllt, but as Lailoken the Mad Prophet - lived in Hogsmeade Valley, and the old stonework at the base of one of Hogwarts' towers is all that remains of his home.

***** Jumping on the Merlin thing as "wrong" seems to misunderstand the way JKR has made the HP world. Almost every element of the HP universe was a pre-existing mythological/occult trope /which JKR has twisted and changed/, typically by removing the more mythological elements and making them more "normal". For example, in mythology Perseus' flying horse Pegasus was the child of the god Poseidon. In Harry Potter there are whole herds of winged horses. They reproduce biologically, have no connection to any god, and they drink whiskey.

If the Harry Potter world had to accord with traditional mythology to be "correct", then the whole world is wrong. Veela do not accurately reflect the Slavic legend of Vila. House-Elves do not accurately reflect the Scottish legend of Brownies. And so on.

It's entirely in keeping with the Harry Potter world that Merlin does not reflect the figure as depicted in the traditional legend of King Arthur. The idea that Muggles have the wrong idea about magical things is a consistent theme throughout the books.

****** No I'll actually give her that one. You're right that strictly speaking, Pegasus is a single creature, it's been adopted into popular culture as a generic term for a flying horse. In fact (just checked) the Wikipedia article specifically mentions this: "Although often misused in popular culture, the term "Pegasus" is a proper noun, referring to a particular character, whereas the term "pterippus" (plural: "pterippi") is the generic name for the species of winged horses." In this case, it would be wizards who've got the wrong idea about a magical thing, not muggles.

As for your other examples, she didn't reuse the term "Vila" or "Brownie" but instead created totally new terms, so it's fair enough to change details from the original.

If she wanted a historically powerful wizard she could have made her own. Instead she used Merlin and got the details wrong. And, again, to say it's muggles misunderstanding things wouldn't explain how muggles have stories about Arthur and Merlin that pre-date the founding of Hogwarts.

First, she hasn't created a fictional universe. Rather, she added fictional elements to our universe. That's kind of the whole point - wizards being present in our world.

Second, she screwed up loads of stuff. Some of it is purely her own fault, like the economics of wizarding Britain making no sense and some is just sloppy - like the Express leaving from platform 9 3/4 and people accessing it through the pillars between platforms 9 and 10 when *there are no pillars between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross * - the two lines are right next to each other.

*** I actually think the portrayal of Merlin was kind of weak in the story. It's kind of overshadowed by all the filler scenes in the future. Like, Merlin is matching Harry in skill after 3 years, despite Harry being /3000/ years older at one point. And it's done with runes, because the author went with the old cliche of runes being some sort of programming language, so Merlin just swaps a couple and bam, solved. It's like a scene out of a bad movie. Like, the story is in theory about an OP Harry, but he's arbitrarily hamstrung at every opportunity, never gets a chance to shine.

** *Caution - Self Promotion*

In the Last Mage of Krypton series, there are a couple of comments sprinkled around as to how there were actually THREE Merlins.

Merlin 1 - Maker of magical sword/King Arthur's court wizard.

Merlin 2 - Wizard who taught one or more of the Founders

Merlin 3 - Slytherin Alumni

Wizards being lazy and not fact-checking, all three kinda got mixed up in normal history until we had a Merlin who was a member of House Slytherin, taught the Founders and put King Arthur on the throne via magic sword.

** I always imagine him like I think of, for example, Da Vinci. Way beyond his age in terms of the mastery and sheer /vision/ he has for magic and its many uses. A true genius of his time, but other than many artists, engineers and inventors, actually seen as such. With him being on the forefront of magic, things took a turn for progress. I think of him as the man who changed the preservatory function of Hogwarts into a progressing one, or at least added it to the workings of Hogwarts. I imagine him in school to be a lot like the Marauders - researching, inventing, and doing it all because its just /fun/. With age he would use this same drive in a more serious environment, as well as in a political arena, but it would ultimately still be a mindset of invention and progress.

But compared to Dumbledore and Voldemort, even against people like Remus, he'd be helplessly outgunned if he would be just dropped into such a duel. Simply because he would have inferior spellwork, and inferior equipment (wand). Its one conclusion of my belief that magic and its many facettes progresses and gets modernized (while some old knowledge of it gets lost until needed again).

** I imagine that Merlin was born in the 10th century to or was raised by Druids and in adulthood, he made a True time turner device and went back to the 5th/6th century and became the Merlin of Arthurian Legend. Maybe he brought Cadogan and Morgana with him.

Personality-wise, like Dumbledore, Dinsey's Merlin and Gandalf, he'd be wise, eccentric, whimsical but serious, authoritive, cunning and manipulative when needed.

He was the most powerful wizard of his time, perhaps all time and he was involved in the political and religious going-ons at the time and founded the Order of Merlin which in addition to being a Muggle-rights organization, fought dark wizards and witches etc and became a precursor to the wizard's council and became the legal authority among wizardkind to allow them to govern themselves and ensure loyalty to the crown being King Arthur.

He would also be Seer and a Metamorphmagus (thus tying in with his myths of prophecy and shapeshifting. He would eventually meet, train and fall in love with Nyneve/Nimueh and Morgana would use either Metamorphmagus, Polyjuice Potion or self-transfiguration to assume Nyneve/Nmueh's form and either kill Merlin, transfigure him into a tree or lure him into a cave and put him in bewitched sleep and seal the cave.

At some point after, the battle of Camlann would happen where Arthur would either be mortally wounded or die straight out. If wounded only, then Arthur would be taken to Avalon where he would be healed and put into Bewitched Sleep only to be woken when needed again. If he died, he'd be buried on Avalon.

That's one of my interpretations.

***** In that case, Merlin is still awesome. There is a reason the phrase "Da Vinci of our time" is so complimentary even though Da Vinci's actual knowledge is pretty limited by today's standards. Da Vinci is a great because he utilized what knowledge and resources available in his time to make massive advancements in multiple areas. Had Da Vinci been born in modern times he would likely be making huge contributions to the sciences and arts just like he did in his own time. I think it's the same with Merlin - it's not his knowledge or magical skills but rather the contributions he made to society.

He is not powerful due to his knowledge or experience but because his ability to see magic and souls/life grants him an unprecedented insight that simply cannot be matched by any conventional wizard or witch.

By the age of 17, he can transfigure complex wards into water, rip souls and dementors to shreds, take on multiple Death Eaters and Voldemort and an Inferi army single handedly, among other feats. All using raw magic manipulation and transfiguration.

Merlin was, according to legend in this fic, known for similar or even greater feats and was regarded as the Prince of Enchanters.
