The fic was called "Dragons and death" and had a harry/rhaegar pairing. I'm wondering if anyone has a copy.

EDIT: I have a pdf now, thanks for the help!


** The only version I can find has 138 chapters, but I don't know if there had been any more. [[https://web.archive.org/web/20190714222108/https://archiveofourown.org/works/17768201?view_full_work=true]]

** Only thing I could find is an old comment referencing it,

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bgjidi/game_of_thrones_or_a_song_of_ice_and_fire/ells1fe/]]

At least they have the fic ID (ao3 17768201). Archive.org, hpfanfic archive, and ff2ebook archive all don't have it though.
