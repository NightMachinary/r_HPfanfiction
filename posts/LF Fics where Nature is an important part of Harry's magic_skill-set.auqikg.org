Essentially good stories where Harry could be considered a druid, as much as he could be considered a wizard. Stories where Harry actively uses everything he learns in Care of Magical Creatures, or where he becomes an Animagus in order to get closer to nature, or tries to figure out how to grow his own Whomping Willows.

Basically stories where Harry's skill-set draws from Herbology, or Magical Creatures, or anything else nature inspired.

Anybody know any good ones?

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

** Hmm...I can imagine, a druid who studies the properties of mystical plants and animals, learning magical rituals to unlock their own powers for his own use, powers that can't easily be replicated via mere wandwork...

Wait...is Snape a druid?
