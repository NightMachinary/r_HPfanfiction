not in the sense that he is the son of a god but just the way Percy approaches his new world. Harry and Percy are both dropped into a mythical or magical world that they know nothing about but where Percy sees and learns and eventually becomes one of the strongest at camp, Harry sees, learns and forgets. Harry doesn't strive to be better and he constantly relies on Hermione. The trios in both books are pretty much identical but Percy learns to be competent and Harry doesn't as much. So whats a fic where Harry starts at the bottom with no skill at all and works to be the best over time.


** Harry Potter is one of the strongest characters in his world. The only reason it isn't noticeable is because we see him as a kid standing next to Dumbledore and Voldemort, which really colours your perspective.

In any interaction between him and his classmates or him and non-insane godlike adults he is the strongest one there.

- He is so good at defence he is the one teaching 7th years how to do it when he was only 15 at the time.
- He won the triwizard tournament against the best of the best of Europe, who were also three years older than him.
- He defeats experienced death eaters in a duel without even realizing this is supposed to be hard.
- He defeats Voldemort in a fair fight.

Yes, he isn't really all that interested in the theory and doesn't care tot memorize dates of Goblin rebellions, thus Hermione has higher scores than him in class. But out in the real world he clearly outclasses her in power.

*** It becomes really obvious in OotP and HBP. He hits Antonin Dolohov with a /Petrificus Totalus/ and I'm pretty sure he stuns Rabastan Lestrange easily in the Ministry battle. Dolohov, who killed Lupin and is one of the most dangerous Death Eaters and Lestrange who was part of the quartet who tortured the Longbottoms.

It's even more impressive when you realise he has no formal training and went through a lot of shit the entire year, had his mind infiltrated by Voldemort and a splitting headache at the same time.

In HBP, he takes out Greyback with a single spell, who had defeated Bill just minutes ago, and his Impediment Jinx throws Amycus Carrow across the corridor.

All of this after who knows how many hours of running around all day, the RoR thing with Trelawney and nearly being drowned by Inferi.

It's when you realise Super!Harry fanfic is mostly canon Harry who isn't being sidelined by well-meaning but condescending adults.

*** Not saying that I disagree with everything you've mentioned, and Harry isn't by any means completely inept, but Harry only won the tournament because of outside help. First task Moody/Crouch had to hint to use a broomstick - and, yes, we can attest to Harry's amazing flying skills, but the whole point of that task, was if I remember correctly, to judge how the champion would be able to fair in a unknown task, and it judged their creativity etc.

The second task was basically spoon-fed to him- Cedric told him what to do with the egg. Dobby gave him the gillyweed. I mean, he fought of the grindylows and merpeople, but they learned that in third year, not to mention that the gillyweed made things much easier in terms of accessibility.

And thirdly, Moody/Crouch himself said he personally oversaw the maze in order to ensure that Harry won. Most things that Harry fought off in there were either mentioned in his classes (and he'd have to be Crabbe/Goyle level not to be able recall how to get past them) or he'd dealt with before (the acromantuala) or just needed common sense to be dealt with (the sphinx and the mist)

I'm not going to comment on the duel because I can't remember enough of the Canon part from the top of my head. And I'm not saying that Harry's stupid or weak, though Harry's whole character arc is (and I've forgotten what the title for it was, though I've seen it mentioned on this subreddit a few times) molded out to make him seem as human, relatable and average as possible to the reader.

**** How about this then? He is able to learn the Patronus charm, at the age of 13, a charm that is supposed to be incredibly difficult to master.

As the other person said, he did in fact teach the other students DA.

Harry knew of the tasks, but then so did everyone else. The fact that he was able to outfly a dragon, is nothing to scoff at.

Harry, Hermione and Ron end up entering the Ministry of Magic, while on the run, of Voldemort and Death Eaters, while under Polyjuice potion, again under no small feat!

**** A couple of counterpoints:

- First task.

Everyone "cheated" in that they knew upfront they were going to be facing dragons. Nobody truly went in blind/unprepared. Every other contestant also prepared for dragons their own way and had people helping them. You think Krum just randomly happened to know the exact spell to blind a dragon? No, he was training specifically for that shit after Karkarov told him, the same as Harry. At the end of the day Harry still did it himself and actually outflew the dragon!!

​

- Second task.

Learning about grindylows in a book and actually fighting them off for real are not the same thing. case in point, Fleur was actually overwhelmed by them and had to drop out. Everyone of the contestants had the same chance going in and Harry was still first to reach the hostages and only his moral code stopped him from outright winning it all because he choose to wait until the others arrived.

- third task

Crouch said a lot of things to throw Harry of his game, there is little to no actual evidence in the books what he said was true or that it made a difference in the end. Harry did face that task and ended up victorious against opponents older than him and already the best of their respective years.

Very fair, but outside of us seeing him teach them like five spells, we're never actually shown that he's good at defense, we're just told he is. Yeah he survives a lot of nonsense, but that's just because he has to because plot reasons.

#+begin_quote
  He won the triwizard tournament against the best of the best of Europe, who were also three years older than him.
#+end_quote

He had outside help for every step of this. While the others did too, Jr. used the Imperius Curse to get make sure Harry would get to the cup and win. The first task, his flying helped for sure, 100%, but he only managed the second task because Jr. again literally handed Dobby the Gillyweed.

#+end_quote

These are plot armor, and saying otherwise at all is just being dense. Harry literally stops an the unstoppable Killing Curse using a LITERAL Deus Ex Machina, and he only ever wins these 1v1s through plot armor. Voldemort only ever throws around that one curse at him if he's not trying to use the Cruciatus on him.

The Death Eaters aren't allowed to kill Harry, per Voldemort's orders, so obviously they're not throwing around crazy shit that they'd use on the Aurors/Order during the first war or whatever.

*** He won the Tournament because Voldemort was rigging it and he got outside help constantly.

He survives every end-of-the-year brush with death mostly through luck, other people's machinations and plot armor.

He stumbles through the first three years of his life in the Magical world without even bothering to find out how Voldemort's followers were called. Or his own /grandparents/.

Every year, it gets more and more clear Voldemort has a personal interest in him and he will hunt him down, and he never puts any effort into improving himself. On the contrary, he signs up for the easiest classes because he can't be bothered with the difficulty of Runes and Arithmancy.

Doesn't put any effort into Occlumency. Even though Snape is a shit teacher... fucking hell, not being allowed the privacy of your own thoughts?! That's horrible! Learning a way to protect your own brain would be the first thing anyone would do the moment they learn how many ways of controlling/entering someone's mind are.

Never uses his own assets, even as the nation turns increasingly hostile towards him.

​

Could go on and on, really. Like another comment said, I don't want, by any means, to imply he is inept. But all the potential he has, he constantly squanders through out the 7 books. He is just a slightly above average teen who gets unfairly thrust into something he should have never been involved in, but he never puts in any effort to help himself out.

Even the Patronus thing, which most people claim as an unquestionable feat of skill. The fact that every single one of the DA pulls it off actually devalues the spell, imo. Sure, you may argue that he explained it very clearly, but that just shows he could be a good teacher later on. The fact that everyone manages the spell only shows his colleagues had the same power level as he did. You can explain anything for years, if the student doesn't have the physical capability to do the task, it's futile.

If you go for a realistic take on the series, he should have been killed in the first book, when he gets the brilliant idea of battling an adult wizard.

*** - He is good in defence. His most impressive spell is the patronus charm, which he was forced to learn due to adverse circumstances. Most of the DA picked it up by the time they disbanded. He was indeed a good teacher and has above average power but his spell reportoire is still limited when compared to someone like Hermione.
- The tournament was rigged heavily in favor of Harry. Remember, Krum and Cedric performed impressive transfigurations and Fleur charmed the Dragon to sleep.
- Deatheaters weren't going all out were they? Voldemort couldn't allow that to happen. Snape practically kicked Harry's ass while he was fleeing after Dumbledore's death.
- It was a strange combination of Dumbledore's machinations, prophesy, luck that made Harry survive. Now compare Harry with the Marauder generation when they went to Hogwarts. They were doing animagi transformations, creating magical artefacts, spell creation, modifying potions. The Weasley Twins and Hermione ( the DA coins and roster) are the ones shown doing anything creative at all. Canon Harry just coasted through school. Admittedly there was this Dark lord shaped Sword hanging over his head, but still. I think this is the whole reason for the existence of the Indy!Harry trope.

**** Most of the DA didn't pick it up. That was in the movie. In the books it was just Luna, Cho, Hermione, Ginny and Ron. Ernie Macmillan cast it in the Battle of Hogwarts, over 2 years later. Also, Harry didn't just pick it up. He pretty much mastered it. He drove off a hundred dementors with it. Adult wizards and witches face difficulty in barely casting it. The only other guy to drive off a hundred at the same time was Aberforth Dumbledore, and he was called an extremely gifted wizard even when being compared to Albus, although not quite in his level. Also, Aberforth did it when he was 115+ years old. Harry did it when he was 13, nearly 14.

The tournament was rigged, yes. Doesn't change the fact that he summoned a broomstick from over a mile away. Cedric and Fleur were 2 years older than him. Also, the flashiest method isn't always the best. Fleur was taken out early on in the second task. Sure, water was unnatural or something for part-Veelas, but Harry was thoroughly unprepared for the task. She had Maxime's help.

Snape used Legilimency in their duel, and Harry's bad mental defences can be attributed to Snape's own shitty Occlumency teaching skills. Harry had already defeated Greyback and Amycus by that point. He also defeated Dolohov in the Ministry. Dolohov killed Lupin and dueled Moody for quite a while. And Dolohov was using his speciality, some lethal purple curse, Rabastan Lestrange tried to get off a Killing Curse, and Bellatrix was throwing out Cruciatus Curses.

***** Ron, who is a known slacker. Enough said. I won't argue about Harry's power level being above average. He was 13, but it was a necessity on his part to learn the charm due to the dementors and he practiced with Lupin for ages. Moody was handholding Harry through all the tasks. Sure, Krum and Fleur may have had support from their Heads but Cedric? He was the true champion. Narrowly defeated Greyback who don't carry a wand unlike others. Amycus was dueling Ginny and Harry took a potshot. A Dolohov who was then recently freed from long term imprisonment at Azkaban.

****** You should take that out of the summary and instead mention it in the authors note of the first chapter. While writing fanfiction isn't about the amount of readers you get get, you're probably missing out on a fair amount of people that assume it's a harem story and just skips it, if the comments here are anything to go by.

Multi!Harry is the best way to go though. It's quite unrealistic when Harry ends in with someone during his first year and ends up marrying her. Even book Harry ends up marrying his first girlfriend.
