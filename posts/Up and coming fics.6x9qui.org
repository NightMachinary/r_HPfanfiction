I'm looking for some up and coming stories that aren't finished yet but are being updated regularly and are fairly decent.

- At least 5 Chapters and 20,000 words

- Updated at least once a month

- Has an interesting idea or interesting twist on an old idea

I'm bored of reading the same thirty or so stories over and over and while this subreddit has a fairly large variety in its recs I still see the same fics being recommended all the time. I'm looking for some fresh blood.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** I've been enjoying A Quiet Mind. I'm not sure if it's on a monthly update schedule, but it's up to 13 chapters so far and deals with Ron in a PTSD situation. The author seems to have some real-life experience in this realm and the writing is pretty decent.

** If I can blow my own trumpet - I'm releasing on Ao3 at the moment (actually an old work massively revised). 10 chapters and 22,000 words, releasing fairly steadily. 20 years post-DH Harry finds an 11-year-old Tom Riddle and brings him back to the wizarding world - focused very much on the consequences of that on various characters, and the natural development of events from there.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
