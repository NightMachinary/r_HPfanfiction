Wondering if anyone can recommend a HHr fic where Harry and Hermione meet later in their school life i.e. one of them moves to hogwarts in 4th or 5th year or something OR they both go to Hogwarts first year but for whatever reason don't become friends until much later.

I've found a couple of stories like this so far: Feeling by Mister Barney: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7303431/1/Feeling]] What we're fighting for by James Spookie: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For]]

Also found one where Harry shows up in fouth year for the TWT (but he doesnt end up with hermione), The Fourth Champion by James Spookie: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7222456/21/The-Fourth-Champion]]

Anyone know of some others?

EDIT: also would prefer for them to be longer 30K+ stories.


** Here's one for you:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?
#+end_quote

Complete, 90k+ words. Basically Harry has not attended Hogwarts at all and shows up after the graveyard incident with Voldemort, terrified of magic.

** An annoying tendency I've found in these sorts of fics is that Hermione is invariably portrayed as basically useless and is not allowed to be happy or to achieve anything interesting until Harry enters her life (and, even after they meet, Harry usually does all the achieving anyway).

*BEGIN RANT*

Case in point, that /What We're Fighting For/ fic: while Harry is off growing his "magical core" and learning amazing wandless magic, Hermione has almost everybody in her year lining up to bully her, with the few that don't limiting themselves to merely ignoring and ostracizing her, all of which she passively accepts. (Correction: In the interests of accuracy, she did try to fight in some ill-defined past, but, unlike Harry, she wasn't allowed to actually win, so at the time the story begins, she does passively accept it.) She dates Krum in her fourth year, but he merely takes advantage of her and breaks her heart in the end, leaving her pining for a good man who would treat her right (which is where Harry comes in). Looking at what Krum does to her in some of the other fics linked in the thread, /she got off easy/.

Also, Ron is invariably Hermione's perennial bully, and is actually successful at it. Apparently, that time in canon that he made her cry once, early in their first year, with a remark that wasn't even directed at her or meant to be heard by her, after she had spent the prior two months thinking that he was her friend, means that his words have an Imperius-like power to make her wither any time he wants her to.

Oddly enough, in most of these fics, she is still excellent at magic, but, somehow, she never actually uses magic to actually improve her situation, at least until Harry shows up, at which point she still doesn't use it, because Harry fixes everything.

*END RANT*

With that rant out of the way, other than Kwan Li's work, are there any HP/HG fics where they don't meet and/or become friends until later, but where Hermione has agency, achievements, and dignity of her own before she meets Harry? (In other words, she doesn't have to be happy or fulfilled, but she isn't pitiful either, and if Harry had performed some badass feats in the meantime, her own feats should be comparable.)

*** I get where you're coming from. I'd very much like to read a story like this where Hermione is actually Hermione, even if she didn't end up making any good friends without Harry. It seems like a lot of authors take the crying in the bathroom episode in first year and extrapolate it out until Harry comes along.

In Feeling by Mister Barney, Hermione is getting along alright (if I remember correctly) and Harry is the 'loner', although she is unrealistically in awe of Neville because he vanquished Voldemort in 4th year, which felt OOC.

**** I tried reading that one. It's not as egregious as most fics of this kind, but it really is more of the same.

Harry, as far as I can tell, has a fairly well thought out back story both before and during Hogwarts, complete with a fairly original reason for the enmity between him and Ron and Neville, and the author had given a lot of thought to how his personality had evolved. He has drive and ambition (for all that he is a Huffelpuff), and it's shown, not just told; and he was, apparently, secretly involved in many of the BWL!Neville's triumphs. Dumbledore is worried about him going Dark.

Hermione, on the other hand, has no real personality or agency (with pretty much the only initiative of any kind that she shows being towards Harry), positive or negative. What has Hermione been up to in her four years in Ravenclaw? I suspect that the author doesn't know or even care. Her accomplishments are limited to getting good marks.

Then, the story is contrived to put her into situations where she needs to be helped, rescued, or avenged; and she never does anything about anything, with powerful!Harry being the one to go out and fix her problems once he is in her life, often without her knowledge.

In Chapter 3, we find out that Harry is practicing Wandless Magic (tm). In Chapter 4, Neville and Ron, believing that Hermione has been mind-controlled by Harry, confront her, with the the confrontation becoming physical, with Ron (of course) grabbing Hermione's arm. Now, wouldn't it have been useful if Hermione could use wandless magic to escape his grip long enough to draw her wand?

But, alas, only Harry gets to do Wandless Magic (tm) in these fics, so Hermione has to pull away with physical force only, which results in her falling down conveniently placed stairs, so that she could be well and truly avenged.

TL;DR: It's not as bad as other examples, but no, this fic doesn't really break the pattern.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], Neville replaces Harry in the Golden Trio but the main pairing is HHr, with hints of a Neville/Hermione/Harry triangle. Warning: I personally found the ending extremely depressing. Multiple main character deaths. 250k+ words.

EDIT: Same deal with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]]. Harry's brother is the BWL, HHr pairing, Ravenclaw!Harry. The story was almost removed from portkey.org because of how depressing the ending was, but the author caved and added a time-traveling prologue to appease readers. 200k+ words.

For something a little more fluffy, there's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7325][Teacher's Pet]]. AU, Hermione signs up for Auror training. Her instructor turns out to be yesterday's one night stand. HHr, R/L, Lavender/Charlie.

EDIT2: Almost forgot about [[/u/KwanLi]]'s fantastic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]]. Not completed but recently and steadily updated. Probably the best characterization of a competitive relationship between Harry and Hermione. Slytherin!Harry

*** Ravenclaw. Unsung Hero's Harry is in Ravenclaw. The ending is not the only thing that's depressing. Good story, though, even if it the writing is rather sketchy at times.

**** You're absolutely right. I assume you're referring to the "possession" episode? That really pushed me to finish the fic hoping there would be a nice ending, which only compounded my disappointment when I finished it.

**** For the most part, no. The first book functions as sort of an overview of Harry's life with Sirius, as well as giving a view of how events at Hogwarts play out in Harry's absence. It will give you background on all of the main characters, and set the stage for what's to come, but it doesn't contain very much crucial plot information.
