i've read a lot of time travel fics, and i have a fair few favourites such as ad infinitum and yesterday is tomorrow and sands of destiny, but most of them use the same plot and the same characters and tropes and i can only read "hermione goes back to the 70s and befriends the marauders by being smart and kind and standing up to them" or "hermione goes back to the 40s and interests tom riddle because shes smart and mysterious and doesn't fall for his act" so many times y'know? i do like a lot of those types of fic, but i also want to read ones with other main characters too, especially more uncommonly written ones. for instance my favourite thing about my favourite time travel fic is hermione being best friends with barty crouch jr and their friendship and interactions.

any ship is free game except snape, and any rare pairs or unique plots are especially appreciated. gen fic is okay as well if there's some nice friendships in it. above all i like well written fics, not ooc and full of cliches although i know what one person considers ooc another won't. ideally i'd like fics where she doesn't just resign herself to having to stick to the timeline and takes things into her own hands but i'll take what i can get.

I don't think I've ever read a fic quite like this one.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  (Complete) The love of the Minister's life disappeared just before the end of the First Wizarding War. When he finds her again, he can hardly trust his sanity. His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home. Hermione soon finds herself in the early 70s surrounded by future followers of the Dark Lord.

It's a Hermione x James fic which I think are pretty rare in comparison to how many Hermione/Sirius or Remus fica there are. Very interesting plot and one of my favorites.

  Hermione Granger thought that she could not possibly be surprised by anything anymore, but Theodore Nott arriving at the safe house with a perilous, last-ditch solution to the nearly-lost war against Voldemort isn't even the most unbelievable thing. The most unbelievable thing is that Theo is supposed to be dead. **The Order is losing the War. Most are dead and the ones remaining are sure to follow. Theodore Nott has a solution. Give up everything to win it all back. It's simply not the Slytherin way to run head-first at a problem, and Hermione is ready to try anything. His solution? A bit more cunning. It's one thing to run straight at the King and hope for the best, but perhaps the solution is to get rid of the pawns- one by one- first.
