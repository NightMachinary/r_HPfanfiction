There are numerous fics that give out titles like candy, but Harry himself never actually takes on the role of a responsible head of a family. Most of the time it's just a case of getting more political clout, money, property and some generic artifacts that are barely unique and are mostly left forgotten and unused. Oh, and he absolutely has to have a harem and is perfectly fine with it for some reason ('But it says so and I'm being forced into it!').

Have you read fics in which Harry discovers he's part of a long lost line that focus on: family magic texts from long forgotten ages, spells and magic manipulation techniques long thought lost (necromancy; demonology; druidism; the arcane; shamanism); artifacts other than the obligatory armor and sword, that are enchanted with unique properties or have roles attached to them (cursed ones that force you into a role, horcrux/holocron possessed ones, holy ones that guide you); or maybe maps or guidelines to ancient ruins or properties outside of this world. Perhaps Pendragon or some other legendary name from another culture (Egypt, Japan?), or maybe ancestry that isn't even from this particular universe or species. Preferably the money and political influence isn't a big factor, or at least doesn't play an important role so that Harry can't steamroll the opposition. Wouldn't it be cool if there is a stigma attached to the name that would make it's reveal counterproductive to spread publicly, or maybe responsibilities attached that require your attention or you risk dire consequences.

Preferably this would be through Lily's side of the family, because sorry but there's no way that the Potters would have missed something like that. Also it's fine if it's a fem!Harry fic.

TLDR: Discuss fics you came across in which Harry learns he's part of an ancient bloodline with a HISTORY that include good, bad, and maybe even horrible consequences. Family is something Harry has always wanted, so delving deeper into his roots and searching if there was something to his legacy transcending political influence and riches should be natural.


** No fics that meet your criteria come to mind at the moment, sorry. You've got me thinking of Hermione Granger & the Serpent's Renaissance, though. That's an ongoing story with Hermione being the reincarnated Salazar Slytherin (memories and all) who sets out as a 1st year Hogwarts student to restore his good name when it's been tarnished by ages and the death-eater movement.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet... Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar? (Reincarnation fic)

**** I just read it up to Chapter 12, and I must say, I'm extremely unimpressed.

The author doesn't just portray Dark Arts as acceptable, which is perfectly reasonable behavior; no, the author goes out of their way to make everyone absurdly easily convinced of such by Sally's largely lackluster arguments in favor of the dark arts. Furthermore, everyone in the story just goes along with whatever her plans require them to do, even when it involves going far out-of-character.

For instance, she convinces the extremely PR-conscious Lockhart to publicly give scripted lessons that make him look like a dark arts sympathizer. She does this by passing along a diary that purports to be communicating with Salazar Slytherin and offers a deal in which Slytherin writes his lessons for him; Lockhart does not question this extraordinarily suspicious situation and agrees immediately without further questions.

In short, I don't think Sally's ever been wrong or failed at anything in-story, even though her plans and speeches are in truth extremely shaky; the story's held together by duct tape and wishes, far past the point of even regular author fiat.

Ah typical Mary sue / self insert fic then: The protagonist goes on long winded rants that attempt to sound super smart... Of course they always turn out to be right, by the grace of +god+ the author. Yawn. The opposite is much rarer and much more interesting: A well reasoned and logical argument turns out to be wrong because, well sometimes it's just not good enough - no matter how smart. I doubt in the canon HP-world you could convince any significant percentage of the mainstream that the dark arts aren't all that bad even if you're Einstein and Machiavelli in one.

Well, you could go the simple way and make a subreddit specifically for this. You'd need a few people with some spare time to kickstart the whole thing, and a set of rules to make it easier for visitors to find reviews for whatever stories they are thinking about---and possibly tusing's cooperation with the FanfictionBot as I think it only works on the subreddits he sets it to work on---but I guess it could work.

She remembers her previous life as Salazar, with all his knowledge, powers, and issues.

Although Salazar was very successful in his previous life, he was somehow deeply unhappy, or else he would not have tried the very risky reincarnation ritual.

The Hermione in this story IS Salazar, although a 55 year old guy stuck in a girl's body was bound to experience changes later on. Year 1 and 2 went pretty smoothly for him/her, but Year 3 brought challenges.

I just think most authors don't really realize the ramifications? I think though that the ethical problem is slightly reduced if you take-over/return to your own body, because you can at least try to make some informed argument: "Would I consent to this if I could explain to myself that this is necessary in order to defeat Voldemort / achieve world peace / save the universe?". Unless I became insane or had some kind of traumatic experience I'd trust myself enough to make such a decision for myself.
