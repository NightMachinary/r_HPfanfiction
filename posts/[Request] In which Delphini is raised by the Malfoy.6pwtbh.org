Hi! I have currently started to read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, because I want to make my own opinion of it. However, I am slightly familiar with the plot already (god bless wiki), and one thing just doesn't make any sense to me: Why wasn't Delphini raised by the Malfoy? They are a loving family despite all of their faults, and Narcissa and Bellatrix were extremely close. It doesn't make sense to me that Narcissa would abandon her niece. SO, I'd like to see a fic where she ends up being raised by the Malfoy, and the effect it would have on her 'brother' Draco and 'Nephew' Scorpius. Thanks! =3


** You know, it would have been a much better ending if they'd went back in time once more and rescued Delphi as a baby and gave her to a family that could love her. It would have paralleled the beginning of the first Harry Potter book too.

*** I hadn't even thought about that but I totally agree. Letting Harry be an orphan is one thing, its what was NEEDED to have Voldemort die later on. Delphi though? I seriously doubt anything bad would have happened from giving her to a happy, loving familly.

**** It's not what you asked but in linkffn(the augurey) Harry rescues Delphi and raises her as his own because he feels guilty about the death of her parents (only Harry could think something like that!) Hermione also is very involved in their lives.

** A story focusing on Delphini finding out about her heritage and struggling to find out what this means for her, would be way more interesting than what we got. Also, considering that the Malfoy´s would do anything possible to remove themselves from anything that connects them to Voldemort after the war, I wouldn´t think it´s out of character to remove a liability in that endeavor. Though the question is if Narcissa even knew about her, even with what I said before this must´ve been a hard decision, again if she knew. I would argue she would be most interesting as an orphan, out of a bad family finding out about her heritage, there could be an interesting story about how she reacts to that, being torn between defying her heritage or embracing it and following in their parents footsteps. She is a way to intriguing concept to waste her as lame villain for a mediocre story.
