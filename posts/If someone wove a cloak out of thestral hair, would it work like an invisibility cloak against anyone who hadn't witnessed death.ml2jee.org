Or do you think thestral body parts become visible after detaching from the animal?

I don't know, just thinking thoughts and am wondering if anyone has addressed this sort of thing in a fic before.


** Presumably, the cloak would be invisible, but you'd be able to see whoever was wearing it just fine.

Then again, that's how I'd expect a cloak made of demiguise hair to work too. Invisibility cloaks make no damn sense, possibly it's magic.

*** The real invisiblity cloak harry has is the oppisate, you can see it fine when its off (It is discribed as being a silvery fabric I think) and when you put it on you cant see anything at all.

** I think it's more likely that it would be transparent to anyone who hasn't witnessed death and opaque to someone who has.

OK, now I want to see a crack fic in which someone's clothes get replaced by identical-looking ones made of thestral hair. The victim of this prank has, of course, seen death.

After some random citizens call in the indecent exposure, the hit-wizards who arrive can't find this alleged streaker, since obviously everybody is fully dressed.

**** Sure! I'd be interested in reading the result as well. (Or, does "personal" mean that he doesn't intend to post it anywhere?)

** Presumably the cloak is invisible, but whatever it's covering isn't. It'd be a cool jacket material for showing off warm-weather outfits in winter, but not for sneaking around.

** Depending on the treatment of the hair afterward. Regular invisibility cloaks are made from Demiguise hair, which can switch their invisibility at will and eventually lost the ability after few years. Since Thestrals appear to be permanently invisible while living, we can presume that even if the hair becomes visible when separated from the animal, magical treatments can activate that ability for at least a few years. Since Thestrals hair core so far are only seen on the Elder Wand, it's also possible that they might last longer than regular cloak from Demiguise hair.

** I personally headcannon that all of the Hallows are made out of thestrals in some way (thestral hair core, thestral bone fragment, thestral hair woven with demiguise hair) to explain how the 'death' theme came into being in the first place.

** Thestrals look like bats, especially their wings. I doubt their hair covers their whole body, and the whole creature is invisible, so maybe you'd want a Thestral leather cloak?

I like to think that they would retain their magical properties, so i'm leaning towards yes, you are able to make an selective invisibility cloak with it. But it's fanfiction, you can do whatever you want.

** Well I think the cloak would be invisible but you would be visible. So no one will see the cloak over yourself
