I read a fic that I loved a month or so ago and I can't find it anymore. It was a time travel fic, where Hermione flips over an hourglass and ends up in the Marauder era until all the sands fall through the glass. She ends up becoming friends with/in a relationship with Snape, he takes her home for Christmas to meet his mother, and they fall in love. She returns (unwillingly) to the Trio-era but is sad and heartbroken, until Severus admits he still remembers her. This isn't my usual ship so I don't have any idea where I came across it (maybe GrangerEnchanted or AO3).
