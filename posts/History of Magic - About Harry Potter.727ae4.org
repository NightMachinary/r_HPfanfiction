Let's say Binns doesn't talk only about goblin wars, okay? And students do learn recent history including Harry Potter's legend/story/something.

I want fics where on a lesson students are taught about Harry Potter. Even better if Harry Potter himself has to listen to this crap and write a test about himself. I read a fic once with these requests. I [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkNHAkMXTDEvFDHLyFbEtX8xbD9qYvPwsvHBmYivXjQ/edit?usp=sharing][quoted it]] and google-translated it for those who are interested. Though I corrected only the obvious mistakes so beware.

Something similar?
