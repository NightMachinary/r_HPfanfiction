I having a very hard time finding one. This has so much potential in the political and war issues within the series. How come I can't find one?


** I think i saw it somewhere else on this reddit, but since the Weasley's were trying for a girl, if Ron (or the twins) had been born a girl, they would have likely been named Ginny and had no younger siblings.

Of course, that doesn't stop GenderBent!Ron, or RonNamedGinny, but it does change the dynamic a bit

Or maybe Arthur and Molly just couldn't keep it in their pants.

**** Pretty sure it is cannon. It is part of Ron's inferiority complex. It might just be all in his head, but even so, missing that part of his character would be a pretty significant character change.

If you want a female Ron without too much backstory change, I think you are stuck with whole-weasley-family changes (such as the whole universe change such as distaff linkffn(3894793)) or magical gender transformation, where Ron magically becomes a girl for one reason or another.

I know there are a few trio-gender bends out there but I think they gloss over the backstory changes

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

** The only female Ron story I remember off-hand is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl]["Weasley Girl"]], but I don't think that it features that pairing.
