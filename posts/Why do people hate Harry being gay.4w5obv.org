** Two reasons:

1) Most people don't hate Harry being gay. They're just not gay and so don't like reading slash.

2) Slash fics have a reputation and tendency towards being shitty and generally just being an excuse to write the pairing.

Not everyone dislikes gay Harry, though. There are plenty of people on this sub that like slash.

As opposed to het fics, which are all the pinnacle of solid plot and good writing. /s

To be honest, the real reason is your number one. This might be crass, but many readers can overlook the shittiness of het fics because they can (literally or figuratively) get off on them. Without that factor, slash and to a lesser extent femslash fics are held to a higher standard by potential readers.

I'm just saying that the discrepancy between the (slash fics)/(homosexual fics) ratio and the (PWP het)/(gen fic) ratio can partly be explained by just how many more gen fics there are compared to fics that explicitly discuss a character's homosexuality (what I called "homosexual fic"). Wow, this terminology is confusing.

******** That's because all the characters in canon are straight. If there's no romance in the story, there's little reason to alter the characters.

EDIT: Fine, we assume almost all the main characters are straight because most have been shown to be attracted to the opposite sex, there's no evidence that they're attracted to the same sex, and only a very small percentage of people are bisexual. I admit there is a small chance one of the main characters is bisexual enough to have a gay relationship. I maintain that the chances are small enough that portraying any single character in that way is an alteration to the character.

Also, given that such a small percentage of people are gay, spacehurps comment is irrelevant because only a couple percent of non-romance fics would have a gay main character, anyway.

No, if you really wanted to correct it you'd write something closer to "That's because all the characters in canon are assumed to be straight due to overwhelming evidence that they are attracted to the opposite sex, an absence of evidence that they are attracted to the same sex, and the statistical unlikelihood of any single character being bisexual."

*********** First off, we're in exactly one person's head, so we know the sexuality of exactly one person. After all, there are more sexualities than just "gay" and "straight". Secondly there are named characters whose relationship status we have no idea of (as far as I know) when the series ends, so you can't even use that to judge that they're straight.

************ We have absolutely no indication that almost any main character is anything other than straight, while we are absolutely certain that most of them are attracted to the opposite sex, at least. Given that and the very small percentage of people who are bisexual, I think it's fair to say that for most Harry Potter characters, it's an alteration to their character to portray them as gay.

Excepting Dumbledore and Sirius, I can't think of a single significant character that we don't know is attracted to the opposite sex.

As for your edit, "everyone" doesn't matter, we're talking about the larger scale here. 99% of stories are about one of the "main characters." I don't care about the few side characters that are mostly irrelevant and that we don't know the sexuality of.

***** What? First of all, that is an obvious trap. Sexual orientation is neither a personality trait nor a physical characteristic. Second, how is that relevant? Harry is straight in canon. Period. Any homosexual feelings, tendencies, thoughts, dreams you give Harry while in the framework of JKR's canon makes Harry OOC.

This is not a debate about slash in general. PsychoGeek specifically said "OOC isn't really my thing". All I'm saying is that a gay Harry is OOC based on the books.

Write/read what you will. It's the beauty of fanfiction to turn characters from what they are into what we wish they were. I personally enjoy fanfics where Harry is more studious and proactive from an early age. These are OOC as well.

****** Oh no worries, I'm not trying to trap you. This is a meaningful discussion and I respect your viewpoint. To me, it all depends on whether making a character gay/straight affects the way they behave - as far as I understand it, radically different personality/behavior characterizes OOCness. A homosexual Harry who suddenly loves the Dark Arts and praises Voldemort = OOC.

** I'll answer as someone who generally isn't a fan of gay Harry (but don't take that as being anti-slash, so bare with me). For me, it simply falls down to the fact that the books are written from Harry's POV and we happen to know he isn't gay. I am a stickler for keeping characters in character and I find changing a characters sexuality as changing a core aspect of a character. I also tend to dislike gay Harry stories because most go with the "he just woke up gay" idea. If you change his sexuality over time, I am more keen to the idea because the "woke up" version seems to create the idea of sexuality being a choice.

That being said, no one should ever tell anyone else that they "can't" change a character's sexuality. There aren't a ton of LGBT characters out there, so the ability to alter characters to give them to us is a crucial part of fanfic. Just do it well!

** I really like Gay Harry, but I know it's not canon. We know that Harry in the series is not exclusively gay. On the other hand we don't know either if he's exclusively straight. Yes, he has two straight relationships but in the books, which are from Harry's POV, he describes male character beauty as well.

So hell yeah we need more male pairings for Harry (Bisexual Potter FTW), but most stories are shit (which I've read quite a few knowing they are shit and still enjoyed) or PWP (which I enjoy but I'm a bisexual male). Also there are good stories with crazy pairings (funnily enough I love LV/HP but I hate SS or LM) which I don't want to read. And neither do the rest of readers.

Bring more slash stories with less focus on the pairing!!

** Harry is the viewpoint character, and readers often identify with and even imagine themselves as that character. Your average female reader putting themselves into the male viewpoint may feel comfortable with having that character expressing appreciation for other male characters, but for male readers they have been taught from an early age to suppress in themselves and ridicule in others any sexual desire or affection for other males.

I don't get the sense that female readers have been taught to suppress or ridicule any intimate feelings for other women in quite the same way. In fact the male-centric storytelling trends will most likely have inured them to the dissonance that might be induced when imagining themselves in the opposite gender role.

I never realized this is a common approach. Since you mentioned female readers potentially not minding a gay male perspective, do you think there is a similar hurdle for male readers reading fiction with a female POV (especially a female character in a heterosexual relationship), or do you think it's mainly a sexuality-based thing?

**** I would say there is a similar but lesser hurdle. A male reading a female perspective understands that women do what women do, and may not be as prone to "inserting themselves into the story", while they might be more likely to identify and self insert with a male character, and so the relationship with another male character might squick them out more.

I'm just speculating, though, I'm bi so I simply do not have this problem.

** Well, you can't really say I "hate Harry being gay", since he is confirmed to be heterosexual in canon. I do avoid slash fics in general (got an addon, where I can add a slash filter), because I am het, and it's just weird for me to read a slash fic, as I can't associate with that person. Plus most slash pairings are Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco, or Harry/Voldemort, and I find those disgusting with Snape being 20 years older, Draco is a ferret (lol) and Voldemort is your number one fcking enemy! With that being said, I have nothing against gay people, it's just not my cup of tea in stories. Although I do read a lot of het fics, I tend to stick to those, where romance is only scratched and a background plot. I prefer Gen fics, that focus rather on the actual plot than spending every second chapter on teenage angst and their love life.

** I think people often mistake the hate for slash as hate for gay people in general, which isn't usually the case. The problem with slash is that it seems most of it is written by young teenage girls. As we all know, 99% of stories written by teenagers are awful.

They don't write stories for them to be read, they write them as wish-fulfillment. There's nothing wrong with that, per say, but it annoys people because it clusters up page after page when you're searching for something decent to read, and the filters never catch everything.

Personally, I hate Harry being gay because being gay isn't a choice. You are, or you are not. Harry isn't. Dumbledore is gay, so I hate it when he's married to a woman (usually McGonagall, and usually an indicator of a terrible story).
