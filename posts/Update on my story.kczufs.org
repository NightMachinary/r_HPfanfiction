I know I've posted here before but my story â€˜What Are We Supposed To Do Now?' is now on chapter 4!

Also, you can now find it on fanfiction.net

It is a Harry/Lavender story where they end up traveling back in time to the 1940s and meet Tom Riddle.

All criticism is welcome!

Thank you <3


** Harry/Lavander? Huh, that's not a pairing one sees often.

So far seems quite nice. Keep up the good work!
