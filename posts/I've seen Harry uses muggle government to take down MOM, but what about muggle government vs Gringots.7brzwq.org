Seriously, when I think about all the tax laws and and banking regulations that exist I realized that Gringots probably only has any cooperation and treaties with MOM as a sovereign nation not with Muggle Governments. Which means they probably are massively violating all sorts of laws.

So has anyone come across any of those type of stories?


** Justice, Justice You Shall Pursue by White Squirrel. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue]]. Harry isn't using the Muggle government, the Muggle government does it all themselves.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** But poor goblins are opressed and misunderstood minority, it's only right that the much more civilised and cultured muggles will support them so they can get free from the opression of this, basically Victorian, wizarding society.
