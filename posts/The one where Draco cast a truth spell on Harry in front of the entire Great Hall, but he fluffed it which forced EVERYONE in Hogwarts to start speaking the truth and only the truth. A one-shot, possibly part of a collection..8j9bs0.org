#+TITLE: The one where Draco cast a truth spell on Harry in front of the entire Great Hall, but he fluffed it which forced EVERYONE in Hogwarts to start speaking the truth and only the truth. A one-shot, possibly part of a collection.

I know this one fairly well, but I can't remember where it is. It was set in 5th year, Umbridge appears of course, and...yeah, the title, Draco Malfoy tries casting a truth-telling spell on Harry Potter in front of the entire Great Hall (Dumbledore goes NOOOO!), to try and expose him as a liar, but a flaw in the language he uses makes it so that Harry /radiates/ truth instead, so that everyone within a massive radius of Hogwarts is forced to tell the truth.

Punchlines include Umbridge accidentally admitting to something incriminating, and Voldemort killing the Malfoys so they can't spill the beans on where he is.

I hope I'm including enough information in the title.

--------------

Additional notes: It's Snape who explains to Draco (and the reader) afterwards just what the spell he tried to cast on Harry did.

The fic is on Fanfiction.net, not Archive of our Own or any other sites.


** I found it! Searching for 'Malfoy truth spell fanfiction "Nooo!"' and adding an O to the Nooo every time eventually found it: It's TheBeardedOne's /Little Whinging Pet Shop/, chapter 21.

Regular expressions, the manual version.

Here's to hoping the fic is actually fun.

This makes absolutely no sense. Draco Malfoy is one of the few people who knows for certain that Harry is telling the truth. He would be the last person who would want to magically confirm that, because Voldemort would be pissed.

*** That is a bit odd, but nonetheless, it's definitely Draco who casts the spell. I'm also not sure why Dumbledore would go NOOOOO!, but I'm sure that's in the fic too. It's also Snape who explains to Draco just how he mucked up the spell.

*** I haven't read it, but maybe he was trying to get him to admit something embarrassing, or even damning (about the Order)?

*** It paints him as an idiot, actually it paints Umbridge also as an idiot who doesn't understand the consequences, it is just an idea but not developed thoroughly.

** Only one chapter!? I've been robbed!

Disappointing that the writer still managed to bash Ronald in such a short story.

*** ...What bashing? I don't see any bashing. Not of Ron at least, there's a decent amount of Slytherins-are-dumb.
