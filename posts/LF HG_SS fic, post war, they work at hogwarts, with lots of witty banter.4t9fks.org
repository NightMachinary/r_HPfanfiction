  Post-Hogwarts, Hermione is the Potions Apprentice, and Severus is still Headmaster. If they don't hex each other first maybe they'll find comfort in one another.

*** A few years I think ? Hermione worked at Hogwarts but I don't remember if she studied at a university or not, so it could be 2-6 years after the war, I don't know. Also, the fic wasn't extremely long I think, maybe 30000 words.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.
