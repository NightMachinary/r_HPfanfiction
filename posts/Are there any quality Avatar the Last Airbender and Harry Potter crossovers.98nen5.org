*** Actually a fusion instead of a crossover (the two worlds are merged), but yeah, the best HP/Avatar story ever. I messaged the author a year or two back about the story's state of abandonedness and they insisted it's merely on hold and they fully intend to finish it some day. Which, you know, is hopeful.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]
