Most stories seem to follow one of two reasons foor giving Harry a harem.

Either Harry is somehow forced to have a harem due to magical bonds or marriage contracts. Alternatively Harry gains a harem because girls can't help but fall in love with him, and nobofy wants anyone to get hurt.

So is there any story where Harry intentionally gets in a relationship with multiple people?


** Sounds like Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

** Bonus points if he forms a harem for someone else?

I don't think anything like that was ever written. Like Harry decides to use his fame to get Ron multiple girlfriends because he keeps complaining.

Would almost have to be a comedy
