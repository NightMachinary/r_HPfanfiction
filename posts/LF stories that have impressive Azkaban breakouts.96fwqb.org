What the title says. It doesn't necessarily have to be Azkaban, any prison or cell is OK as long as it's magical.


** Well, I'm not sure how impressive you will find it but linkffn(Elizium for the Sleepless Souls by Voice of the Nephilim) is literally /just/ about the break-out from Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** I can't believe no one has mentioned linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) yet. Not only was actual break into azkaban amazing, the motivations and build up to the prison break was some of the best writing I've read.

It didn't feel like some random idea that popped up because the stations of canon demanded it, there was this tangible build up to it with character motivations and developments based upon the previous years. The idea of it didn't feel forced to me and it didn't feel like Harry made a leap in logic or did something out of character like in some fics. More than anything, it felt like a natural progression in the story that ultimately lead to the events at Azkaban.

Also, they're breaking into one of the most dreadful and heavily guarded prisons in the magical world, a /magic/ prison with /magic/ guards that can devour your souls, the characters should feel the pressure, and in turn, the readers should feel the tension as well and I think this fic really nailed it. Also, unlike in some fics, this Harry doesn't just go along with the random idea of breaking into Britain's worst prison because someone said one of the prisoners were innocent without any proof really.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
