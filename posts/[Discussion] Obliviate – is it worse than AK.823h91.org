In the stories I often read a very casual use of obliviation. At some point I started to wonder if the authors truly understand what they are doing?

In my opinion "Obliviate" is an ultimate crime against a human being, because it messes with the core thing that makes us who we are -- our memories. AK just kills a person like any other offensive spell can.

Example with Lockhart shows that it can easily destroy a personality and possibly soul: when Lockhart dies and would be called with Resurrection Stone, how will his shadow behave?

Also it makes possible a dream of any rapist: rape-heal-obliviate. Repeat as you want, no one will ever notice and investigate.

Am I missing something? May be it's not as bad as I think?

[Edit]: it was pointed here that Obliviate spell is taught in [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Standard_Book_of_Spells,_Grade_2][2nd year]] to 12-13 year old teenagers in (pre-) puberal period.

Except, well, we know from canon that souls exist. Therefore, it is highly likely that the Wizarding World considers the soul as the core of a being and therefore would be far more cavalier than Muggles when it comes to the "sanctity/importance" of memory to the notion of self.

Now that that is out of the way, there is evidence that Memory Charms are either reversible, or able to be cast in a way that is reversible. For example, consider the Grangers. That kind of memory alteration is, to me at least, a clear example of a reversible or removable Memory Charm. Though of course we have to consider the opposing case: Bertha Jorkins. Bertha, as you probably remember, went cuckoo for cocoa puffs when the Memory Charm upon her was broken. Of course, that may be a difference between reversing/removing a charm and breaking one.

Frankly, my headcanon is that the Memory Charm is a legally restricted charm, restricted to Obliviators in service to the Ministry who spend their time modifying the memories of Muggles who have witnessed magic. Unauthorized use would most likely be considered assault and/or battery.

Separate from all my above ramblings: Lockhart is a poor example, as if Lockhart wasn't used Ron's utterly fucked up wand, the spell would never have backfired and permanently left him as an adult with an infantile mind.

*** This. It's notable that Lockhart still likes to sign things after obliviation. It removes your memories but it doesn't change who you are, which in HP is a much more fundamental thing than your mind.

Still a pretty devastating injury if someone removes a significant part of your memories, but no, not equivalent to death.

Despite banging on about the importance of choice, JKR actually set up an extremely deterministic system which has been described as Calvinist, in that certain people are "the chosen'. Some people are just fundamentally good and others are fundamentally bad. It's a part of a soul-deep personality.

So Harry remains fundamentally good regardless of what he goes through and regardless of how many times he uses torture curses. Meanwhile Voldemort only has the choice to redeem himself in theory. In actual fact his nature is such that he would never make that choice.

The way JKR thinks about these things was revealed on her old website:

#+begin_quote
  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). *Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself*; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, *of course*, he refused to feel remorse.
#+end_quote

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104945/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=122]]

That's rather telling. In the HP world the capacity for goodness is a tangible quality which can be transfered magically. Some people have it and others... don't.

To tie this all back into the obliviation point, the way JKR clearly sees people in the HP universe (and maybe real life...) is that they have a fundamental character which is disconnected from their experiences and memories, their physical condition, etc. It is just who they are. People have free will so they have the ability to choose to act contrary to their character, but "of course" people don't actually do that. People act according to who they are.

**** My headcanon is that Lockhart and company will be totally okay in the Afterlife. See, I think Obliviate only erases the memory from the physical brain, but not from the soul; the soul has a perfect recall of everything, which can only be accessed upon death, or, if you want to use it on Earth, thanks to a Pensieve. This is also how it is possible to "unlock" memories that had been Obliviated, and why it's so dangerous: it requires tampering with the very soul of the patient.

That's a really interesting point and probably part of why I didn't like The Cursed Child. I'm not completely opposed to the idea of Voldemort having a kid, but Delphi was basically destined to be evil. I should write something with a non-evil Delphi. I like the idea that characters can change.

***** I think you're struggling to reconcile a real-world physicalist/materialist understanding of identity with the HP system. This is doomed to failure. The HP system is unapologetically dualist. A person's identity, their essential self, has nothing (or little) to do with their brain or their memories. It is (one supposes) their soul.

As for how that essential character manifests, it does so in the decisions you make, your habits, the things you like doing, the people who you like to associate with, your moral compass, etc.

Example with Grangers is a good one.

Hermione temporary "killed" personalities of her parents and created an absolute others -- Wilkins. If Hermione died in the war, what memories would her parents souls have? Would they remember their daughter and life as Grangers in their afterlife? If they would, what is about clash between their old and new personalities?

Maybe Muggles in the story are unrealistic, but it sure seems that every time they are given a slither of power over wizards, they seem hell-bent on destroying them.

********* I gotta give [[/u/Quoba]] this much:

If we assume that Hermione did not even attempt to persuade her parents to leave the country without the use of magic, then the Obliviation seems an extremely callous a method. After all, if she tells them "Leave Britain, the wizards - me included - are about to go to war and I'd feel better if you're far, far away from that." and her parents would refuse, the Obliviation is still an option.

I've seen quite a few headcanons around this issue. I personally assume that Hermione did try, but ultimately failed to get through to her parents. Hermione can be rather brutal and vindictive, but she never is so towards the people she deeply cares about. Just judging from her character I would think Obliviation is a last resort for her.

*********** I never tackled leaving the country at all, but rather the difference between a scenario in which this obliviation would be a last resort, and a scenario in which it would have been a callous walking on an easy path.

Because it's not just "sparing them worry and grief". On the other side of that double edged sword stands an /extreme/ breaking of trust. To delete a core part of their entire being - their daughter - from their memory and lifes, is unimaginably brutal. At first there would be no hole. The Grangers would live their life in Australia, happy and child-less. Where the true problems arise is when they get their memories back. How could they trust their daughter ever again? What tells them that she even is their daughter? If she can erase the one memory, why shouldn't she be able to create the other? Are they even the Grangers, or does this /witch/ only want them to forget they were who all these papers say they were? How can you trust this being of so unimaginable powers that, if what she says is true, has used those powers once to make you forget /your own daughter/.

This action of Hermione's carries so much consequence with it, that I always came to the conclusion it would have been a last resort for her, in order to keep her stubborn parents alive. Because I'm sure that Hermione would think through the consequences and arive at the same "How could they ever trust me again?" questions. I'm sure that had they been willing to stay out of this and flee, any worry and grief would have been preferable to the insurmountable rift between Hermione and her parents after they regained their memories.

I'm convinced, too, that BC, Sr., got his memory charm wrong. I think that instead of being too strong, it was too broad. He wasn't precises enough in his casting and that's why she was so forgetful. He memory-charmed too many things away.

** The real question is, of course, if the soul is truly affected by an Obliviation or if it retains it's healthy state in the afterlife if no damage was done to it by the person themselve.

I personally don't think the concept of the soul in Harry Potter is so easily damaged. It takes much to channel it, breaking it is the worst of the worst of magic, and having it devoured the highest form of punishment in the wizarding world.

So assuming the soul stays intact in the afterlife, the Obliviate is less morally deplorable than the Avada Kedavra. The one removes your personality from the mortal plane, but still grants you a life as someone else (or a heavily modified version of yourself). The Avada Kedavra takes your life from you and never even gives you the chance to explore mortal life.

If, however, the Obliviate damages the soul and therefore the person for all eternity, then the Avada Kedavra is definitely less bad then a strong Obliviate.

Entirely depends on how you want to interpret all this.

** From a personal standpoint no it is not as bad, potential for abuse doesn't make a thing bad on it's own.

An argument from fear

A dog could bite. If a dog bites it is bad. So all dogs are bad

Obliviation could be abused. If abuse happens it is bad. Obliviation is bad.

Not to say your points aren't valid, any character who uses Obliviation without some sort of strict training is clearly comitting reckless magical endangerment. But more like playing with a knife not committing a heinous crime in and of itself.

Most magic is portrayed like that. A knife can cut up some vegetables for dinner, it can kill someone, and you can use it to skin someone alive.

But the AK is bad because it can only be used to kill, I highly doubt you could use AK as some sort of mercy killing tool like unplugging a terminally ill patient. Since it's labeled "dark" and most dark magic is assumed to require a desire to harm or some other negative emotion.

The Santi had my favorite take on Dark Magic, you used a spell with an emotion like hatred and that not only enhanced the effects of the spell it made them have lingering effects and harder to remove.

It was a stronger spell, but it requires a certain mindset. And that is why dark magic was bad, not because of the effect but because it implied something about the mindset of the user.

...

From a rape, obliviate, repeat standpoint, hmm I suppose if I wrote it used as such... the lingering effects would clue you in on the fact that something has happened. The the feeling you get around the person who committed the act would definitely clue you in.

Going back to my dog example, if you were mauled by a dog as a 4 year old. You probably don't actually remember the incident. But you could fear dogs for the rest of your life, that small jolt in your spine whenever you don't have a chance to prepare yourself.

So perhaps it is my view on memory that makes it seem less terrible in my eyes. If Obliviate was so powerful that it could reset someone so easily, then I'd say it was much worse.

...

I could think of much much worse uses for spells and potions. For example Cheering charm or Imperius but not in the way you think. I could cast it softly, the same way you could vary light Lumos gives you.

Every time I see a person I like, I cast it just a bit. So that they feel euphoria and happiness every time they see me.

Get them literally addicted to my presence, instead of using a love potion that needs to be reapplied like Ms. Riddle. Just condition them to feel a certain way around me. And without using commands, they'd never notice I was using it on them.

An honest mercy killing to me? Hermione was just lit on fire, burned down to bone in some places. While in terrible agony she asks Harry to kill her.

He would do it, but can you see him using the AK?

Like... casting a Patronus you can be pretty drained of happy. But you only need just enough to use it properly.

...

Well there's Obliviation as a choice, say you got Crucio cast on you for an hour. You survive, maybe take a chunk of that suffering away. It probably wouldn't save Neville's parents because that looks more like brain damage from their nervous system misfiring. But maybe help Harry sleep better after some Tom Torture?

Or an actual Imperus victim even, you could leave them with the knowledge of what they've done if they wanted.

Maybe remove visceral memory of say, being caught then strangling their squib son or something during a Death Eater attack because of mind control.

Not everyone is Harry Potter levels of willpower in their bank to resist mental effects.

There is the obvious maintaining Stature of Secrecy. Imagine if they had to do so without the memory charm?

They'd be forced to either kidnap witnesses, or make sure they are labeled insane, or even torture to make them so afraid to ever speak about magic.

I think Michael said it best. "You forget a thousand things every day. Make sure this is one of them."

Just look at X-Men, people don't really like when a section of people are just straight up better than you.

Sure it's kind if a dick move to take away memory, but the alternatives for the average person are terrible. What use it is to know of magic if you aren't part of the world? And can't talk about it with anyone?

"Crocodiles ridges and bumps that make them intimidating are actually so that when they swim through the water they don't make ripples." This knowledge is useful if you encounter a crocodile, or are near water in Australia.

But otherwise doesn't affect your life. Especially if your life has nothing to do with crocodiles.

So if I erased it, sure knowing about it before hand you'd be offended at the loss. But really what use what it that the Magical World exists?

Now this doesn't mean I'm advocating muggle people who get raped by witches or wizards are better off not knowing. I'm saying remove the magic, and put away or kill the perpetrator.

Because the lingering effects without cause could lead to mental breaks. And I've always hated cruelty.

But knowing they were raped by a person with magical powers who could teleport, and nothing they do could ever stop them? That magic let then use you as a puppet and forced feeling upon you til they got bored of you?

I don't think that knowledge that magic exists helps the victims then. Just leaves then even more paranoid than an already traumatized person. Wild claims of magic just dismissed by their family and friends as hallucinations from trauma.

***** Using AK on your best friend to end his/her suffering? Probably not.

Professional Healer using AK to give a painless death to end suffering? Sure. In that case AK looks more humane than most of the other methods.

Snape and Dumbledore is a long and complex off-topic here. I'll just say that I don't agree with you.

I can see and accept when Obliviation is used by special trained people in special and supervised circumstances.

But as it was pointed this spell is taught to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Standard_Book_of_Spells,_Grade_2][12-13 year old children]].

****** Hmm the fully trained Healer is a very interesting train of thought. As I've always seen it as AK as truly desiring the death of someone without any hesitation.

That would in fact be an amazing tool, though you could probably cast some sort of sleeping spell and just slow the heart gently. Most fiction don't really delve into medical magic techniques. I think the Dykstra shuffle is the only one I can remember? Maybe there's more in something I haven't read.

Though a Professional Healer wearing goggles with a solemn face... and then casting Bombarda Maxima is a hilarious image.

...

I had in fact totally forgotten that Obliviation is available that early on. While terrible, the fact that it aids in getting away with your scenario doesn't make it the cause.

The same can and is accomplished plenty easy without memory charms in the normal world.

You still have to be terrible enough to be willing to commit the act, which to me is the real issue. Not that they have an easier time covering it up.

The best way (well besides wiping out all knowledge) to make sure it isn't abused is to create ways to defend against it. Maybe that orb thing Neville has, give it charmed to detect Obliviation and check every week or so.

Like that nail polish that detects date rape drugs in drinks. You can't stop people from trying in bars at this point try as society might, but we're getting closer.

Not fool proof but every bit helps right?

...

Also keeping knowledge restricted won't stop people from abusing it. Polyjuice Potion could be used to abuse malleable victims by turning then into whoever you actually wanted to abuse.

Young boys into sexy teenage girls, I remember vaguely some scene in a fic where Harry sleeps with the Patil twins and it ends up being the Creevey Brothers who have been stalking him.

While kinda funny and portrayed as such, it really highlights how easy it would be once you had your hands on Polyjuice.

Maybe teenage girls take Potter for a spin since they want some chosen one in their diet. I always wondered about Romilda...

But Hermione not only knew about it (even if the recipe was in the restricted section) she was able to brew it in second year. I'm not saying it was easy, but even if Obliviation was a seventh year spell and in the restricted section. Deviant, hormonal, and cruel teenagers would find and use it.

How?

Obliviate removes memories of a rape or any other sexual (or humiliating) violence. Other spells easily heal physical damage and remove the evidence. If a victim doesn't remember the rape and there's no other evidences there's nothing to report.

Polyjuice Potion can be abused too. But works just an hour and requires some actor skills from an imposer. Can be compared with using drugs in order to make a victim to be agreeable. Horrible, but not to the same extent.

******** Ahh my apologies I was unclear, I didn't mean it wasn't easier to get away with abuse in the magical world as opposed to the mundane.

I meant the same people who would use the memory charm to cover their tracks. Would do the same even if the memory charm didn't exist, or were born without magic.

The abuse would still happen, but with the charm they can erase their tracks nearly perfectly.

...

That was why I brought up better ways to defend against it some analogue to the nail polish.

If it can be reversed, it is not removing memory just making you forget it is there. Which is an important distinction.

An altered Rememberal could be used. The red smoke for stuff you should remember, there must be some limit on how recently you've forgotten something or it would be red all the time. Black smoke for recent memory charms detected then.

Slap a bunch of orbs on door knobs to commonly used rooms or something, and you've got an alert that something has happened in the last 24 hours.

Maybe the Charms classrooms? Since a charms master would most likely be able to remove it.

********** True, but since the Obliviation charm exists. Creating some kind of detection puts the inevitability of punishment back to normal. Instead of the free pass if protections don't exist at all.

If I assume those protections don't exist in some manner then I also have to assume Hermione was probably abused once the war was closer to the forefront just for being associated with Harry.

Obliviation isn't committing murder to me, like the cop from HP and the Natural 20. But assuming Obliviation is that easily abused and has no lingering effects makes me wonder why Tom isn't ruler of England, or that Slughorn had a memory to give back to implicate him.

Sad answer is it's probably just a plot hole.

Though that sounds like a hilarious conversation between Harry and Voldemort, "So... did it just not occur to you to hide your tracks better?"

Obliviation, like Centaurs in a forest is just one of those things no one really thought to tell Rowling about.

...

Seems like we've reach a solid conclusion,

Obliviation is a terribly easy to abuse spell. If it truly is a perfect memory wipe, with no evidence if done the right way. It could be used as a tool for much more Evil than the AK. It is in itself not more powerful but much more dangerous.

Everything below here is just more tangent off into nonsense. Just typed out to vent frustration and curiosity.

...

I think about off screen stuff alot.

Like in HP and most fiction stemming from it Good and Evil are tangible things. In the same way Good and Evil exist in DnD.

People who commit atrocities like rape, torture, and murder are literally affected by it in their tangible soul. So by doing good things people can literally redeem the soul. Karma exists bitch!

But Light and Dark imply something completely different. But exist in the same way Unicorn and Phoenix, or Threstals exist.

That Magic makes emotion into something with physical presence.

...

Or how differently Auror forensics must be with the existence of Polyjuice, sure it lasts an hour but with a flask how many doses are required per hour? Do fingerprints change after the fact? What about self transfiguration?

Since Hogwarts is basically a reference point and collection of knowledge, how often are grad students allowed to visit?

How active are wizard farmers for food? Or do they simply use muggle farms?

** My headcanon is that Lockhart and company will be totally okay in the Afterlife. See, I think Obliviate only erases the memory from the physical brain, but /not/ from the soul; the soul has a perfect recall of everything, which can only be accessed upon death, or, if you want to use it on Earth, thanks to a Pensieve.

This is also how it is possible to "unlock" memories that had been Obliviated, and why it's so dangerous: it requires tampering with the very soul of the patient.

This is the conclusion that I'd come to. The soul remembers, but Obliviation severs the brain's connection to the memories.

It has to be more complicated than that, or Obliviation would be impossible to undo, though--not that there's any canon evidence that it can be undone.

Word of God is that Hermione altered her parents' memories, which is a different spell to erasing them.

** Depends on your POV - in some works of (science) fiction death of personality is a replacement for the death-penalty because it gives society a productive member and is less gruesome and wasteful (one excample would be Babylon 5, where telepaths can erase peoples minds and do so when ordered to by law), not to mention that the personality can be brought back if new evidence shows that someone was innocent!

I happen to agree with you OP, that's why I never understand why people can brush aside that Hermione (who often claims a seat on the proverbial high horse of superior morals) erased her parents memories (hell, she was unsure if she could recover them later if I remember this right!)...Damned, Hermione you are playing god here and I would understand it if your parents wouldn't ever want to talk to you again after you restore their minds!
