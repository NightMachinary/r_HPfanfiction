Sorry if I don't explain this well but sometimes I just want to see certain things in a negative light when it wasn't ( or wasn't as much in canon).

Like for example lets say I wanted Love potions framed in a more negative light. That doesn't mean that I want every one who used it or mentioned using it in the books to now be depicted as minipulative rapists.

Just that people talk about it in a more dire less dismissive way and if people do talk about using it flippantly the narrative frames that as uncomfortable. Less people admit to using it if someone does use it in story and there are more dire consequences if they do. Harry comments on how disturbing what Merope did to Tom Riddle Sr was.

it doesn't necessarily change the story ( though it could). It doesn't have any character lecturing why love potions are bad to people who use it on others. No one is made ooc just to make them look bad. But the negative consequences of Love potions ( like the effect on victims ) are explored to a degree and there is weight in its impact .

You can apply same logic to characters or actions.

I think it usually more noted as critical when it veers into more bashing territory.

This might be not even considered harsh enough to be considered critical but I like it alot because when its too harsh people seem ooc and it feels less catharthic.

Like for example I'd love a Molly critical fic that was handled like this ( especially if it included the Sirius vs Molly moment and framed it as non sympathetic or not as sympathetic to Molly).

But if I were to look for one it would likely involve a really exaggerated Molly probably being thrown out of Grimauld Place probably after a lecture from Harry or Sirius as a sorta powerfantasy esque moment. Which honestly kinda ruins the catharsis for me. Everyone is too ooc the response is too harsh.

That kinda subtly critical is hard to find because its not usually defined as critical imo.

Do you guys have this problem?


** Yeah. I get what you mean. It's annoying because I would like to see that perspective explored, but there are almost no fics that can do it without adding so much bashing that the fic becomes unreadable.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14031132][Petrification Proliferation]] is kind of a crack fic, but it might interest you. It starts with the Magical government actually going, "A basilisk? At a school? Let's make sure there's no more!"

In a similar vein by the same author, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977403][A Dramatic Reading]] is Harry Potter characters reading and reacting to the books. They acknowledge where people fucked up in the past. There's surprisingly little direct quotations and more plot than you might expect.

** One thing I didn't like in canon was how easily Ron kept getting forgiven for all of his bullshit. For example, if I was harry, and Ron abandoned me like he did in the 4th book, the friend ship is over. Like done, no hope of recovery. Yet canon they practically kiss and makeup just because harry did good on the first task.

Tldr; fuck ron

*** - Ron didn't have to sacrifice himself so Harry could continue in PS.
- Ron didn't have to steal his father car and fly half the country just to check on Harry in CoS.
- Ron didn't have to invite him into his home almost every summer until the Weasleys became his surogate family
- Ron didn't have to follow Harry in the middle of an Acromantulas' nest even though he is deadly afraid of spiders
- Ron didn't have to follows Harry into the Chamber of Secrets (. . . ok just a bit for this one, his sister was there).
- Ron didn't have to stand on a broken leg et say to Sirius Black that he would have to kill him before getting to Harry

Tldr : Ron is an amazing friend and probably did more for Harry than Harry did for him.

*** Indeed, Harry didn't owe Ron any forgiveness, but Ron didn't have to offer Harry a family either. I can be perfectly understanding of people who say that Harry didn't have to forgive Ron but quit frankly, after all Ron's done for Harry, I also have the right to think that those people probably had never had a friend and are basically socially retarded.

**** Nah. Just because molly tried to surrogate mother harry doesn't mean Ron gave him a family. Nor does it mean all should be forgiven. I've dropped people in real life as friends for less. Some people like me have a high standard of friendship. People like me can count their friends on one hand, and people like me aren't afraid to cut off a metaphorical finger.

And no, I'm not socially retarded. I just know exactly what I do and don't want in a friend, and I refuse to settle. Quality over quantity.

***** From the way you wrote the comment, you make me think of those people on dating sites that impose a bunch of rules for their potential dating partner, while forgetting to mention what they bring to the table. As for Harry and Ron I wouldn't have personally cared if they went to their own way but being that Ron sincerely apologized for a one time fuck up, people that suggest that Harry shouldn't have heard him out indicates only how antisocial they are.

****** Lol. So hold up. Because I have a high standard for how friends should be or act, that makes me some kinda dating site Nazi? Am I reading that right? Just because you are more forgiving and loose with your standards when it comes to friendships doesn't mean other people need to emulate you. The kind of disloyalty due to JEALOUSY of all things Ron showed in goblet of fire is one of the worst offenses a friend can make.

But you do you brotha, you keep defending him üëçüèª

No. Just a person who expects the perfect friend. Maybe get a dog in that case and avoid all humans in the future?

Also, I don't defend Ron as a character. But I do defend his courage to actually make the first step towards reconciliation despite both being too proud to admit that they were suffering after each other.

******* Just put yourself in Ron's shoes. You sacrificed yourself for your best friend, expecting to die to a stone chess figure. You followed him into (spider)hell. You stood on a broken leg to tell a mass-murderer that he had to go through you to get to your friend.

And then your friend breaks your friendship over a mistake you apologised for, and that's OK?

Who exactly would be the bad friend in this story?

** Personally one of the things I don't like is how some people forgive Sirius his abandonment from his godfather duties to chase after Pettigrew. And consider he should still be godfather after that or even adopt Harry. For me when Sirius handed Harry to Hagrid, he forfeited any custodial rights and godfather status over Harry.
