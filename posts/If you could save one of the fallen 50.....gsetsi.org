.... Who would you choose?

I'm writing a canon-divergent/AU-ish story that spans the war and I've been pondering this question.

I expect most people to pick Fred, or maybe Lupin. Or Snape.

Lavender has quite a big role in my plot but it's important story-wise that she still dies (even though I love her and it will be hard to write!) My answer, I think, is Tonks. She's a great character I feel is underused. Plus (and I know it applies to Lupin too, it's just my feeling) it's just incredibly heart breaking for a new mother to lose her life when her baby isn't even a month old.


** Fred, Lavender, Colin - basically any of the “kids” who died before they actually got a chance to live.

**** I'm actually in denial about it because in the book it isn't /explicitly/ stated that she dies, but I just watched the movie the other day and it really annoyed me that they blatantly killed her off so if given the opportunity I want her to live.

***** I totally agree! She didn't die in the book, so as far as I am concerned, she's not dead. Death of the author, and all.

****** Lavender was only savaged by Greyback in the book: she was seen to be weakly moving after, so unless she died off-scene, I'd say she was still alive.

However, the movie had her as being killed, and JKR had a *lot* of creative control over the films -- from casting to scripts.

So, it's a toss-up, I guess?

As for someone to be saved? Hm... for story-line potential, I'd say either Lavender or Tonks.

The former would have to deal with post-War trauma and issues -- even if she doesn't become a full werewolf, she'd still be contaminated in the way William Weasley was. Plus, a vain girl like her dealing with horrific scarring? Character maturity/development.

A few fics out there have this already, too.

The latter? Wounded, possibly disabled, widow and single-mother. 'Nuff said.

A possible storyline could be that, over five/ten years, Tonks gradually grows closer to Harry, Teddy's godfather, to the point where it causes issues (especially if Harry's still with Ginny).

Hell, if Teddy calls Harry "dad"...

** Lupin and / or Tonks.

I know, I know: it's like the most "basic" choice. But I always loved Lupin's character, and I appreciated the little light-in-the-darkness that their relationship made me feel.

Also, I agree with OP that Tonks had a lot of potential as a character.

** Hedwig. No, seriously, it was the saddest death for me.

If Hedwig doesn't work, then Tonks or Remus. I don't particularly care for either of them, but the fact that both of them died always seemed forced to me, like JKR tried too hard to create a parallel between Harry and Teddy.

Snape makes for some interesting interactions. Would Harry want to talk with him, thank him maybe? How would Snape treat Harry knowing he had seen his memories? Would Snape stay at Hogwarts or retire? Would he be celebrated or shunned by wizarding community?

** Also definitely Tonks or Lupin for me. I totally understand the parallel of having Teddy grow up like Harry but with a loving family and no worries of a war. It just never quite sat right with me. There's already quite a few parallels between Harry, Voldemort and Snape due to their childhood upbringings and I hate that Teddy is also thrown in there despite having a fairly minimal similarity.

I really like Tonks but I can probably make more cases for Remus because he's the last Marauder and Harry never ever got to hear a lot about his parents (at least canon wise?). It also feels like Remus should've been a father/uncle figure to Harry if things were right and we never really see that due to him dying. I also feel bad that Remus dies after suffering so much.

I do agree that Tonks is underused and a vibrant character in the bits that we get. For me, I want either or both to live for similar reasons: I wanted more. Whether it's more happiness/contentment for Remus or more scenes and info for Tonks.
