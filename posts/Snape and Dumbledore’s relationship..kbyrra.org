What I mean is: What do you usually see in fics about their relationship? Does Snape thinks that Dumbledore means well? Does Dumbledore explains stuff to Snape? Are they even friends?

Tell me what you see usually, thanks in advance.


** I think Snape resents Dumbledore, but feels an obligation to him (rather like his life debt to Harry). He doesn't like the way Dumbledore goes about things, but has little choice but to follow orders.

Snape is Dumbledore's blindspot (or one of them, at least), because of the similarities in their youths. Both Snape and Dumbledore:

- were taken in by charismatic, but evil, wizard (Voldemort/Grindelwald)
- caused the death of someone they loved (Lily/Ariana), albeit unintentionally

Dumbledore /has/ to believe that Snape is redeemable, no matter the awful things Snape does or the uncertainty over whether he actually /wants/ to be good.

Because if Snape cannot be redeemed, neither can Dumbledore. And redemption is the deepest, most desperate desire of his heart.

Don't know if I've ever really seen this in fics, but it's certainly what's in my headcanon.

*** That makes sense. Thank you for sharing! Also, thank you for listing the similarities, I might use them someday.

Also, is PoliteSnark an oxymoron?

**** You're welcome.

And not at all - one can be snarky without being disrespectful (which Harry only gets right sometimes).

***** Okay. I guess in my mind I've always associated being snarky with being slightly rude, or asshole-ish.

** Nothing really. I used to read Severitus and SS/HP and those lean heavily into Manipulative Dumbledore. I read more Dumbledore mentor/friendship stories now, which typically has Dumbledore deal with Snape off camera. In fact, in these stories you could make the case that Harry replaces Snape, which I think is an underexplored route.

*** I don't think I've seen Harry acting as a spy for Dumbledore, if that's what you mean. I think it would be easier to write about Snape adopting Harry if there's an Evil! Dumbledore to blame everything for, and that way, Snape and Harry have a great way to bond! Blaming Dumbledore for screwing both of them over.

Anyways, I just wanted to see other people's opinion on this, and if it differs from mine.

**** Not a spy, but a respected confidant/ally who's in the know. Canon Dumbledore didn't give Harry that respect until he was dead and Harry had reached the end. Something like their relationship in Magicks of the Arcane if you've read it.

***** As a matter of fact, I did! In that one, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore was very helpful, but an... (oath?) was preventing him from doing his best to help Harry survive the Tournament, and I remember him introducing Harry to an... (instructor? madam?) to teach him about etiquette if I remember correctly.

Sorry, it's been a long time since I've read that one.
