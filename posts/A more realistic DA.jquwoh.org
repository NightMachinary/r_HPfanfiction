Does anybody know of a fic where the DA is less of a study group, and more of an actual army?

For example, taking a more active place in the war efforts instead of standing back.

Slytherins aren't ostracised, though there aren't many of them - they use their ties to find information that helps the light side.

Basically, I'd like to read about Dumbledore's Army being the main reason that the war is won.

Didn't finish it but it definitely has the DA becoming Harry's own 'Order of the Pheonix'

Do be warned, it's not for Weasley fans

**** I only read about half the story but Ginny and to a lesser extent Ron used a spell to make Harry and Hermione, respectively, fall in love with them. They learnt it from Molly, who it's heavily implied used it on Arthur.

It got pretty messed up and while I'm not sure whether it's true or not it's implied that Fleur has possibly also received the same treatment from Bill but I didn't read far enough to confirm.

I'm sure it's a decent fic if you like that kind of thing but it's definitely not my cup of tea.

***** Isn't this kind of a popular mindset in fanon? I highly doubt most of the Weasleys did that (as Ginny attempted to “get over” Harry, and Fluer was clearly interested in Bill), but I feel like I've read something along those lines about Molly before.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.
