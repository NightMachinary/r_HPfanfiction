  Accio' only works on inanimate objects. While people or creatures may be indirectly moved by ‘Accio-ing' objects that they are wearing or holding, this carries all kinds of risks because of the likelihood of injury to the person or beast attached to an object travelling at close to the speed of light."

But Harry summoned a bullfrog in Book 4's charms class.

Also, Speed of light? Really J.K.?


** As did Ted Tonks

#+begin_quote
  Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. “There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d'you reckon it's too early in the season? Accio Salmon!” There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh.

And also a bit of the boys expecting someone else to do it, and Hermione who is realistic enough to realize that won't happen.

1. Hagrid survives a huge fall, suggesting Accio probably slowed him down.

2. The bike speeds up after Harry casts it. It's ambiguous, but this might have been because the object being Accioed was bigger than the caster, so as Harry reeled Hagrid in he also was reeled in towards Hagrid.

3. Harry moderately probably wouldn't attempt the charm unless he thought it would work.

This instance is more ambiguous than the two you describe, but I think still qualifies as evidence the charm can be used on living things.

This means that muggleborns must have a magical mother or father either through dark things like rape, or magical people just leaving their kid in the muggle world (which is also pretty dark).

Also, then squibs must have had something super weird happen to be without magic.

If you have at least one copy of the gene, barring a mutation, you'll be magical: that's why half-bloods (the wizard + muggle type) are assumed to be wizards, and if not, end up as squibs. But for some reason, sometimes the gene vanishes/becomes inactive for a generation or three, and you get a squib. And three generations later a kid is born with an intact version of the gene, and that's a Muggle-born.

**** If magic was recessive muggle borns can be explained as having witches/wizards back in the family tree that had kids that had the gene but not both copies so didn't have magic and then eventually 2 muggles have the right combo and one/some of their kids has magic (also around 25% of wizarding offspring would be squibs which is WAY higher than shown); but since magic is stated as dominate if it's their then it's expressed which means every mother of a muggleborn had an affair with a wizard or was raped by one since if their muggle parents actually had the magic gene they wouldn't be muggles.

Ooh boy. Let's start with [[https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/relativistic-ke]]

Let's be conservative and go with 0.75c as "close to the speed of light". And a [[http://www.anvilfire.com/article.php?bodyName=/FAQs/anvil-6.htm][conservative anvil weight]] at, say, 50kg.

That's 2300174656227MJ, or about 550 megatons of TNT. Yea, that'd probably blow up a good sized chunk of a country.

Step it up to 0.99c and you get 27361756811838MJ, or 6500 megatons of TNT. I can't even imagine what that would do.

** Now that I think about it, Accio is overpowered. It doesn't require aiming or line of sight. It's invisible. It's not too difficult to do over great distances. It can presumably be blocked or countered, but as a temporary way to apply a lot of force to somebody, it's great.

I think this might have been an attempt at nerfing an unused combat tactic. Unfortunately, if it moved things near the speed of light it'd make huge explosions every time it was used, so if this was an attempt at a nerf it's backfired.

You can't cite death of the author to say that Elizabeth didn't in fact marry Mr Darcy. Nor does death of the author prevent the author from continuing to publish more works.

So what is death of the author good for? Well, JKR says Snape was a good man. But that's a matter of interpretation, based on JKR's own moral views. She gets to determine the facts of what Snape did and didn't do, but she doesn't get to determine how readers view those facts.

So when Mrs. Weasley spurts creamy sauce from her wand, she isn't creating it (as it would violate Gamp's law) but merely siphoning it from somewhere else.

** Why /not/ the speed of light? Don't let the movies fool you, Summoning is meant to be /fast/. There's a reason Muggles often use the word "summon" for what a wizard would call Conjuration: the two are often visually indistinguishable. (EDIT: And yes, I know the object probably wouldn't survive such speed in real life, but this is /magic/. I'm assuming the laws of thermodynamics simply don't apply here any more than they do for Apparition or Bluebell Flames.)

As for the mistake you found... yeah, either a retcon or a pretty egregious blunder. A proposed fix I've seen is that the more complex and magical a being, the more their own magic will rebell against the spell, and thus the harder it is to Summon them. Hence a bullfrog might be feasible, but directly summoning a Muggle (let alone a wizard) is something only Voldemort or Dumbledore could do.

*** Well, wouldn't that destroy the object? Unless, Magic protects it during travel. Also, this quote from the books implies that it does not travel at nearly the speed of light:

#+begin_quote
  “Accio Firebolt!” he shouted. Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn't worked . . . if it wasn't coming . . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . .

  And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount
#+end_quote

This implies that at least a couple of seconds have passed. If it was traveling at nearly the speed of light, it would have appeared as soon as Harry finished speaking

**** I /was/ assuming magic would protect it. But good catch with that quote. I suppose, if one wanted to reconcile the two statements, one might say that it took longer because Harry isn't as good at casting the spell as he might be, or because the Firebolt, being a magical object, is somewhat resistant to the spell.

***** Fair enough, I suppose. Although, still, going at the speed of light would affect more things then the summoned item.

******* To be fair, JK introduced physics in the first place by stating that summoned objects behave in adherence to a physical constant. Explaining magic is fine conceptually, but the moment you start making quantitative associations, you have to tread very carefully.

At any rate, the issue is far more with the contradiction of how the spell's effects are described in canon -- hypothetical nuclear fireballs are just a fun tangent.

******* Yes exactly! :( Magic itself by its nature breaks laws of physics all the time! Flames in a jar without wood, stuff teleporting, statues getting consciousnesses and stone walls popping up out of nowhere, turning torches into swords! Why are people here always so hellbent on shouting "BUT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!!" I mean FINE if you want to make magic obey natural laws in your fanfics FINE, but that is obviously never how it is in canon! So WHY WOULDN'T a fucking lightspeed summoning speed not affect anything around it or destroy the object being summoned?!

I mean you don't all go around saying "WHY DOESNT APPARITION TEAR SOMEONE APART AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AND KILL THEM!!!!"

***** If we agree to say "it's magic" then why does there need to be a reference to speed of light, which conjures (geddit) a very much science-like, /unmagical/ image imo. Just say "instantly". If JKR invoked speed of light, we can invoke the physics that comes with it.
