** Many would comment that the only wizard Voldemort feared was Dumbledore. In fact every single person would, including every sane death eater.

Regulus however was not rank and file in the death eaters. He was part of the true inner circle, as all the Black's who had joined were, even Narcissa.

So when he had learned about the truth behind the foul things the man had done to his own soul, he made his way to Dumbledore's door.

Black's were twisted, evil, and Dark (with a capital letter even), they were not foul enough to alter their soul.

The soul was sacrosanct, to harm it intentionally was disgusting enough to make Regulus get sick across the floor.

So he had made his was to the door at 8 in the morning sharp when he would likely not be busy yet.

Dumbledore greet him past the wooden door and to take a set before the great oak table in front of him.

"Dumbledore sir, I bring grave tidings and require your help. The Dark Lord has done something truly vile."

Dumbledore leaned forward reaching into a bowl on the table eating a candy.

"Oh, what mess have you gotten yourself into?"

Regulus steadied himself taking a deep breath before saying the words that filled his soul with disgust.

"The Dark Lord has created multiple Horcrux. He had me help him is hiding one of them."

The room grew uncomfortably hot quickly as he could see the rage of the information anger Dumbledore.

The old man stood and lashed out his hand, a staff smacking into his hand. There were only four Staved magicals in Britain currently.

Alastor Moody (who was so spell damaged he could barely use the thing anymore), Dragon (the head of the unspeakables), Arcturus Black (his insanely powerful, and insane, grandfather), and of course Aberforth Dumbledore (Last of the Druids).

Aberforth ushered the boy out and slammed his staff into the ground. A stone archway grew from the ground and Regulus saw his grandfathers rose garden through the archway.

"Come along, Arcturus will need to know what foolishness his family has gotten tied up in."

**** Regulus could thankfully count on one hand the number of times he had the 'honor' of visiting his grandfathers manor.

Arcturus was a force of nature, practically magic made manifest. He also held everyone he met to his own obscenely high standards. Which meant he spent the vast majority of his life supremely disappointed by everyone in his life.

Regulus had last seen the man when he had turned 11. Arcturus had cast a spell to test his willpower. Regulus still had nightmares from the effects of that spell. He was just glad he had managed to keep his screams of terror silent enough to not get kicked out of the family.

Aberforth led the way through the garden as the stone archway behind them collapsed back into the ground.

The patio walls were banished off to the side and it was wide open to the garden. There were two empty chairs near where Arcturus was already sitting waiting for them.

How in Merlin's name did the old man set this up in the few minutes it had taken them to arrive? His grandfather was a deep man and this stunt showed the depths of it once again.

Aberforth nodded to Arcturus and took his seat next to him. Regulus stood beside the chair across from them and bowed to his grandfather.

Arcturus stared at him for a solid minute before nodding back and gesturing for Regulus to sit as well.

"Well, what is it that bring my kin and The Druid to my garden?"

Arcturus had a deep voice that rumbled and cut through the air like a giant saw blade.

Despite his deep voice the man was a dapper individual who refused to ever look anything other than the image of a perfect gentleman.

Aberforth gestured with his staff and a ring of yellow light echoed through the air.

Arcturus raised a manicured eyebrow at this act. Regulus knew that meant he had get to the point and as such did so.

"Voldemort has committed an act most foul. He has sundered his soul and created multiple horcrux. I learned this after lending him Kreacher, who he forced to help him hide his newest one."

Arcturus prided himself on always presenting a pristine image. As such Regulus could understand how furious the man was over learning this information.

His hair fell out of place and his facial features began shifting. Regulus knew of the rumors Arcturus was a metamorphagus. He also knew it was worth more than his life to never let it slip there was more to the story than just rumors.

Arcturus took a deep breath and settled himself fully; mind, body, and magic.

"You have done well grandson. You are to never speak of this to anyone. Take such foulness to the grave with you. For now stay, there is plans to be made."

Arcturus nodded to Aberforth who lifted his staff again letting the yellow light fade into a mist the blew away on winds of magic.

Arcturus snapped his wrist and his staff appeared in his hand. It was a tall twisted dark unidentifiable wood that you could almost see veins of blood running through.

He lashed through the air with it and Regulus could feel the magic in the air settle down around them like a thick tacky syrup.

"I have only one source of knowledge on soul magic, the same all in the family must read. Magick Moste Evile. We have added to it all new information that is anathema destroying the sources as we can."

Aberforth sat back in thought. As a Druid he had a bit more knowledge of souls past the anathema knowledge.

"My idiot brother has something I feel may be useful. If we could trust Dragon I know he would have something useful. The fool would likely want to play with it as destroy it."

Arcturus had to silently agree. The unspeakables had permit to study those magics that were esoteric, insanely dangerous, and most importantly, they could study that which was anathema.

Dragon was a pureblood though he seemed to be entirely ambivalent towards the entire war. All he had cared about so far was Rookwood betraying his oath somehow.

He had forced Rookwood into several unbreakable oaths afterwards under some unspeakable threat.

It would be a toss up between which action Dragon would take. Helping destroy such anathema or being delighted in getting to study such a rare magic.

"No we cannot rely on Dragon. Get what you will need from Albus Brian, I will find out the details from Kreacher. Perhaps if he was foolish enough to use one of my grandchildren he was foolish enough to have another help as well."

Aberforth stood shaking his staff making a vine grow from it and a smile on his face. Albus hated that Arcturus called him Brian, the most common of his names, it always brought a smile to Aberforth's face to see it happen.

The vine reached out into the air and suddenly Aberforth was flying along as the vine seemed to pull him along.

Regulus found staff users to be strange beings, deep into the well of magic and far beyond mortal understanding.

"Thoughts like those limit you."

Regulus had the grace to look somewhat ashamed though on slightly. He had accepted his place in the hierarchy of power, there was no gain from lying to himself.

Once again Arcturus seemed to be reading his thoughts as he replied to his unspoken thoughts.

"Alright Regulus, at least you know yourself well enough. Now let's see about getting more information from that house elf shall we."

***** Hard disagree there. I don't even read anything unless it has at least 50k+ words. Ideally in the 120k-350k range. Anything beyond that tends to be a bit self-indulgent, but below that isn't enough of a story to get involved in. Personal taste, I guess.
