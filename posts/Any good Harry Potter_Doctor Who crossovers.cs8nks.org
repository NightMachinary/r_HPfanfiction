Basically the title, any good stories that combine the two? Not really looking for shipping, just a solid adventure story

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** Like most Naruto crossovers, a lot of authors love the "The Doctor/Team 7 visit Hogwarts to solve wacky problems/protect Harry Potter" getting rid of 90% of the reason of a crossover, that being the surprise and mystery of being in a new world/alien environement.

It's rare to find a good Doctor Who crossover for that reason, and there are so many opportunities for one. For example, hardly anyone mentions Time Turners in these fics, even though it's prime material. Also Luna Lovegood would make for a /fantastic/ companion, what with her magical nature and way of thinking and the Doctor's grounded reality, they're like fire and water in the best of ways.

As for good fics, here's one of the few that explores the idea in a fun, unique and creative way:

*** I also feel like Hermione would make a great companion. Her constant frustration with “but time travel just doesn't work that way” and “what? It's bigger on the inside? So? So's my bag”

**** True, but I think Luna's unflappability and innocence would work a lot better:

***** True. I just think Hermione is a lot like some of the doctor's other companions. And have had the idea of her as a companion in my head for a while, but lacked the skill to write it.

*** Lots of crossovers suffer from these problems, sadly.

Another thing that often happens is that one franchise's gimmick is totally nerfed, removed, or explained using the other one. I see it all the time in Stargate crossovers, or that one time I looked up star trek crossovers.

A crossover in my mind should serve to collide both worlds and mishmash them into one muddled one, not thrust a single element into a new reference frame.

So for example, don't allow the Starfleet engineer to explain away magic as "phased curzeran energy", but don't make magic the end all be all to beat every UFP tech solution.

  In third year, Harry Potter has a near fatal accident with a time turner while trying to save his godfather. Now Harry's not quite human and is beginning to have memories that aren't his own. The Doctor is now searching for the young Time Lord that he mentally sensed with a far-fetched hope that he is not alone. TimeLord!Harry
