All the time travel fics I've read have been pretty bad. The last one I read was Cursed Child so I've been pretty weary about reading stuff with time travel lol. So if there was any fic you'd recommend to change my mind, what would it be?


** First off: LOVE how you said the Cursed Child was a fic.

Secondly: Face death in the hope by LullabyKnell is great.

** Face Death in the Hope is really good but like they said, very slow paced.

For a good, action packed story, linkao3(The Second String) is the best time travel story. Just incredible.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is also really good fun!!

** Well what do you like? Which themes? Lots of action? Pairings?

My favourite of all time is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1060709][FDitH 'verse]] it starts with linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

But beware; face death in the hope is very slow paced with lots of extended introspection in case that turns you off. The characterization is fantastic though, it feels very real. I could simp all day.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards by viciousmouse) is pretty great! It covers first year, its sequel second year and yet another sequel is currently still in progress for third year.

I've got linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) favourited but frankly don't remember much more than that I liked it. Hasn't been updated in five years though, so quite certainly abandoned.

linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki) is kinda sorta time travel? It's definetely certainly great though.

Last but not least, linkffn(Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281) seems to be a favourite of the fandom. My memory might be shit bit I still know this one's hilarious. Have fun!

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

**** Depending on how far you got into it, it may be worth another shot - the beginning is slow and I found that part a lot more enjoyable on the second read than the first, because the good parts of the first bit don't really make sense without the context of the rest of the story.

However, if you didn't like it because you prefer action-centric fics, then that's fair. This fic is very character driven and there's very little Voldemort fighting or big impressive magic - it's about love and grief and interpersonal relationships and trust and inevitability, not swashbuckling adventure and esoteric magic.

****** Yeah, that's a big part of why I found the beginning to be far better after I'd already read it once than I did the first time. The majority of the story is set back in time, and Sirius's behavior in the first part makes a lot more sense once you've read the story of them growing up together from the age of 11, but it does feel a little weird when you're missing the context. Honestly, if you want to give it another try, you can literally skip the beginning and just jump straight to the scene where she gets sent back. All you're missing is the end of Deathly Hallows, with some differences in who dies because Sirius is around for the final battle and takes out some death eaters before they kill whoever they did in canon, and enjoy the story of Hermione basically getting a second childhood without yearly trauma. Some people actually prefer it in chronological order, starting with her first appearance back in time and reading forward with the world's timeline, not Hermione's, and there's a PDF out there that's got it helpfully re-arranged in that order so you don't have to juggle the chapters.

******* So, I ended up reading through it again, and finished it this time. It was nice to see the Marauders further developed as characters, and Remus+Sirius+Tonks surviving the Battle of Hogwarts. The closed causal loop makes me wonder a bit how the author envisions the canon Marauders in their teenage years, especially the James/Lily dynamic without Mia helping.

It did have a strong lemon flavour, which I could have done without. It wasn't unrealistic or gratuitous, but I prefer to leave people's intimate lives off-screen, since they're not my business. It's the author's call how they want to write their story, of course.

If anyone else is interesting in trying it in chronological order, then the starting point is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/16/The-Debt-of-Time][chapter 16]].

And yeeeah, there are definitely some strong lemons, but, for future reference if you ever want to recommend it to someone, she has edited/is in the process of editing (not sure if it's done yet) the FFN version down to PG-13 specifically for people who wanted to share it to folks who don't like or are too young for lemons.

****** Yeah, I get why a lot of people like The Debt of Time, but it's not for me either. I personally was really uncomfortable reading about Hermione/Mia, who still had her memories from her original timeline, lusting after Remus and Sirius when they were underage. (I know she was physically the same age, I just really didn't like it.) I also thought she was getting really OOC by the time I stopped reading.

My favorite Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus time travel fics are these:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5385554/chapters/12438575][*Divergence*]] *by abovetheserpentine:* In an effort to escape her captors, Hermione Granger attempts to go back in time two hours. However, she ends up in 1977, confused and alone. How will she navigate the past when she knows the future? Can she sit idly by and watch those she begins to consider friends succumb to their horrible fates? Timelines are tricky things. EWE. /(Hermione Granger/Remus Lupin. Complete. FYI that there's sort of a teacher-student relationship in this one.)/

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404/chapters/2266336][*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*]] *by Soupy_George:* It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. /(Hermione Granger/Sirius Black. Complete. FYI that Sirius definitely has era-typical views on gender roles/traits in this one.)/

I don't think you even have to like Time Travel to enjoy -- it has interesting characters and the problems that arise make for interesting tale. It takes place a few years prior to Harry's birth and it initially begins with Harry trying to not change (or change much) of the timeline, and ends with Harry finding a colorful patchwork of family and friends. However, it does have is dark spots -- It's during Voldemorts reign after all -- but it was an awesome ride for sure

** linkffn(Time on my Side by Mark Geoffrey Norrish): A time-travel adventure with only canon-style (short jump, closed loop) time travel that does a great job maintaining the early canon spirit, while weaving an original story.

linkffn(Spectrum by Consume): Hermione goes back in time to prevent Voldemort's rise. For once, she doesn't end up in an overwrought romance. One-shot.

linkao3(In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud): Hermione goes back in time to deliver infant Tom Riddle to his father, and ensure that he doesn't grow up evil. A generally good story with excellent characterisation.

*** Just finished reading In the Bleak Midwinter. I really like the characterisation of Tom Riddle Sr; he's ruthlessly ambitious, but he also has common decency and human feeling. And the way he manages to pass as a wizarding noble on a mixture of people's assumptions, Dobby's assistance, and pure nerve is amusing.

It's just a shame that it seems to have stopped updating.

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?

** Linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) is basically Harry trying to change the future and failing at it.

Linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die) is my second favorite and is an amazing example of Ron and Harry's friendship

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is Best Served Raw) is one of the best. Some people have problems with it sexualizing minors (which it doesn't) and discrimination against women (which has an in-world excuse that's redundant bc most of the BAMF characters are girls). It's amazing mixture of tropes that are redone in a better way, along with many original ideas. Must read

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
