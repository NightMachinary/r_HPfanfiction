Just read this fic and I'm blow away by where the story went, and I needed to mention it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team]]

The first year is mostly a rehash, but after that shit gets off the rails pretty quick, by the end of second year the story is very different, and things aren't where you expected them to go.


** I really enjoy this fic. I like where the author's taken the story. The relationship between Harry and Hermione has grown more complicated, and more obstacles are in their path. I can't wait until the author updates. My opinion, it's one of the best time-travel fics out there.

**** Yes, probably. The question though is will it be a long term thing like I'm hoping, or is Hermione going to see the light all of a sudden? I'd love to see an indefinite estrangement, Hermione thinking she's right and going off on her own.

#+begin_quote
  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

**** I've tried with this one. Really, I have. There's only one thing that annoys me half as much as Indy!Harry, and it's Hermione wank. The wank here is just too damn high, I'm sorry.

EDIT: Unless this changes later on? I was up to Chapter 9 last time.

EDIT Part Deux: Aaand I'm eating my words. Just skimmed the latest chapter. That was awkward.
