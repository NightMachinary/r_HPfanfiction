Edit: I mean can they procreate. Is the transfiguration on a genetic level and does the offspring inherit traits from both parents?


** It probably depends on how well the transfiguration was performed. We see multiple times throughout the series that transfiguration isn't an all-or-nothing thing, so if something was still part tortoise, part teakettle, then I imagine it would only be able to viably mate with something that was a similar ratio of tortoise to teakettle as itself.

** Now I want a crack fic with all the pure blood inheritance crap where Sirius in his animagus form mates with a legit dog and so his heir is a dog and everyone has to deal respectfully with heir black since they're an important family but how the hell do you take it seriously trying to discuss business and politics with a dog.

*** Do we have reason to assume that they are, though?

If such things were possible you'd think we have heard of people doing things like transfiguring human slaves from practically nothing. Pretty sure transfiguring potion ingredients doesn't work, though maybe that wasn't mentioned at all.

**** Transfiguration in general is about turning one thing into another, according to Rowling the molecular structure literally changes, we also know that its permanent. So from all we know they really should be reals.

You probably cant transfigure humans for metaphysical reason, not because of some rule of transfiguration, from the way we know transfiguration works it simply wouldn't be able to create human souls, which would be necessary if you want to create human slaves.

About Potion ingredients we dont know either way because its never been stated, but since transfiguration only changes objects physically it shouldn't he able to create magical ingredients.

My own headcanon is that it wouldn't work in general because the transfiguration wouldnt change the magical significance of the objects, meaning a cat hair transfigured into a dog hair would still count as cat hair for the purpose of magic, but be real in any other way.

** I'm going with "yes", assuming the transfiguration is total and lasts long enough.

So if you permanently turned a teacup into a female mouse, she could have little mouse babies the usual way. But that's not student-level transfiguration.

** Is a ball turned into a bird still a ball with an illusion (though tactile) or is it a true bird?

From canon, I would say yes. In classes they turn hedgehogs into pincushions and mice into snuff boxes, as well guinea fowl into guinea pig. JKR said that: Transfiguration is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, via the alteration of the object's molecular structure.

Molecular structure. This means that you really change a ball into a bird. Regardless if it's permanent. If you do the transfiguration well enough it is a bird. The phrasing molecular structure implies heart, brain, liver, kidneys, gonads etc.

So from a purely canon point of view, I would say yes. If it's done well enough.

** I've been reading The Archmage of Arda linkffn(13407891) recently where that's actually how you breed magical creatures.

Harry transfigures an eagle into a horse and has it mate with another horse, creating hippogriffs (or abraxans, can't remember.)

Anyway, I thought it was pretty interesting.

  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

** That happened in Elf Quest. Timmain shape-changed into a wolf, mated and gave birth to a Timmorn Yellow Eyes, half-elf/half-wolf and father of the Wolfriders. In the HP case, I am going to say no. The animagus wizard would still have human/wizard DNA and chromosomes which would be incompatible with those of an animal, mainly due to the differences in chromosomal pairs.
