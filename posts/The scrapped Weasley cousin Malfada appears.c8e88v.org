For those who don't know,Malfada was a planned character who would've been in first year during Goblet of Fire. She was planned to be a Slytherin and would have filled Rita Skeeter's role. I'm interested in any fics where she actually exists


** What's funny is that I actually just recently found out about her from an article and wanted the same thing. Too bad i've never seen a fic that even mentions her name.

** Linkffn(3 slytherin Maurders) is the only one I know of, it takes awhile for her to appear though but she does appear for than a throw away

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
