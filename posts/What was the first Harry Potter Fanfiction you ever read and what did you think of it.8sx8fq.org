Mine was a Cedric/Hermione fic called Started with a Kiss. I have no idea how I stumbled upon it but I remembered being surprised that such an obscure pairing existed, little did I know at the time how diverse the pairings can be in HP fanfiction. As I've learned now for every two characters or even a thing there is a ship. It was a pretty good fic overall, not my favorite but not bad for my first try.

Anyway share your first ever read HP fanfic!


** Cuckolding at Shell Cottage. I was 15 at that time, scared me away from all kind of fanfic for the next 8 years.

*** Methods of Rationality was my first foray into fanfictions, ever.

Me before MOR: Fanfictions? That cringy stuff written by angsty teenagers who want to get it on with their favorite fantasy characters?

Me while reading MOR: Why am I up till 4 am? What magic is this!?!?!

Me after reading MOR: It's...finished. How do I fill this hole in my heart? I need MORE!!!

** Jesus, I have no idea how so many people here actually remember their first fic. I found fanfiction sometime around OotP; I was around ten. Even looking through my oldest ffn bookmarks, which start in 2005, I know those weren't the first I read because I didn't get an account there for awhile after finding it. Not to mention I remember them as not being amongst the very first I read; hell, the oldest one is linkffn(A Mary Sue Alphabet), which I remember favoriting because it included Ginny and it agreed with my thoughts on her character in fanfiction at the time.

So basically, I have no bloody idea.

*** That was my first too, I found it while looking for web novels and random stuff to read online like a year ago and back then hadnt really read the books much but had seen the movies (and enjoyed as a child). Now I've read the series and have also read over 100 fanfics. I cant get enough of hp and wish I got into the fandom more back when the last movie came out and grown up reading them... I only read a couple naruto fanfics as a young teen (and maybe the odd 1d during a phase i had on wattpad) and hadnt gotten into the fanfiction community.

Basically reading the seventh horcrux changed me from someone who enjoyed the movies into a huge hp fan who constantly reads hp fanfic instead of normal books.

*** Exactly as above for me too. I found it on IRC the Sunday before Deathly Hallows was about to be launched, and think I read it almost three times before Friday night. By then I was fairly suspicious and looking forward to the Saturday launch as I'd either have a hardcover version of the story I'd been enjoying, or a whole new HP book 7 to read. Needless to say, I wasn't overly impressed with DH, and started looking for more info on the story I'd been reading. I found a reference to Melindaleo and found a few more of her stories, then tracked her onto potterficforum, and my slow descent into Potter addiction became a one way fall. Can't say I've ever regretted it, but it can be a struggle to find good, new stories. I could use a good excuse to get back into writing my own... (Brian64)

Years later, I hear people dump on it and I'm afraid to go back and re-read it, because my guess is that it's not as good as I recall.

I had been in the Inuyasha fandom for a while because my friend had introduced me to fanfiction. But Harry Potter the book series had ended and I was sad. I wanted more Harry Potter.

** The first Harry Potter story I read was G.Norman Lippert's James Potter story. I remember liking it quite a bit at first. It fell out of favour though, it was too different from JK Rowling's writing at the time for me to really enjoy it and I never finished it.

Although actually what introduced me to the idea of fanfiction at all was one of the Goodreads forums for Harry Potter, which had people roleplaying. I found it fascinating and I remember really enjoying one particular story someone had created, so technically speaking that was my first fanfiction. It was a sweet romance set during the Harry Potter years.

** I could never find it again after losing my browser bookmarks (don't remember the title), but it was a story about the 19 years between the Battle of Hogwarts and the epilogue. I've always been a fan of the canon pairings and I wanted more HP content. It honestly was very good from what I remember. English isn't my first language though, so I probably overlooked some writing errors back when I wasn't fully fluent. I really enjoyed the story and it's the fic that got me into reading fanfic in the first place.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword) has the same title as the third book in a fantasy medieval series. I was doing a book report on the book and googled its title to see if there were any reviews on it.

The first link was the fanfiction. I consumed the whole fic in one night; it was great.

Little did I know, it's one of the best fanfics in the fandom. I just read it and moved on, not even considering there might be more. I checked up on /Forging the Sword/ for years before discovering more fanfiction.

Then I read /Vox Corporis/ and /NOFP/, one of which is fluffy angst and the other of which is wish-fulfillment-ridden angst, but both were still enjoyable.

Then I read /HPMOR/, which initially sucked me in. I never considered that books (or fanfics masquerading as published works) could seem good but have serious flaws. I still have a lot of fond memories of experiencing that fic, despite the weaknesses hidden within.

** My first Fic was Runaway Wizard by Yanagi-wa.

However as soon as I had finished it I felt disgusted by the stereotypical shit that was in it.\\
I have worked in a SM Fetish Shop to pay for university for almost 3 1/2 years, and went out with my boss and his lover in quite a few gay bars and clubs.\\
I have never, ever encountered behavior as described in Yaoi/slash/gay Fanfictions.

I understand that most of those fictions are written by girls who get off on that stuff, but seriously. What the heck is wrong with them?

And dont get me started on all those Mpreg/Rape/AngstyHurt shit. Damn.

** I don't remember the title, or whether I finished it at all, but I distinctly recall Harry forming a weird alliance with the goblins after he realises Dumbledore is manipulating him. There might have been some inheritance involved in the mix, and there was definitely a part where he either traveled in the past to meet the founders of Hogwarts or otherwise contacted them to help him with his mission (whatever it was). Unfortunately, I don't remember anything else about it. It's probably not that special compared to some of the stories I've read since, but it intrigued me enough to keep reading fanfic... And that's how I got my foot in the door :)

** I think it was "Searching for the Power" about seven years ago. It was...not good. Looking back at what I remember of it, it hit so many overused and uninteresting tropes. I barely made it through and honestly didn't read any fanfiction for a year or so after I finished.

** I can't remember at all but the first that I actually remember was "He Who Must Not Be Normal". It's a Drarry fic and it is still one of my favorites. I remember reading it during one summer. It was morning and I just sat on my bed, reading and loving it. To this day I still read Drarry constantly and I still believe it is one of the best HP fanfics to this day.

** This was back in *2004 and it was on Schnoogle. I have no idea what it was called but it was a marauder's era fic (james/lily and/or remus/sirius) at the start(or maybe end) of each chapter it had a song recomendation. I enjoyed it. I would love to read it again but don't have much to go off of, in fact I might be mixing fics together.

** i doubt it still exists - this is pre HBP so would have been a take on that Dramione for sure - still holding onto that one... Probably about Hermione and Draco having a secret relationship in 6th year, then heads in 7th year. Er... so like many Dramione fic back then. Voldemort just... disappeared. Haha. Ah a simpler pre-Horcrux, pre-Death Eater Draco time.

** Harry Potter and method of rationality was the first one I read. It was a glorious read and saved me from abandoning HP fandom. I come from non-English background and when HP finally reached my radar I was too old to be bewildered by yet another 'prophecy child saves the day by ending an idiot villain that only he can defeat' trope.

It wasn't the first wizard, boarding school or prophecy child story that I read. But it was the first 'children' story with ridiculously simplified and cardboard morality that made it so big. I was disappointed. And it took me a lot longer than necessary to understand that children don't really care beyond superficial 'Wow! HP defeated so and so', hence easy readership.

HPMoR gave an antagonist, in truest sense of him opposing the protagonist, instead of evil warlord, the usual mustache twirling sadist nose-less cartoon Voldemort, and I thoroughly enjoyed his interaction with a rational MC. Internal monologues, overconfidence leading to mistakes and genuine wrong assumptions based on faulty and incomplete data but reasonable thought process was intriguing.

It saved me from mind numbing stupidity that HPP canon series was, coming from Enders Saga.
