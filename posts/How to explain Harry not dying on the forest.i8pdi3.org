I'm curious about this, what are your point of views about what made Harry live again after being hit by the Avada Kedavra in the forest, in the seventh book?

I've read about this a lot and I'm divided, between three main theories.

1 - *Voldemort resurrection ritual worked as a Horcrux for Harry*: Because Voldy now has Harry blood coursing through his body their lives are tied together so Harry can't die while Voldemort lives -makes sense with the prophecy I suppose-, which means Harry couldn't actually die during any of the events of the fifth, sixth and seventh book until Voldemort Death, at least once (?), because he always had this one "extra-life" that was the horcrux under his sleeve. This would make everything kind of underwhelming in retrospective like none of the danger was real. Not for Harry at least.

2 - *Voldemort resurrection ritual accidentally made so he was the only person that could safely destroy the Horcrux inside Harry*: Similar to the previous one, but in this case the danger Harry experimented was real and he could die at any moment. Because if anyone besides Voldemort were to "kill him", the Horcrux would be destroyed, but Harry would remained dead.

3 - *The deadly hallows made him immortal.* This is the one I think is less probable. Like just by comparing the differences between the resurrection stone of the story and the real deal, we know we don't have to take everything in a literal way. After all, if the stone made him live again because he was the master of death, doesn't this means Harry just can't die anymore at all until he lost possession of the title?

What do you think?


** Its explained in the book. And the closest explanation is the second one

Voldemort had Harry's blood, so Lily's enchantment was kept alive. So when he used Avada kadavra Harry was protected like he was when he was a baby, and because he was still grounded to earth because of his mother's protection. And because of his blood bounding\\
he was able to come back from limbo and back into the living world unlike ghosts like nearly headless nick who was in a similar state who chose to remain on earth but their connection to their bodies was severed when they died, unlike Harry.

** Dumbledore's explanation is a guess (and possibly a hallucination) and it mostly requires you to know as much about magic as Dumbledore does. I choose to view it simply the killing curse killing the horcrux instead of Harry.
