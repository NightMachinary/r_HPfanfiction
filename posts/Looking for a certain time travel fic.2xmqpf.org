Hello everyone!

I was hoping someone would remember a fic where Harry and Hermione go back in time as their souls? Ghosts? Something like that to the day before halloween 1981. They tell Lily, James, and Hermione's parents whats about to happen, destroy all the horcruxes (maybe?) and then go back in their bodies. They then hide the fact that they still have their memories from their parents. Does anyone know this fic?
