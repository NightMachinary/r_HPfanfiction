Harry can be the main character, or a side character, or not even part of the story.

*No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, if possible*

No Weasley Bashing

No Seer Luna

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated if possible

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be dark/light or in between

Harry can be smarter or more powerful then in canon, but I'd appreciate it if it could be believable enough. No Harry is Master of Death type stuff, please.


** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] trilogy, starting with linkffn(1795399) is a Snape-adopts-Harry story and the whole series clocks in at over 1.7 million words.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] series, starting with linkao3(7737991) is at 870k words and has fairly regular updates. Next-gen, Albus/Scorpius.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676][Divided and Entwined]] linkao3(11645676) diverges from canon at the end of 4th year and is focused on Hermione. Ron/Hermione, though romance isn't the focus.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** So three of the series I like and follow for updates come to mind:

The Child of Hogwarts series by AimeretVivre, story of Harry getting pulled from the Dursleys after year one and living at (obviously) Hogwarts. Currently on book 3. Book 1 was 216K words, Book 2 was double that, Book 3 is the ongoing at almost 300K but updates have become lengthy. When writer started there was weekly updates but author has had a lot going on. Does seem to want to continue the story though so I hold onto hope.

The Innocent series by MarauderLover7, currently on book 5, first story was almost 500,000 words and the next 3 were 150K-200K. Fifth one is ongoing and gets update every couple weeks.

And then, if you haven't done the Alexander Quick series by Inverarity. Story about an American girl who discovers she's a witch (none of it is canon compliant with everything we've learned about America since it's a series started a decade ago but it's good). It's 4 completed books averaging around 200K words. Author has promised a fifth to the series in 2019 after a 7-year hiatus since the last one was completed, so might be a good time to give it a try if you haven't.
