Any recommendations for less common Hermione pairings? ie Graham M, Anthony G, Dean, Seamus, Terence H, Blaise, Adrian P (wow a lot of slytherins- but other houses work too!). I'll also accept a muggle or OC.

I hate that on the ff app you can't search by tag, so unless the characters name is in the title/summary you can't find anything


** You can't search by tag, but you can filter by main characters if that is more helpful

**** On the FFN app: Read -> Harry Potter -> button in top right corner that looks like a funnel

Has several different ways to sort, including by character. For what you want, I'd probably sort by Hermione and exclude Harry and Ron, but you can only exclude 2, so that may not be perfect
