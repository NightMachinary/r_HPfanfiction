** If wanting to give him diplomatic respect but not actually trying to keep him happy, “Lord Voldemort”. If /actually/ trying to be respectful, I'd say... “Dark Lord”?

** So many people here are suggesting “Voldemort,” but he was pretty sensitive about that name. I assume that as he got older, he grew to regret the goofy name he'd made up as a teenager, but it was too late to change it, hence the taboo.

I'd go with “My lord” to be safe.

** The Dark Lord. That's the only real option.

That's what Death Eaters and other sympathizers call him when they're not in his presence and saying 'My Lord' to him directly.

Possibly, only possibly, Lord Voldemort.

A long time ago, in his early days, I can see someone politely referring to him by this moniker. After all, his name had to spread before everyone became afraid of it. However, once it became culturally taboo, speaking his name began to be considered an act of defiance against him, and that would contradict being respectful. Definitely could be interpreted either way depending on the era and the context. If you'd rather be safe and not take any risks, you're gonna call him The Dark Lord.

But honestly, if you are talking to a evil megalomaniac you better saying 'My Lord' if you want to keep your life ^^

** In the few interactions we see him have with people other than Death Eaters, he is addressed to as Voldemort/Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord/Tom (by Dumbledore and Harry). Anyways, in his later years, the only way a conversation with him would usually end with the other person either becoming his servant (willingly or unwillingly) or end up dead.

Edit: the only circumstance I can think where someone not in his service (or wishing to enter his service) would care about how they approach Voldemort, it would be if a relatively equally powerful wizard or witch would like to build an alliance, case in which I would go with "Lord Voldemort" in order to show proper respect to his title but also to show that I'm not afraid of using his name.

The other case would be if the Ministry was trying to reach a truce with the Death Eaters, in which case I think Voldemort (if dealing with a powerful negotiator of course) would try to charm his way to get the best out of the truce agreement, in which case he would not really care how he's called, although he would still likely be addressed to as 'Lord Voldemort'.
