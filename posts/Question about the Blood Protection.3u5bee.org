I don't fully understand how Lily's protection works. I get that it doesn't allow Voldemort to touch/harm Harry, but how does that extend to the Dursleys house? And in GoT, since LV rebuilt his body with Harry's blood, therefore allowing him to touch him... wouldn't that also allow LV to enter the Dursleys home? In canon, its said that if Harry renounces the Dursleys as his home, the "Blood Protection Charm" would stop working -- but would that also stop the mechanism that keeps LV from touching him? (say its before GoT).

If someone understands this better than I do, please help me, haha


** It's more about living with a relative of the person who'd made the sacrifice. Which means Petunia or anyone else related to Lily by blood. And the blood protection itself is simply a remnant of the magic that had destroyed Tom Riddle's body at the time, sustained by the connection of blood between Lily and Petunia.

To be honest, it's not quite known if there's any actual protective effect as far as the residence of the Dursleys is concerned. However, magic works with intent as its basis, so it might be possible that there is a harmful effect to those meaning harm and the very possibility is enough to make it not really worth it to try unless you go for a decisive strike from the get-go and cut your losses. And for all we know, it might also simply be that before taking over the ministry the Death Eaters simply did not know where exactly Harry was and weren't audacious enough to check house after house.

That being said, yes, should Harry have renounced the Dursleys the blood protection would have stopped working and thus Tom Riddle would be able to touch him normally. But you must realise that it's all about Lily here, not Harry; the reason the ritual made it possible for Tom to touch Harry wasn't that he now had Harry's blood, but rather that he had blood of someone related to Lily.

** i thought the implication was that harry always has the protection in his skin; the protection on the house was a defencive spell dumbledore cast on the house to keep wizards with bad intentions from being able to get close, which was only possible because of lily's protection. and the spell was more like an unplottable than a shield.
