This is the direction I'm going with mine, because I have a far more Wizarding-Britannia-centric structure to my global politics and I see wizards of political power in the colonies as more likely to be loyalists than rebels. (Also because MACUSA as a term and independent body being formed only two years after the Statute is abominably stupid from any legitimate historical perspective, kind of like the term Mugwump, which I am also defenestrating without compunction. With all respect to JKR, of course. Everyone makes blunders.) I'm curious if anyone else has explored this concept. :)


** My usual take on Magical USA is: There is no magical USA. The various wizarding enclaves founded on the East Coast in the 17th and 18th century never banded together since they were founded by extremists of all sorts - the kind of people who roll with "if you don't like it here, go and found your own country" - and they have been warring each other since more than they have fought the Native tribes, which were pushed out of the East Coast area. So, they're not exactly part of Britain or colonies, but they're small fry compared to Britain - doubly so a Britain with Dumbledore, who is pretty much a walking WMD in my stories with regards to political influence.

*** I like that idea! I'm actually doing something similar in a few other places. Like the Scamander Foundation is actually an independent wizarding body with sanctuaries scattered around the globe and the ICW treats it like a rogue nation more or less.
