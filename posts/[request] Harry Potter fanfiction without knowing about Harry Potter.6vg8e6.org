I'm trying to find some Harry Potter fanfiction without having knowledge behind Harry Potter. Never finished the series in books or movies. Plan on it sometime but have to be into the story again. I recently watched fantastic beasts and now want to read some fanfiction that's like it. Based in the universe but doesn't have anything to really do with Harry Potter or needing knowledge of the film's or movies to go through it.


** Your best bet is going to be historical stories like linkffn(Starnlicht)

Something that still has the world. I can't say how good the one I'm linking is though, it's been awhile since I've read it.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** I think you will like linkffn(Browncoat; Green Eyes) by nonjon. It is a crossover with the TV-Series Firefly (and the follow-up movie Serenity), and it is definitely one of the better fics in our fandom.

Additionally it has no requirements, it introduces everyone from both sources.

Other than that I can really recommend reading the books. If you don't want to read too much of children's books, start with Prizoner of Azkaban, and maybe read plot-summaries of the books before if you really want to.

Generally Rowling's writing is exceptional, and there is a reason why she is so successful. While she had plenty of luck her success comes from more than just that - so I do recommend you actually reading the originals. There is also the problem that a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction is deconstructive and takes pride in taking apart 'plot holes' of the books, so reading much fanfiction will definitly change your perceptions of some characters, /especially/ Ron and Dumbledore.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.
