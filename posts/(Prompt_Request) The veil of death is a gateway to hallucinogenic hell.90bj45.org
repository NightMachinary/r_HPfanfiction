Where you get unmade and made repeatedly. In constant agony and pleasure. You feel yourself become one with everything while simultaneously being torn apart. A combination of the best and worst hallucinogenic drug trips. Everything around you is moving and breathing and laughing and crying. You feel your soul getting vacuumed out of your body into the belly of an eldritch abomination, powerless to do anything but scream and hope that you pass through with some semblance of self. Whenever you think it is over it begins anew, an endless cycle of hope and despair. Your flesh being torn off your bones to the rhythm of terrifying, awe-inspiring music that suddenly seems to invade every sense of your being.

It's really hard to put a hallucinogenic trip into words.
