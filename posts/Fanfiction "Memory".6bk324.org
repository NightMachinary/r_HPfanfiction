Hi, I am writing a Harry Potter Fanfiction called "Memory" (Yes, very creative, I know). It's placed in germany and without any of the characters of the books. It's not very long yet, but I'm working on it. It's written from the point of view from a german muggle archeologist who makes quite an interesting find.

It can be found on Fanfiction.net as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12485585/1/Memory]]

Chapter 1

Richard was walking carefully through the excavation site, which was supposed to eventually become a cinema, with the constructions starting in about nine days. The archaeological team he was a part of, was spread throughout the future construction site, looking for anything of interest. They weren't expecting anything outstanding here, but everything was a possible valuable insight into the past, the older the better, obviously. Up to now there hadn't been anything that exciting yet, only some broken plates from the 1950s, hardly worth noticing.

Richard kneeled down, touching a row of bricks with his hand, inspecting them closer. Those were most likely from an building that was destroyed in the Second World WarMaybe it's worth looking here he thought by himself while grabbing a small shovel. While he started to dig carefully, he asked himself what he should do at this evening: Should he sit alone at home once more or go and visit a Bar for exchange? While the Bar would, beyond a doubt, bring him among other people, he wasn't really comfortable in places like these. Sadly he couldn't think about what else to do to catch the attention of a woman. Huh, maybe it simply has to happen. He thought by himself, when a noise caught his attention, it sounded like his shovel hit something wooden.

Looks like I got something here, Let's hope it's not just some rubble. Were his thoughts while he kneeled down to the ground, and he carefully started to remove the dirt around the piece of wood he had hit with his shovel. The piece of wood turned out to bee a small box, which was luckily mostly undamaged. It seemed to be nothing special, through the decay of the centuries he could still see a carving. He took a small brush and cleaned it from the remaining dirt. As he lifted up to move it to a small table on one side of the excavation site, the lid suddenly sprang up on it's own with a small ‘click', as the lock seemed to unlock itself. “Now that's strange,.” he muttered to himself, while he wondered if the lock was simply broken.

In the box was a chain with a pendant in the shape of an eagle, made out of an material, thatwhich looked like silver.

“Looks like we finally got something good. You're quite the beauty,.” he said to the pendant. “I wonder who you belonged to”

Now having a closer look at the carving on the now cleaned lid. Looks like a king... where have I seen this before? He wondered while inspecting the bearded man with crown and plate armour, who could barely made out on the lid. Some details had sadly been destroyed forever by decay. He bowed over the box until his nose almost touched the lid and started inspecting it closely. Looks like letters here, most likely Llatin considering that it comes from early middle ages most likely. “O-T-T-O-I-M...” he spelled out loudly as it slowly dawned on him.

“Oh no, that can't be!” he exclaimed, almost laughing. If his suspicion was correct, then this wasn't only old, but very valuable as well.

“Now forto some closer inspection.” he said, putting on a pair of gloves and he tried to lift it carefully so he could have a closer look.Upon touching it he felt a jolt like he had just touched an electric fence. For a moment his memories of the past week passed by before his eyes. He was unable to let go for a moment before he finally could drop the object it back into the box.

“What the hell was that?” he asked himself, with a strange feeling creeping up his back. First the lock had broken conveniently just when he lifted the box and now this. Something just had to be wrong with this strange pendant.

Feeling spooked now, Richard closed the box again, not caring if it could ever be opened again. I should get it back to base, there should be proper equipment and a safer environment for it there,. he thought while storing the box carefully before he made his way to the car.

Chapter 2

Richard was already sitting in his archaeological laboratory for hours, carefully cleaning the box and analysing every single detail about it and it's content. With the Seal now proving to be a lot more readable, he now had ample proof, that this had once been a personal Item of emperor Otto I. of the Holy Roman Empire of the german Nation. For a time with as few informations about as the early middle ages, this would be a remarkable found. He would still need to send it in for further checks but right now he had a literal treasure at his hands and it was his find. This basically was, what every archeologist dreams about to do.

He was looking at the pendant with a magnifying glass, when someone knocked at the door. Richard sighed heavily “In a moment!” he yelled towards the door as he put the pendant back into the box and closed it. When he opened the door, a man in a green suit stood before him. The man seemed to be in his thirties with black hair, tall and rather skinny. For some reason Richard needed a moment before he could tear his eyes from his suit. It was in this strange emerald green and looked slightly old fashioned, like it would have been modern forty Years ago.

“Hello, my name is Sylvester Wagtail, I am here on behalf of the Archeological Committee.” The man introduced the man himself with the polite but slightly distanced voice of somebody who made a routine job he had done many times before ‘Archeological Committee', aha, first time I hear from those guys. Noted Richard by himself, but decided to see where this would lead, but just in case he positioned himself in a way that most of the door was blocked. “Ah, nice to hear from you, how may I help you?” Richard said instead with an amicable voice. “We received your letter about your finding this morning at the construction site you are currently working on. We would like to have a closer look at it for further reference.” he explained his presence. Aha, can someone become even more obvious a fake? Richard wondered and was somehow amused by the question how far this would go and started to memorize that man's face, but while musing about the question if he was wearing this suit only to get everyone's attention away from his face, which indeed worked somewhat, he answered: “I'm sorry, but as you probably know, this is an old piece of art and I'm not yet ready with researching it. Findings like these can be very delicate and easily damaged if treated poorly. I will probably be able to show it to you later but right now I wouldn't let even the Director of the Museum touch it.” Sylvester Wagtail looked slightly disappointed by that answer but recovered quickly, apparently searching something in the pocket of his jacket. “I'm sorry to hear that. You will most likely hear again from me in a few days.” The man said “Of course, I wish you a nice day.” Richard said as he turned around and closed the door.

Richard was on his way to his phone to call the Director and tell him about his meeting with this Sylvester Guy. Wherever he came from and how Ridiculous his disguise may be, they should really keep their eyes open for him, as he clearly was after the pendant, when no one outside of his team and this building knew about it yet. While he was reaching for the phone he heart a faint clicking from the door behind him. He was just about to turn around, as someone said in a quiet but clear voice “Obliviate!”

The next thing Richard felt was emptiness. He still knew who and where he was but not what he had done in the last hours. It was as if a white fog was suffocating all his memories about his day at work. But only a moment later he felt the fog lifting. He had found a pendant of Emperor Otto I. at the construction site and was now cleaning and looking closer at it. A few spots though, where still clouded in fog, he could for heaven's sake not remember the name of the person who just visited, even while he knew it was a strange one.

When he came back to his senses, Richard was leaning against a wall and felt as mentally exhausted, as he usually was after a very long day at work. While he took a deep breath, he saw the man in the green suit taking the box with the pendant in it, Richard made an effort to stand upright again and raised his voice. “Hey, put that back immediately”.

The other man looked truly surprised as he turned around, the box still in hands. “What? How do you...” he said in disbelief, as Richard started to walk to him firmly to get the pendant back from him. “Give it back now, or I'll call the police!” Richard threatened while grabbing the box and pulling it out of the man's arm, hoping it wouldn't hit the ground and become damaged in the process.

The man in the suit looked completely confused, almost as if he didn't know how to act now and slowly moved away from him, still grabbing something in his pocket and seemingly muttering to himself.


** That's ~ 800 words per chapter, which is way too short. 800 words are slightly more than an A4 page. You should aim for at least 2000 per chapter with 4k being the better option. Short chapters make the story feel rushed and lacking details.

Describe the surroundings in more detail (the dig site, the lab). Not only does it increase your word count but it adds so much to the story because the reader can imagine things better if he has directions. A lab can be clinically white and brightly illuminated. Or a dark room on the sixth floor of a run down university building. You should tell the reader how you imagine things.
