I don't know if this is fandom or canon but there are rules about making or doing something (usually in rituals) that everything has a price.

So, apparation is basically the same with how fast you want to be there, with the price of comfort. Same as the floo network and portkeys.

Floo and portkeys are a lot worse because they need to travel further. (The international floo network if there is one)

What are your opinions

P.S The knight bus also works the same.


** Everything has a price is fanon. Harry practices accio all day and it gets better, and his hand didn't wither off or something.

I always felt it was a nod as to how uncomfortable travel is in real life. Though honestly, I'd rather take a portkey than a 16 hour flight where some baby is going to be crying the whole way.

The in-world explanation, of course, is probably that the theory behind magical transportation (at least instantaneous transportation) can't remove the discomfort of magical travel. Though, expanded flying cars sounds like a great way to travel.

*** This. Travel is uncomfortable. Travel used to be even more uncomfortable in the past.

A sixteen hour flight with a crying baby is nothing compared with a two-year journey by land and sea, with bandits and pirates and storms and diseases.

Wizarding travel compresses the journey into a shorter timeframe, including the discomfort. And nobody has bothered to update wizarding travel methods to conform with current levels of discomfort.

** My knight bus headcanon is that it's intentionally overly expensive and uncomfortable.

Children usually don't travel alone at night. Harry in PoA is the exception. Adults usually apparate. People going from one magical location to another would use the Floo. Therefore the only people who'd use the bus regularly would be people who need transportation in the middle of the night, to or from a nonmagical location, and can't apparate for some reason. Apparating is similarly difficult as driving a car, needing instruction and a license and everything.

So, the bus mainly exists for wizards who spent half the night drinking in a muggle pub and are too drunk to apparate home. If the bus wasn't provided they might try to apparate and splinch themselves and cause muggles to notice them, but the Ministry still wants to discourage that kind of behavior so they make the bus less comfortable than it could be.

** Everything having a price is a fanon thing. J.K. left a /lot/ of the magic system vague-at-best, and in some cases what /is/ stated is inconsistent with itself (not being able to Summon living creatures versus "Accio Trevor" - and that's just what's in the books), she certainly didn't make any rules around equivalent exchange, magic-with-a-price, et cetera.

I remember Accidental Animagus mentioning pretty much this exact theory, though - linkao3(14078862). In Chapter 10 of this fic, the following dialouge happens: “Not fast ones. Floo, portkey, apparition---they're all the same. All powerful magic has a price, and in this case, the price is that it's really uncomfortable.”

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
