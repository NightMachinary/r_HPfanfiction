** Thought this one up the other day by free-associating from another Pettigrew-related prompt: what if Ron tries to use one of these fanon familiar-bonding rituals on Scabbers, and ends up with a telepathic link to Mr Wormtail? Obviously he'd instantly find out his pet's true identity. But Wormtail could easily convince a young, impressionable boy not to do anything rash, because if the Ministry catch him, they'll have him Kissed by a Dementor, and if Ron is soulbonded to him that could be very bad news for him indeed.

What comes next? You tell me. But there's a story there.

** The Triwizard Tournament comes to Hogwarts in the Marauder era. Lily is selected as champion. Her Muggle born status makes the whole thing so politically combustible that Voldemort wants her dead without any prophecy or baby. She doesn't want protection from James or Severus--- she has no use for any posturing from either of them and just wants to win. But then comes the final task...

** World-bunny:

Mana is a real ambient part of the world. When wizards duel, they draw on the mana in the environment, of which there is a limited amount. High level duelers try to draw more mana than their opponents and use more efficient spells. Flitwick is a good dueler because his spells are efficient.

Dumbledore is exceptionally talented at affecting mana. He can typically monopolize all of it in a duel, reducing opponents to relying on physical attacks or weak spells.

The Elder Wand provides some sort of mana battery, allowing its user to fire extra strong spells and shields without drawing or depleting the ambient mana.

Dumbledore vs Grindelwald was a trial of efficiency vs raw power.

Tom Riddle has access to mana from many different locations--through his horcruxes. This allows him to duel Dumbledore despite the Headmaster having superior mana control and the Elder Wand.

Dumbledore vs Voldemort duels are clashes of titans.

Harry vs Voldemort is a clash of wills, since Harry can use Dumbledore's mana-techniques to freeze the Horcruxes.
