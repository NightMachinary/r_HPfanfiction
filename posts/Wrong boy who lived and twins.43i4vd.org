Ok, so I've seen a few of these stories, and some are actually good. I just wish that people would leave Harry as the BWL, and focus their story on the twin. I don't understand why take a character we all know and...love, and then completely change everything except the name and looks. It sort of ruins it for me. Do such stories exist, am I simply looking in the wrong tags? Or do people just not leave Harry as Harry, and write about an original character? Because if he isn't a Horcrux, Gryffindor, friends with R&H, dating Ginny, then how is he Harry?

So anyway, I'd like to read a story where Harry is a twin, and James and Lily don't die, but Dumbledore obliviates them and sends them and the twin overseas with new identities, for Dumbledorian reasons, and everything in Harry's life is canon, or at least having the oc twin be the evil one rather than Harry


** While I'm afraid I don't have any stories for you, I can answer this:

Simply because he isn't canon!Harry doesn't mean he isn't Harry Potter. Many stories do take the changes too far and make him an entirely different person, true, but that is often because the changes are wild jumps in personality that have no transitional connection. Nurture versus Nature is often debated for a good reason, as Nurture shapes a good amount of our lives while Nature often has an unseen effect as well.

Depending on when and how the changes take place, Harry can grow up to be a completely different person because he learned different lessons early on. A good author will then apply these lessons going forward, and depending on the lessons AU!Harry can grow closer or further away from what he was in canon. A good author can also make AU!Harry /feel/ like canon Harry by having him learn lessons such as self-blaming and sarcasm, things canon!Harry was known for.

tl;dr - a good author can make AU!Harry feel like Canon!Harry even if he isn't.

*** Awesome, thank you very much, I can understand now, and in fact, I think I can look back on a couple of stories I've read and enjoyed and realize that it is still Harry, just raised differently. I think it's interesting to note that a lot of authors seem to believe a Harry raised differently wouldn't be friends with Ron or Hermione.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** Yeah, I can see that now, [[/u/Averant]] pointed out why. As long as it is still Harry and not a Marty Stu with Harry's name, because some of them really do feel like a MS, and I wonder why they don't just make it an OC instead of stealing Harry's name.

**** Have you ever read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi)?

Harry in the story is essentially an OC, but his brother Nathan is canon!Harry. The fic would be much worse if it was from the point of view of the OC brother. I think this is just because we know and love Harry Potter even if he is different from the books. It is much harder to become emotionally invested in an OC.

***** That was the one that sparked my question. In my mind, Nathan pretty much is original Harry in all but name, (and not being the Potter heir, which doesn't seem to matter so much), so why change them around? I get what you are saying though, it's just that in my case I enjoy OC's a lot, that aren't obvious self-inserts. It's more the HP world I enjoy reading about, rather than Harry himself.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I read one where James and Lily lived overseas with secret twins but it was a Light Bashing Harrymort one. Like that exact thing but Harry was really mad when he found out. Included time travel.

*** I'm not too keen on time travel, because I can't quite wrap my head around how it works, but as long as it isn't too wibbly-wobbly-ish, I'd be interested it reading it, do you have the link? By the phrase "Light Bashing Harrymort" do you mean that Harry connects with his darker side? Because I quite enjoy Dark Harry as well, if it's believable.
