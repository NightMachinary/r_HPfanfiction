So I'm really into the someone-other-than-the-Dursleys-raises-Harry thing at the moment, and I've finally decided to give Innocent a go. I really enjoyed the start but now I'm past chapter 60 and it's still going and its just getting a bit slow. I've really liked the character development, and that there isn't any of that Lord-Potter-Black rubbish or Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, but the plots got soooo slow. I guess I'm wondering if it's worth sticking with - people that have finished it/read the sequels, can you help me out? Does the plot pick up and get interesting again? Are the characters still well written later on or not? And is the most recent one still being updated, because I don't want to committ to reading and then find its been abandoned. Also, any recs for any other good Harry-raised-by-other people would be appreciated! Cheers!


** I also stumbled ober this series about a week ago and continued to read all three parts (or as much of it as is released right now) in 3-4 days.

The character building is in my opinion one of the best I have seen in any fanfiction so far. The plot is slow, but that doesn't mean nothing is happening: interesting interactions, character building and foreshadowing are everywhere.

The foreshadowing in particular is excellent. Seemingly unimportant things are introduced and only used dozens of chapters later (sometimes even it even spans the sequels).

The end of innocent was also great in my opinion.

I can only recommend reading on, but at the same time I DO like slow stories, where the build-up might take forever, but I get a huge payoff in return.

** I just finished this story a few days ago. The story is really slow after the trial, I felt that most of it could have been left out. I'm about halfway through the sequel and the plot is interesting. The character development is well done too. The third part is still being updating regularly.

** I always get this fic confused with Linkffn(The Wise One) for some reason. So if you haven't read that one, you might enjoy it.

I liked Innocent, but I never bothered to read the other two fics.

** The story is slow burning but the plot is interesting

It peaks on the trial and the last part of innocent is really not that good as the first part.

Initiate Covers Year 1 Hogwarts and it differs enough from canon that its interesting

you should keep reading just because the whole Draco plot

** Did you already read the trial chapters? IMO it gets slow after that, I quit some ways into the second one.

I've heard here that the author still updates weekly, though, I think if I could get all the way through it, it would be kinda nice to have a dependable little update every week, so I'm really curious about whether the second and third one get better also. I really respect the author for writing as much as they have.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** The series as a whole is really good; it has two sequels already so far.

I think a lot of the first 'book', in respect of that, is setting up and worldbuilding. Stick with it, just so you know the characters. Or you could pop ahead into the first sequel and nip back to Innocent as needed if you need to work out who a character is.

I can't remember off the top of my head what the divisions are like, but Harry goes to Hogwarts and a lot of canon characters make an appearance at a later date. This series also has one of my fave depictions of Lupin and Sirius - non-slash, which is rare for me to give praise to, given Wolfstar is probably my OTP.
