The Snape of this prompt is not an asshole and Harry doesn't read!AU


** In canon, Hermione knew the answers, so they probably were in the book.

Snape is still an asshole though, because he singled out one student for no good reason. And no reasonable teacher would expect most students to have read their textbooks before the first class, unless they were somehow told to beforehand.

*** What people forget or might not know is that Snape was a representation of the evil teacher of those times, the kind of teacher for which "Another brick in the wall" was written. JK might have been a student during Pink Floyd's rise to popularity.

** A Snape who's not a pathetic, vindictive, abusive arsehole, isn't actually Snape, but a Skrull agent who's obviously about to fail his assignment, because he couldn't immerse himself into the role!

** I feel like a non-arsehole snape simply wouldn't single Harry out and ask those questions.

Thinking about the idea further, Snape is important enough to the cannon story that changing his character in such a major way would result in a very different plot progression, even if the story starts in basically the same place.

It's a potentially interesting change but far to easy to handle it poorly.
