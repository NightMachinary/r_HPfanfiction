If someone requests fics with vague criteria like "nothing too popular, I read all of those already", is it okay to look up their username in ffn, look through their favorites/bookmarked lists and check that they don't have the fic you want to recommend already there?


** why wouldn't it be ok? Unless you're getting their ffn name via some creepy cyber voodoo, that is.

** It could be perceived as creepy, but you know your own motivations, and it's 100% fine to go the extra mile to help others.

** that seems like a bit too much effort. I'd just recommend the fic anyways and hope they haven't read it.

** I wouldn't go as far as checking FFN, but I think it makes sense to briefly check someone's reddit history to see if they've ever mentioned disliking certain tropes, pairings, etc. Many people have different usernames on reddit, so Googling to find their FFN profile would be a waste of time in most cases anyway.

** I stalk reddit histories all the time and I think that's worse.
