Hey fellow fanfic readers!

This might be an odd post but I was wondering if it is possible for someone random like me to become a beta reader / grammar checker for Harry Potter fan fictions? I love reading a lot of fan fiction and it annoys me slightly that the grammar is off. It isn't that big of a deal because the grammar mistakes are so far and few but they are still there. So I thought I would like to become a beta reader for a recently new fan fiction so I can help improve the story / check and correct the grammar.

Any suggestions is much appreciated. Have a nice day!

(Sorry if flair is wrong kind of new to this)


** I'd be interested but only if you're ok with extremely slow updates. I'd like to finish the story before posting chapters because otherwise I feel like I'd end up leaving people hanging. I'm focusing on not coughing up a lung right now and my head is so stuffed that creative writing is difficult but I could get a chapter to you late next week. If this sounds too slow I totes won't take offense if you decide to beta elsewhere.

*** I would love to give it a try but I just read Lindsiria's comment and I don't think I have the qualifications to actually re-write a fanfic. I might have bit of more than I can chew. I think I would be best to correct grammar and improve sentences or paragraphs and I do have stuff to add to a story / find, identify and correct plotholes.\\
But I would still like to try if you want.

**** That actually sounds great. I'm not looking for a co-writer just someone who can make sure it makes sense on paper and is grammatically correct. I'll PM you sometime next week with the first chapter if that works for you. Thanks!

** What're your qualifications?

Do you have an English Degree?

Do you write?

What is your primary purpose as a beta? Just grammar or improving word choice, solving plot holes, etc, etc?

Beta readers are always in demand, as anyone wishing to improve on their writing will want one. You will want to be careful with who you pick, however, as it's awful to be a beta for a fic that you are not interested in, or because the writer refuses to listen to your advice (personally experienced this. It sucks).

Good writers, the ones you really want to beta for, usually don't need someone to look over just their grammar. They want someone who can actively improve their story beyond grammar. Making characters sound more in-character, solving plot holes, helping with word choice to make the reader feel more. That is true beta'ing.

A friend of mine just edited my first chapter in this way, and it's glorious. If you are interested, you can take a look. I'm always interested in beta-readers, especially as I don't plan on posting my story until it is complete (meaning heavy edits). However, I am looking for beta-readers that go far beyond grammar.

*** Hmm okay I might have bit off more than I can chew. I don't really have any qualifications. I don't have an English Degree although I get A+ on assignments in university in my home country. I never liked to write stories myself but have always loved to identify and correct plotholes, correct grammar / improve certain paragraphs - sentences and lay small eastereggs early on in a story to use later on.

I can see I am in no way qualified to actually be a beta tester. Well I might still try and see if I can start out as a really horrible one and then improve along the way.

**** Demanding an English degree is ridiculous. My beta is wonderful and certainly doesn't have an English degree.

Just offer your services and see which writers are interested. You'll probably have so many writers wanting your services, you'll have to turn some away.

**** I don't think it's necessarily true that you're not qualified simply because you don't have an English degree. It really depends on what the writer needs from you. Some might just be looking for you to proofread and check for flow and consistency, while others might want a complete overhaul.

Imo, the most important qualification to have is strong knowledge of grammar and vocab, as well as knowledge of the fandom you're working with.

**** If you have discord and if you're interested in a self insert into Harry Potter himself story, PM me on Reddit or on discord (okmangeez#8905).

I mainly need story ideas (not grammar) and I'm eager for any suggestions.

**** I didn't mean that all beta readers should have English degrees. It was more to see what your qualifications are. I've met some beta readers who really don't have the grasp of grammar in the English language.

Like I mentioned, you should be able to find fic's to beta easily, as they are always in demand. Just make sure you like the fic you are reading before offering to beta (or be okay with turning them down if it isn't your thing).

Practice makes perfect after all. Your skills will expand as you beta.

** Yes, you can!

I am looking for the Beta reader myself. Just read anything in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/]] tell me why it is a crap (PM me for the email address), and I will be very thankful for it. Yes, grammar checking is good as well, as is the brit-picking, but I would need somebody who can think about the whole plot (or lack of thereof), about the structure of dialogues, etc.

That's beta-reading, if I understand things correctly.

I am currently just browsing through and reading one of your stories called James & Me: Accident. Do you have a discord account? If so please feel free to pm me your username on Reddit and I will add you. I already have some grammar based corrections as well some story based improvements.

** It might be helpful to look up or make a thread asking what beta readers and editors do, then seeing what of that you think you're able to do. Some people will want more, some people will want less, but asking a lot of people and checking a lot of sources will help you get a good average idea of what you'd be doing.

If you think it's something you'd be happy to do, the Fanfiction reddit has a beta-finder thread day (check the sidebar calendar there to find out exactly when that day is), FFnet has a beta-reader function, and I believe Dark Lord Potter has some functionality to place beta-readers with appropriate writers. You could also post again here and offer your services, then talk it through with whomever you get responses from in order to find the best match for you. Good luck to you, Overkaer. :)

**** Sure. Happy to help. Just don't lose motivation either way. If it's something you're interested in doing, there's plenty of places to find advice on it. eg. search this subreddit for 'beta' in the search bar at the top and you'll get every thread mentioning the topic here.
