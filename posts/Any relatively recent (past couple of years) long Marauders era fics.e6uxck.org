I can never get enough of Hogwarts era James Sirius and Remus (and Peter I suppose). Any recent 60k+ word fics? It feels as if I've exhausted all the classics.


** These are all unfinished, but at least the first two update regularly.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/chapters/33372651]]) This one feels pretty canon compliant, is well-written and does a good job of bringing in other characters than just the Marauders.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19900360/chapters/47135293]]) This one is very explicit/a bit dark when descrbing teenage life, and also very funny. I think the characterisation and different dynamics of MWPP is spot on.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12968535/chapters/29646957]]) This one has a unique plot and is Lily's point of view. Feels a bit American but not necessarily in a bad way.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013]]) Another unique plot, extremely good characterisation and very funny and with some explicit scenes. I'm a bit heartbroken that it hasn't updated for so long, because it's very closed to finished.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.
