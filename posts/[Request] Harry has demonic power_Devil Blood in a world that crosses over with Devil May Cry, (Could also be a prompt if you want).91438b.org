Perhaps Harry was given to the Order of the Sword from DMC4 and his is a artificial Demon, maybe Harry makes a Deal with a demon to help destroy Voldemort, maybe a quirk of fate means that Lily and James children are always part demonic/supernatural other than Their Wizarding abilities. And as much as I hate it maybe one of his parents cheated on the other. Maybe they were manipulated by Dumbledore to make Harry a Half demon through a ceremony so he could better fit the prophecy

Basically anything. If you want anyone can use this as a prompt if you want DMC is fun as fuck especially the universe of you just look past the games, Demons are plentiful enough that Dante can make a entire company around slaying them and pay out to multiple people and have 2 or more locations active (Trish, Lady ,Dante Himself, Enzo in the past, Morrison, Nero, Kyrie, and the new girl Nico from the DMC5 Trailer), Humans with enough training can swing around shoulder mounted rocket launchers like they are just wooden mop sticks, and even match half Demons and Full Demons in combat, who themselves are capable of some Superhero type shit, like catching actual fired bullets with his teeth or ignoring being stabbed a half dozen times, throwing his sword hard enough for it to become super heated.

This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it is a crossover with DMC, as well as other fandoms like Fairy Tale, Ramna, etc.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
