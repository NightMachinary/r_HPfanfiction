Does anyone have a recommendation for a fic that features Harry responding in a realistic manner to canon-level Dursley abuse? Not one that cranks it up to 11 with crazy bearings or other abuse or just brushes it off.


** Different kids react differently, obviously, but if you look closely to canon, it's not off the mark. Harry has difficulties socializing with people (although part of it is Rowling trying to keep the amount of characters down) to the point he is only really friend of two people, despite being in the Quidditch team. He doesn't get to know the rest of his classmates. He is bullied twice at Hogwarts, which also likely points to a more introvert personality or other character trait that makes him a target from a bully's point of view. He's shut down from Hermione's impossible schedule during PoA even though Ron tells him over and over how something is up. And he eventually ends up suicidal.

  Harry supposes he'll never know how they learned about the cupboard under the stairs. He also supposes he'll never know how they managed to make him so afraid of it, all these years later.

** I'm also on the lookout for that sort of plot! I get what you mean about the 'turned up to 11'. There was a big surge of HP fics for a long time that were based on 'A Child Called It' with whole scenes ripped from that book.

** Away Childish Things by Lettered ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033]]) fits the bill. Lettered deals with the long term consequences of child abuse in a rather convincing way. It's a de-aging fic and a case fic that shows the (negative) effects of both Harry and Draco's upbringing. It is also very well written an plotted. Highly recommended
