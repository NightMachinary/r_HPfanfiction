** You've probably read a lot of these, but I'll share them anyways, in case anyone else hasn't:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]]: (COMPLETE) It's a very good fic that I think appeals to the same audience as Too Young to Die. It's very well written. (From ff.net): H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise]]: (IN PROGRESS) It's fairly well-written, and very interesting. (From ff.net): This story chronicles the rise of Harry Potter, the right hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Features a dark Harry in Slytherin, from pre-hogwarts to the end of the war. Harry knew nothing of the wizarding world until a teacher from a mysterious school visited him and told him the tale of his father, catapulting him into a world of intrigue, politics and Power.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control]]: (PROBABLY ABANDONED) This Harry is extremely dark, and the story reads very well. If only it got updated. (From ff.net): I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10859387/1/Heartless-Harry][Heartless Harry]]: (ONESHOT) Explores sociopathic Harry, a really interesting read. Definitely would recommend. (From ff.net): When Petunia had to allow her hated nephew into her home, she'd expected troubles to arise sooner or later. Nothing though could have prepared her for the reality of what was to come. The boy sleeping under her roof, eating her food, wasting her money, was no normal child, oh no. It was an evil little demon hiding beneath innocent features. My take on sociopath!Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][The Prisoner's Cipher]] (IN PROGRESS/ABANDONED): Very well-written and very interesting. (From ff.net): AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

**** Yeah I agree, it felt kinda slapped together in the end. I definitely didn't expect it to end there. Its rise was good though.

** Too Young to Die is probably my favorite dark Harry fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] Completely OP Harry, its only compelling to me due to its descriptions of magic and situations he finds himself in. Also amusing in that he is time travel Harry, and is working hard to corrupt canonish Harry (due to the time travel he accidently saved his parents).

I recommend Cipher and Dark rise from bpile009's list.

** My favorite own so far is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8517195/1/Heir-of-Dracula][Heir of Dracula]] By: ZenoNoKyuubi

In 1895, the last time he was defeated, Count Dracula made a prophecy. His legacy would live on in the boy of lightning... His four mistresses set out on a quest to find this boy, and finds him in the boy known as Harry Potter.

It is kind of short but it covers the Hogwart years and then some.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2823892/1/Burn-Baby-Burn][Burn Baby Burn]] (Completed) This one is my favorite, I know it's just a one-shot for each year (+one pre hogwarts) but it's rather "fun". It ask the question "What if Harry was both a pyromaniac and a syciopath?" This is NOT a redemption fic!
