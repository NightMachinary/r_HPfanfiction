I just finished Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, and am a tad confused. Namely: What is that stuff with "Morgan" and Wizard Trotsky. I absolutely love the story and really want to understand. Thanks!


** I just read it too and here is what I got from it, although it is super confusing:

Lily of the present time was obliviated and lost her memories of everything and somehow ended up in the past. She worked for Morfin Gaunt as a servant named Morgan Lily Gaunt (Since she forgot her name). She occasionally had flashbacks of the Dursleys and other memories.

Young Tom Riddle goes to gaunt house to kill his relatives. Finds Morgan (amnesiac Lily) working for Gaunt, becomes her friend. Puts her in a coma/statis and tells her he will revive her after he does his dark lord thing since he doesn't want her to get in the way.

Tom Riddle goes on to make first horcrux with diary, splits his soul. One half gets stuck in Diary. This is Wizard Trotsky, he released the basilisk and has been causing problems at Hogwarts in the present since Malfoy gave diary to Ginny.

The main soul half apparently forgets where he left Morgan/Lily in statis or got distracted or something. Goes on to get followers and become a dark lord. Tries to kill Ellie Potter (young Lily), another part of soul becomes Wizard Lenin (Lily's Horcrux). The events of the fic happen after.

In present, Lily disappears (To time travel back as amnesiac servant Morgan, not sure what happened?). Diary Horcrux, Wizard Trostky goes to where he left Morgan (amnesiac Lily from the past) and revives her. The last chapter is from Morgan's POV with Wizard Trotsky (Diary Horcrux). She has occasional memories of being present Lily and often thinks of wizard Trosrky as being "wrong" since she is thinking of Wizard Lenin who was her Horcrux before.

In the end, there is the main soul piece without a body doing whatever it was he did in canon before the triwizard tournament. There is Wizard Lenin, Lily's Horcux with his own body who is now gathering followers or being a revolutionary. And there is Wizard Trotsky, diary horcrux who is hanging out with Morgan and being depressed or something.

**** Can you explain that more? So he obliviated present Lily and gave her memories of being Morgan?

****** That would also make sense now that I think about it. The reason I went with the time traveling theory is because Lily seems to be present in many time lines and that Lenin mentions something about once having a friend who looks like her. Although I may have completely misremembered what he actually said so who knows.

*** I don't think your timeline is correct.

My reading of it is that in the present before any time travel has happened Trotsky obliviates Lily during second year and replaces her actual life's memories with similar but fake ones of her being a Gaunt, possibly in attempt to make her into the person he met when he was young(who is Lily, but further on in Lily's timeline than the story is yet). After the obliviation they immediately go hide in the Riddle Manner for a bit, then go to Diagon Alley when that is compromised. The 50 years stasis thing is just how he explained to her why her fake memories are from 50 years ago. The Lily/Morgan in the current chapter has not yet traveled back in time at all, she is about to though, and will then meet young Tom Riddle at Wool's Orphanage. At some future point in the story she will also travel back even further and create the Lily Riddle crime organization(Pretty sure they say Lily Riddle first showed up in a time period that predates Tom Riddle's childhood, but don't feel like looking it up.)

So the timeline would be

Sept 1991 to Christmas 1991: Lily goes to Hogwarts and faces squirrel

Christmas to Sept 1992: Lily destroys Albania

Sept 1992 to a couple chapters ago, forget what month they were in, lets just call it Christmas 1992: Second year, Lily creates the body for Lennin, Trotsky opens the chamber of secrets, Trotsky frames Lennin and corners Lily in the chamber of secrets and oblivates her, replaces her memories with very similar ones with her as a Gaunt, possibly not intending to make them so similar, but Lily being Lily managed to basically just keep many of her existing memories but replaced the Dursley's with the Gaunts, hence why she also still knows pop culture references. Something happened with the basilisk too prior to this, but that is still unclear I think.

Christmas to present month: Trotsky and Morgan hide in Riddle Manner, then they go to Diagon Alley in most recent chapter

Near Future: For some reason Lily travels back in time to the mid to late 1930s.

Mid to late 1930s: Lily meets Tom Riddle, either her memories are still jumbled and so she thinks she's Morgan, and Trostky based the fake memories on this forming a loop. Or they aren't jumbled and the fake memories were just so she would listen to and trust him. Or somewhere in between. She is present when Dumbledore stops by to give him his letter and fake burns the closet she is hiding in scarring Tom Riddle for life.

**** That timeline does seem more plausable, you are probably right. I have never thought about the closet incident though, haha. That scene becomes quite messed up if Lily is hiding in the closet. I can see Tom Riddle being traumatized by believing his friend burned to death, no wonder he hates Dumbledore.

***** Lnnin says explicitly that his friend was hiding in the wardrobe in chapter 17.

#+begin_quote
  "As it stands Dumbledore and I are not the only ones in this room."

  She looked at him with raised eyebrows, looking around the room for a moment which really appeared to contain only them, the boy, and the younger Albus Dumbledore.

  "Well, yes, we're here too."

  He made some dissatisfied noise, glancing at her slightly as if disapproving, before clarifying, "No, we don't count. Remember I told you I once had a friend."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  His face twisted into an expression of displeasure at the memory of it but he nodded tightly, "Yes, although this was long before that occurred. Regardless right now she is hiding in the wardrobe."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "It was the illusion of fire." Wizard Lenin, the normal Wizard Lenin, said softly as he walked into the center of the room once again his footsteps echoing in the silence, "Only a few seconds later she was rolling out of the wardrobe perfectly unscathed and all my other possessions untouched. Nevertheless it remains that in this moment, in this one single moment, I lost everything at the whims of that man."

** This is my take on it, I could be wrong though.

So at some point in the future of Lily's timeline she will travel to the past and meet a young Tom Riddle, prior to him turning 11, and become good friends with him. Trotsky, being a 16 year old Tom Riddle himself, remembers her vividly. He is saddened when he encounters her that she doesn't remember him, indicating that time travel shenanigans have occurred and that the Lily 11 year old Tom Riddle knew is present Lily's future.

After Trotsky frames Lenin for the chamber of secrets he corners Lily and obliviates her. Then he replaces her memories with ones of her being a Gaunt. Either because it's easier for minds to fill in the blanks with familiar things, or as some result of Lily being Lily, her memories are extremely similar to her actual life just with the Dursley's subbed out for the Gaunts and her name being Morgan. Trotsky presumably either does this to attempt to turn Lily into the friend he had when he was 11, or just in a general attempt to get her to be on his side. Because all his relatives were dead in 1981 when Lily was born and thus couldn't have conceived her, he makes the fake memories be from 50 years ago and then tells her she was in stasis for 50 years so that she can still be related to him and be 12 in the present. They hide out in the Riddle Manner for a bit, then go to Diagon alley. At some point, most likely in the near future, Lily will travel back in time to when Tom Riddle was a kid and meet him at Wool's Orphanage. Whether or not she still has her memories jumbled and thinks she's Morgan when that happens I am not sure. Its possible she does, and that this is what Trotsky based the Morgan persona on in the first place, creating a stable time loop. Or maybe she doesn't, and the Morgan person was just so she would trust/listen/like him rather than Lenin. She will be present when Dumbledore comes with Tom's hogwarts letter, but she will be hiding in some piece of furniture. Dumbledore will fake light the furniture on fire when Tom acts like a little shit. This will scar Tom for life.
