The newly elected government demanded the delivery of black to number 10, “as a Show of good faith Between the Muggle and magical British governments.” Cornelius still didn't understand the logic or the demands of the newly elected Muggle Prime Minister he was a strange Fellow , named Romulus Leapwind. A man one of his Auror swore was an old schoolmate(Remus Lupin's) Doppelgänger but that Poppycock was just Too outlandish to be believed, Imagine a werewolf the Muggle Prime Minister. Even if the man did have an adorable ward named Harry Potter the little was a ginger not the trade mark Potter ebony. It all just had to be a coincidence, even if the Auror informed him Leapwind told them to chain Black in the old dungeon of 10 Downing St. thatthe general public that was an old bomb shelter. But what did Cornelius care They got to trade a mass murderer in exchange for the continued cooperation of the Muggle government from his position the exchange was a win-win either way not matter the strange Coincidences.


** This is a decent premise. Edited, style shifted, and this could make for a good story.
