Okay, so, stop me if this one's been done before.

--------------

Magic originates as psychic force, willpower imposed upon the world. Anything or anyone with the ability to think, remember, synthesize information, and such, has the potential to manifest magical power.

Yes, unintelligent creatures can use the power of magic, but they rely on the magical residue left by those who can create it; the magical energies themselves must originate from imagination.

Why, then, don't the Muggles have magic? The answer is, they did. All humans had magic, once.

Once upon a time, long, /long/ ago, places like Sumer, Egypt and Atlantis were magical kingdoms, filled with wonder by humans using the power of magic.

Though many of the kings and queens of these lands were kind and just, a few were not.

One such cruel king, Ubara, invented a terrible curse; a spell that would destroy the magical potential of his foes, leaving them no more capable of performing magic than common dogs.

Using the power of this Original Dark Magic, Ubara swept the land, shredding the magic of anyone who tried to challenge him and establishing himself as the supreme tyrant of the ancient world.

Fortunately, though Ubara's magic could stave off death, he was never truly immortal, and he died 600 years into his reign.

However, his victims remained cursed; not only was their magic broken, utterly inaccessible to them, but their children, and their children's children, and each and every single one of their descendants, suffered a similar lack of magic.

With very few magically-capable survivors of Ubara's reign, the ancient world stagnated for centuries, while humans struggled to reinvent their civilization to live without the power of magic.

They succeeded; every Muggle today is a descendant of a damaged survivor from Ubara's reign, similarly, those few wizards and witches living today are descendants of those who escaped his wrath.

Muggleborns are an interesting phenomenon; the Original Dark Magic was never effective on anything but humans, so muggleborn witches and wizards are those who have genes /just/ different enough that the destroying spell doesn't affect them.

Now, what do you suppose would happen if you had a wizard or witch, or even some other magical being, hell-bent on breaking the hold that the Original Dark Magic has over Muggles?

What if each and every single one of the 7 billion Muggles on earth, were granted the power to use magic that's been denied to them for so long?

Would it be best to help this mystery wizard achieve their goal in the name of righting an ancient wrong, or would it open a king-sized can of flobberworms?


** It doesn't sound as if it needs to be fanfiction. Sounds more like an original fantasy story. Yes, write it!

*** I would so read that story, that is an amazing plot concept. Imagine Malfoy's and other purebloods having to live as muggles. No more house elves, no charms to make chores easy. No more being able to travel by apparating or the floo. The panic of the Wizarding world would be quite something.

** This sounds like a pretty amazing concept tbh. Can't imagine how insane the fic could get with billions of untrained magic users suddenly appearing. What if Hogwarts automatically tried to send out hundreds of millions of owls to these new "muggleborns".

** If you do decide to go ahead and write this, I'd suggest finding somebody who knows a bit about genealogy to work on numbers. When Sumer existed, the world population was almost certainly under 100 million. I dunno exactly what you'd end up with, but I'm certain the wizarding population in the modern day would have to be larger than we see if your scenario occurred.

It also doesn't explain everywhere else. By that time, humans had long since spread throughout the Earth. Whatever Ubara did, he certainly didn't need to do it to each individual village and town and wandering tribe, otherwise every non-western civilization would have had fully magical populations.

Also, if any sufficiently intelligent creature can perform magic, why not animals? There are lots of ways to measure intelligence, and some animals will surprise you. Dogs are incredibly socially capable, crows are creative problem solvers, whales communicate with complex vocalizations, and so on. How intelligent, and in what way, does something actually have to be in order to use magic? This isn't relevant to the overall concept, but if you are going to try to justify magic, you'll want to rethink exactly what you're going for.

I think the premise is good. That is, muggles are the result of ancient magic, and what the consequences would be of removing that magic. A lot of authors have experimented with it, myself included, but I've never actually seen it fleshed out. If muggles are the result of suppressed magic, then that suppression originally occurring in the ancient world is the most logical time, otherwise you run head-on into conflicts with recorded history. Still, if you run with this, you'll want to work on the details.

I had the same thought. Maybe instead of him cursing his enemies, he found a way to curse /everyone/ but spare those who were loyal/useful to him (his servants, armies, etc) and all wizards and witches are descended from them.

To answer the OP, fuck no would I help that guy. Humanity would last a year, tops.

A deviation to the story could be that someone finds a way to lift the curse from /individual/ muggles, not all of them. Maybe a muggleborn who is sick of being treated badly, makes himself some magical muggles to overrun the purebloods.

*** "Sufficient intelligence" likely pertains to those who are physically capable of being consciously aware of their own fallibility and yet, gaze still beyond for something perceivably unattainable. What sentience should be defined as.

*** There's a few things he could do to limit the size of the Wizarding population.

1. There's a very small amount of people who weren't cursed. Possibly only the person who made the curse.

2. Tweaking how common squibs are. If a wizard marries a muggle, then the genetics will be more like muggles, and more likely to be hit by the curse. Once people forget about the curse, this would be much more likely to happen, as they'll forget why they're intermarrying.

You mean the entire world? If he didn't conquer the entire world, other magical nations would have quickly reconquered his peoples after he died, right? But conquering the world requires magical technology at lost-civilization scale (communication, transportation, population management, etc.). Maybe he cursed the entire world but only ruled part of it?
