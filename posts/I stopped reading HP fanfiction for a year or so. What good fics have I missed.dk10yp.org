***** I think some of it is that the writing a book a chapter at a time approach fanfic authors use encourages much longer stories versus writing the whole thing out and then editing it. If you have the whole thing written it's easier to cut out a lot of bloat and streamline in a way you cant when doing one chapter at a time.

Also HP fics specifically often cover seven years, which was seven actual books in canon. So comparing a seven year fic to a single book's length isn't really fair.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.

Like, there doesn't seem to be an overearching plot, and the MC doesn't experience much character growth. It made it hard for me to stay interested.

Doesn't help that the author is kind of whiny. Honestly, WTR reminds me of Taylor Varga. They both jumped ship from SB over something really minor, except WTR left SB /and/ SV.

******** Elements don't have to specifically further the plot in order to "add something to the story".

I was (re)reading Innocent recently, and there's a scene where Sirius explains to Harry that dust bunnies are accumulations of magic that occur when magical houses aren't maintained, and he transforms into Padfoot to chase them. It wasn't anything necessary to the storyline; it could have been dropped and no one would notice. But it was cute, it develops Sirius as a character (and Kreacher, actually), and it helped to flesh out the world.

With This Ring does that too, interacting with dozens of characters in ways that don't just further the protagonist's goals, but also demonstrate those characters' personalities, highlight and perhaps fix problems that they canonically face, or alternatively, have them create extra problems. "What Would an Orange Lantern Do?" /is/ the story, and as such, very little of what happens is truly "meaningless fluff".

********* You're absolutely correct, not every little thing has to add something to the overall plot. That said, I do believe that those instances that could easily be removed without affecting the story should be kept relatively few in number - there should never be more of them than scenes that /do/ add to the story.

WTR conists almost entirely of those scenes. You could cut out the vast majority of the story and not lose all that much. It makes it very hard to get invested in anything the character is trying to achieve because I know I'm going to have to get through the length of a small novel just to get a single chapter relating to those goals.

A big issue I have with the story is that the it is very /routine/. A problem occurs. Paul goes and fixes it somehow. Onto the next thing. The constant repetition of that cycle made the story very boring and predictable. I couldn't get engaged at all. Why should I care about these meaningless sidestories that don't have any sort of emotional payoff? I don't read stories for the sake of reading them. I want to get invested in what's going on. WTR makes it nigh-impossible to do so.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

*** I support this. I've caught up with the latest chapter, and it has been amazing so far. It highlights a lot of the character flaws in a constructive way (especially Molly and Hermione), and has a lot of angst for a teenager.

The cherry on top is the fact that it gets updated twice a week, I read some other fanfictions as well but the main problem is that they get updated once a month, and considering how long the chapters are, you'll end up waiting years for it to conclude, unlike Fate. I hope the fanfictions keeps going like this.

** Three Black Birds - linkffn(13247979) - An AU fic with WBWL. Harry is 2 years older, in the twins' year.

Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts - linkffn(13230151) - Harry uses magic before Hogwarts and bases it on pen and paper RPGs.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament - linkffn(13140418) - A very rich story set in the 4th year, obviously. Probably one of the best, if not the best, constantly updated ones currently.

The Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - A quite nice Daphne/Harry romance/destruction of Voldemort via the importance of intent.

Those are probably 4 of the best, for me, stories either completed or constantly updated.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events.

** I have been enjoying New Blood - Linkffn(13051824)

It is a Slytherin Hermione fic, and one of the best written stories on the site IMO. Not finished yet, but it gets like 2 updates a week and has kept to that schedule for the past year or so. The prose is good, and it avoids a lot of the tropes and power creep that these kinds of stories tend to have. It also gives characterization not only to the Slytherins, but also many of the Ravenclaws.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

It's not your usual fic but it works and holy shit does it work. No cap GOAT of fics, and best thing it updates twice a week and is long. Very long.

Some might not like it as it is a Ron fic, but just know Ron isnt the only POV, in a chapter there are at least 5 or y different POV's. It's just Ron is a centric character, like Walt in Breaking Bad.

Seriously check it out!

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

  Harry James Potter is what is now known as a World Jumper. Accompanied by his gorgeous but deadly mother and his many lovelies, they sow chaos, mayhem and disorder everywhere they went.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
