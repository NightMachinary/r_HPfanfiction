The above as in he can travel through time either by magic or machine.

Thanks, Warryn.


** Huh, don't think I've ever seen one where he has a time machine. I'm now imagining Harry using a big steampunk time machine, ala... well, The Time Machine.

*** This i've read as well, but it's more dimensional traveling than time traveling.

Thabks anyway, Warryn.

** Time travel is usually a one-off thing. /Consensual/ time travel is rare. And I don't think I've /ever/ seen a fic where Harry can travel through time at will /and uses it/. Here's some almost-fitting fics.

linkffn(/Harry Potter and the Time Snafu/) Harry semi-randomly travels through time.

linkao3(/A Jaunt Through Time/) "Time travel minus angst equals this."

linkao3(/A Good Teacher/) Harry teaches Harry.

linkffn(/The Anachronistic Adventures of Patch and Eddie/) Harry and Dobby on adventures through time.

linkffn(/The Wizard Who Meddled With Time/) Harry is a chronomancer! Exactly what you're looking for. Except he uses it like...once.

linkao3(/Temport/) Luna tests the temporal portkey. Guess who gets to retrieve her. Has as sequel oneshot.

linkffn(/Retroactive/) Luna and Harry get up to temporal shenanigans after the Department of Mysteries.

linkffn(/Timely Errors/) A History of Magic class becomes quite literal.

  Harry takes a chance in hope of saving Sirius from the Veil, assisted by Luna and some stolen Time Turners. Working with Luna comes with its own complications, though.

  Terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time. When that wizard is Harry Potter, the terrible things tend to happen to other people instead. Fourth Year. Time Travel.

  WIP. PostOotP. Harry gave his life to defeat Voldemort. So what should he do now? Hop through time with Dobby on some zany misadventures, of course. As if there really was an alternative.

  The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop.Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it.OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.

  Harry has a little "accident" with a easily-swallowed Time-Turner. Yes, an "accident". Ultra crack.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
