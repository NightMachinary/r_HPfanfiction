I know I'm multiple years late, but I recently re-read my favorite Draco romance fic and now decided to write my own. :')

Warning: It's romance with smut, so NSFW. It's also quite non-canon since main characters are 18-22, Hogwarts is also a college and many late main events happen later and a little different.

Mainly looking for someone to read through it and let me know if it's worth continuing. Aside from what's posted rn, there's also 2-3 chapters in review/making, if you are interested to help me proofread and let me know if things sound or read weird or things are not happening fast enough/too fast. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25257547/chapters/61231243]])
