Usually killing curse is depicted as unblockable except by a solid object or harry potter. So, does a matter state affect killing curse, and how big for a matter to block killing curse? Does a donut placed in the path of a killing curse made it smaller, as small as the hole of the donuts?


** Man, I've seen people try to argue that clothing is a physical barrier that can stop the Killing Curse. That leads to arguments about porosity and splash damage and things like that.

The truth is that some suspension of disbelief is necessary when thinking about the mechanics of spells. Like, they're not actually light. They won't travel infinitely through space. They're not lasers or energy beams either. Nor would you think that magic would get messed up in a normal rain.

So, I guess the real question here is "how thick is a spell?" My guess is that it's not a uniform thing, and varies by spell. Some people would try to talk about the viscosity of a spell or the size of the spellflare, but that's not really something that I have any interest in reading about in a story. But, if I were to write it, I'd have the Killing Curse have enough power behind it that it would go right through the donut, no precision necessary. It's still magic, after all, and it shouldn't be treated like a joke.

** This post made me realize that I basically treated the Killing Curse like a bullet.

Anything a normal 5.56 could puncture, the Killing Curse can as well. At least I realized that was how I thought about it. I'm not entirely sure if it would make sense. Probably not.

*** I treat it like a million tiny droplets making up a whole. If there's space for a droplet to pass through, all of it is not stopped. So a shirt wouldn't stop the curse but a steel plate would.

Edit: also, by thickness. A micron thick steel plate wouldnt disperse the spell in time, killing the person. Ten microns thick? Probably still too thin.

***** It depends on the story for me. In one i might say holding a shield would stop it, in another i might decide the shield would act as a conduit for the spell.

***** One story had harry using a gravestone dispenser to block spells, going with the holiness of a gravestone/literalism of the gravestone used in book 4. I hated that story, I think.

** I've also thought about this unblockable curse. Surely someone must have tried creating a shield charm that would work, like one that conjured a physical shield rather than a normal one, which mostly seem to be pure energy/magic.

What I conclude is that the object must be capable of withstanding the force of the curse. So, a chunk of marble would probably stop it, but a snowflake or water drop would be either brushed aside or disbursed. But Crouch jr claimed that the entire class could cast it and not give him a nosebleed - so possibly a weak AK could be blocked by a tissue. Whereas I suspect a Voldemort AK would obliterate the tissue.

As for the doughnut hole - I imagine the curse working like light.

*** But it couldn't work like light. The spell is depicted as being a bolt that can be dodged, and Harry notably blocked it by hitting it with another spell as it was flying towards him. If it worked like light, it couldn't do that.

I think it's more likely that a doughnut would either be blasted away or would not obstruct it at all, rather than, say, narrowing the beam.

****** That was a special effect with the wands though. With any other wand he would have just been dead (assuming it was Avada Kadavra that Voldemort cast there, I honestly can't remember off the top of my head). It wasn't a block to the curse.

** The curse itself has some physical properties. It imparts at least some level of kinetic force and can be blocked with solid objects.

Matter stats do matter when you consider that we all live in an atmosphere. Air is not a vacuum after all.

** The Killing Curse requires intent to kill, so we can see that intent is part of the magic. Which tells me that intent is also vital in the blocking of said curse. If a wizard conjures a donut to block (ignoring, of course, Gamp's law of whatever), the donut's hole doesn't really matter. It's a part of the donut in the mind of the wizard and will block the curse.

When we get to thinner objects, such as tissues or screens, I think they may or may not work depending on the strength of the intent behind them. It seems to me this would be similar to the Imperius: a stronger-willed wizard can overpower a weaker-willed. Instead of a longer struggle, it would be decided in a moment.

It's also interesting to note that clothes do not stop the Curse, nor any spell used in the books. This works into the intent theory, as the clothes a wizard wears are considered by both the wizard and the attacker to be part of the wizard, though somewhat separate. If a Killing Curse hits Snape's billowing cloak as it streams out behind him, no damage is done because in that instance it is separate from him. But if it hits a segment of the cloak that is actually covering him, that is part of him at the moment and he dies.

Alternately, we could just expect that JKR didn't put that much thought into the mechanics of her magic system and went instead for telling a story.

** On a similar note, what if a person gets hit in the toe or their pinky or something? Logically it should kill them anyways, but it seems kind of silly to me.
