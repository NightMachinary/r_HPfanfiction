Hey guys,

another request from me (obviously...I know):

This time I'd like you to recommend me your best fanfictions with a Dumbledore who is sorry for what he did to Harry and tries to make it up to him (unlike the canon Dumbledore who kind of seemed to think a little tough "love" is good for people, otherwise he IMHO would have blown up on the Dursleys and would have cracked down on bullying and slurs in Hogwarts, which he never did!)

Bonus points if he is actively fighting the war (not reacting to Voldemort and only gathering - next to useless - information (with the exception of the Horcruxes Dumbledore's information was either so useless as to not be worth acting on or so bad/outdated that the Order couldn't act on it!)) and maybe even training Harry!

As always: Please no Slash! (Unless it is minor characters in the background)

Thanks again for your help (search functions on say [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] are kind of clumsy and I don't find new stories anymore - maybe because I am searching for the wrong things, but still having recommendations is just better, because most people have red what they recommend!)

So, the stage is your's! Go wild and show me some *censored*...Oh, sorry, wrong subreddit :D

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
