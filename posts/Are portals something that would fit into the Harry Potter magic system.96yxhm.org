When I say portals, I mean a portal from let's say, China to Finland, Russia to Australia, etc.

However, I also wonder if portals leading into other dimensions are possible the the Harry Potter universe and if they would fit there.


** I think just simply having a gateway type of thing wouldn't be whimsical enough for the HP universe.

I'm imagining something thats maybe... a waiting room. You go in from the Ministry of Magic in London and take a seat. After a while of checking out the latest Transfiguration Monthly, you get up and go out the same door, only to stand in Singapour.

Or maybe there is a pillar you need to circle as many times as there are timezones between you and your destination to get there.

In short: I think portals fit, if they aren't just... you know... portals.

*** King's Cross, Platform 9^{3/4}. Floo powder. One's a portal, the other's a flame-powered wormhole.

Between those, expanded spaces, time turners, and apparition, it's pretty clear that wizards have a good grasp of the magical mechanics of space-time.

*** I totally get it, the magic system is very quirky and particular in Harry Potter. JK Rowling does such a good job with it but it doesn't seem to be too popular with people. But what I meant through the post is the concept of a portal, not necessarily the typical ones.

**** Oh, the concept of it is already implemented, I think. The Floo and Portkeys. Those are, in broad terms, portals.

** I don't see why not. Vanishing cabinets provide instant travel to another location. This would be another form.

One way I can see to do this with mirrors is to act as a long range switching spell. The mirror switches the position of two people who have their hand against the glass on either side. The mirrors come with an accessory, an enchanted mirror frame. If there isn't anyone else nearby that wants to switch places the frame can conjure a temporary copy of you on the other side to switch with.

** I've used mirrors as portals before as a pre-floo method of transportation.

*** Mirrors isn't bad. Maybe the veil was an attempt at a portal that didn't work?

Vanishing cabinets are kind of like portals.

To me the only thing that matters is that it's whimsical, relatively convenient, and utterly, utterly uncomfortable.

*** Have you never played /Portal/, the game? Did you not watch /Incredibles 2/? Short distance portals could add a lot to combat, nevermind the practicality of having a semi-permanent way of transporting large numbers of people/things between two places that doesn't involve violent motion, flame, or flying on a broom.

** I'm thinking of writing a fic with dimensional portals actually. I was going to go with the idea that dimensional travel is genetic, and this has been transferred from Lily Evans' side of the family in a dormant form that doesn't kick in unless you have magic. It seems like it would fit into the idea of rare powers manifesting in those of “impure” blood, like Tonks. It would lead to multiple types of Harrys or his counterparts meeting each other. The only rule is that each dimension is running parallel at the same time, so the amount of time spent in another world is in real time with ones own and you'll phase into the same location equivalent in that dimension. I played around with the idea of controlling what dimension you end in with blood runes (which Harry would be reluctant to use since it's Dark Magic). It would lead to complications after Voldemort's resurrection since he would have Harry's blood, he could also gain the ability to phase through dimensions
