I'm looking for something with the deep horror. Things that we can barely comprehend. Demon summoning any kind of deep stuff like that.

Harry solves the puzzle box from Hellraiser. This does not go well for Voldemort.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/][Deathly Hallowed]] A fic centred on Lily who makes a bargain with something very, very unnatural for Harry's life. It's probably one of the most eldritch stories out there. On the other hand it's unfinished.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger Demonologist]] Definitely not horror. It's more comedy if anything, but it does involve a young Hermione summoning the Princes of Hell.

​

The Wayland Smith's series starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]], followed by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11842318/1/Traveller][Traveller]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]], has a fair amount of demon summoning and eldritch abominations. The first one touches on it mostly in an action setting, the second one is light on it and treats them as fairies, the third one seems to be shaping up (if it's continued) to be a bit more Lovecraftian.

​

This is a similar thread, although focusing on stories where Harry himself is the abomination:

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11636560/1/It-s-Always-The-Quiet-Ones]]) - Luna Lovecraft. Great one shot.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/952100/1/Leviathan-Rising]])

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1268849/1/Keep-it-Simple]])

I haven't read those for a while. IIRC it fits. Ruskbyte is a good author anyway, you should read it.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.

  Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs?

  A prequel of sorts to Leviathan Rising. Harry got through the first task of the Triwizard Tournament thanks to some good, general advice. But what if 'Moody' had given Harry some different advice?

  The year is 1927; the month, October. Credence Barebone, rescued Obscurial, works at MACUSA so that he can be kept under watch. When a strange artifact makes its way into MACUSA's hands, he is sent with Director Percival Graves to Innsmouth, Massachusetts, to discover the origins of the artifact. The secrets they uncover are far more dangerous than anyone expected.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
