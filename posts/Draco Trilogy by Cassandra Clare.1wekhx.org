*Edit 23/05/18:* All three stories can be reached here, available as EPUB, AZW3, and PDF: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsWUstaDFiN0M5aFE]]

I've handed this out via email to several people on here, so I thought I'd stick it up somewhere it could be easily downloaded by anyone. Please note the PDFs are not the original PDFs handed out by CC prior to deletion, which included images and were very large. These PDFs are a smaller filesize and are text only.

*** I know, but people still ask for it and I've had problems with a lot of spam in my email lately, so I figure better here to download for those that want to read it anyway.

*** I get accusation of "plagiarism" when it comes to fanfiction if material is taken from another fanfiction verbatim. But accusing fanfiction of plagiarism because it borrows heavily from a famous TV shows? People write and read crossovers all the time - this trilogy is basically an HP/Buffy crossover where the snarky dialogue from the later was the part that "crossed over" to HP.

**** It would be easier if you read the whole account. It'd not borrowing lines. It's stealing entire scenes. You should read avocado's account on this. I linked to it earlier.

** just an fyi - most people in the HPfandom don't particularly like her. She plagiarized most of her fics, and when someone called her out on it she tried to get that person explained from their uni. Most of her story is an entire universe based on funny lines, quotes, and scenes from popular culture. She manipulated a lot of people [her betas], is a bully, and is generally not supported. edit: here's the link [[http://failfandomanonwiki.pbworks.com/w/page/46416689/Cassandra%20Claire]] and another link [[http://www.journalfen.net/community/bad_penny/8985.html]]

*** But the stories are in a way, a piece of history. I've never read them but want to at some point, just because of what they once meant. They are hard to find too.

*** Author's summary: When an accident in Potions class turns Harry into Draco and Draco into Harry, each is trapped playing the part of the other. Romance, mistaken identities, really Cunning Plans, evil bake sales, a love triangle, and snogs galore.

It's a really old fic and very popular when it was first written. Whether it's actually good is a matter of opinion of course.

** It makes me both mad and sad that Cassandra Claire is a celebrated author while Inverarity (author of the Alexandra Quick series) can't find an agent.
