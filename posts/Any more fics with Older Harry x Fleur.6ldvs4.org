I'm looking for fics featuring an older than canon Harry in a relationship with Fleur. I've read a majority of the more fics featuring this like Knowledge is Power and Harry Potter and the Veela and was wondering if there are any more of these fics out there.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference.
