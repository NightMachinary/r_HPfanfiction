Fics almost always portray Hedwig as ultra intelligent beyond normal post owls, why not go even further. Make Hedwig the power that can defeat Voldemort. Making Hedwig a Noctowl in disguise, or giving her Superb Owl powers, some kind of Mystic Owl that is the power to win.

** If you think about it, Hedwig kinda already is "the power he knows not" Hedwig clearly l9ves harry despite the fact that she is an owl, and sacrifices herself to save him just as Lily did. In Hedwig, Harry has someone that loves him so much that she dies for him. And and while Bellatrix certainly is obsessed with Voldemort, It isn't exactly the same. Harry has people that love him, Voldemort has slaves.

** There's a series that fuses the HP world with Pokemon, wherein Animagi function by learning to fuse with one of your unevolved Pokemon at will. The Pokemon loses its ability to evolve, but gains the power of its evolved form (over time), and the fused trainer/Pokemon takes on the evolved form.

Harry names his Hoothoot Hedwig...

  Harry uses Hedwig to test the restrictions on the Goblet of Fire. Obviously, they're not good enough to stop the smartest owl in Britain!

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

*** Sinister Arrow Raid > Voldemort's entire army in Book 7 at once. Gen 7 isn't great for starters thoug. Ash's Noctowl would convince the Death eater's they're attacking Harry whilst they're attacking eeach other, and they all end up killing each other off with Avadas so Harry can escape the Graveyard. It has Hypnosishax in the the anime, and made a guy run around naked instead of capturing it.

***** More like a Piercing Hex. Or one of Archer from FSN's generic random rain of Swords. You're nerfing Pokemon to HP level... actually that would make a better Fanfic, but in terms of actual power, it'd decimate. Anime is more interesting sometimes. Counter Shield Pikachu > All.

****** If one arrow from Sinister Arrow Raid is a piercing hex, then Explosion would be a nuke. These moves probably aren't that powerful in all actuality. And I reiterate, the anime is not canon. If it were, then fucking /Venustoise/ would be official.

******* Charvenustoise was filler. I was comparing it to an actual arrow, but with magic involved. The Anime is used to make canon though. Without it the games would have fell to Niche years ago, and well... Ash Greninja in the anime, and then gen 7 comes and we get Ash Greninja to play in the game.
