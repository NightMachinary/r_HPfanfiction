Nothing throws me from a fic where it's in Harry's perspective and the next paragraph is in Draco's. So what are your favorite fics where this doesn't happen? Please and thank you!


** This is one of the things that immediately make me stop reading a fic. If the writer can't be arsed to write a scene or chapter from a single character's point of view, without at least making it clear if/when they are switching POV, I really can't be arsed to read it.

Fics where I have to pause my reading to understand whose POV I'm reading from are a bother.

As to your request, I suppose there are plenty of fics that don't have POV-swapping, but perhaps if you gave a preference to what sort of story you might be looking for, people could better help.

*** This is true lol. I have the strongest aversion to mpreg. Even though it's not my favorite, I'll be willing to read harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione. Ty again boo!

** Do you want less know fics? Have you read most of the frequently recommend fics in this sub like The Sum of Their Parts?

**** Emmm interesting. I'm not sure why. I'd recommend a Ron-centric Romione fic called Australia linkffn(Australia) You'd definitely want to try that, unless that of course, you are not into romance or have read it before

** Well, ok, here are my favorite fics(and they don't have this annoying feature).

linkffn(3401052)

linkffn(3964606)

Alexandra Quick is not about Harry Potter and doesn't take place at Hogwarts, but it's in Rowling's wizarding world, so to speak. Regardless, it and Black Comedy are the only fics I've ever read that I consider good and would recommend to anyone. I've read fics that get constantly recommended and they're not that good. I'm still looking though. And the fact that AQ is not so popular gives me hope for other stories.
