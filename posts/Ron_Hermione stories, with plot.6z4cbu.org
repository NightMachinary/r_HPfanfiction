Aside from the oft recommended Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived and Starfox's fics.

One lesser known story I remember enjoying was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]]. This is set in an AU where Voldemort successfully had Harry killed in the forest, and wins the overall war. Ron and Hermione are trying to survive in the new world. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]] has Hermione dimension travelling to the canon dimension. Both stories have their issues, but they are very good overall. Especially the sequel.

But by and large, most stories with this pairing have been primarily romances. I want something with some sort of adventure or mystery plot as well.
