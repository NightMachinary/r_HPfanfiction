Edit: what are your interpretations of this character? Do you have any particular thing you think people often overlook about him?


** [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/][Check out this thread on Fanon vs. Canon Sirius.]]

If you're writing a canon Sirius (not a fluffy Everyone Lives AU), then here's the TL;DR:

- Sirius isn't a happy-go-lucky goofy manchild. Fanon Sirius loves dumb puns and whoopee cushion-tier practical jokes.

- Sirius isn't a chronic womanizer. The only canon evidence of his preferences was his bedroom bikini posters, but that could just be rebelling from his parents, like motorcycles and running away from home at age 16. He is never shown to have any romantic relationships in the books.

- Sirius is talented, resourceful, and strong-willed.

- Sirius never says "Pup", "Cub", or "Prongslet".

*** I think in general teenage boys who like bikinis are not in any way more prone to grow up as womanizers. Nor are popular or good looking boys.

** Sirius and James are said to be a 'double act' as Hogwarts students. His humour after Azkaban seems to be a mix of crude and quirky, e.g. he throws out a line about walking in on Kreacher snogging a pair of his father's trousers, and of course he requests that Harry and the others write to him as 'Snuffles'.

He seems to be both cruel and caring, cruel to Pettigrew and Snape, but then he gives Pigwidgeon to Ron in what is quite a generous gift. He also talks to Harry, Ron and Hermione as if they were adults, i.e. he listens to their arguments and takes them seriously.

As for his sexuality, I don't think there's a consensus on what he was like before Azkaban (or after). I've seen him written extrememly convincingly as gay, bi, straight and asexual. To play devil's advocate, I think there are hints that he was a womanizer in his youth other than the posters (which easily may have been to upset his parents, or to hide his homosexuality as lots of fics use it as proof of...). One point in the favour of womanizer is that Harry in OotP explicitly wishes he could talk to Sirius to ask him about girls, which might mean they've discussed it before and Harry sees him as an authority on the subject. Another is a line of JKR's own writing in Pottermore, in the short essay she wrote on Lupin. In that essay Lupin says (bitterly) "he always got the women". Anyway, I think this can be done any way the author likes.

As for appearance, we know he grows his hair longer when he's depressed. He has black hair and grey eyes. We also know that he's more than a head taller than Pettigrew, which suggests he was quite tall. He's head-turningly good-looking, JKR describes him as handsome every chance she gets. He also likes to tip his chair back on two legs and he likes lounging and leaning back when he sits.

It's suggested that he both drinks and smokes in OotP when there's a "Mundugus-like smell" about him when he's been alone for a while.

James was his best friend and the two seemed to have moved about together a lot. They all joined the Order straight after Hogwarts (according to JKR in an interview) and didn't get jobs. Sirius would probably have been quite rich from what he inherited from his uncle Alphard as there was still plenty of gold left for Harry to inherit from him.

There's no evidence he was a quidditch player, he would probably have mentioned it if he was. Pottermore says he's particularly good at Charms and non-verbal magic.

He ran away from home and was not thrown out by his parents. He was taken in by James's family and he continued to go there for Sunday roasts even after he got his own place.

He seems to have despised most of his family and there are no hints that he regretted cutting ties with them. There is probably some sort of backstory to do with his mother, as Kreacher insists that Sirius 'broke her heart' (interesting choice of words I think), and all the screaming matches with her portrait etc.

He was probably very good in school to the point where he didn't think he had to practice for his OWLs and he suggests that he will merit a higher grade than Outstanding on his DADA OWL.

He is consistently described as arrogant.

He seems to have some understanding of muggle mechanics, and this interest seems to have started in his early teens already as there are motorcycle manuals in his Grimmauld bedroom. Maybe he and Arthur have swapped stories about charming muggle vehicles?

Edited for grammar.

I doubt Harry only inherited Alphard money from Sirius, I think he got all the gold of the Blacks like what his parent left him was all the gold from the Potters.\\
Since Sirius was the owner of Grimmault Place, it means it was him who inherited it when the last owner (his mother) died. So either his parents never disinherited him when he left, of they put him back in the will later (when Regulus died for example, or when they thought he was also a Death Eater). The way Sirius describe it, the gold he got from Alphard was enough to live for a while, but not really enough to be considered "rich" without working.

**** It's certainly possible! I had to go digging a little bit because I vaguely remembered a discussion about how Sirius and then Harry could inherit the house, and from what I can understand of it it would be possible for Sirius mother to leave the family money to someone else when she died, but still have to hand over the house to her son as he was the last one with the name Black, even though he had been disinherited:

To be honest, Sirius growing up to become exactly what Walburga hated the most (a blood traitor) would be in itself more than enough to warrant describing her as heart broken over her son's decisions. I certainly have seen parent-child relationships break the fuck down HARD over politics and cultural differences.

  I think one of the main traits you should consider is his recklessness, as well as his reluctance/inability to plan ahead. He does what seems right at the moment and doesn't really think of the consequences. You see that over and over again with him; Sirius is the ultimate "seemed like a good idea at the time" sort. He definitely has a brain, he can be quite devious and even insightful when it suits him.... but he has this tendency to let his emotions get the better of him and act rashly.

**** Sure! The deviousness is mainly on display in POA... Sirius is REALLY good at sneaking around and avoiding detection, and in his youth he managed to not only become an Animagus without ANYONE, even Dumbledore, suspecting... but he also SOMEHOW managed to convince Snape, who hated him and would likely be more than suspicious, to go check out the Shrieking Shack. He wouldn't have managed this without a bit of deviousness. The "changing of the Secret-Keepers" thing was also pretty blatantly mentioned to be Sirius's idea... that one ended in tragedy, but it does display Sirius's talent for deviousness, even if it ALSO shows that he sometimes put his trust in the WRONG people. (It's also why he felt like he was to blame for James and Lily's deaths; the switch was his idea.)

When it comes to insight, you get a fair bit of this in GOF and OOTP in his conversations with Harry. Sirius is the one who says "If you want to see the true measure of a man, watch how he treats his inferiors, not his equals," which is an EXTREMELY insightful observation, and probably one of the best quotes in the series altogether. It's also Sirius who tries to tell Harry that "the world isn't made up of good people and Death Eaters," which Harry never quite seems to take to heart, but is still true even in the HP universe.

** I've seen Sirius portrayed as the one with an explosive temper, and that was before prison and running away. The man also does have a mean streak, even as a teenager. Sirius doesn't think things through, he does something and might even not think about it if he isn't forced (capture Peter instead of going to Dumbledore, then 12 years later, kill Peter instead of,'I should probably turn him in' and the whole incident with Snape and Remus). Sirius is also shown as rather dismissive,e.g., he might say something nasty to Peter and wouldn't think much of it. That seems pretty acurate since he is the one who mocks Peter in swm.
