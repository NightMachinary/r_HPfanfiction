If there's parings I don't really care which. One-shots are alright as well, though preferably over ~2k words. I don't have the mental energy to read anything overly complex atm, so anything with decent spelling and grammar is great and plot doesn't matter too much. Just not anything overly cringey and under 60k words. Thank you!


** I really enjoyed Petrification Proliferation.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** I wrote a short (28k words) fic called Driving Miss Weasley. Basically non-stop action, with a few fluffy scenes in between. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12631584/1/Driving-Miss-Weasley]]

  I used the following prompt rather loosely:"You remove your tattoo because you hate the idea of someone dictating who you can be with for the rest of your life and the person who's removing it happens to be your soulmate and they're torn between letting you know and just not bringing it up because you kind of went there because you didn't want a soulmate and vice versa."In which Harry thinks soulmates are stupid and Draco thinks Harry is stupid.

  When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.

  Draco Malfoy thinks he might know whose thoughts are scrawling themselves on his skin, but that's crazy. Impossible, even. It has to be a mistake.-Self-indulgent soulmate AU where the thoughts of your soulmate inscribe themselves on your skin in a shifting magic tattoo
