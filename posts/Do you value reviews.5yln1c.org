** Value, as in, appreciate that someone read my story and left a comment behind - yes.

But I don't attribute much worth to the content of the reviews. As nice as reading them sometimes is, I feel their value greatly decreases when I see the same positive comments on some Lord Potter bash-fic-fest.

There are only a few I do read and take to heart, but those are mostly the ones over a few paragraphs that try to give feedback.

****** I don't think you understand me.

A review isn't like, I don't know, a dumpling more in your soup or something. A review is a feedback to your story and it exists not in an isolated vacuum, but in the context of the site.

For example, I would put more value into a positive review on the DLP forums than on reviews on FFN, simply because the first one is harder to obtain by readers with a much higher and stricter expectation for quality.

As with UndeadBBQ, there are very few I value from a critical standpoint, but the few that I get that are a couple paragraphs discussing the stories are one of the main things that motivates me to write more.

** I like reviews (either good or bad) that indicate the reader has actually READ the story, and the review is engaging in that. Those are the ones that I live for (and generally a decent portion of each chapter I release gets this kind of feedback). I also have no problem with answering reviews to my story that have questions, and highly enjoy engaging with readers this way.

The ones that drive me nuts, and I've been learning to ignore are those which are trying to hijack the story. The ones that want to see their specific plot take form, and kvetch over the fact that I'm not doing that. It's one thing if it's a viable criticism - it's another if you're insulting because your own personal plot line is not taking place. Write your own story at that point.

*** I like that attitude. While I understand that authors of fanfiction don't get paid to do it, so no one should expect high-quality writing with lots of world-building and Character Development (although we didn't get it from the lady that did get paid to make the books too....), but the authors that only post fics to be 'yerked off' in a manner of speaking, are the worst. Whenever you leave a review that moderately critiques their idea of an "Ultimate Magical Core Prodigy Lesbian Hermione who fights for the rights of everything, including conjured animals (THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO), and stops being Lesbian as soon as she sees Draco Malfoy" they will flame you, then proceed to block you while calling you many rude names that shouldn't be repeated.

Once you write stuff, you gain a healthy respect for the amount of time people give to write all these fanfics. You may not respect the fic itself, but the effort put into writing it is always worthy of respect.

** If we're talking about value as in how seriously do we take critical reviews rather than the fuzzy feel-goodness of readers caring enough to write them... that depends. I often use reviews as a kind of general barometer. Individual critical reviews don't really carry much weight (unless they're by people who have a history of really great reviews, or are clearly and obviously extremely well thought out) but when dozens of people all say similar things, it's a sign I need to look more carefully.

One thing I've noticed is that critical reviews are extremely good at spotting when something is wrong, but are often rather bad at identifying what that something is, and even worse at suggesting appropriate corrective measures. That's fine. Improving the writing is my job after all, not theirs.

I love all my single line 'Omg I <3 this,' reviews :) I know it's not cool to, but I do.

Also, is it just my monkey pattern finding brain, or do REALLY critical reviews tend to be among the first ones that come in? I swear my emotions play a yoyo when I publish a new chapter, until the mass settles on a general consensus.

Mmmm... I've gotten plenty of comments like this one and I'm never sure how to reply to them. I'm never sure what the reviewer is looking for --- assurances I will finish? A decision to change the story into something less complex? The former is pretty meaningless since if my word was enough they wouldn't be worried in the first place, and I have no intention of doing the later. All I can do is keep plugging away. One chapter at a time.

** Not an author, but...

On the whole, no. I'm interested in the number of reviews in general because it's an indicator that the story generated enough interest in the readers that they commented.

However, I'm not generally interested in the content of the comments themselves. Unless the user name is recognized, it doesn't matter. I don't know who the reviewer is. I don't know their taste and won't use it to make any decision about the story.

/Edit:/ If there's a chapter that I HATE and I stop reading the story, I'll read that chapter's reviews to see if it's just me.

** I enjoy getting reviews, it tells me people are reading my story and care enough to leave feedback.

The only ones I value are ones that actually do review. That is, they give thoughtful critisms and praise about the story. Something along the lines of "character X is behaving in a very odd manner and seems OOC, is there a reason for this or are you just being goofy" or "I really like the detailed description of X it made me feel Y." Those are helpful "kill yourself you sick scum" or "update soon plz" are ok to receive but they don't help me at all.

** I like any review. It means someone read what I wrote and was motivated to comment.

The only exception to the would be the sometimes-seen "this is shit" comment. I don't see any point in that. Say why it's shit, suggest improvements. If the entirety of your point is that you've read better stuff, then go and read it and don't denigrate an author trying to learn.

The other thing that annoys me is reviewers who clearly haven't read what you've written. One story I posted to FF net stated from the get-go that it was a copy of an abandoned story that I had zero interest continuing. First reviewer was looking forward to seeing where I took the story.

So really it's like anything else. Comment, but don't be a moron.

** I'm currently escaping some review/reaction drama on another forum, so this question seems particularly apropos at the moment.

I definitely do appreciate reviews... to varying degrees. And I don't mean "I love positive reviews and hate critical reviews", although that'll be the first thing people will accuse you of if you complain.

People forget that reviews have good and bad quality, just like the stories. A review like "Lol, love this" is nice, sure. But one where the person says, "The motivations and reactions are very believable" is worth ten times that, because you know they thought about it.

Similarly with critical reviews. Someone posting "This sucks, I'm not reading any more" is actually quite hurtful, because not only are they outright saying they hate the story, they're doing it in a way that implies that they can't even be arsed to say why. It can be very demoralizing, and it can take a lot of the "minor positive" reviews to make up for these.

The guy who reviews with: "This doesn't work... <x> comes off ambiguous, and maybe you should think about <y>" is your best friend. She/He may not like your story, but they're not throwing /you/ out into the trash with it. It means a lot because even though they may not have gotten much out of it themselves, they still took the time to think and try to help you improve.

(Although you have to be careful to pick out the annoying people who are trying to get you to write the plotline that exists only in /their/ head for them. You know the type: "Well, obviously Harry would do /this/, and I don't know why you had Ron do that, when he should have...")

** On ff.net, no. They annoy me and make me not want to continue a story. On ao3, yes, so far.

On ff.net, they're called reviews. They should, well, review the story. Reviews on amazon or whatever are written for other potential readers and should give people a better idea of whether they want to spend their resources (time, in this case) on the story. Instead, they're primarily there for people to react to chapters for the author's benefit. I've seen plenty of spoilers in the review section, and I've seen people writing one-line comments to every chapter for fifteen chapters in a row. It's terrible and I would turn it off if possible.

On ao3, they're called comments. They're for discussing the story, presumably with people who have read it and with the author.
