A couple of posts and comments lately got me thinking about one of the strangest creatures to deal with in Harry Potter, Goblins.

Goblins can be surprisingly polarizing in the fandom as evidenced by reactions to fics like Harry Crow. Many people absolutely despise the trope of misunderstood and/or friendly goblins.

A thread from earlier was talking about the importance of keeping the symbolism and meaning of JK Rowlings writing intact when making changes. Eg not invalidating blood purity as a symbol for racism, house elves and slavery, werewolves and aids, etc.

The question that this leaves us with is how to treat Goblins? JK followed a traditional fantasy description for these creatures in a way that paints them in a very ugly light, the only creatures that Hagrid himself had bad things to say about.

At the same time they are lumped in with the other non humans, stuck gazing adoringly up at the witch and wizard of the ministry fountain along with house elves and centaurs. Those two are creatures for whom repression and agression are a theme in Harry Potter.

So where do Goblins belong in fanon? As unredeemable money grubbing, self serving, jealous, vicious, creatures? As sentient beings with their own culture and differences that don't deserve the hate they get from people like Umbridge like centaurs? As oppressed creatures denied rights to carry a wand, and placed in a role of servitude like house elves?

Rowling wrote Slytherins in a way that the only "redeemed" one we ever see is Snape. The house as a whole is written off as unredeemingly evil from book one to book seven. Are goblins the same?

Many people see the good in providing depth to Slytherins, but at the same time I feel like many people are willing to condone (most likely unintentionally) with their writing that their exists a group of beings that are inherently violent and greedy and that don't deserve rights.


** I think that it was best put by Bill Weasley. “They're a different breed of being”. They simply don't think like humans in the same way that tigers don't think like wolves.

To us, they may often come off as conniving, cutthroat, greedy sociopaths, and by human standards they are. But it's really just a very different moral and ethical framework.

To a goblin, it's humans who are the greedy psychos.

*** As I am working on a fic that involves goblins and curse breakers, I find this tidbit helpful. I am trying to decide what to do without being to tropey.

*** Interesting way to look at it. I do wonder about the implications when considering their sentience though? It actually almost feels like a discussion seen in scifi circles regarding aggressive alien races. Do the violent, proud, and warlike Krogan deserve to have their ability to reproduce properly stolen from them? Do the Goblins deserve to live under a system that denies them wands and leads to an entire history of rebellions and revolts?

** First of all, Slytherin House is not written off as "unredeemingly evil." In addition to Snape, there's Andromeda (grew up in a blood purist family but married a muggleborn), Regulus (turned on Voldemort after he left Kreacher to die), Slughorn (not a paragon of virtue, admittedly, but hardly evil), and even Draco (a right little shit, but with moral lines he won't cross).

As for goblins, it's true that the one we see the most of - Griphook - is not portrayed in the best light, but neither is he totally unsympathetic. He noticed that Harry dug Dobby a grave (which most wizards wouldn't have done), the text takes seriously his claim that Gryffindor stole the sword, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all acknowledge that their plan to trick him is wrong, even as they create it. I think the point is that the way wizards treated goblins was still wrong, even if the goblins weren't blameless themselves.

*** Agree to disagree regarding the way Slytherin house as a whole was written by Rowling.

We definitely get most of canon Goblin interaction from Griphook and that colors a lot of fanfiction representation of Goblins. Honestly, the most three dimensional description given for Goblins by Rowling is their view of ownership. I just wonder why there is such a pushback in the community against Goblins as a species being relatable and or decent.

** I'm majorly a fan of said connections and symbolism, even what JK missed. As result I like to take context of unreliable narrarators and draw parralels between the treatment of goblins and the treatment of jews and / or arabs seeing as, regardless of the intent of the author, she did kinda sorta deploy a whole lot of tropes allusions and sterotypes that very very much fit the mold. I know she herself had no antisemetic intentions or what have you but in this case the tropes have been deployed which makes it real interesting to see them acknowledged and fucked around with rather than ignored or dismissed, especially because they make their way into most things regardless. Much the same way as I like to see the slytherins and the bullshit sent their way being acknowledged and fucked around with beyond this one asshole had a crush on the MC's mum and was bullied so it's all good, even if it's just going further into that one because with more development that could have been a really interesting plot line(and indeed several fics have made it an epic plotline).

​

Of course that doesnt resolve how to actually treat the goblins themselves and more how to treat their relation to how other's treat them and how others treat them. Personally I don't really care for the common set of fanon tropes, we all know the ones, and every time I see the name "ragnok" I want to roll my eyes. Just as well maybe it would be nice to have lives and culture beyond "running an english bank" be a thing would be pretty dang nice though I can only think of like 7 fics that ever did that and three of them were pure smut.(Can I say how dissapointing it is when the fics that delve into interesting facets of interesting cultures are pure smut, like really?)

​

So uh, JK fucked up big time but that's almost okay because she really didn't mean to, the popular fanon is disappoint, and I think we should really be taking JK's fuck up and going interesting places with it rather than accepting or ignoring it because despite it it has the ability to turn into some really interesting story regardless. Where we should be going I have almost no clue save for that it's, in my opinion, not where we usually go with it. That sums up my opinion on the matter I think kinda sorta.

*** I'd heard these claims before and I actually did some research into the origins of Goblins in folklore and myth and it really looks like they were standard Fey creatures originally and any antisemitic parallels were emphasized later. It's a pretty big accusation and it doesnt fit with Rowlings opinions, writings, and actions on race. I do think she just went with the common representation of Goblins rather than intending anything malicious. My pondering is about if that is okay given the nature and meaning behind all other creature relationships
