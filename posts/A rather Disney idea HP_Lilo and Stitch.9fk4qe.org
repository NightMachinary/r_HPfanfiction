+imagine three au's where Stitch crash-lands in these locations+

1. The Burrow(?)
2. In Hermione's backyard.
3. The Rookery. (Don't know much about it, but someone suggested so it SO YEET.)

In the Weasley AU, I was thinking that perhaps Stitch bonds with Molly the most. Especially with her nature to mother anyone. Though, I suppose Ron bonding with Stitch out of the siblings would be cool. It'll give him something that'll set him apart from the rest of his siblings. (Maybe Ginny ends up with Sparky? I LOVE SPARKY! How would Sparky even coexist with magic. :thinking:)

Hermione's AU.... I suppose it'll be like the typical "My first and only friend." Until Hogwarts.

+I'm in love with the idea of a Weasley-raised! Stitch.+


** I have an idea for the set-up:

Luna, a bright girl, who is distraught about losing her mother. She became very quiet and withdrawn, and her father could never seem to help her. But then a strange creature named Stitch crashlands in the nearby woods. Luna being Luna, they are instant best friends. She's afraid Xenophilius will take him away from her, but he loves the strange creature as well. She can keep him and they have a lot of adventures.

One night Ginny steals her brother's broom and goes into the forest to practice in secret, and she discovers Luna and Stitch (it even sounds catchy!) there.

I don't know how it would go from there but I love how cute and wholesome it could be.

** There's one where a grown up Harry meets Lilo and Stitch. It's also a Hawaii Five 0 crossover, with other tv shows having cameos.

  There was a reason that surfer crashed into Kono that day... and she really shouldn't have hit him. Kono's hot tempered response lands them a team mate that likes to cause mischief and has very little respect for protocol.

**** You don't need to know the show. I've only seen a few episodes and I was able to follow things without issues.
