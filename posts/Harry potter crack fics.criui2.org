I have read the seventh horcrux, oh god not again and ABC and I live for them. Any recommendations for more crack fics?


** Honestly, Harry is one of my absolute favorite fics. I think it's ridiculously funny, and just plain absurd. There are only 3 chapters unfortunately. I would have loved it if the author wrote more to this. It's doesn't really have much of a plot, it's just Harry and Hermione messing around with the rules of magic and how far you can stretch them.

It's kind of a crackfic because throwing a DnD Wizard with munchkin tendencies into the world of Harry Potter, well, that's just not done while perfectly sober. But it's also really wel written, incredibly funny, with some very nice plot twists, interesting OCs, and a few ideas I never say anywhere else.

A must read truly, even if you don't know shit about DnD.

*** This is a great story highly recommend reading. However, two things to note; It is actually played fairly straight. It is unlikely that the series will ever be finished.

This one's really short, but I enjoyed it.

Something New. by Nerexx

This fic was inspired by $30 for 8 oz, and it's how I found it. The last chapter is coming out tomorrow. Again, it's short, but good read in my opinion.
