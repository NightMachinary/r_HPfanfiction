Despite going through numerous variations of sweets from the trolley, Harry and Ron had their attention solely focused on the amazing marmalade sandwiches Paddington brought with him. The candy since then have been forgotten.

"This is delicious Paddington!" Harry said while Ron was wolfing down his own sandwich.

"Doesn't it? And just one sandwich contains the vitamins and minerals a bear needs for the whole day! The recipe is courtesy of my Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo" the kind bear replied as he too enjoyed a sandwich along with some of the forgotten sweets.

The trio continued to enjoy their meal, until their compartment door had opened and revealed 3 boys. They didn't look like a pleasant bunch.

They all flinched at the sight of Paddington.

"What's that thing doing their?!" one of the boys, a pale blond boy, yelled.

Harry stood up and countered "He isn't a thing, his name is Paddington!", while said bear waved at the newcomers.

The pale blond boy sneered in disgust and decided to ignore the horribly dressed beast for now. He introduced himself as Draco Malfoy and gestured to the other 2, Crabbe and Goyle. Ron let out a cough that sounded more like a snicker.

This went unnoticed, and Draco went to insult Ron's family and offered an alliance with Harry. He refused. The Malfoy heir had gone on to insult Harry's parents, the Weasleys, a fellow named Hagrid, and last but not least, Paddington.

The bear had enough, and confronted Draco.

"I beg your pardon?! Why must you be so rude?!"

Draco sneered again, "As if you're one to talk about manners, filthy little beast."

Before Harry and Ron could defend their friend, Draco's face changed.

Why? Paddington's mouth fell into a sharp frown, as his eyes narrowed and glared deeply at Draco's.

The blond boy became unnerved along with his minions.

"W-w-why are you looking at me like that?"

Paddington didn't answer, only continuing to glare at him.

"S-stop it! I-i-i-is it just me or is it getting hot in here?!"

"It's called a hard stare. My Aunt Lucy taught me how to do them when people have forgotten their manners" Paddington said has his face softened into a more relaxed state.


** I love this. So much. I'm cackling, thank you.

** Thoroughly enjoyable.

On a side note: I loved Paddington Bear books and hated marmalade as a kid. It was too sweet, too sour, too much texture, and the smell actually made me gag.

But then, like a year ago, I was served some marmalade with a full tea service and it was so delightful! I'm really craving marmalade and buttered scones now.
