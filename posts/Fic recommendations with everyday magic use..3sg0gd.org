Are there any good fanfics that focus more on the use of magic in everyday life and how having magic effects their society. For instance, with warming charms, witches/wizards have no need for heavy clothing. With the aguamenti spell, you have readily available drinking water. Does conjured water taste different depending on who conjures it similar to how tap water tastes different on where you live? If so, then it would be funny to see celebrity beverages. "Get your special edition Lockhart butterbeer!"

Basically, I'd like to read a fic that is a magic-based story not focused on Harry just learning fighting spells.


** Technically, Warming Charms are fanon --- broadly used and benign, in my opinion, fanon, but fanon. There is a hot-air Charm that Hermione and Dumbledore use to dry out soggy clothes, but nothing ongoing.

Now that I think about it, that makes for an interesting worldbuilding element... Yes, there is a lot of demand for a spell that does that, but no one's been able to produce one with a right combination of temperature (effective, but not scalding, even if not cast absolutely perfectly) and area of effect (because you don't want to walk by an icebox and melt everything inside; nor do you want to heat one half of your internal organs but not the other half), while being simple enough that it doesn't take a Dumbledore to cast it.

That aside...

linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a magical society that is profoundly affected by magic, including some very charming worldbuilding touches that are obvious in retrospect.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

*** Read a fic recently where Harry talked about buying a razor and said there was no charm to get a clean shave without feeling like your face was being cauterized. I absolutely loved that. Fanon has made HP a world where you can wave your wand and get any damn thing you please and it was nice to see something so simple that wasn't just easy.

** If you can find a copy, "Out of the Night" by Raining Ink touched on this.

** I don't think magic has a solution for everything, or sometimes that solution has faults of its own. For instance, maybe there is a warming charm, but it only works when the moon is waxing gibbous. Otherwise it is uncomfortably warm or ineffective, depending on the lunar cycle. Maybe there's a potion that cures baldness, but from 1-2 PM the drinker can only sing opera when trying to speak.

It makes more sense to me that there isn't a simple solution for everything.

Edit: Whoops, I didn't even answer your request! I don't really know of anything like that. There's a user here who was asking for ideas to write about things like this, so I'll try to dig it up.

Edit 2: In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3orv1i/discussion_which_stories_would_you_want_to_see_in/][this topic]] by [[/u/capitolprostitute]], they mention that they're looking for ideas. Perhaps you can interest them with some ideas?

*** If magical solutions for everyday problems we already can solve easily with technology have drawbacks, then that nerfs magic a bit too much for my taste. "Oh, central heating... and heated floors... each time we tried that with magic, it set the house on fire" makes Magic look worse than useless.

**** Well, everything has its drawbacks. I think that should be applied to magic as well. It costs money to heat your house and gosh darn it still is cold by the Windows. Magical fixes should have drawbacks as well. Maybe the Home Heating Charm has to be renewed every year and is too complicated for the average witch or wizard-they have to hire someone. I don't think every issue should have a simple spell that solves it. I guess I think it's more interesting than perfect spells for every problem.

***** That's how it works in Patron - spell casting and maintenance is what most wizards and witches work at, specializing in a few complicated spells most can't cast themselves. Usually convenience spells too. But the spells themselves don't have disadvantages. You don't run the risk of a fire when using heating charms, nor are warming charms unreliable.
