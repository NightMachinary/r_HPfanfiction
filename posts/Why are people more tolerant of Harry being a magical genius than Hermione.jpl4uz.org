I notice a lot that in most fanfiction communities, people are generally more open to the idea of Harry being OP and a genius at magic than Hermione being like that, and I'm wondering why that is. In canon, she is much smarter (Word of God says she's a near genius) and more hard-working than him. She memorized all her course books the summer before her first year and all of the spells she tried had worked at that point. Isn't that very impressive, especially after we're shown that it takes multiple classes for the whole class to learn one spell? She also manages to transfigure her match into a needle partially while the rest of the class couldn't change their match at all and gets a 112% in her charms exam.

After first year, she somehow manages even more impressive feats. In second year, she brews the Polyjuice Potion, which is said to be very difficult since most adult wizards (who all presumably have taken Potions class until their O.W.L.s) cannot brew it and JK Rowling herself that the fact Hermione could brew it was "a testimony to her outstanding magical ability". She also solved the thousand year old mystery of what the monster of Slytherin was (since Dumbledore could understand Parseltongue, he doesn't even have the excuse of lack of information). In third year, she does nothing of note besides being the first student in Hogwarts to ever receive a time turner, managing to cast spells classes before everyone else as usual, managing to figure out that her teacher was a werewolf, and getting a 320% on one of her exams. Also, I notice a lot of people tend to act like she is close-minded solely because of how she disregarded divination in this book, but I think they forget that McGonagall and Dumbledore both also thought that divination is bullshit, and only Voldemort, Lavender, and Parvati seemed to take it seriously, and they're hardly trustworthy. In fourth year, she is still top of her class (according to Viktor Krum, she was also the only girl in the whole school who went to the library not because he was there, so that's hardly surprising), finds out Rita Skeeter is an animagus, performs a perfectly cast Unbreakable Charm on the jar holding her, is the one who teaches Harry every spell, and was doing O.W.L. practice tests in November:

*“Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what's the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. ... The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide. ... I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall ... unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers. ...”*

In her fifth year, she was said to have known the most jinxes in the DA (including even Harry), mastered every spell the fastest (even when Neville started his training montage after the Death Eaters escaped, he was still second to her), casted a seventh year enchantment on the Galleons, created her own spell (Both Madame Pomfrey and Umbridge couldn't undo it and Marietta still had it the next year. Unless she was dabbling with some extremely dark magic, she created the SNEAK spell), and outsmarted Umbridge and made the centaurs do whatever they did to Umbridge that traumatized her so much.

In sixth year, she literally did nothing but sit on her butt, snipe at Harry, and cry from Ron's insults, but even then she was still managed to silently cast spells in only 10 minutes (the rest of the class didn't even manage it by the end of class) and mastered spells much quicker than everybody else:

*Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione 's creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.*

In seventh year, she literally does everything. Food? Hermione was the one transfiguring it (Ron claimed it was because she was the best at magic). Clothes? Hermione was the one packing it. Shelter? Hermione was the one who brought it. Combat? Hermione is without a doubt the main combatant in this book, since she was the one who ended basically every fight from the battle in the muggle restaurant from turning the stairs into a slide (which is one of the most wide-scale charms we see in the series) and the portrait into stone, knocking out or kill three Death Eaters. Knowledge? Hermione was the one who summoned the books and read them. Transport? Hermione was the one apparating them from place to place. Healing? Hermione was the one who healed Ron's injury (she also claimed that she knew a lot of healing spells that would fix him right away but she didn't want to mess them up on Ron). Protection? Hermione was the one who set the protective enchantments almost every day. She also performed many difficult spells, the main ones being the Memory Charm, the False Memory Charm, and the Undetectable Extension Charm. She stated that she had only read the theory of the Memory Charm but she somehow did it perfectly on her first try, which is amazing since there are people who are literally trained in that one spell and it is said multiple times to be extremely difficult. The Extension Charm she illegally cast was stated to be very advanced magic that's use was restricted for only the production of objects and even then, a license would have to be given. She also performed the False Memory Charm on her first try, which is probably much more difficult than the regular Memory Charm since it's basically the improved version of it and even Dumbledore himself called it complex in reference to Tom Riddle performing the charm:

*"...Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle's mind, laid Morfin's wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.”*

So in light of all of this, why is Hermione constantly depicted as an untalented nosy bookworm while Harry, who is average at magic, seen as some genius who has some "raw power" just because he cast an emotion-powered charm in a stressful situation that he learned over the course of half a year. It's impressive, but is it really more impressive than Hermione brewing the Polyjuice Potion? It was both post-N.E.W.T. level magic that thirteen year olds performed, though unlike Harry, Hermione got it right on her first try. It's not even a problem just with Harry, but even with characters like the Marauders, just because they were described as "the cleverest students in their year" (Hermione was called the cleverest witch of her age, which seems to be more impressive, by the same man), they became animagi (over the course of two to three years, and Rita Skeeter also did it, but is she called a genius?), James was described as great at transfiguration, and Sirius said he knew all the material already (Hermione knew the material already at the start of her fourth year, so she's much ahead of him there tbh).

What do you think of this? Why do you think that other characters can receive power-ups (like Ron can be suddenly a great strategist), but Hermione is called a Mary Sue if she does?


** I think it's because no matter how many times it's repeated that she can perform advanced magic without a second thought and, as you said before, knew O.W.L level material well enough to do OWL practice tests basically two years ahead of schedule, people will always think of her as Harry Potter's bossy know-it-all sidekick. Even though she's the one who's ambitious, cunning, intelligent, hard working, etc., people will always have an excuse for it. Looking through the comments, people are even trying to say that Harry has something special in the magical department, which Hermione lacks, which is blatantly false. JK Rowling calls Hermione's magical abilities "outstanding", while she says Harry is on the same level as Ron in magical ability.

#+end_quote

Why is that so impressive? All it takes is to hold a Mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month, brew a relatively advanced potion, and cast a spell. In Uagadou, it's literally part of their fourth or fifth year curriculum. It's really just more tedious than actually complex.

Oh? What about the parchment curse? A spell that spells out "SNEAK" in acne after you betray the DA is awfully specific, and the fact that no professor, Ministry official, or anyone else knew how to reverse at all until it faded naturally over the years kind of proves that she had to have invented it. You could say it was some highly advanced dark magic, but I'm pretty sure at least Pomfrey would mention that while trying to heal Marietta.

#+begin_quote

First of all, the DA Coins were kind of innovative, since they burned like the Dark Mark whenever there was a change, which doesn't happen with standard Protean Charms.

Second of all, the Marauders' Map isn't innovative, since all we know is that they just used an obscure spell called the Homunculus Charm that allowed them to track everyone in the entire castle.

#+end_quote

Imagine saying that she's not a genius when she:

- Is a genius according to Rowling
- Is "the brightest character" according to JK Rowling, although she probably wasn't including people like Dumbledore and Voldemort.
- Learns all the course material for the year in the summer, and that's while not even spending the majority of her time studying for it.
- Is able to cast a "few simple spells" on her first try after only an hour or so on the Hogwarts Express (probably less, given that she helped Neville). Since all of them are presumably charms, since she hadn't tried the first Transfiguration exercise by the time of the Welcoming Feast, if her conversation with Percy is any indication, and DADA spells need a person to cast on, that means, practically-wise, she became at least half a year ahead of everybody else WITHIN ONE HOUR in Charms, since they only did their first spell on Halloween and they take around two weeks to be able to cast one new spell. Given that she was practicing the Summoning Charm in GoF in the first hour they were on the Express, and continued practicing, it seems that she continued that practice every year.
- Goes much deeper into the theory behind the spells than anyone else, so she actually /masters/ the spells instead of just being able to cast it
- Knows about Switching Spells in her first year, even though they weren't taught until fourth year
- Masters multiple spells the first time she ever casts them, and it usually takes people HOURS to cast one new spell right
- Is able to enchant a Quidditch banner to flash different colors in her first yeat
- Allegedly "read all about" the powerful dark magic that Quirrell had used in her first year
- Reads a lot about magic not learned in the curriculum, such as alchemy, healing magic, protection magic, enchanting, dark magic, illegal charms, nifty day-to-day magic, and many pieces of obscure and complex magic that comes in handy
- Brews Polyjuice Potion in her second year, which only highly skilled wizards can do
- Figures out the whole Chamber mystery as a second year
- Is the only student in Hogwarts history to ever be given a Time-Turner
- Finds a new and innovative use for the Impervius Charm that nobody else had thought about before
- Learns a foreign legal system and becomes Buckbeack's pseudo-lawyer as a third year
- Figures out Lupin is a werewolf
- Is called the cleverest witch of her age, meaning she's smarter than Lily Potter, who was frequently called brilliant and even Snape praised her for her magical skill
- Is able to learn the whole fifth year course material in the first two months of her fourth year, while balancing going deeper into the theory of the magic she already knows, learning extracurricular magic, campaigning for S.P.E.W, hanging out with friends, going to classes, and spending an absurd amount of time doing homework
- Reads N.E.W.T-level Transfiguration books in her fourth year
- Figures out Skeeter is an animagus
- Sets up the DA
- Jinxes the DA list as a 16 year old girl, and nobody, not even adults like Madam Pomfrey and Umbridge, could reverse it for the rest of Marietta's life
- Enchants a coin with a N.E.W.T-level charm as a fifth year, and doesn't even see it as impressive
- Knows much more offensive spells than the rest of the DA, including Harry and the older students like the Weasley twins and Cho.
- Masters all the spells that Harry teaches the DA the fastest, even the Patronus, which Harry notes is the only spell she ever struggled with
- Figures out how to get all of the school to believe Harry in her fifth year
- Outsmarts Umbridge, an intelligent adult woman, multiple times
- Is able to cast nonverbally after 10 minutes of practice while Harry never managed to do it in 2 years
- Casts the False Memory Charm as a 17 year old on her first try, which Dumbledore himself called "complex magic" in reference to a 16 year old Tom Riddle casting it
- Casts the Undetectable Extension Charm, which is advanced magic that is so complex and dangerous that it legally required a license to cast
- Makes almost all of the plans in DH
- Does almost all of the quick thinking in DH
- Could cast the advanced variant of the Patronus even though it's the only spell she ever struggled with
- Casts the Memory Charm, which is notoriously difficult, on her first try
- Knows a lot about the theory behind healing magic even though she never cast any (for obvious reasons, of course)
- Puts all of the protective charms hiding the trio from Voldemort in DH
- Lies to Bellatrix, a known Legilimens
- Is the only person besides Dumbledore, Voldemort, and the professors to cast non-point-and-shoot magic in duels, showing her creativity

What innovative magic did he invent as a teenager? You could argue that the mere fact that /Dumbledore/ called the False Memory Charm, which he did, extremely complex is a show of his genius, but Hermione did that too.

Contrary to popular opinion, most of their creations are just applying already known magic to produce their effects, which you stated didn't count. It isn't until HBP that they show any invented magic.

Example? Maybe it's just me, but Hermione changed her opinions basically every book. In PS, she went from a rule-follower to setting teachers on fire, smuggling dragons, attacking classmates, and sneaking out to defeat Magical Hitler. In PoA, she learned that she shouldn't overwork herself and the importance of empathy. In GoF, she learned not to be so hotheaded and rush into situations blindly. In OotP, she learns to not judge others. In DH, she immediately believed in the Hallows after she was given evidence.

This fanon idea that Hermione is close-minded is honestly tiring. Contrary to what the Lovegoods believe, just because she wants evidence before she jumps to conclusions doesn't mean she's close minded, and is in fact the opposite of close-minded.

** I don't think anyone is saying that genius!Harry is canon. So to the extent that everyone agrees that it is an AU, I don't think canon quotes showing Hermione to be smarter are all that relevant to the discussion. I do think you've substantially exaggerated Hermione's magical talent in your OP, which contains quite a few reaching conclusions, but that's also largely irrelevant to the discussion: we can agree that in canon she is both intelligent and hard working.

The question presented is really two questions:

1. Why do people accept AUs in which Harry is substantially more talented than canon?

2. Why do those same people reject AUs in which Hermione is substantially more talented than canon?

*Why do people accept AUs in which Harry is substantially more talented than canon?*

Ultimately, people accept this because it is perceived as a correction to an error in canon.

Harry is the protagonist and hero. Ergo he should be the magically special one. And if you look at the first 4 books alone, it does appear that JKR originally intended to take Harry on a more traditional hero's arc resulting in Harry being magically special:

- POA. Harry's spell repelling the large group of Dementors, which remains probably the single most impressive magical feat in the series.

- GOF. Harry resisting fake Moody's Imperius Curse, being the only one to do so.

- GOF. Harry learning a good number of combat spells for the Third Task which, at the time, was a considerable step up in his magical repertoire.

- GOF. Harry resisting Voldemort's Imperius Curse.

- GOF. Harry defeating Voldemort in Priori Incantatem, which is the closest thing we've seen to a contest of sheer magical strength.

At the end of GOF, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Harry was on the path to being something like Dumbledore's successor. Hermione had smarts and had applied herself better, but there were indications that Harry had a level of innate magical ability which she lacked. No matter how many books she read, Hermione would never have been able to resist Voldemort's Imperius Curse or beat him in Priori Incantatem.

In OotP things wobbled. Harry failed at Occlumency despite it being said that it required similar skills to resisting the Imperius. All the special combat spells which Harry learnt in GOF - which at the time had been presented as rare magic which they had to find in the library - were made standard parts of the curriculum. The Patronus Charm was taught to the DA, albeit not in the presence of any Dementors. All of Harry's previous achievements were being undermined.

Nonetheless, there were still some hints of the hero's path remaining: Harry's leadership of the DA, Harry holding his own against Death Eaters in the Ministry battle, and of course the prophecy, which promised us that Harry was Voldemort's equal and would have a power Voldemort lacked.

At the end of OotP, after hearing the prophecy, the fandom largely believed that book 6 would consist of Harry stepping up his game. The hero's path had wobbled in OotP, but it was not dead, and the end of OotP suggested that it would be restored in book 6.

Then HBP arrived and the hero's path died a quick and ignoble death. The book stressed Harry struggling with magic numerous times (though it also referred to Hermione struggling with NEWT Transfiguration theory). He struggled especially with non-verbal magic, another skill said to require mental focus, something that Harry had shown particular skill with in the past. He didn't make good his failures with Occlumency in book 5. He didn't do anything to prepare magically for the war, and his lessons with Dumbledore covered history, not magic. This theme of incompetent Harry was finally brought home in the finale by Snape lazily out-duelling Harry without having to lift a finger.

More than any other book, HBP is responsible for the perception that Harry is not particularly special when it comes to magic.

DH went some way to correcting this. Harry suddenly starts casting powerful combat magic which we never saw him learn; he finally masters occlumency; he is consistently depicted duelling at a level which can handle Death Eaters; his death and rebirth appear to have granted him a new level of magical insight. But it's too late to restore the hero's arc at this point, especially as a lot of these magical elements are underplayed and can easily go by barely noticed.

And that is what people are seeking to correct when they write Harry as highly magically talented. They are giving Harry the hero's arc he /should/ have had but which JKR took from him. They are fulfilling the promise of the prophecy: a Harry who is Voldemort's equal.

*Why do those same people reject AUs in which Hermione is substantially more talented than canon?*

In brief, Hermione is not the protagonist or chosen one, Harry is. To give Hermione's a hero's arc instead of Harry feels like she is usurping Harry's rightful place in the story. This can be especially frustrating when combined with JKR's above failure to give Harry the arc he deserved - it feels like not only has it been given to Hermione, but /taken/ from Harry.

Ultimately, usurpation is the key characteristic of a Mary Sue. It's not about a lack of flaws etc. It's about a character coming along and being given a level of importance or narrative focus which feels wrong because that narrative focus rightfully belongs to a different character.

When people write super!Hermione, this is what they are doing. They are turning Hermione into the hero in Harry's place. Harry generally becomes an ornament or just completely surplus to requirement.

Hermione's level of magical ability in canon works well. She's widely read and picks up spells quickly. That gives her a useful and important plot function of being the source of worldbuilding and setting up the parts of the plot which turn on the reader knowing about some item of magic. Originally she shared this role with Ron, who played a similar role for providing worldbuilding as to wizarding society and culture, but over time Hermione regretfully supplanted that role too.

So that's why Hermione's level of knowledge in canon does not feel like a usurpation. It has an important plot role, and that plot role is essentially a support role to Harry's central role as the hero.

Crucially, Hermione is contained in her supporting role by her magical abilities in canon being depicted as relatively dry - the product of intelligence and hard work, rather than raw magical talent. The core of Hermione's magic is that she looks up spells in books and teaches them to herself. And don't get me wrong, that is impressive. She's intelligent enough to understand magical texts above her year level, and it shows dedication to teach yourself that much magic outside of class.

However, Hermione is never shown as possessing what you might call innate magical talent. She never invents magic of her own, or alters magic to put a new twist on it. Nor does she ever really work out a piece of magic without the aid of a book to tell her how it works, or cast any spell that feels particularly powerful. At no point in the books do you think that Hermione could stand opposite Voldemort in the same way Harry does.

If you were to think of a comparable talent, you'd be thinking of Remus Lupin or Percy Weasley, not characters like Snape (who created spells and modified potions), James Potter and Sirius Black (who get straight Os without having to study at all, whereas Hermione works hard at it), or Lily Evans (who is depicted casting controlled magic without a wand before starting Hogwarts). And by no means is she anywhere near characters like Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald.

Because Hermione is never depicted as particularly powerful, or possessing a high level of raw magical talent/insight, she never leaves the support role which is her canonical place in the story. For all that she's highly competent in most areas of magic, she never shows any sign of that magical /je ne sais quoi/ that Harry so clearly possesses but which he never properly develops. And it's taking that magical /je ne sais quoi/ and running with it which is the basis of fics where Harry has a high magical talent.

2. Lupin specifically describes to us how impossible they are to overcome, to the point where there is only single spell capable of affecting them, and that single spell is extremely difficult to cast.

4. We're explicitly told in POA that only a very powerful wizard could have done it.

*** The answers to the two questions you pose, /Why do people accept AUs in which Harry is substantially more talented than canon?/ and /Why do those same people reject AUs in which Hermione is substantially more talented than canon?/ are very simple lol.

Super powerful protagonists are popular because most fanfics (aimed at a male audience) are one-note power fantasies, and HPfic is no different than any other fandom in that regard. Harry is popular because he is the canon protagonist, and the fandom has erased most of his (admittedly not super deep or well written) canon personality so as to be a blank slate that is easier for the reader to self insert into, so they can get all into it when "Harry" becomes the biggest strongest wizard to ever live. Hermione, as a female character, who is in a supporting role in canon, and whose personality is more defined (and thus harder to just write over), is not particularly popular (as a protagonist).

"A hero's arc" has nothing to do with "power levels". Many characters following ye ol' Hero's Journey narrative do become more powerful (physically, socially, politically, in some magical bullshit), but that increase in power is just a part, often a small one, of the narrative (ie, Luke Skywalker's strength in the Force doesn't matter for the conclusion of his story, his emotional growth is far more important). Additionally, many heroic character's have entirely different narratives, and begin and end there story with about as much "power" as they began their story with, while there are many common narratives and tropes a "heroic arc" is not a standardized thing.

I do not think that is present in the text.

*** I know that Hermione doesn't have "raw magical ability" but how do James Potter, Sirius Black, Lily Evans, or Harry Potter? Lupin called her the cleverest witch of her age, so Lily Evans is automatically less clever than her, right? For James Potter and Sirius Black, all we know about them are that they became animagi, created the Marauders Map, were called exceptionally clever, and Sirius said he knew it all (the O.W.L. material). Where are you getting straight O's without studying? We only know they didn't study right before their OWLs, which is great and all, but not as impressive as taking OWL practice tests in the first term of her fourth year. The animagus process was more tedious than actually difficult and the Marauders Map was created by the Homonculous Charm, so they didn't invent anything. What "/je ne sais quoi"/ does Harry have? The power he has is his emotions and the strength of his will? /That's/ why he could achieve all of those feats, not because of magical talent. In canon, Ron and Harry have the same magical ability while Hermione is head and shoulders above them. Also, I'm pretty sure she did create the SNEAK spell since it's can that nobody was able to heal it (not even Madame Pomfrey) and it faded and left scars like normal acne.

  I know that Hermione doesn't have "raw magical ability" but how do James Potter, Sirius Black, Lily Evans, or Harry Potter? Lupin called her the cleverest witch of her, so Lily Evans is automatically less clever than her, right?
#+end_quote

Right, but Taure was comparing innate magical ability, cleverness doesn't necessarily play a role here. And this also means that Hermione at 14 might be cleverer than Lily at 14, but it doesn't say anything about them later on. I know loads of people who were quite dumb at that age, but became a lot cleverer. I personally think that Lily isn't quite on the same level as James, Sirius or Snape. I always saw her as having her strength in Potions and then was generally above average in other subjects. But that isn't relevant and the magical control she had as a child probably was an indicator of power, but the only praise she gets in the books when it comes to academia is in regards to her Potions abilities.

Also, back on the matter of cleverness, here are two quotes from PoA;

#+begin_quote
  "Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school,"
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione."
#+end_quote

Personally, I find the former remark a lot more impressive, considering this is Lupin talking about them during their Animagus process, which was from ages 12-15 (possibly 13-16 depending on when they started and completed it).

#+begin_quote
  Where are you getting straight O's without studying? We only know they didn't study right before their OWLs, which is great and all, but not as impressive as taking OWL practice tests in the first term of her fourth year.
#+end_quote

From what we little we see in Snape's Worst Memory, we can surmise that James and Sirius /very likely/ both got O's in DADA, Transfiguration, Charms and Potions. From feats such as casting the Charms on the map, James doing wordless magic on Snape, I can't see them get any lower than an O on their Charms OWLs. As for Potions, they successfully brewed the Animagus Potion, which is way beyond anything they teach at Hogwarts. And if this doesn't convince you, then you can just look at Hermione's OWL scores and then compare the previous quotes about their intelligence.

#+begin_quote
  the Marauders Map was created by the Homonculous Charm, so they didn't invent anything.
#+end_quote

I very much doubt they tapped a piece of parchment with the Homonculous Charm and called it a day. What is inventing if not using/combining multiple spells to make an enchanted object? You don't need to make a new spell if it isn't necessary. We don't know if they invented anything for the map either, the Homonculous Charm is only described as tracking people in a mapped area. The other qualities of the map, such as the insults and passwords are unknown spells.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, Ron and Harry have the same magical ability while Hermione is head and shoulders above them.

Harry is generally portrayed as being more talented at Defense and even teaches Hermione a bunch of spells during DA lessons. I can't see Hermione matching Harry's feat of driving away a 100 dementors with a Patronus at age 13. That alone suggests that Harry has a /je ne sais quoi/ as Taure put it, when it comes to innate magical proficiency.

***** Cleverness /does/ play a role. In the Harry Potter series, power is determined by understanding of magic (the best wizards are academics and Hogwarts is a literal school), so Hermione, as the smarter one, would probably be more naturally talented than Lily.

Personally, I find the second remark much more impressive since Lupin has been known to play up James and Sirius' good traits while not remarking upon their faults. He even said Snape was just jealous of James' quidditch skills, and that's why he hated him so much.

Also, James and Sirius didn't cast nonverbal magic according to the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Nonverbal_spell#Known_uses][wiki]]. Also, Hermione mastered silent casting in 10 minutes while the rest of the class took multiple class periods to master it, and she didn't even live in a wizarding household unlike James and Sirius, so unless they mastered it under 10 minutes in their first DADA class, Hermione is more talented than them. Besides the animagus transformation, what evidence is there the they would have gotten O's. Peter also transformed and he made an extremely complex potion to resurrect Voldemort, but no one thinks he got all O's.

No matter your doubt, besides the charms to repel Snape, only the Homunculous charm was used to create the map. Hermione creating the SNEAK spell (which she probably did since no one, not even Madame Pomfrey, could remove it and it eventually faded, leaving permanent scars according to Rowling) is just as impressive, if not more, right?

In OOtP, Harry literally stated that Hermione knew the most jinxes and hexes out of all of them (including himself), and mastered all of the spells he taught her the quickest, so by the end of the year, she probably was still much more knowledgeable than him even in her worst subject. I also think you're forgetting that for a lot of spells, he was learning only slightly before the DA.

I think it is disingenuous to compare Harry's best spell with Hermione's worst spell (Harry said it was the only ever spell Hermione had trouble in). It was powered by emotions, which is literally Harry's power, so it's very unfair. I don't think Harry could perform the False Memory Charm (which Dumbledore states is extremely complex magic in reference to Voldemort using it) on his first try. Does that mean Hermione has a magic "/je ne sais quoi/" that Harry doesn't?

Here are two instances of James casting nonverbal magic before during Snape's Worst Memory. So he did learn it before Hermione. Well, Unless "Certainly" is the counter-jinx.

And I agree, cleverness DOES play a role, but Taure was only comparing their innate power and not the whole package in that particular moment.

And what about the charms for the passwords? And you didn't provide counter-evidence as to why they didn't invent the Snape-insulting charm, considering it was very personalized toward Snape.

And yes, it is possible that Hermione invented the "SNEAK" jinx, however the more likely scenario is just that she found a jinx with no counter-curse.

Yes, she will always be more knowledgeable because of her huge amount of time spent studying. DADA is not simply about knowing more hexes or jinxes, otherwise any 11 year old with a textbook memorized could be dueling seventh years.

******* 1. That's unfair. Even Harry, who couldn't do nonverbal magic, could do Levicorpus nonverbally. It was marked "nonverbal" in the HBP's book, so that means it was meant to be cast like that.
2. Even if they got O's in transfiguration and potions (which they were never shown to do), how is that more impressive than Hermione getting that? Also, why did James never get a Slug Club invite if he was so smart?
3. I will admit that I overlooked the passwords. I still think your biased against Hermione since the SNEAK jinx was very specific, and the fact that we know no jinxes that don't have a counter jinx (Throughout the books, even the invented spells have a counter jinx that the creators know about)
4. The reason why Harry is better in DADA is because of his reflexes and performance under pressure. Not because of any magical abilities. In the Harry Potter universe, magical ability is literally determine by knowledge of magical theory and only few other factors like intent, which is why Hermione can run circles around almost everybody else.

#+end_quote

By this point they had already covered nonverbal magic in class, so it's not unreasonable to consider that harry could cast some nonverbal spells. Also, it is possible to cast it verbally.

Here are two passages from DH featuring, ironically, Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry and whispered, ‘Levicorpus.' Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armour and replicas burst out of it like whitehot bodies, filling the cramped space.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  ‘Liberacorpus!' yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry's hand.
#+end_quote

Both of these spells are cast nonverbally by James. As for why he never got invited to the slug club, we simply don't know. He probably did get invited but rejected the offer, as Sirius did also get an invite. James' father invented sleakeezy which made the Potters rich, so based on that alone I think Slughorn would've invited him. It's likely James did something to piss him off anyway (such as bully one of his favourite students, Snape).

#+begin_quote
  I still think your biased against Hermione since the SNEAK jinx was very specific
#+end_quote

Okay, I think we can compromise that Hermione probably did invent that particular jinx. But if we do that, we can assume that the passwords and Snape-repelling charms on the map were original spells too.

In general I think Hermione just can't compare to James and Sirius because of their very shallow learning curve. They also seem to be more creative, which is very important when it comes to general magic. All evidence points to them being generational prodigies along with Snape, but still not on the same level as Voldemort and Dumbledore. Hermione is exceptional but not necessarily a prodigy, she is closer to the likes of Barty Crouch Jr, Percy or Bill Weasley, all of whom are intelligent and score exceedingly high on exams.

I think making Hermione more naturally gifted does her a disservice, because she fits better as the poster-girl for hard work. She can compare to students with greater natural talents and advantages such as magical upbringings, which is probably her most impressive quality.

********* 1. Regardless of whether it is possible to cast verbally, it was meant to be cast nonverbally according to Snape's potion book
2. Yes, we can assume that the Marauders made it. Although we don't know if Lupin and Pettigrew helped in its creation or not, but their names /did/ appear first, and Lupin is extremely intelligent according to Rowling.
3. What shallow learning curve? All we know is that they weren't studying right before their OWLs. We don't know anything else. Hermione, on the other hand, was doing OWL practice tests in the first term of her fourth year. Whether you like her or not, that's much more impressive.
4. How are they more creative? I think you're just acting like they're the Weasley twins or something, who /are/ creative (more than Hermione, at least), but all we know is that they like to jinx and hex people and that they created the password and Snape repelling charms, which is SNEAK level impressive in my opinion.
5. How are they generational prodigies along with Snape? They literally had to duel Snape 2 on 1 every time they bullied him. Hermione has much more awe-inspiring feats while they only have the Marauders Map and animagus transformation, which, as I said before, are all shared achievements, so unless you start calling Remus and Peter prodigies, you're being biased towards them. Hermione was two years ahead of her peers in magical theory and weeks to months ahead of them in practical magical (depending on the spell they're learning). I do think intelligence-wise, Hermione is probably Percy-level, but I think she has much more impressive feats and is more powerful because of her hard work. Hermione, as a teenager, performed a piece of magic Dumbledore himself called difficult in reference to Voldemort using it. If that doesn't change your mind about her canonical talent, nothing will.
6. I'm not trying to say Hermione is actually a genius rivaling the likes of Dumbledore. I'm just saying there's a reason frequent comparisons with her and McGonagall were made. I think she's well-read on magical theory to an extent that Lupin and Percy will probably never be. They're neurotic, but even when Percy was taking his 12 NEWTs, she was just as stressed about taking 11 final exams for a reason even though she ended up with a 320 on one of them (and probably all O's in the others too). It's because she has a need to be the best in everything she does that outstrips Percy and other characters just as intelligent as her. I don't think Percy could ever memorize all the OWL material and take OWL practice tests in the first term of his fourth year like Hermione did. In the end, while love is Harry's power, neuroticism is Hermione's.

** I can't really speak much on the hatred of a powerful Hermione, because I haven't really seen too much of it and I'd suspect it has more to do with a vocal minority of sexists, but I can put forth my two cents on why I like powerful Harry myself.

To me, Harry is a far more 'fixable' character. He perfectly embodies the typical 'forced hero' archetype in the first 4 books. He begins as just a regular wizard, not really caring too much about what he does until the Dementor incident. At this point we see the first glimpse into the potential Harry has, learning the Patronus Charm - which is by all accounts a very difficult spell - in only his third year. The next year, we see more of the same desire to learn when pushed, as he is forced to learn a lot of spells for the Triwizard Tournament.

When I first read the books I loved this. I'm a complete sucker for training arcs, and this felt like a great one. And then OoTP came out and... I hated it. Harry didn't feel like he was growing as a character through his hardships. Honestly he felt like he was regressing, and as the series continued I got more and more dissatisfied with it.

A magical genius Harry, specifically one that grows in strength after the fourth year, fulfils that dissatisfaction I had with canon, and I think that's why it resonates with myself, and many others.

On the flip side, Hermione was, in my opinion, already a powerful character in canon. She is already very smart, and has a characteristic strength for picking up magic. Making her more powerful, though great in some situations, seems unnecessary in a lot of fics.

** There's a lot of people arguing about cannon details in the other comments, but to me, the answer is really just plain old misogyny.

There's a lot of people who feel that Hermione had overshadowed Harry in the books, and there are more who are going out of their way to correct the perceived error of her being smarter than him. Coupled with her stealing Ron's and Harry's lines in the films, there has been a recent trend of people overcorrecting and pretty much just bashing everything she's done in cannon and then going after the fics that center her and celebrate her brilliance.

There is currently a lot of pushback against her for being extremely popular. There are also a whole bunch of posts calling out her apparent over-glorification in the fandom. And since she's female, her detractors are especially brutal. There are mutterings about how she's too perfect and therefore boring. And then when the flaws show up, it's either not a big enough flaw or she's flat-out too terrible and irredeemable. They nitpick all of her flaws while whining all the while that she was too strong, too smart, too brave.

This goes double with her relationship with Harry. You already mentioned the double-standard. Because Harry is the protagonist, Hermione being as brilliant as she is threatens that position. So they correct by giving him the genius, thus being the "proper" hero of the story. Meanwhile, they will deride Hermione for having the same traits as him.

Her being called Mary Sue comes from the same place. Harry is arguably more of a Mary Sue than Hermione is. She's brilliant, but we see her working very hard for all that she's achieved. Meanwhile, everything Harry is good at, he was a natural in - natural in flying, natural in DADA, innate protection from his mother, naturally good and kind despite the circumstances. If we want to talk about the one who's Mary Sue-perfect, Harry is a shoe-in, but as you said, no one likes poking at male characters that way.

Hermione is brave, brilliant, and beautiful, and the common fandom response to female characters like this is to tear them apart. This is neither new nor unexpected. It happens all the time, and this particular trend has been in the rise for some time now. Who she is in cannon is immaterial to how others see her and portray her.

As much as others would claim cannon injustices or poor writing or whatever, the poor (and sometimes hostile) response to Hermione all just boils down to misogyny. It's a prevalent issue in fandom culture and Hermione hasn't escaped that.

Some points:

- Dumbledore didn't know where the chamber was. Hermione also had the advantage of knowing the resident parselmouth could hear a voice no one else could.

- we have no idea if others had a time turner or not. It's also less impressive if Percy got 12 top marks without a time turner.

- Hermione is seen as close minded because of her behavior with Luna and her outright dismissal of things that don't coincide with what's written in books. Also, Voldemort /is/ a canon genius and Percy recommended Harry take divination because he also believed in it.

Most of what you list hear isn't magical ability. Hermione has her head blown off if Ron and Harry aren't paying attention in the café. Harry performs the protective charms after Ron leaves. Harry figures out where the horcruxes. Harry is quick to understand the hallows where Hermione doesn't.

- What did Hermione do that's comparable to the map and animagi? James and Sirius were called top students without living in the library. Being the cleverest 13 yr old girl someone has ever met isn't more impressive than being the cleverest in a year that includes a guy who modified an entire potions book.

Quick question, do you think people not believing Boris isn't an alien sent to spy on humans and that the earth is flat are close minded? Luna is honestly just the wizarding version of a conspiracy theorist. She'd probably believe 9/11 was an inside job, the moon landing was fake, vaccines cause autism, and think QAnon is legit. Also, what do you mean "dismissal of things that don't coincide with what's written in books". She clearly does since she's the one who asks about the Chamber which is known as a myth. Also, where do you get your information from? Jesus? I don't know any other sources she's supposed to get her information from. Voldemort is also unstable and Percy, for all his intelligence, isn't as reliable as Dumbledore or McGonagall.
4. She is the one who teaches Harry the spells. In fifth year, she created the SNEAK spell unless you think she was delving into some really dark magic since no one (not even Madame Pomfrey, who is shown to be able to heal almost everything) could fix it and Rowling said they faded like regular acne and left scars, so even as an adult, no one healed Marietta.
5. Transfiguring food because she's the best at magic is not magical ability? Performing three complex bits of magic on her first try is not magical ability? After months of seeing Hermione do it, he obviously picked up on it. I also don't know what you think stating that he found the horcruxes and understood the hallows. He was the one who Dumbledore showed the memories to so he could understand Tom Riddle and had a connection with him. The hallows was a last minute thing that he only truly understood once he died, became wizarding Jesus, and understood /everything/. That hardly counts.
6. For the map, JK Rowling said it was created with the Homunculus Charm, so they didn't create it or do any innovation. It was just an obscure charm they found. I'd rate multiple things Hermione did on that level: Polyjuice, doing O.W.L. practice tests in the first term of her 4th year, creating the SNEAK spell, the False Memory Charm, the Memory Charm, the Undetectable Extension Charm, etc. Being an animagus is very impressive, but it is more tedious than actually hard from the process we know, so I'd say Polyjuice is on the same level
7. Maybe we're not reading the same fics. In the fics I read, she's usually a shy bookworm who ends up with Draco, arm candy said to be a genius but really is there to just serve Harry and spout knowledge when he needs it (though she usually does one really OP thing to set up Harry's growth), and bashed Hermione who isn't actually smart and just spouts knowledge

I think, all in all, you're very much affected by Fanon. In canon, she regularly thinks for herself and even if she doesn't reach the conclusions everybody else does (like with SPEW), she will fight for her voice to be heard.

6. Sorry
7. Exaggerations are very common. Using the word "literally" is usually a sign of that. She dismissed it because it wasn't logical to believe in a fairytale no matter the similarities between it and real life. In fourth year, should she have believed she was the reincarnation of Cinderella because of the similarities?
8. Only the Homunculous Charm and charms to repel Snape: "/The magic used in the map's creation is advanced and impressive; it includes the/ [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Homonculous_Charm][/Homonculous Charm/]]/, enabling the possessor of the map to track the movements of every person in the castle, and it was also enchanted to forever repel (as insultingly as possible) the curiosity of their nemesis, Severus Snape./"
9. I don't know those authors, but I looked on Spookie's profile and the Harry's sound much more Sue-is than Hermione. /Dumbledore believes he's found the answer to how to end the war with Lord Voldemort by pulling a warrior from another dimension./

/The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn./

Everyone didn't say the Chamber was a false myth. Binns said he dealt with facts, not legends and myths. Hermione pointed out legends have some fact to them, which is what the CoS was. The Deathly Hallows were a myth, which she didn't believe in despite being in a world with mermaids and having used a very powerful invisibility cloak.

The simple fact is that when she was presented with ingenious, experimental magic she took a 'that's dangerous' rather than a 'how does that work' stance something that the actual geniuses of the series didn't do.

The initial, and majority of the, spells Harry taught in OotP were learned for the 3rd task. Ergo, if Hermione was the 1st to master them in OotP she didn't teach him those spells in 4th years. The only one you can credit is the Summoning Charm

If, as you just quoted, the Homunculous Charm only allowed the possser to track individuals on the map how exactly did they create an actual map by only using tracking and repelling charms?

And this does not negate that they literally created a map. Hermione did not have a creation under her belt.

******* 1. I think that you're ignoring that Hermione is a character that works o logic and evidence. She asks about the Chamber because there is sufficient evidence to believe it is true and the legend itself is actually pretty plausible, but wouldn't believe in the Deathly Hallows because Death giving three brothers three uber powerful items is just a silly way to have the moral of the story be that the third brother was the wisest.
2. How does she know it's safe though? As she states, it's not Ministry approved. Would you mix random chemicals because a random annotated chemistry book told you to?
3. No, they weren't. He learned them from books he read that year. Hermione was also stated to know the most jinxes and hexes out of all of them (including Harry).
4. They literally only used that charm and charms to repels Snape. It's not as impressive as many of her listed achievments.

She took the CoS seriously because it's in a history book rather than a story book. 17 year old Dumbledore and Grindelwald studied myth and lore and are far and away above her. She would never be able to explain what happened to Harry's wand in DH because she is too close minded and logical.

Harry, Dumbledore, and Grindelwald were all entranced by the hallows while she thought they were all dangerous and useless except the invisibility cloak, which she already had access to.
2. I'm not arguing she was a Dumbledore level prodigy in canon. The reason she didn't test the potions book is because of lack of interest. Hermione is more the type to read piles of books on magical theory than experiment and discover, and that's fine. People are so obsessed with the idea of "natural geniuses" but I like a character like Hermione who proves you can be exceptionally intelligent with "pushing the boundaries" of your field. Even real-life geniuses almost never do that and are more like Hermione (learning information at a very quick pace and retaining it all).
3. Oops, sorry. Hermione and Ron were the ones who found those spells, so I thought they had known the ones they trained Harry in.
4. They probably just sketched the map, no magic involved. That's why areas they don't know aren't there. Rowling also calls many of Hermione's feats impressive
5. I read the first chapter and didn't get that impression. Hermione was a shy, helpless bookworm who never fought back against Ron and Lavender for 5 years until Harry, her knight in shining armor, valiantly protected her and made them flee in terror from his awesomeness.

She's much more human than him, and when I first read the books, I remember relating to her a lot. I was always excited about school and learned all the material over summer so I would be able to have more free time to read more books and so I could prove I was smart to my parents. My intelligence was the only trait I could pride myself in, so I poured all my work into knowing more than everyone else I knew. I remember memorizing chapters from books because if I didn't, I'd ramble on and on about the subject. There are multiple other traits of mine that I found in her and many other people I know also relate to her, so it's not just me who feels that way.

If she's as good as in canon, but the other character is supposed to be better, then where should they be? If the OP character can solve all of these problems, but an equally powerful Hermione could not, then it makes an inconsistency. You either have to explain how Hermione couldn't solve it, or make a convoluted reason why your character could.

The easiest solution is to nerf Hermione. Otherwise suddenly they're way OP way too quickly. I mean, what, Polyjuice in first year? The next is to qualify her OPness into 'oh, just this' and then give proactivity and means to the new character.

There's also the possibility of just shunting Hermione to the side, but her being #1 in canon would still need to be addressed, as well as the reasoning behind the switch to a different house let's say.

** 1. Why Harry It often has to do with Harry's past aka The Dursleys: He was abused by them no questions about that and abused children hide things so they don't get into trouble. Examples: being stronger, smarter, talented in something ...

This means he has the potential for change in the story he is a fluid character easily changeable without too much change to the past. + The books are called Harry Potter so he is supposed to be the main character and have the core strengths. Power, Smarts, Bravery ...

2.Why not Hermione

She already is quite the powerful witch as you already said but she said to herself that it's all books and no talent in the movies does she not ( sorry if you prefer book quotes but I read those books 7 years ago in german so my memory is not that fresh)

Hermione is already a genius she did all the things you mentioned above so there is not much room for improvement. Of course, you could make her more powerful but then she would be essentially the perfect witch so there would be no reason for Harry to exist.

In a smarter!Hermione fic Harry would be the forgotten bright star that would be blinding beside Ron and a black hole next to Hermione.

3.A smart Harry that does not take away from Hermione.

Having Harry be talented and Smart does not undermine Hermione as easily he can simply be a different kind of smart for example Hermione learns easily from books and retains information that way easier but Harry in this imagined smart!harry fanfic needs a more practical/hands-on approach to learning he is bad at memorizing things but when he sees a spell and remembers wand movement and incantation he can redo it with ease and he gets most of his essay information through experimentation.

This way Hermione is still our information goodness and Harry is smarter than canon and does supplement Hermione through practical knowledge rather than be a replacement Hermione.

See two different kinds of smarts is possible and does not undermine any character but if Hermione is as powerful as harry there is really no need for harry to be in the story.

I dont think its about plain misogyny but I dont doubt that plays a big enough role, I think it's more complicated than that and summing it up as "they dont like hermione because they are sexist" only gives one part of the full picture.

** 1. To me it's that Hermione has always been super smart in canon and when people make her smarter it just seems like their making her godlike, which if in the fanfic she's the main character it's fine to read, but when she's supposed to be a side character it kinda bothers me. That's mostly because it seems like she's almost taking away from the main character and that's not how it's supposed to go when I read it in my opinion. However when Harry gets a power up I kinda enjoy it especially when they make him smarter.

2. Harry was supposed to be fit for all of the houses but once he's in Gryfinndor he kinda just drops all of those traits in my eyes. The hat really wanted him in Slytherin, so really he should be kinda personifying the qualities of Slytherin and we should've been able to see those qualities but really I don't think we ever did. When Harry gets a power up or he's made smarter, I almost think that it's what canon should've been like. Not even necessarily the power up, though I always think it's cool when that happens, especially when it's due to a creature inheritance or something like that, but when he gets smarter in fanfics I always wish that's what he had been like in canon because that's probably what he would've been in reality. An abused child would probably absorb a lot more of this new perceived reality they get because they think it'll be ripped away from them at any moment, but J.K. Rowling has always kinda downplayed Harry's abuse as “not important”, even going as far to say he's never really physically abused, even though his uncle legit choked him like it was an everyday thing.

3. I think that people get annoyed with Hermione getting a power up it's really because she's already basically an almost textbook perfect character and when she's made into something more it seems like too much. It makes her measure as the best out of everyone else and that kinds rubs me the wrong way sometimes too. Hermione also had a way of developing that a lot of her bossiness and know it all tendencies didn't ever go away where as I feel like in actuality they would've. Not saying they didn't get better but a lot of times I just felt like she didn't grow much as a character should've. I mean it in the way that her traits never really changed a lot and her core beliefs were never really questioned even when they were talked about which I think is unrealistic.

- It's really fun to see Hermione physically assaulting Ron with birds and fists. But if Ron complains a little bit too much, he is an ABUSER!!!

It's a very common stance in literature - a female character is much more likely to be called a Mary Sue than a male character.

*** Yes! So many people were pointing out cannon stuff in this thread, but cannon doesn't count for shit here. The double standard in Hermione's treatment is sexism plain and simple.

(And a lot of these people really downvoted you for pointing out the misogyny in fandom, huh?)

**** Grindelwald gets a pass. Snape is above average and has some specific areas he's good at, but I stay clear of fics when he is clearly OP.

A fic of Tom the barman as OP would warrant giving it a chance.

** Well you also have to think about the fact that in the movies Hermione's was much better and more progressive independent baddas woman in the movies while in reality she was a support person they all had flaws in the trio's but then that happens in the movies an example being when they made Hermione's who was paralyzed with fear in the books crawl over to Ron and tell him the spell(troll scene) this is a trent that continues it seems that jk Rowling iand jk Rowling seemed to be influenced by that also look at this Hermione was stupid in books 6 and 7 a relationship should be of equal partners which is why I personally think harry and Hermione should have been canon and especially the book 6 thing harry did nothing wrong hermione is a literal bitch she has no reason besides the fact that she's known Ron so long to even consider him romantically outside of a crush he's lazy insecure and would end up that guy who assumes your a cheater if your ever late(as we know in canon epilogue excluded)jk Rowling over the time changes hermione because of the movies and over time this shows there's also self inserting which is much easier for men and women in a power fantasy the thing is Hermione's character was ultimately an independent smart(looks arnt everything etc progressive woman) that's what she was made to be that was all she would be but because of jk Rowling's book 6 shenanigans book 7 Ron and etc etc you get what we have nobody want hermione to be the magical genius power fantasy because she is a support role a progressive independent woman support character how can you throw a support character into a badass power role good examples of how this would work would be Ben Ripley from spy school he is the protagonist then again that isn't a fantasy series but still he is a support smart character but because if the fact that he slowly gets by slowly gets better we can relate same can be said for percy Jackson who is more relatable than hermione will ever be because if the simple fact that hermione is a progressive bait if jk rowling were to make her anything more than that maybe she could be better another example would be annabeth from percy jackson(percabeth bitchessss)she is more flushed out with her trauma from talia what happens to Luke her relationship with her father and step mother we also see people she's met before protagonist came along she talks to others besides bullys we've been in her point of view there's also the fact that characters over all have more depth imo because of fatal flaws that's in my opinion why hermione will never be relatable and is much less likely to be in trashy power fantasy.

** hermione isn't the protagonist, nor is there any sort of build up to her realizing some sort of hidden potential. Harry is and up until HBP Rowling kept hinting at him being remarkable but then did an about face for the last two books.

Then there is the fact that a lot of people felt let down by Harry not living up to "dark lords equal" part of the prophecy. Yes canon makes sense and there was no way for harry to become equal to tom in seven years of schooling but he also was unremarkable compared to other people, Lily and James were both said to be extremely talented, Snape was researching and modifying potions and was doing the same with the dark arts and other spells. the marauders became animagi created their map and whatever prank stuff they came up with. Harry on the other hand was magically ordinary, he learned one impressive spell in his entire academic career, the rest of his achievements come down to luck, circumstance and his strength of character rather than any inherent talent or prior effort.

Did she? Harry's implied to be mostly on par with Ron in terms of magical ability (since they master spells at the same time, get the same grades, etc.), and the only extremely impressive magical feats he achieved (the Patronus, resisting the Imperius) were all because of his emotions rather than any magical ability.

Well, he had to deal with a lot of other stuff, so obviously his magical feats wouldn't be on par with them.

That's the whole point of the books though, right? If Harry was some Voldemort-level genius, than the whole moral about love overcoming all would not be as clear.

**** I agree with most what you said but that still doesn't change my reasons for why it is Harry is more accepted as a genius character in fanfics

The one thing I disagree with would be he had other stuff to deal with part. Everything we see happens weeks or months apart we don't get day to day until OOTP and even then there are time skips. That and the fact that he was in danger should have been a very good reason to get good. I have no problem with Rowling's interpretation of the prophecy with love being the power he knows not nor do I mind the plot armour bs she pulls to beat Tom but what I dislike is that Harry was shown to lacklustre compared to other people (everyone I listed above). Yes Harry and Ron were decent students but putting the studies in context the amount of work they do is actually a lot less then what a regular student does considering hogwarts equivalent UK schools which would be Eton or Winchester or Westminster. I know a lot of people think that Ron and Harry's attitude towards studies was normal but I really don't agree with that. Maybe it's just my own experience skewing my expectations of a high school student but they are barely above mediocre in my opinion. Yes they get ‘decent' grades but all that proves is that they aren't idiots.

Seriously though my opinions are probably influenced by my own high school experience where everyone was fairly driven

** Because Hermione is NOT a genius, can't accept other people's oppinions if they contradict her own (SPEW anybody?) and has the social skills and charm of a dead mouse?

Yes, I am exaggerating her lack of social skills a bit, granted - still, the the other things are quite true!

Hermion is good at magic, but in an academical way and she also isn't very creative (hell, Harry and Ron may be totally worthless at planing for the 'crux-hunt, but Hermione wasn't great either...they could have bought canned goods and even emergency rations in the muggle world and stashed them in the tent, they after all knew what was coming, but in the end they nearly starved! Damned, why?)...she also develops no new magics (unlike Dumbledore, Voldemort, Merlin, the Founders, the Marauders, the Weasley-Twins etc. etc...those are what I'd call geniuses!)

Basically Hermione can learn magic from books and teachers and use them well, but other than that she isn't as special as the fandom at large says!

As for Harry: Harry is simply totally unrealistic! If one of us fans were dumped into the HP-Universe with magic, we would learn and learn and learn and learn some more and we would probably try to find ways to abuse magic to get ahead (hell, something as simple as buying up old furniture and restoring it with the help of repair-charms, transfiguration etc. would easily make you tons of money and that's just one idea!)...Harry treats magic as a damn chore, like learning to screw with the laws of physics is boring!

That is IMHO why people often change Harry because this fact annoys many!
