I love Nundu's, and they are my second favorite magical creature (the other being the Basilisk). I'm looking for stories that feature them prominantly. This could mean any of the following:

- Crack
- Tropy, but as a MC's familiar or friend.
- Voldemort uses one as a weapon.
- It is an antagonist.
- etc.

Thanks, and have a great day!


** I don't know any stories that feature them in any great detail, but I figured I may as well list them given the low number posted. The first in linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon), which has a fairly funny encounter with a Nundu in chapter 19. The other is linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure), where the main character picks a fight with a Nundu in the opening chapter. You may need to read the first story of the series to understand everything, but even as someone who has never followed WH40k I still very much enjoyed most of it.

** On a random note checking the HP wiki about nundu I found these gems:

"The Nundu is extremely hard to subdue, and has never been defeated by less than around one hundred wizards working together.[1]"

and

"Newton Scamander had a Nundu in his suitcase during his travels to New York in 1926.[3] "

'Not dangerous' my ass...
