** linkffn(The Mysterious Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks). I can't spoil exactly what it does, though. Also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) where something more than the Stone ends up trapped inside the Mirror... but again, too big a thing for me to spoil unless you ask further.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

  What if, when Harry was at the Mirror of Erised in first year, he managed to bring his parents out of it by accident? Not that he's complaining! James and Lily are back!

** I remember reading a story where the Mirror was used to contain some evil spirit that had destroyed some Greek town thousands of you before. Draco was friends with Harry and his friends in the story. All I remember.
