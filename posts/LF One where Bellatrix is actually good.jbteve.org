I have found myself falling in love with the idea that Bellatrix was forced into becoming what she is. That she turned insane due to massive amounts of obliviations and imperios. Now I'm looking for fanfics which are similar to this.

Really loved Delenda Est, it's not exactly like what I said but it's a good Bella and I love it.


** linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive) does this idea excellently, and has her recover from it with the help of the main character. It's well worth reading anyway.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

** Not a fic but a fan made film on youtube called "Sisters of House Black" depicts her relationship with her sisters... she starts out as a normal teenage girl but the family pressure of carrying out the Black blood-purist traditions and her father's mental enchantments whenever she rebels, combined with her infatuation with Voldemort drive her insane.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** linkao3(All According to Plan) and its sequels are some of the very best fanfiction I have read. The main character is a 13 year old Bellatrix who has time/dimension traveled from the past to Harry's 3rd year. In the dimension that she traveled to, the adult Bellatrix is fairly cannon, and this is because from an early age Tom Riddle, before becoming Voldemort, cast compulsions on her to make her essentially obsessed with him/be his slave. I can't recommend this one enough.

*** I have seen the sequel in the recent updates and the summary there puts me off this heavily..Not a big fan of slash and there we have Bella together with two girls it seems like. Really like the premise to begin with but it's kind of off putting. I'd rather it was just a story where she fell in love with Harry, Neville, Fred/George or even someone like Dean or Seamus. There are plenty of Hermione/Bellatrix out there for those who like femslash.

Thanks for the recommendation though, didn't even know that what I saw was a sequel.
