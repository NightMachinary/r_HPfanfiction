LF any 4th year, or fics that start in 4th year, with the real Moody. Bonus if he personally trains Harry.


** As Harry and Ron stepped in the DADA class, at first everything seemed normal. Well except Professor Moody not being there, but that could be attributed to the fact that he might be so paranoid, that he thinks that someone is out to kill him in the classroom. Then Harry noticed that the class also was unnaturally silent. And then, both boys nearly got a heart attack. Seemingly out of nowhere Moody stunned them both, and then shouted ''CONSTANT VIGILANCE'' at the top of his lungs. 'Potter! How do you expect to defeat Lord Voldemort with this inattentiveness?! 15 points from Gryffindor.

** linkffn(12104688) has the real Mad Eye Moody (I'm still reading but I'm 99% sure at this point, if there is a major plot twist I will update) and I believe he's also going to train Harry but I'm not there yet.

EDIT: I can now confirm that Moody is actually moody in this fic. So far there is quite a bit of interaction but no training.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): The good thing is that Barty Jr is not stupid enough to impersonate Moody here, but the bad thing is that the outcome is still the same as in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Serpent-s-Renaissance][Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance]], linkffn(10991501): Year 4 is still ongoing, but I do believe that this Moody is real, although the author keeps everyone guessing here.
