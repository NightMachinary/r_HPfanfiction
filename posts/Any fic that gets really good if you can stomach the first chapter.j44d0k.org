** For clarity, are you asking for fics where the first chapter is bad and the rest are good?

**** The Venom Peddler iirc was pretty good in the first couple chapters, then got very slow for several chapters so that I almost stopped reading, but then picked up so it was pretty good almost til the end. The ending (last few pages) was disappointing but fixable if the author ever revises the story. There were a lot of typos too, but those don't bother me too much.

**** Also there is some wannabe pureblood-fic enforcer around here who downvotes any post mentioning HPMOR, but it has its own fandom so some people obviously like it. All I can say to that person if you're not into it, that's fine, just read something else and let others decide for themselves.

The author's note at the beginning says to hold out for 10 chapters or so (out of 120) before giving up. I'd say the writing settles down after maybe 20 chapters. There is lots of pure cringe in the first 10, and then occasional pockets of it through the rest of the book. There are structural rationalizations of this but I think the real reason is that the author wasn't that experienced at long fiction when he started, and got to be more skillful as the book progressed.

It is not for everyone. It has many deficiencies that are rightly called to task here. So it just depends on how big a deal those particular ones are for you.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) the first chapters aren't terrible, but they are extremely basic, and they seem to lean heavily on tropes. The story gets very good later on in my opinion.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(A Beautiful Lie) the first few chapters are a bit hard on you especially if you dislike Ron or Hermione bashing. But, it gets better as by the time it reaches 10th chapter they are more or less shoved into the background.

Overall a great read

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.
