*** This. I have nothing against turning canonically good characters into antagonists, but only if it's done realistically and not just by turning them into a drooling moron or cackling villain.

**** I mean yeah, that's not bashing, though. Bashing is when you take a character and balloon up their negative traits to ludicrous extremes. It turns them into the opposite of a Mary Sue.

And stories that include that sort of thing (that aren't crack) are always completely unreadable because they make me want to bash my head against a wall.

** I generally dislike bashing fics, however I would like to see fics where snape is shown as a dark character. He might have been brave for lily, but I still get a feeling that he hated harry even at his death

***** Fred and George are literally saints compared to the shit other people have pulled. Like in their first couple years they were probably blowing small stuff up and changing the colours of people's clothes. Hermione on the other hand literally knocked out 2 kids, doped them and shoved them in a tiny cupboard.

Daphne is basically an OC and it's only a few people that have ruined her character. like when the first Daphne the ice Queen fic came out everyone loved it but now it's been mutilated by some writers

****** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote

The testing practices the twins use, especially underage test subjects without parental consent and the lack of trained medical personnel on stand-by would leave them thrown into prison in any civilised society.

Also, Muggle-baiting Dudley.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione on the other hand literally knocked out 2 kids, doped them and shoved them in a tiny cupboard.
#+end_quote

Which has significantly less potential for fatal side-effects than what the Twins were doing.

I can enjoy bashing of many characters, but I severely dislike Hermione so I prefer her getting bashed.

*** Harry looked over at his new owl. Cold intelligent eyes stared back at him. The owl he had purchased hours ago had been nothing but a ploy. He had been a pawn, a mere tool in a game much greater than himself... 'The Greater Good'... Harry recoiled at the thought, it hadn't felt like his own. Harry shrugged, better to be a pawn than a victim. He went to find some bacon

** Hermione, Snape and Remus.

Also Molly but without the rest of the Weasleys getting bashed along with her, it seems like anytime Molly gets bashed most of her family do too. it would be a change to see Molly get bashed without the rest getting it as well.
