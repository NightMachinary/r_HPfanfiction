** I'm reading the series The secret language of plants. It has four parts. I found it on Archive Of Our Own and it's by Endrina. Remus and Snape are parental figures to Harry. So far it's really good. I finished book two. Book three is over 200k words. The other two parts weren't anywhere close to that! I'm crap at linking, so....

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
