Hey guys. I just finished "A Black Comedy" by nonjon and I have to say: I really really loved it. The humor was great, the grammar kmpeccable and the characters well thought out and entertaining. But you know what I enjoyed the most about this fic? The fact that the story was completely original. What I mean by this is, that I hadd no idea what was going to happen, because the story deviated massively from the one in the original books. It's what really sold the story for me. The fact that with each chapter I was dying to see what would happen next because I never knew a similar storyline. And I noticed, that all my other fav fanfics, like "Broken Bow" by XedAlpha, "Null" by Coeur Al'Aran, "Eclipse" by Darth0s or "A Dragon's Roar" by spectre4hire (all amazing stories, read em if you haven't already) are all AUs as well. So now I want to ask you guys: what are the best Alternate Universe fics, or fic that diverge from the original storyline to a point where the story is basically an original one, that you've ever read? I'm really hyped for your recs!:D

(Pls rec everything except Slash)

TLDR: What are the best AU-fics that y'all know of?


** Have you tried Alexandra Quick? A very different world from canon, more classical writing than nonjon but still good. A completely-OC story in an original American wizarding setting. linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is a complete AU inspired by Alanna the Lioness, less tight but very engaging.

There are also some big classics like linkffn(Forging the Sword), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). The first two are incomplete, the third in progress. Anything by enembee or joe6991 is also a classic AU tale, and most of their fics are complete.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
