It's especially annoying for lesser-used characters who aren't really characters in the story and are not really even in the story. Such a tease.

I don't check AO3 as often because there's usually fewer fics and the ones that are added don't have the searched character as anything resembling a main character a lot of the time.

*** Urgh. I hate the inbred argument with respect to Pureblood wizards. With the exception of the Gaunts, none of them show any signs of inbreeding.

It's one of those awful tropes like Moldyshorts that have somehow become the default "go-to" joke when writers with no ability to write humour want to make Harry look witty.

**** It's not an argument, it's an insult. Those do not have to be true. Though, given the canon assumed numbers of wizards, inbreeding is pretty much a given among purebloods. The signs might not be obvious, but they really have a very, very limited genepool if they stick to British purebloods.

To be a successful insult it has to have some element of truth. "It's funny because it's true" relies on it being at least partially true.

My point is not that they don't marry their cousins, etc. The point is that despite doing so they are not inbred. Inbreeding refers to the negative effects of a limited gene pool, not the limited gene pool itself. After all, all of humanity is essentially derived from a limited gene pool if you go back far enough - the Toba catastrophe reduced the human population down to around 10,000 individuals. Despite that, we don't classify as inbred, because most people do not show signs of genetic illnesses.

********* That's rather my argument. The meaning of inbreeding is intrinsically linked to its negative consequences. That's why it's a pejorative term. But in the magical world there is apparently no such negative consequences except in the most extreme cases, likely because magic enhances their resistance to non-magical problems. Since there are no apparent negative consequences, the term rather loses its meaning in that context and thus fails to work as a good insult.
