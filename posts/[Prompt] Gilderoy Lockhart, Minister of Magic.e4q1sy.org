Lockhart's skill with obliviation, desire for the spotlight, and the general incompetence of the Ministry as a whole lead to him obliviating and bluffing his way into office. I think this is very much in character for him, and I think there's even several non crack ways to write this out. Have Alastor Moody trying to investigate him as a retired Auror, but not being able to make headway thanks to several factors (interference from the Ministry, Rita Skeeter, Dumbledore always dragging him on missions). I'm not sure when he would get elected, but I could see him taking over at the end of the first war instead of Fudge. Just run wild with this one, because I think it's gold.

*** This is really good! It's a shame it isn't longer, but I honestly didn't think anyone had done this before so it's awesome.
