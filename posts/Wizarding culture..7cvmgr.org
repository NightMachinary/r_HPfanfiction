Question. In many fics we see that purebloods oppose muggleborns entering their society because they disrupt their culture.

I do wonder, what /is/ +purebllod+ pureblood culture? canon does not show much of it, as far as I know.

You, as a reader, what do you think when you hear "Wizarding Culture"?

And as a writer, what is your idea of it? How do you incorporate pureblood culture into your fics?


** There was no such thing as â€˜Pureblood Culture' in canon. Malfoys, Lestranges, and their ilks just hated people who had Muggle heritage.

In canon, other Purebloods with opposite ideology were their main enemies. Known Muggleborn participants, with the exception of Hermione, Dean, and Justin, were non existent.

There was also no such thing as Muggleborns being excluded from lucrative Ministry jobs. Nobby Leach made it to Minister, and one's heritage was not even questioned, as the case with Dirk Cresswell showed. It took until Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry when they finally went after people's ancestry. Even then, many managed to bribe and cheat out of their troubles. Cresswell only got caught because Albert Runcorn ratted him out.

My question doesn't really go there. More like a broad meaning of culture.

What kind of music do they listen to? Would they listen to Mozart? Some fics put him as a wizard, others put him as "one of the good things muggles managed to do"

What does an adult wizard do for fun? Are there [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_club][Gentlemen's clubs]] for Wizards?

You know, things like that.

*********** I haven't read much on Pottermore, but the main things I did read, primarily the international schools and stuff, just kinda irked me. Ilvermorny was probably the most safe and boring option she could have gone with, in my opinion. It's basically just "Hogwarts, but American!" and tied to the book's story just for the heck of it (the tie into the Gaunt family). What I've seen of the other school are just little summaries that gloss over more interesting aspects (basically everything with the Russian school is just mentioned with no follow up), stereotypical (of course the Japanese school uses Cherry Wood wands...), among other reasons.

I also can't fault her for only writing 7 because the rest would be a headache, but why mention there are 7 main ones and not just give a general description and mention a school from the region as an example? Europe has 3 major schools? Four if you count Siberia as technically attached to a European nation? The whole of the massive continent of Africa only has one? Japan represents all of Asia, and no word about how Korea or China would feel about that? No Middle Eastern school? That last one would be extremely interesting to me.

Overall I'm just not really a fan of what I saw.

************ To each his own, but I loved the story of Ilvemorny and its founder. American is a country full of immigrants (with a lot of British immigrants) so it makes sense that the wizarding school has lots of Hogwarts influence.

************* But if it is full of immigrants, why does only show British/Irish influence? America was founded by the British, but allied the French and a very large portion of the population came from Germany/Eastern Europe/Scandinavia. If the idea is for it to be inspired by immigrants why not have a melting pot school instead of just the British one? Also I just think some mention of Native American/First Nations would be interesting seeing as how magical their folklore is.

And while the African school sounded interesting, it's still only one school for one of the largest continents in the world. Same with Asia. Also it mentions wands not being used and them being largely a European thing, but the only thing we have mentioned about the Japanese School is their wands.

If there's only around 10.000 inhabitants in magical Britain, and taking into account that not every wizard is going to like this weird muggle-imported thing that is "rock" (can you /imagine/ Draco stooping to such levels?), and that those who /are/ okay with it would probably be fine with listening to muggle bands, I don't think it's unreasonable that there'd only be a handful of British wizarding bands.

**** *Gentlemen's club*

A gentlemen's club, or formerly traditional gentlemen's club, is a members-only private club originally set up by and for British upper-class men in the 18th century, and popularised by English upper middle-class men and women in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Today, some clubs are more accommodating about the gender and social status of their members. Many countries outside the United Kingdom have prominent gentlemen's clubs, mostly those associated with the British Empire, in particular, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have enthusiastically taken up the practice, and have a thriving club scene.

** I would like to focus on a small part of wizarding culture that comes often up in fanfiction: Arranged marriages. In my head-canon, arranged marriages would be common, especially in rich families. However, I don't believe in magical binding contracts.

Love potions are a big problem and they always were. Dose a rich boy or girl with a potion and you can comfortably live the rest of your life. Many noble families didn't accept this. Both wizards and muggles, feared that their heirs would be dosed with love potions. To stop this, they started to arrange marriages. Affection would often still arise between the people that married. If not, it could be helped with potions. (Yes, love can't be brewed, but a mild potion can help people being more open to each other. This can help developing love. Especially, when it happens knowingly).

When the wizarding world retreated in secrecy, many parts of the muggle world stopped executing this practice. By wizards, this is seen as a weakness. Rich muggles can easily be dosed with potions. There are enough examples that this happens, some fully documented, others merely suspected. Wizard families often still practice marriage contracts. Not because they don't love their children, but rather because they do.

*Disclaimer:* This is in no way my political opinion on arranged marriages. That is a totally different discussion and (luckily) love potions are no issue in the real world.

** There's a reason that my favorite type of stories are those that explore wizarding culture. It's just a shame that there's so few of them that are decent (seriously, there's like 3 total).

For me, it's not that hard of the concept, but the execution is very difficult. Like, there are many muggle cultures. Many countries have their own traditions, etc. It makes sense that the wizards would have their own. After all, their entire government pretty much exists for the sole reason of keeping their existence a secret. So, when there are thousands of wizards who group up isolated from them, it makes sense that they would have their own culture.

I wouldn't call them ignorant of muggles (I think things like "please-men" and "firemen" are played up in canon to get a cheap laugh from the reader, since we see both Draco and Ron make normal muggle references. But, I do think a pureblood wizard's view on muggle culture wouldn't be much different than an American's view on French culture. They're aware of some aspects of it, but not others.

So I think it really comes down to what a culture is actually comprised of, and just replacing the muggle aspects with wizards. Like, you've got art, religion, music, sport, traditions, language, and things like that. So instead of famous muggle artists, there could be famous wizard artists, and we know moving portraits are a thing. We know of wizarding sports as well.

It's not much of a stretch to think that all aspects of their culture would be influenced by magic in some way. That's how they can claim it as their own.

The biggest sticking point that always pops up in this type of story is always religion. There's really no reason for wizards to celebrate christmas or believe in a fictional god, not when magic exists. The most common excuse I see in these types of story is that it was something that someone at some point enacted at Hogwarts in order to make the transition for muggleborns into their world to be more comfortable and familiar, and some wizarding families took it up as well, to be more accommodating. Personally, I prefer the paganistic route that some stories seem to take, incorporating the typical festival days of midwinter and samhain, etc. In fitting with other aspects of wizarding culture, it makes sense if there's some actual magical benefit for celebrating a particular day, even if it's just an increase in magical crop yield, or a temporary affinity to a certain type of magic. I just think the idea of ritualistic offerings to receive a magical benefit is more interesting that Harry waking up in the morning and receiving a box of chocolate frogs.

** I've done a lot of thinking on this topic for my fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). In my headcanon for this fic, I looked at Wizarding society as an insular group heavily influenced by the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts. Thus, I've crafted a religion for them based on the old Anglo-Saxon gods (Britain) and the old Celtic gods (Ireland). This is one of the aspects of their culture that originally didn't set them apart from muggles, but during the witch buring and pagan-hunting eras it certainly did. In 1100 A.D., there's a big to do with the muggle king (don't want to give away too many details) and it leads to the rise of a quasi-government for the wizards. Around 1600 A.D., I have the "birth of the modern Wizengamot", which is a bicameral body consisting of a House of Lords and a House of Commons. Skipping forward to modern day, the government structure is similar to 17th/19th century English government. So, the impacts of that on culture. You've got an insular group of individuals, and not a lot of change coming in. I see the strictest of Purebloods sticking to the old pagan traditions and, to some extent, following more traditional gender roles, especially in regard to who can inherit a Wizengamot seat. There's also a strong influence of Victorian fashion in the Wizarding World, at least at formal events. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on which character is speaking) a lot of these old traditions are fading away due to modern times, as well as more mixed marriages (muggles and wizards, muggleborns and wizards). In my fic, the upper echelons are trying to hold tight to the old traditions where most others either ignore them (essentially are secular) or are trying to do away with them.

** I think of it as a group of clans who all have distinctive qualities and outlooks, and who look out for themselves and their own first, coming together for the sake of organization and protection. They value their heritage and protect their secrets, but value magic and the need to teach it to their children. They forge political alliances, have feuds, and often distinctive outlooks on life in general.

Their problem with Muggleborn entering could be not so much new magicians, but more the infusion of muggle ideals which are completely opposed to this. Muggles would almost automatically assume that their system is oppressive and backwards. They might be right too, it's fanfiction after all, you decide.

I started this way of thinking through some fics that focussed on the black family in particular, and how they form essentially a universe onto themselves when it comes to their thinking. A black will never consider themselves anything but worthy of whatever it is they wish to pursue, and don't consider themselves beholden to the judgement of anything but themselves and their familial hierarchy. They are amaoral in anything beyond that. That kind of thing makes a lot of sense to me in a magical world, where everyone has the potential to be completely self-reliant without too much effort and have their power only be limited by their drive to self-actualize. Magicals aren't gods, but they're certainly a class of being onto themselves, if they choose to be.

Then again, this is obviously my headcanon. I don't think J.K. envisioned it could hardly have been case post-Grindelwald anyway.
