...is James Potter's reincarnation. No, /literally/. Every night, when he goes to sleep, his dreams are simply the days in James I's life. This is an idea I /really/ want to write, I've got some bits planned already.

More about it: It's going to be one chapter next gen, one chapter marauders era-- alternating throughout the fic. James Sirius' entire year is reincarnations; so all of them have the 'vision-dreams'; but the pairings and personalities (and backstories!) of the characters will be entirely different. (Also, Regulus Black will live.) Eg. There'll be a Lily Evans, but she won't look a lot like Lily I. Also, there'll be some hilarity over Lily Luna and Lily Reincarnated. And Lily Reincarnated will also /not/ end up with James Sirius. Trust me, he won't do a Prongs and fall in love with your typical genius redhead (aka the Potter Effect, which is a very overused trope in fanfics).

What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear ideas, and (if you like) I'll tag you in my tumblr (if you leave a url)!


** So, he's his own grandpa?

** Great idea! I /just/ read a fic like this, btw. Wait, I'll link it here. It's sort of similar. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17066708][Names are Labels (on the bottled essence of our pasts)]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry James Potter is born on July 31st with a head of black hair and blue eyes which occasionally look very green of which James Potter assumes is from his wife's side of the family, doesn't her sister have blue eyes he wonders? The point is nonetheless that Harry is a strange child by all accounts, wizarding ones included.“Those are the eyes of an old soul.”Arabella Figg says to Lily as she rocks Harry in her arms, Lily who is familiar with the muggle term nods, but James who knows the rather more magical term peers at his son and wonders if Squibs have a way of knowing these things.
