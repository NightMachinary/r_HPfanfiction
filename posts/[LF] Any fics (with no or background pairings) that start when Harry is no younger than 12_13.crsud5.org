Sure it can diverge before this time but can the main plot please start anytime after when second year would take place. I just find if irritating when having to read through a first year, as in mind at fics this is either where Harry is far too mature or powerful for his age and I want to avoid this. Yet I find it very slow going when it has been done right.....

"During the summer between first and second year Harry does something that has unexpected consequences, for himself and for the wizarding world."

Harry doesn't get into a serious relationship, the series is complete at 440k, and it is a crossover with MCU - AU Loki helps Harry out but it is set before the Avenger's timeline.
