*** A room escape with mentally challenging things seems like a good idea.

And I really like the capture a person challenge idea. No idea how I'd pull that off but it definitely sounds interesting.

  You get dropped off out in the wild and have to make it back to the central point without being detected.

The forest one I'm having is a bit too similar to this. They get portkeyed out in the forest and have to make it to the center of the forest and back.

** How about doing something like a magical Turing test? 3 dimensional maze? Project creation? (Create something new using 2 or more fields of magic)

** hmm, maybe do something so it comes as a surprise to the contestants? like tell them its a week later then it actually is, and then kidnap/drug them the night of the task, and force them to compete, where half the task is figuring out that the task has already started? (IDK like in inception, they have to figure out they are dreaming and what they see isn't real)

** Hrm. Elemental theme? You already have: Fire/X/water/Earth/Aether (especially if the maze has some ethereal/trippy gimmick, like being a maze of 3-dimensional paths through a 4-dimensional shape).

So something Air-based, but not brooms.

Maybe try to make them survive in a vacuum? They have to make a rat survive for as long as possible. (And bubblehead charms can be handwaved to not work by claiming they filter oxygen out of the air/water rather than conjure it, if you want).

** A treasure hunt for the clue for the Third Task, possibly involving riddles and/or ciphers, with the treasure unlocking a Boggart that takes the form of the hostage for the third task.
