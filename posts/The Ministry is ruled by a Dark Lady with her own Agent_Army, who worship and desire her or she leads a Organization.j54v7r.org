Its more of a concept for a (dark) story, that i thought about. I had the image about an attractive, Beautiful Witch sitting on a Chair and around her said "agents" (among those Draco and Harry).

how she gained this position and can control her People or the Magic community, aside from her attractive looks? Maybe Charisma. Tom Riddle could manipulate People with his appearance after all.

But if this is enough to make Honest People like Harry do "unspeakable" things...i dont know. Maybe she would allow few to refuse to do certain things, but still keep them. But as i said, its more of a concept. I will flair it as Request, because im curious if such exist.

Well, as already mentioned, she keeps her Agents close and loyal by her Charisma and attractivity. She might even get intim with some, if not all of them or only with those, that she acknowledges most.

I leave it open, if such could be a Canon or an AU Fic.


** Even Tom Riddle didn't gain loyalty from Bellatrix by offering his body, and it's something really silly that the best a female character can do is offer sex to make her followers loyal.

If this character of yours is ruling the Ministry then she make her powerful as Voldemort. Take inspiration from Disney movies. She could've casted a powerful enchantment on Harry to make him loyal.
