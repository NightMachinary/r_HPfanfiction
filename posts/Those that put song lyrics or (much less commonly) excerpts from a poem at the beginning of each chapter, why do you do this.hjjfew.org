This is not a post complaining about this. I am merely curious and genuinely do not understand why some authors do this.

Are they trying to communicate something to the reader? Do the song lyrics have anything to do with the chapter? What about readers (like me) who aren't familiar with the song at all? Are we supposed to listen to the referenced song before reading the chapter so that we can be in the right frame of mind to read the chapter?

Is it supposed to imply that the musical artist exists in the fanfiction world and one of the main characters of that chapter listens to that song?

This is very confusing.


** I believe it's the inspiration for whatever is happening in the chapter, or it's kinda like a theme song for each chapter. Can't describe it any other way because im stupid

** It can be for a lot of things. Inspiration for the chapter, something that captures the theme of the story very well, something that elaborates on the thoughts of a specific character in the story, or even a theme song assigned to the chapter. It can even be because it just sounded neat and the author wanted to share it with their readers.

I love the show Criminal Minds and they begin and end each episode with a quote, I thought it was cool and it's fun finding quotes

** I've done it before, and it's usually because it has something to do with the chapter. Whether you listen to the song or not is up to you, but the actual quoted bit will have something to do with the chapter/section ahead. It's a thing in fantasy novels, usually, where chapters are prefaced with quotes and verses. I remember a series called Jig the Goblin had an entire epic song (Jig the Dragonslayer) and the novel was peppered with verses from it, along with a delightful tune called "The Sweet Tome of Ally Ba'ma". And yes, if you get that reference, it is exactly what it sounds like.

You've pretty much captured the range of reasons, though. I know some people do it just because that was what they were listening to while they were writing, so they're hoping to share music or put the reader in the mindset they were in while writing, I know some try to make the song thematic or foreshadowing of something in the chapter ahead, and I'm sure there's other reasons too.

I'd imagine for most people, it's because they saw a novel do it and found it added to the chapter, so they took a stab at it too. :)

** I don't know about now but early on some fanfic writers for harry potter would put enough "fair use" material into their fics that it was very clear that they couldn't monetize them. If it was extremely clear from a few angles (saying you weren't, giving credit to jk, and making the fic clearly unsaleable) then her lawyers would ignore it in favor of fics that were taking less stringent measures.

â€‹

To be clear I have no idea if that was actually true it is just what I heard 2nd or 3rd hand and it seems reasonable. the internet was the wild west back then. I assume people do it now because they saw people do it before and they thought it was cool.

** One of my favourite authors - Loten - does it, and it feels like every quote (and they're quite short) feels like an overture to the coming chapter. It always fit into the setting.

** The song made me feel a thing, so now you have to suffer with me.

I'm kidding, I don't do that as a writer so idk why. But as a reader, it's a fun way to get to know new music from someone who already likes something in common.

** I put suggested theme songs at the start of each chapter. I listen to music while writing, so I figure some may want to do the same when reading.

Yes, they relate to the theme of the chapter and are supposed to say something about it - not anything you'd miss by just reading if you aren't into music, but often I do find a song that conveys the mood I had in mind when writing a chapter up nicely and succinctly. It is up to the reader whether or not they want to listen but I do think it would help with the frame of mind if they are into music generally.

No, definitely not supposed to mean anybody in the story is actually listening to it.

** I have a series of one shots where each one shot is actually based on a song and how I can see it applying to characters/situations.

I don't think it's necessary to know the song to understand the story, but I feel like it sets the tone for those that do.

** It's called an epigraph (a short quotation or saying at the beginning of a book or chapter, intended to suggest its theme).

Honestly most of the time I ignore them, which is hypocritical of me because I teach English and almost always make my students analyze the epigraphs of stuff we read. But yeah, they're there for a reason. If it's song lyrics, you can look up/listen to the song if you want, but usually it's just the words that matter.

** It sets the tone, or subverts the upcoming chapter, or presages an event - my favorites are when everything that happens is listed at the top of the chapter, in order! So when I go searching for a quote, or to find a specific piece of advice, I can find it by checking the chapter headlines. I grew up reading a lot of Victorian lit.

** I usually don't. It's actually kind of hard to do in a meaningful way.

But I'm currently working on a fic with about 55 chapters, and each is titled with lyrics from a 90s song. The main character is a musician, and the more melancholy alt/grunge rock of the 90s really sets the mood.

The full playlist of 150+ songs mentioned in the fic is going to be AWESOME.

** I think of it like those hacky tv sequences where they kill 5 minutes playing a song to some "dramatic" scenes without any dialogue, but worse because it breaks the flow. It may be perfectly executed and relevant and my assessment may be unfair, but that's how I perceive it.
