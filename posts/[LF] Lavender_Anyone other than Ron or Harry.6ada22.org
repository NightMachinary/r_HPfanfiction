Preferably 20k+ words, but not too important.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] features Lavender/OC in several of his stories. I like how he writes her-I find myself getting a little irritated by her.

** This is my first recommendation, and oh boy am I happy it is for this one fic.

linkffn(3771297) Stars Fall

A post-DH Lavender/Remus, slightly AU, of course, but only about Remus and Tonks's survival. If it wasn't for the well written summary, I don't think I would have even clicked on it. And yet, I fell in love with this fic. It is beautiful, realistic, painful, touching... A dive in their post-war lives and struggles, when time passes and people grow.

  A post DH AU in three parts. We all craft our own happy endings. Even in the best of all possible worlds, romances decay and constellations fall from the sky, but Remus Lupin will pin them back up in a world that has already forgotten what he sacrificed.

*** That may of been what threw me off since Lavender is seemingly never paired with Harry, not even in harems does Lav get love.

We need more Harry/Lavender Stories

#+begin_quote
  The Ink Drop was the best-kept secret in the nightclubs of Wizarding London. Werewolves, or those close enough, could work out their sexual appetites on willing submissives looking for a rough ride, and nobody had to get hurt. The system generally worked best when the werewolves stayed clear of each other, but someone forgot to tell the new girl about that.36,000 words. NC-17 and then some -- for sex, violence and the foul language of werewolf subcultures. Bill/Lavender. Past Remus/Bill. Quite a bit of Fleur. Several werewolf OCs. July 2008.
