Honestly, the majority of the fics where Harry is innocent but sent to Azkaban are bad. So can you guys recommend any good ones to me?


** *Wizengamot, Old Courtroom 4*

/I was doing my transfiguration homework together with Ron and Hermione (in particular, Emeric's theories of what can go wrong in human transfiguration), when I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my neck and my eyes and the world disappeared./

/Everything was completely gone; my body was numb, everything was silent and completely dark, I couldn't even hear or smell air./

/I don't know how long I was in that void for, after a while I started hearing a faint ringing and seeing shapes and feeling chills, but I think those were my imagination./

/All of a sudden, I felt another sharp pain like before, and the world reappeared again, but I wasn't in the Gryffindor Common Room (I was there before, by the way). I was in one of the unused classrooms on the 6th floor, standing over Neville with my wand in my hand. Neville wasn't moving and his chest/

Rufus Scrimgeoer looked up at the court, "Mr. Potter's affidavit ends here. According to his handler in the room at the time, Mr. Mayfall, Mr. Potter started shaking and put down his quill, refusing to respond to any of Mr. Mayfall's question and even shifted his chair to avoid looking in his direction."

Scrimgeoer put aside the affidavit, glancing briefly at Harry Potter, who (instead of the usual chair with chains on it) had been wrapped up in a golden net that was hovering just above the ground, before he put aside the suspect's affidavit and pulled out several more scrolls of parchment.

"Now, these affidavits were prepared by Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnegan...most of Mr. Potter's yearmates, actually." he coughed, "All of their contents are quite similar, so I'll summarize."

"Early in the evening of the 31st of October, shortly after dinner, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter were in the Gryffindor Common Room, studying for Transfiguration, when Dean Thomas came down the stairs from the dormitory that he, Harry and Ron shared. Dean claimed that he had seen an unidentified grey owl fly in and drop a small, hand-sized package on Harry's bed before leaving."

"Harry, Ron and Hermione started guessing what it could be, before Harry went up to his dormitory alone to investigate the box. A small amount of time later, 2 minutes by Hermione Granger's estimate, he returned and claimed that some 'smart-ass' had sent him a fake Chocolate Frog Card for..." Scrimgeoer paused, considering his audience, before he continued, "A certain /dark wizard/ who murdered his parents."

"Harry Potter claimed at this time that he was 'a little frustrated' and wanted to go for a walk before continuing with his homework; he noticeably had some gloves on and was wearing a knitted hat created by a house-elf called Dobby. He stepped out of the common room's portrait hole without offering for anyone to join him, and left."

Scrimgeoer put down the parchments again, "This is where the affidavits of the Gryffindor tower members end; it seems nobody encountered Harry for the next...approximately 1 hour 10 minutes, whereupon Filius Flitwick encountered him fleeing from the crime scene in a panic; when asked what was panicking him, Harry brought Professor Flitwick back to the classroom where Neville had been found..."

*Later...*

"...In closing, it is the opinion of this court, based on discovered evidence and affidavits, that Harry Potter is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of killing Neville Longbottom using the Aztec Heartburn Curse. Despite Mr. Potter's claim of 'being sent to a void', we could not find any cursed items on his person capable of possession or some other such effect; the 'Dark Lord Card' found in his room also had no such properties and seemed to just be some kind of twisted joke. However, Mr. Potter's wand, when tested, confirmed that it had been used to cast the Aztec Heartburn Curse on Neville, and that nobody but Harry Potter had touched it. Furthermore, exhaustive testing proved that nobody except the usual Gryffindor students had been in Mr. Potter's dormitory, nor did anyone accost him on his route to Mr. Longbottom, meaning that in all likelyhood Mr. Potter could not have been Imperiused or bewitched."

Scrimgeoer closed his eyes for a few seconds, before opening them again and announcing, "As a side note, we filed a request to the Unspeakables to have someone with a Time Turner and an invisibility cloak observe the incident, but they declined, citing provisions 1 and 44 of the Time Travel Act. The jury will now vote as to whether Harry Potter should or should not be considered guilty."

The voting didn't take long. There were still a few holdouts who believed Harry's assumption that something had taken over his body, but the lack of any cursed diary, locket, or anything similar to be found convinced the rest of the Wizengamot.

They voted guilty, 47 to 3 with a 50 person turnout.

Scrimgeoer looked around, "I see...Well, then, Mr. Potter, I am now speaking to you directly. You have been found guilty of premeditated murder using a proscribed dark curse with no mitigating factors, so I hereby sentence you to one life sentence in Azkaban. You may be required to provide additional restitution to the Longbottom family at a later date."

As the court slowly adjourned, the golden net binding Harry Potter floated just above Scrimgeoer's head, on its way to a transport to Azkaban.

As it passed by him, Harry nervously muttered, "But I don't remember /doing/ any of it..."

*In the meantime, back at Hogwarts, on the grounds, directly below the window of the 6th floor classroom where the murder took place...*

Ernie MacMillan was shocked. He never thought Harry would go bad like that...well, technically he did, back in his 2nd year, but he was younger and dumber then and he was wiser now.

He was pacing in a circle around the exterior of Hogwarts, disinclined to talk to anyone at the moment, counting random things like patches of dirt on the ground or weeds taller than others to try and take his mind off things.

/One, two, buckle my shoe, three, four...huh? What's that?/

Ernie bent down. There, in front of him, slightly buried in the grassy dirt, was a little black onyx ring.

"I wonder who this belongs to?" he murmured quietly to himself. Bending down to pocket it, his thumb and finger touched the ring...

And then Ernie felt a sharp pain in his eyes and in his neck, and the world around him disappeared.

** Not your typical Azkaban fic. Centers around Harry's daughter primarily. I should say, I haven't read this in a while, but I remember thinking it was pretty cute at the time.

*** This entire comment is a spoiler so don't read if you haven't already read the story.

[[/spoiler][I hated in so much when his wife died though, it didn't seem to add anything but pain to the story, and I feel like the end would have been far more emotionally rewarding has she not. I really don't see why he did it and it rankles a little as there seemed to be no explanation or reason for it from a narrative perspective. She just died pointlessly and it sucked a whole lot. It actually still hurts a little to think about, the story drew me in emotionally and just left that grief there without dealing with it either.]]

**** That is my main problem with the fic, too. It would be so much better and more rewarding in every sense without this.

Or, if it actually changed anything. It feels like the author steered in a direction, and this minor event wouldn't change anything, right? So he continued right ahead.

**** I think that might be the point though. Sometimes death just happens and you can't really do anything about it. There's no one to blame and it's hard to believe it actually happened. I found it to be very realistic. Still fucked me up emotionally though and I would have preferred it if she had lived.
