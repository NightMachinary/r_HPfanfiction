:END:
I read this probably 3-4 years ago and it was about how all the main harry potter kids (Rose, Lily, etc) + Scorpius live in a house altogether and there's a huge death eaters threat and they have to leave the house after it gets attacked

-the parents leave the kids in the house to go fight against the bad guys and only visit occasionally

-Rose and Lily do not get along at all and when Lilly gets a cat rose dangles it off a balcony but Scorpius saves it

-Scorpius plays the piano and stays in his room alone

-After they leave the house they end up at Hogwarts at some point and when they get attacked Scorpius gets poisoned glass in his back? And then I think they go to Shell cottage to heal him and recover

I loved this fic but I can't seem to find it at all!! I may be mixing up details of two stories but please help a girl out <3
