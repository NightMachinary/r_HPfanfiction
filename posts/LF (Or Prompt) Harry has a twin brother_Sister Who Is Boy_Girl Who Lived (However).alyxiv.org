But Harry lives with his parents as well; no James, Lily, Sirius and Remus bashing

Would also like to have the brother/sister being the real Boy/Girl Who Lived, (No stupid wrong Boy/Girl who lived) while Harry maybe helping his sibling, while at the same time doing his own thing

I'd rather not have Weasley bashing as I really like the Weasley's

No super OP Harry, smarter or more powerful than he was in canon is fine, but being OP in a way that makes it seem unbelievable is not.

No Harems

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

If anyone would like to write this let me know! Would love to read it.


** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. One of the most popular and almost equally polarising. I'd say the world-building is fantastic. But it comes of as kinda angsty power-wank
