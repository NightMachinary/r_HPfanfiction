So there are Eleven schools of Magic, And we know of 8 so far, which are:

- Hogwarts. Which basically serves England, 2 Irelands, Scotland and Wales.

- Beauxbatons. Which serves Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg

- Durmstrang. Which serves Norway, Sweden, Finland, likely Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and other eastern Europe countries. Maybe even Deenmark

- Koldovstoretz. Russia

- Castelobruxo. Serves all Southamerica

- Ivermorny. Serves Northamerica

- Mahoutokoro. Serves Japan, that we know of

- Uagadou. Which serves all of Africa

​

So the question... which ones are the other 3?

- It seems like America and Africa get too few schools compared to Europe, compared to the population. They seem like token schools, especially the Africa one. Like JKR tossing one school in Africa because there had to be at least one. But I am willing to let it pass... maybe Castelobruxo and Uagadou are huge compared to Hogwarts.

- So aside from those that are thinly covered we have zones that are not covered so here is my best guess:

1. Another one in Europe. Yeah, I know we already have a lot of schools in Europe compared to the rest of the world, but we need one to serve Germany, Italy, Greece etc...

2. Honestly, by population, we need 2 more in Asia at least. Lets have one in India, and we would need this one to serve the Middle-East too.

3. China is massive, and I don't see getting them along too much with Japan. I know that we still need to cover Australia, but the population there is rather small, so lets make this. Australia and New Zealand people go to Japan school and 11th is China only.

​

Now... if you asked me what would I do if I had another one... a twelfth school... I would say, put it in Egypt. Africa breaks the population in 2 schools and parts of arab people can go to Egypt school instead of India. Not sure if Korea would be better going to China, Japan or India though.

​

Thoughts? Extra points for creative names for the missing schools.


** Apparently the Eleven Schools of Magic are just the ones that bother to register with the ICW. So, there could be a million pop-up schools all over the world, or Magical Korea could be as Isolationist as Muggle North Korea and have their own school registered with themselves and not the ICW, for example. Could just be a Hedge-Magic tradition of teaching in your living room for most magicals, too.

Could be that South Eastern Europe and the Middle East were served by the same school. Founded during the Crusades for European Magicals living in the Middle East in that kind of 'army camp school' sort of way, then their requirement relaxes over time and they start letting the locals in too. Magicals being illogically obsessed with doing things how their ancestors did them, they kept up that tradition rather than doing the sensible thing and building more schools.

**** I forgot until now, but I actually posted something I found about this awhile back and the post discussion might be interesting to you. No idea if it actually will be, but it's certainly relevant enough to post. :)

** I still hold that there is the oldest magical school at Budeč, Czech republic (long story, there is a group of Czech fanfiction writers around the server [[http://budec.net]]).

*** Why would the oldest be in the modern Czechia and not somewhere like China, Babylon, Italy or Greece?

**** Sorry, older than in Britain (and thus older than France or Durmstrang), so most likely the oldest one in Europe, and it was because most famous wizards were Czechs or Czech-related (they don't care about fake national humility).

** In my Headcannon there is 12 Great Schools of Magic worldwide and the other four are:

1-) Tigadissi School of Sorcery and Wizardry: Located in the middle of the Red Sea rift. The whole school is under the water, buit inside a series of Sunken and is protected from flooding by incredibly old wards. It is the oldest wizarding school, builded by the Queen of Saba on the orders of King Solomon. Unfortunetly school was sacked twice, first by Romans and then by Arabs and majority of its library is lost. Accepts students from Middle east and Horn of Africa. Education language is Aramaic.

2-)Longshang Academy of Magical Arts: Wizarding School of China, located in the city of Shangri-La in Central Tibet. Accepts Students mainly from China but also from other East Asian countries. Education is done in both Chinese and Tibetan.

3-)Gara de Aquila Intarnado of Magic: Used to be an Aztec establishment until Spaniards came. Ancestor of Castelobruxo and its main rival. Located deep underground under the Mexico City. Language of Education is Spanish but Nahuatl and various Mayan language courses exist.

4-)Shehrazabad School of Magicraft and Sorcery: Used to be the magical establishment of the Sassanid Empire however after the conquest of Persia by Umayyads, due to a drop in the numbers of pupils due to muggleborns not surviving to adulthood and pureblood families leaving Persia, School(and the mount Kaf it is built on) moved to present day Khasmir, near to Sianchan glacier. Language of education is classical Persian despite having almost no Persian pupils.
