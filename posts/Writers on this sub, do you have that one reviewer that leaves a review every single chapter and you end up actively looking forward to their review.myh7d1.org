And when it doesn't come you end up feeling sad.


** Back when I was writing (2005-2007) I had that one reviewer who persistently told me that my writing sucks.

*** That is shitty, which platform did you use? I've actually never had this problem. I've had people comment that they didn't enjoy certain parts and most memorable a really long comment on lost porential and that they didn't enjoy my fic at all. But overall - while it certainly didn't elevate my mood - the latter was a rather detailed rant and I was able to see why exactly they didn't like my fic and I understood their reasoning behind it. They had simply different expectations and I respected their. opinion. I feel like if you don't like something, don't read it and if you are disappointed by a story, then at least comment why you didn't like something. Leave the author something to work with not just a "you suck" and leave

**** I didn't mind it all that much after a while. In fact their persistence always made me giggle.

I used to write on portkey.org and harrypotterfanfiction.com... which I believe are both dead nowadays.

** Not quite the same, but I do have a follower over on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] that tends to constantly favorite/follow my stories. Imagine my surprise when I got an email saying they did just that on a new story when I haven't written or posted anything in about a year until then.

** Definetly, overall I look forward to every comment, but I've got a few reviewers which I look forward too especially bc they leave detailed comments and thus enable me to discuss my fic and get a good impression of what needs some tweaking and what not. I love if they ask questions and even critique. Often they also come up with cool ideas I shamelessly use later on. I'm often so baffled to see that the same people have stuck around now for over a year of my writing and I've got one reviewer to whom I'm simply look forward to, bc their profile pic is just so damn funny and it always makes me smile when I spot it in my inbox

** Yes I did(on my Harry/Ron fic)

There's also the people on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] who've reviewed all my fics at some point or another

*** Oh yeah, I feel like rare pairs really bring these people out especially because they're so grateful for someone writing their pairing!
