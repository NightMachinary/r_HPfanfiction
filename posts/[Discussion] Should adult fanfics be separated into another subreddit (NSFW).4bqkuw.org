Similar to how [[/r/mylittlepony/]] is set apart from [[/r/clopclop/]] (NSFW, obv).


** No. The community isn't large enough and NSFW fic requests are handled well already. Responsible users and (I assume) good moderation.

** I think there are a million ways we could further refine this sub (into a requests/recommendations sub and a writing sub as I mooted last week) but I think people were right to suggest the community is more sustainable if it stays as is.

I think the general rule with requesting or recommending adult content should probably be the same applied to fanfiction in general - /tag appropriately/

** No. There's no reason to split the community like that. This isn't an image based subreddit, so it doesn't really matter.

** No. A NSFW tag is more than enough.

** I am going with no for a very simple reason, to not split the community. We are not THAT many people here so why sending some away for something that is not even a problem. Never change a running system they say. Better relie on the users skill to tag accordingly, the commentors ability to be serious and mature and the mods power to moderate accordingly.

** This subreddit isn't anywhere as large as people think. Like, the most users I've ever seen online at one time was only in the ~40's, and we average like 1 new topic per hour at best. That's pretty slow.

** Well, thank you for providing me with something for my next nightmares. Seriously that Pony stuff is beyond creepy...

But anyway, I don't think we need to split the sub like that. Since all that is posted here is mostly written, there is no need to be overly restrictive. Also, this community is very responsible with their tags and handle Smut/NSFW stuff well.

*** You know, I just think that [[/r/clopclop]] stuff is bizarrely funny, in a way.

** Absolutely fucking no. This is a tiny community and I in no way want it divided nor do I want to have to sit through endless arguments over what is or is not adult.

** No, I think we're okay. The discussion topics themselves seem mild enough, and generally aren't graphic in nature outside of NSFW tags, and for the stories linked, thanks to the bot we get the rating upfront. I just assume M means sex, violence, or fun language.

** No. We might fall below the critical mass threshold if we split, and shouldn't really be looking to divide ourselves further.
