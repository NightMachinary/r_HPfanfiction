** You mean like Quirrell first year?

That one is finished, but a lot of people didn't care for the ending.

**** Untwist your panties, dude, it was a joke.

The fact that canon fits the OP's request really isn't my fault.

*** Nah, not really. My headcanon is that Quirrell was dead the moment Voldemort possesed him, and to be honest, Harry didn't really accidentally kill Quirrell imo.

**** He was alive enough to argue with Tommy about exposing him to Harry. I'd go along with 'severing a possession' being fatal, but touching Harry cased Quirrell pain, with Tommy demanding to know what was wrong. Experiencing pain is one of the major indicators of being not dead.

** It happens twice in the Thorny Rose series ( linkffn(9631998) ), though technically both times it's someone else that accidentally kills someone - Harry does help hide the bodies, so technically it fulfills part of the requirement.

In the first installment he and Ginny end up blasting Theodore Nott off of the astronomy tower, in one of the later installments Rita Skeeter gets splattered by an unknowing Sirius because she was sneaking around Grimmauld Place in beetle form.\\
Both times they feed the corpses to the Acromantulas in the Forbidden Forest.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

*** Why not push him in the cabinet? Storyline wise it's right after he finishes repairing the cabinet. After doing so he destroys the cabinet. If this happened would Snape be seen as failing his oath?

** Wingardium levosa then throw the invisibility cloak over the body then sneak out to the forbidden forest and dump the body close enough that the acromanulas will dispose of the body for you.
