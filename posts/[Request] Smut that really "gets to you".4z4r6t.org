Language is vague on purpose; take it however you will. Maybe the fic has a truly epic or poignant scene of lovemaking that tears at your heartstrings. Maybe the plot isn't terribly complex, but the language and imagery is incredibly sexy and visceral and brutal in its hotness. Maybe it's one with a kink that endlessly fascinates you. Or maybe it's just a fic you love so much you keep coming back to it over and over again.

Whatever it might mean to you, if you've got a smutty fanfic that makes you /feel/ some type of way, please post it here.


** "A Big Happy Weasley Family"

The author really captures the moments.

*** I especially like it because even if you remove all the sex, the plot about Harry's seventh year at Hogwarts, the new triwizard tournament and the secret of the Deathly Hallows is still quite good by itself.

Not many smutfics can pull that of.

*** I was actually thinking about BHWF when I wrote the post. It definitely qualifies for the "brutally hot imagery" metric.

**** If you are open to other fiction, "Bunny's Delight" for the series Ranma is also very good.

And for Naruro, it is definitely the story called "Seeing Is Believing"

** On ffn, I like the two stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2114636/HoosYourDaddy][HoosYourDaddy]]. On hpadult, I like several of the stories by [[http://members.adult-fanfiction.org/profile.php?no=1296851847&view=story&zone=hp][Salon_Kitty]], but make sure to pay attention to the tags because they can get interesting to say the least. And lastly, I think there's a reason [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3974128/chapters/8917264][this]] is by far and away the most popular hp story on ao3 (in terms of hits), but it's definitely not for everyone (futa).

*** Y'all are reading my mind. The two fics I had in mind when I posted this were A Big Happy Weasley Family and Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen. Of course that fic also "gets to me" in the sense that I'm mad it was abandoned.

*** Seconding the stories by HoosYourDaddy. A Boy and His Cloak is wonderfully written and realistic, and got me interested in H/Hr in the first place.

** I'm surprised not to see more recs on here, but not surprised to see how different the recs are. It's such a deeply personal thing to read about, that one person's preference will make another person shake their head in disbelief.

I love to read romance with a strongly erotic or quite graphic tone but I don't go to fanfiction to find it. Mostly because I'm likely to find the best written pieces are about characters I don't care for or don't want to see together - and often shoehorning them together makes them so OoC that they are unrecognisable in any case.

I actually like to read the things I wrote myself; not because they are particularly well written or anything like that, but just because they are what I want to see and they do give me the 'feels' I want.

** I had a dream about this, and it stuck in my head so deeply that I had to write it-[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11376490/1/Primal-Connection][Primal Connection]]

One of my favorite smutty stories is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343934/1/Bound-and-Shagged][Bound and Shagged]] because it has a mystery and lots of sex including genderswapping and such, which is always fun.

And basically anything by Aurette- she knows how to push sexy buttons like no one else.
