So I've been reading fanfiction for a while now, and I'm looking for something new. I'm not sure how well this sub takes to personal requests, but I would appreciate the help.

Right now I think I'm looking for a story about an older Harry going on his Next Great Adventure. Something about a man with Gray in his hair storming about being a badass is really appealing lately. I like fics that explore the more and examine magic in a fun way that doesn't allow the author to just write away any conflict in the story. The Lie I've Lived, A Black Comedy, Unsung Hero, and Wand and Shield did this well in my opinion. I've also been known to read an angsty or fluffy romance like Unlike a Sister if it's written well enough. I suppose I'm just curious to see if there are any stories this sub might think I'de like.


** Well, neither of these is exactly a hidden gem, but since you didn't mention them, I'll put them out there. They fit what you're looking for very well:

******* Sounds helpful to me. Suppose I was just happy to hear from someone else who liked those stories. I'de highly recommend the others if you're in the mood. Wand and Shield was my first crossover and delves into some really cool stuff near the end of what's currently available to read.

** How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][Song of the Trees]] by Tinn Tam? 215k words, WIP?

#+begin_quote
  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** The Lone Traveller series by either dunuelos or the professional are good. I have a ton of stories on my faves (same username) and a few more fit, you'll just have to look at the summaries though.
