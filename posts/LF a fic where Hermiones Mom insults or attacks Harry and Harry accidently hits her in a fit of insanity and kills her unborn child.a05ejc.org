  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?

**** Man I just don't get these kinds of fics. Harry is sent to prison "innocently" and then when he is free he punches women and aborts their babies? Seems like he was where he belonged when he sat in Azkaban?!

***** He is stunned and put under the imperius curse by Lucius or Peter at the resurrection, and is returned via the portkey to the school, where he casts the Killing Curse at Cedric's dead body, and screams out for the Dark Lord's triumph or something similar. Later, the curse forces him to keep saying it's all his fault as though he's guilty.

From an outsider's perspective, he really seems guilty and so he's sent to Azkaban, where Diggory throws gold to have him beaten black and blue every few weeks.

Susan manages to scan pensieve memories of the event from the perspective of several people, and finds out he's innocent, and he's set free, and they get together. When they're making out at King's Cross, Hermione's mother (who is unaware of her pregnancy, and thinks Harry is a hooligan because of his imprisonment as any parent would), in an attempt to get his attention, playfully smacks him on the back of his head.

However, his time in Azkaban made him super jumpy, so he flinches away from her hand, and into the wall (he and Susan were making out against a wall), which causes his glasses to shatter and enter his eyes. He then loses control, and thinks he's back in Azkaban/under attack from Diggory's cronies, and lashes out at the person he perceives to be Diggory's thug i.e Hermione's mother. Just to be clear, he doesn't actually see who's behind him when all this is happening.

This fic is poorly written, and could use a LOT of editing, but no, it doesn't have HP punching random pregnant women he sees in order to abort their unborn children.
