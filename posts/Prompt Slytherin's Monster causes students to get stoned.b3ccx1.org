** This is mostly canon rehash with a bit stolen from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_Serpent][this wikipedia article]]. But it's a start.

“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. “There has been another attack...another double attack.”

Harry's insides did a horrible somersault.

Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered...Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly hair.

Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room.

And on the bed next to her was ---

“Hermione!” Ron groaned.

Hermione was staring at a piece of paper, her eyes bloodshot and glassy.

“You ever think about words?” asked Hermione in a dreamy voice, “they are just a collection of lines and squiggles, but yet they are the best thing we've ever invented.”

Ron turned to McGonagall and whispered ”what's on the paper?”

“she hasn't let us see it.” was McGonagall's reply.

Hermione looked away from the paper to gaze at Harry, “Solve the squiggles for me Harry.” she said as she held the paper out to him.

Harry took the paper and unfolded it.

“Those who know say the Uktena is a great snake, as large around as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond on its forehead, and scales glowing like sparks of fire. It has rings or spots of color along its whole length, and can not be wounded except by shooting in the seventh spot from the head, because under this spot are its heart and its life.”---- Harry skimmed ahead ---- “As if this were not enough, the breath of the Uktena is so pestilential, that no living creature can survive should they inhale the tiniest bit of the foul air expelled by the Uktena. Even to see the Uktena asleep is death, not to the hunter himself, but to his family.”

And beneath this, several words had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes, Ginny, Obliviate.
