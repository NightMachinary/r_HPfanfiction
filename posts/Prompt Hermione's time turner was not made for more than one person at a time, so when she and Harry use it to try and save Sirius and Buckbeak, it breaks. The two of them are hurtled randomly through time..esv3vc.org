No real limits on this one as far as pairings, tropes, etc, but I'd prefer they not end up in the Marauders time period.

Thanks!

*** Its a great idea, but definitely not a brand new idea. Time turner issues resulting in individuals lost in time has been around for a while as an excuse to explain time travel of Harry or others. Interestingly I have read quite a few where Harry ends up back in time due to the time room/cabnet in the department of mysteries during the fight between the DA and the Death Eaters.

There are also several where Hermione ends up back in the Mauraders time due to her screwing up her usage of the Time Turner in 3rd year (or it breaking or something).

But oddly, for all the times a time turner has been involved, I dont ever remember seeing one where both Harry AND Hermione end up lost in time via its usage to save Sirius by them. Which, if I think about it, seems surprising. Its a perfect time to explain time travel and pair Hermione/Harry for those who ship a combination of the 2 things.

**** Some of my favourite fan-fictions resolve the time-turner paradox by making sure that whatever happens, the major events don't and CANNOT be changed...

It would be interesting to read how Harry and Hermione both (independently) try to change the future, and their changes just happen to cancel out.

** Dumbledore closed the door to the Hospital Wing. Miss Granger was a smart girl, she would put the pieces together of what needed to be done. He turned around, fully expecting an hour older couple to be in front of them.

But no-one was there.

â€‹

Suddenly he heard an ear piercing roar. Dumbledore strode to the window (Wizards of his stature do not 'hurry'). In front of him he saw the oddest looking dragon-like creature you could ever imagine. It was missing wings, and its front limbs were small and useless. It's head was massive as if a wizard had engorged the lizard's head.

Dumbledore squinted. On the back of the create he saw a young couple in unmistakably (tattered) Hogwarts robes. This was bad, they were too close to Black's scheduled execution, they would not have time to stop it.

Suddenly the creature roared again and took a bite out of the tower holding Sirius Black. Dumbledore could see the minister of magic attempt to curse the creature, but magnificently the spell simply bounced off of its skin. Whatever the creature was, it had the magical properties of dragonhide.

And then there was half a man where the minister stood. Dumbledore blinked. This escalated quickly.

Harry reached town to pat the T-Rex. "Good Girl" he said.

*** There is a fanfic out there with that sort of premise. I can't remember the name of it but the basic plot went they used a ritual at Stonehenge to go back in time to their 11 year old bodies unfortunately what happens is Harry ends up in Hermione's body and Hermione ends up in Harry's body.

I think the interesting twist there was that while the memories and soul ended up in the wrong body the magic stayed with the body. So where Harry's magic is a monster ready to do his every beckon call just by shearly overpowering the spell, Hermione's Magic was all preciseness of pronunciation and wand movement. You can imagine that this particular style change frustrated both Harry and Hermione. Because now Harry just can't cast anything he wants, and every time Hermione tries to be precise she overpowers everything until it explodes.

It was quite fascinating but unfortunately was abandoned.
