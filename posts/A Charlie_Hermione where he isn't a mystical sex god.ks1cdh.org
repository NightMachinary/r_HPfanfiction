Hello!

I worked with Amebb42 to co-write a smut short. I get it, it's fanfiction. The peak of idealism and wish fulfillment. But every goddamm charmione fic just has him being a master at sex and Hermione being an innocent baby princess. (We are guilty of this as well)

So we decided to change it. I present a Charmione where he is still a virgin at 29 and elects to lose it to Hermione.

Does it make sense? No.

Did we write it anyway? Oh, yes.

Enjoy! (Rated E, obviously)
