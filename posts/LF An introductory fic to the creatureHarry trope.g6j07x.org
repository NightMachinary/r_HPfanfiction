So something for someone who's never read one before, something tame lmao


** Are you opposed to Harry/Draco or not?

Maya aka Mistful wrote a very good HarryisaVeela fic called "Drop Dead Gorgeous", sadly she took all her fics down and asked people not to share. If you can get your hands on that one, this would be ideal.

Alternatively I would recommend pretty much anything by Beren. As for something that is a bit more tame, maybe Angels and Devils?

*** [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uvUyE-tHZ8oWiZoPrNjEHGGEPnmHztRP][Drop Dead Gorgeous]] - I have a PDF version somewhere, but that's a docx with cleaned up formatting because the PDF drove me nuts. Can be converted to epub/mobi pretty easily if that's your thing too.
