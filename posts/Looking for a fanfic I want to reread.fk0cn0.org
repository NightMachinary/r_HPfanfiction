It's a Slytherin Harry fanfic in poly relationship with hermione and Theodore Nott all I could remember was that at the end of his first year after the confrontation with Quirrell, Harry intentionally swallows the philosophers stone to steal it based on some Muggle criminal dramas that aunt Petunia used to watch . For some reason the stone gets stuck in harry and can't be removed which makes him immortal
