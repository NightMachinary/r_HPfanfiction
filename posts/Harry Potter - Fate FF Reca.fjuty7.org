Ok so I'm looking for something that involves Harry interacting more with the Nasuverse than the Potterverse, preferably something post Hogwarts but if not that cool too.

Also kind of specific but if anyone could point me to a story were Harry is sent to Camelot and becomes part of Arturias court that would be awesome.

  All my life, people have placed their expectations upon me. They would have me believe I failed. Cowards. What right do these mongrels have to pass judgement upon me. The only right these people have. The only right I allow them. Is to stand in awe and be humbled if and when I deign to stand as their salvation. Gaze upon my wonders. For I sit upon the Throne of Babylon.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
