Last time I posted this I got crucified... let's hope I don't this time ;-;

What do you think? Do you prefer writing fanfiction or original works? Do you find one easier than the other?


** I personally prefer Fanfiction because of the instant familiarity with the characters, and the fact that i want to see them in situations not seen in the source material.

*** Yep, it's the characters; that's why Harry Potter fanfiction has the most written. JK Rowling's ultimate skill was creating interesting and gripping characters that she dearly loved. And so even after 7 books of adventures, we still want more of the characters.

** For me, I would say that original works are easier. Writing fanfiction is like exploring someone else's world. You are restrained by the rules of that particular world and you need to mould your story accordingly. Even more difficult is the characterisation. In original writing, sometimes, you can let yourself go and allow your characters to write the story for you (as weird as it sounds). But in fanfiction, you cannot let your characters 'stray from the path' at risk of being too OOC (of course, there are exceptions but I'm talking about the majority of fanfics). Especially for HP fanfic where most of the characters have already been built with their nuanced flaws and qualities.

Of course, I'm talking about my own writing experiences. I can understand how someone would find it easier to work with pre-established characters and world but for me, it's harder.

That said, I don't know if others would agree but I found that /online/, HP fanfic has a bigger audience than original works. You are more likely to have your story read as a budding HP fanfic writer than a budding original works writer.

** With my own stories I'm very much a perfectionist and it's hard for me to show that work to anyone (together these make it hard to finish stories which is why I have 4 in different stages of being written - and that's over nearly 15 years from starting the first). I started a fan fiction (I guess a year ago?) to be able to write without the story being my baby that I felt I needed to protect, so that I could improve my writing and my story layout, and the process that works best for me. I don't have the same attachment to my fan fiction. Yes, I want it to be good and for people to like it but it's ok to put out a chapter I'm only ok with and move on (maybe going back in a week or maybe three months and fixing it because I realized what was bugging me).

** At the moment I prefer fanfiction, mostly because it's all I've been reading for the past two years ^{^{^{^{Help}}}} ^{^{^{^{me}}}} . They're kind of two different things for me. Writing original fiction means I'm thinking broader, methodically fleshing out my world and considering all the different aspects that it would include. With fanfiction, I'm thinking deeper; All the legwork is already done, so I'm starting at the finish line still fresh. This means I can sort of go "farther" in experimenting with a character and discover new concepts, without having to worry about how it all ties in with my OC.

So really, they're both valuable to me.

** I prefer fan fiction since the world building portion is there and I just have to manipulate it. I have tried my hand at original writing and it is much more difficult due to have to create many original and believeable characters on top of world building. Fanfiction is tough, original writing is incredibly difficult. I applaud those that find original writing easy. You have an incredible skill

That doesn't mean fanfic is easy though. It also takes work and skill.

** I prefer writing original stuff but fanfiction is easier. /Good/ fanfiction is hard.

If you're writing your own stuff you get to create a whole world. Things are as you wish them to be. It requires a lot of imagination but you can create castles in the sky. The downside is that you have to have the ideas.

With fanfic, you're given a start and then it's up to you to do something interesting with the tools you're given.

I love reading stories based in Canon just as much as total AU stuff. For writing, I stick with Canon. Except for one crack fic.

** Why did you get crucified?

I certainly find fanfiction easier than original fiction, simply because you don't have to do the worldbuilding. It can be a bit tricky making a new story work within canon (I find it very much like writing historical fiction but the research material is more manageable), but to be honest I think fanfiction readers are far more forgiving of weaknesses whether in the writing or the plotting. You can get away with a lot in fanfiction that you never could in original fiction. There's plenty of fanfiction stories that don't even have a recognisable plot arc, but people still love them.

There's a buzz in writing fanfiction; from seeing people reading your work -- and if you are lucky getting some feedback and interaction from it too, but it's a bit seductive and easy to settle into that comfort zone. So it depends if you have ambitions to write for a wider audience.

Personally I have more satisfaction in my original work because it's mine, pure and simple.

It depends on the story, the universe, and the author, but I find fanfiction to be the easier one for me.

** As weird as it may sound, I prefer /writing/. If I have it in me to add bits to my original stuff then so be it, and if I don't then I instead spend time doing stuff, including others' works, and sometimes I get inspiration to write a snippet that is derived from this-or-that while doing so and so be it then too. Overall, though, I do prefer working on my stuff because it is mine, created by me from scratch, and there is a certain sort of pride there.

As for which is easier for me to write, honestly, it depends on the mood. Each one presents its own challenges when writing---constructing your own world and the characters living therein versus presenting an already existing world and its characters accurately despite the differences between the original and the derived work---which means one or the other is harder for people who aren't good at doing either of which for whatever reason, but for me it's about the fact that I can write certain kinds of scenes more efficiently if I am in an appropriate mood for them and though I can somewhat make do with music that matches the mood for the scene and with ... certain other things, nothing beats actually being in that mood when trying to write.

** I find writing fanfiction easier, but I do feel more accomplished when I get a chapter of my original work done.

Fanfiction is a nice way to relax. You have the whole of a fandom, and more, to choose from. Worldbuilding, characters,... everything is done. You only need to start typing.

Original works require a lot more work that isn't the actual act of writing. That can sometimes be rather bothersome, especially when i'm not motivated to do it or lack ideas at the moment.

So it really depends on my mood what I prefer. Fanfiction for when I just want to relax with a bit of writing. Original work when I want to get something done.

** I have a hard time creating characters. I find it a lot easier to mutate someone else's characters beyond all recognition. I haven't gotten the hang of extracting characters from different sources, mutating them, and putting them into my own worlds.

Annoyance is a huge motivator for me. If the nonexistence of a thing is annoying me, I will create it. I generally can't summon that annoyance to get myself to write original fiction. I can, however, become annoyed about canon in an existing series.

** Original writing is much more fun, exciting and easy for me. I can make up whatever setting I want. I don't have to include characters I don't like because they are all my characters.

Fanfiction is hard - ESPECIALLY when writing in canon, and even moreso when it's Harry Potter and there's spells, laws, potions, and all that to know. Plus, it takes place in the UK in the 90's - or 70's if you're writing the Marauders - or the 40's if you're writing about TMR or Hagrid - or god forbid the 1890's. I am terrible at history and my knowledge of the UK begins and ends with English Breakfast tea.

Come to think of it, until I started writing fics with original characters, fanfiction was just hard and a chore for me to write. I would have funny ideas but I wouldn't love the characters like I do with my OC's. And in fact, I think about my own characters more than the ones from canon. I suppose that must be a sign.

** I don't like one better than the other. They're both fun, and I'm proud of both my fanfiction and original works.

I suppose fanfiction is easier for the reasons mentioned by others, but it's difficult to remember every aspect of canon (if you're somewhat going by canon).

** Fanfiction, original works are just considered a copy of a certain book anyway if you're going for the fantasy genre. Might as well just change the base story and face up to it being a well-changed edit of the original, rather than a cheap knock-off.

** When I write fiction (which doesn't happen as much as it once did), I prefer writing original fiction. I've sold twenty or so pieces of short fiction and I'm rather proud of some of what I've written. A few of these have been "pro" sales (5c+/word).

Fanfiction is far easier to write--and to be read. A good run for a first novel is 5000 copies sold; most don't get nearly that. In contrast, I've fanfiction stories with close to a million page loads. Dividing by number of chapters means ~50k readers. Few writers ever sell an original fiction novel that gets that.
