A fic like linkffn(Potter Ever After). Draco and Hermione post Voldemort resurrection? He gives her up to get murdered. Harry accuses the Weasleys of love potions. It turns out he never had the talk. Hermione tries to use muggle tech to gain an advantage. The death eaters shut that down because people do that all the time. Daphne Greengrass gets introduced and she's a forgettable girl. People start listening to Seer Luna, but it turns out she was trolling.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** What's the point of introducing Daphne Greengrass if she isn't interresting?

Subverting things for the sake of subverting is meaningless. It needs to be done in the interrest of the story, just like everything else.

*** It can be a sort of "meta subversion". Not subverting the character accorfmding to the story, but subverting fanon conceptions about said character.

***** Not necessarily.

All that's needed is:

#+begin_quote
  Sufficiently Trope Savvy audience members can predict a familiar trope coming based on the hints dropped by the writer. So when the writer decides to build on this expectation, only to reveal that the expected "trope" was a Red Herring while an entirely different situation results, you have a Subverted Trope.
#+end_quote

Replace Trope with Character.

** Female OC takes in a traumatized wizard and comforts him. There is no romance and things do not work out at all. I recently had a reader say that my OC stories might be unpopular with readers because people are expecting the usual OC self-insert cliches, so they either avoid my OC stories because they don't like those cliches or they're disappointed because they don't contain them.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.
