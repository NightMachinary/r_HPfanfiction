** I'm not particularly fond of Ron or Ginny, so be warned, some of these may contain some or a lot of Weasley bashing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141159/1/Breakfast-In-New-York]])

Harry and Hermione meet in New York after years not hearing from each other. Some truths are revealed, yadda yadda, etc.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8693743/1/Senses]])

Harry and Hermione are unhappy in their canon relationships and help each other through tough breakups.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9753533/1/The-Catalyst]])

Another one by lorien829... quite depressing in parts and possibly abandoned.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12310861/1/The-Augurey]])

Still in progress, but I like what I've read well enough to recommend it here. Harry adopts Delphini Riddle.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]])

Probably abandoned, but an interesting take on a post-Hogwarts romance.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536445/1/The-Lily-Potter-Foundation]])

Harry refuses to go along with the plans everyone else seems to have made for him. Strained relationship between him and Hermione in the beginning.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532058/1/Without-You-There-is-Nothing]])

Ron and Hermione implode and Harry steps in.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3511527/1/He-Could-Always-Read-Her]])

Sweet little two-shot... nothing really happens in it. Very fluffy.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243818/1/Sooner-Or-Later]])

Harry and Hermione start a friends with benefits relationship - of course they are completely in over their heads.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/1/Soul-Thief]])

Romance mixed with a whodunnit murder mystery. IMHO worth recommending even without the pairing stuff.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12315670/1/Healing-Hermione]])

Another investigation mystery story. Hermione is hit with a deadly curse and Harry tries to find the culprit(s). Oh also it has a kind-of-bond and telepathy - I know some people hate that.

  A little girl of mysterious origins will become the driving force that will change the very nature of Harry and Hermione's relationship with each other. Moves from canon, disregards epilogue.
