** "Really, I'm still not certain how this all got so out of hand." One would expect a Dark Lord to speak menacingly - Arthur Weasley speaks like a kindly grandfather. One would expect a Dark Lord to lounge, indolently relaxing in some gilded throne - Arthur Weasley slouches back into the chair, unashamed of the paunchy stomach it reveals. One would expect a Dark Lord to pace, twirling their wand with slow, sinuous movements - Arthur Weasley gestures wildly, passionately, with a sparkle in his eye.

"Oh, I know that sounds crazy, but it's true! At first, I was just looking to help out my son's business. You see, they - he, he bred Puffskeins. Darling little creatures, truly sweet you know? But not every family wants a living pet and it never hurts to have some variety on the shelf you know?"

But it's that sparkle that truly marks him as a Dark Lord. It's inhuman - not cruel, just alien. It hints at a curiosity that's unhindered by morals, unconcerned with boundaries. It's a sparkle that, rather than asking "Why?", asks "Why Not?"

"And I've just always been so fascinated with Muggles. I don't really hold to the claim that they have no magic, for what it's worth. I mean, the results speak for themselves, don't they? Muggle technology is amazing all on its own, but give it a helping hand and, well, you've seen the results."

These "results" were horrific. Most of Britain, magical or not, was a smoking ruin and Arthur Weasley and his abominations had torn a bloody swathe through Europe in the months following his rise to infamy.

"I mean, who can argue with reuniting family? At first it was just different varieties of the same, the Muggles made so many you know? And it was just awful, hearing from them about how their siblings, their parents, were trapped under hundreds of tons of garbage or buried in boxes never seeing the light of day. But then they pointed out that we ought not to limit ourselves, that there were plenty of other toys that might not look like them, but were family in all the ways that matter. And you don't give up on family, no matter the challenge."

Before he became known as a Dark Lord, he was nicknamed The Toymaker - at first he was a joke, a laughing stock, a crackpot playing with Muggle knickknacks. Those who hadn't encountered him found the stories entertaining - those who had encountered him found other places to be. Those that were still capable of moving, that is. Or breathing.

"And it's important to ensure that your family is given the room to grow to their full potential. I guess that's really where this whole mess started, isn't it? Some people just weren't willing to tolerate my family growing into their true selves. They tried to stop us. Would you let that happen? Would you let someone harm your family? I did once. I'll never do so again."

"That's why we're here, I guess. Tell me Herr Chancellor, are you happy now? Do you feel like the struggle was meaningful? Was it worth it, trying to separate me and my family? Oh, goodness me, I suppose you can't answer with that Silencing Charm up, can you? Let me get that off you, I think I've finished up the monologue for the moment."

"Please, Mr. Weasley, I'll-"

A cacophonous shriek filled the air, like thousands of birds made of razor blades and glass were being tortured.

"Ooh, they're very particular about titles. Ever since I started reading the newspaper articles referring to me as a Dark Lord, they just won't tolerate any other address. Apologies about that, personally I think it's silly, but you learn to tolerate your family's foibles, do you not? Oh no, it appears our time is up. We're due in Bulgaria tomorrow evening, many family members to free. I'm afraid I can't allow you, or that pesky Statute, to keep us from our family. I won't let /anything/ keep me from my family, you understand, Chancellor? I'm sure you do - or you will."

The last thing His Excellency, the Chancellor of Magical Germany, saw was a flurry of feathers, razor-sharp beaks, and those cold, lifeless eyes. The last thing he heard was "Kah may-may u-ne"

Or, "How Arthur Weasley Discovered Furbies and Things Were Very Much Not Okay"

This one got a little darker than I expected. I'm fairly certain every other Weasley died in this storyline.

*** ... This is absolutely terrifying. Can you write more, but with his kids alive and healthy?

Also, instead of "lifeless eyes, it shoild be eyes full of life." Makes more sense in context for Arthur.

***** Neville didn't actually kill Nagini, she just suffered some strange sort of internal degradation/cell combustion ever since she attacked Arthur Weasley (who was basically running on magical meth) and just exploded into a dust cloud.

Edit to say happy cake day!
