What if Petunia Evans turned out to be a witch, and ended up being the first muggle-born in centuries to be sorted into Slytherin?

  It's never easy to be brilliant, friendly, pretty, wonderfully talented Lily Evans' sister. Even when you're also a witch yourself. But Petunia Evans isn't one to just let herself fade in the background and be forgotten, not if she has anything to say about it (and she has plenty to say, even if she doesn't voice it out loud). Someday, she'll shine on her own, just wait and see! However, shining in a war-torn era isn't that easy when you're Muggleborn, and even more so when no matter what, Lily always seems to do everything better...
