** Muggleborns should really be reincarnated witches & wizards that normally don't remember their past lives. Purebloods would actually be discriminating against their own honorable ancestors.

Werewolves are discriminated against because they don't take wolfsbane potion so people think that they are violent savages. But apothecaries have been greedily marking up wolfsbane at the register, going against the affordable displayed price set by inventor belby. Most Werewolves can't afford the marked up wolfsbane so werewolf attacks rise until the law strikes them from getting jobs and now ALL werewolves can't afford wolfsbane but when they complain about not affording it they sound crazy bc the store price LOOKS compliant with what it's supposed to be.

Ravenclaws diadem is a myth. The actual genius and limitless knowledge is contained in the Sorting Hat. The hat, however, is a bit miffed by previous headmasters' dismissal of any conversation or attempts to impart truths about the Founders so he's kept his brim shut on it for the last century.

Or, the sorting hat is actually a mishap in self-transfiguration and is Godric Gryffindor himself.

** Harry Potter and Hermione are on the run, and Harry dives into the frozen pond to get the sword.

Ron arrives late.

Hermione finds Harry, dead and Ron all wet.

Hermione grabs her beaded bag and gets a very large black book out of her beaded bag and reads it intently.

“Hermione, the answers to life are not in bloody books” said Ron.

“There's only one way this can work,” she says, crying “Harry's the chosen one, he has to kill Voldemort.”

Ron look at her and scratches his head “But he's dead Hermione.”

Hermione looks at Ron, sobs and says “Stupefy!”

Ron falls over.

Ron wakes up in a runic circle on the forest, in a full-body bind, surrounded by candles.

There's another body just next to him, it's Harry. He's clearly dead, with a dark line around his neck where the locket pulled him down.

Hermione kneels nearby with the book “I'm sorry Ron, but he ritual needs a life for a life” she cries.

“Hermione , I love you!” cries Ron.

“I love you too, Ron, it will make the ritual work better” she says, and ... Ron dies, an athame thought his heart.

Harry wakes up some time later, in a camp bed in the tent.

“Ron saved you but didn't make it” said Hermione, red eyed.

...

Harry and Hermione are are on the Horcrux hunt. Poor Ron died.

Harry's very focused on the mission now. Revenants are like that

...

The war

...

Harry goes looking for Ginny. HE must find her.

Ginny runs over and hugs him. “Never leave me again” she says.

“Ginny, I came back for you” he says.

Ginny kisses him.

“Harry, you're so cold” she says.

Thud, Harry falls down dead.
