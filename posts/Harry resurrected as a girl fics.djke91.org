As the title says. Do you guys have any quality fics of the sort? I'm currently reading linkffn(Mistakes and Second Chances) which I enjoy for the most part. The only request I have is no Drarry. Other than that any pairing is fair game. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(13285012) A Fair Life has Harry being sent back in time to the Goblet Of Fire and it's revealed that he was always supposed to be a girl.

linkffn(8175132) Jamie Evans and Fate's fool has Harry going back in time and being thrown into an alternate female version of himselfs body.

linkffn(11396276) The Chosen One Has Knockers is a comedy about Harry waking up one day suddenly alot more female than he remembered.

  When Harry and Voldemort died at each others hands, Harry awoke in an alley as a ten year old girl. Perplexed at this turn of events but not overly surprised, she is taken to Wool's Orphanage. Now known as Iris Black, she is roomed with Tom Riddle, who she decides to befriend because honestly, why not see how things unfold from the other side? It might be fun.

** */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have soul-bond type stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup. Very fluffy.
