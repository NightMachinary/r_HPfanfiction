#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) The Harry vs Krum duel after Krum [[/spoiler][pretends to kill the Pronghorn and Harry destroys the Durmstrang ship]]. It's a grudge match and he just goes to town, being as rude and insulting and overpowering as possible.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** I have a few... I live off of battle scenes they are my bread and butter. The first one that made me shiver in excitement was in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero) I loved the battle between Atrius (I think thats right) and Harry.

Yet the best battle I have read in fanfiction tho... that is a tough one. Especially if it is limited to Harry Potter. The last battle Harry Participates in during linkffn(Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance) I can't give more for fear of spoilers but.. yea that is it

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)
