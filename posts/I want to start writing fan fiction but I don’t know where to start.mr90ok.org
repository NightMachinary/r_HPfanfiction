I've been an avid reader of Harry Potter fanfiction for the past 5 - 6 years or so. I stick to fanfiction.net and ao3, but I've read some on watt pad. I'm interested in writing and I absolutely love the hp universe. I'd like some advice on how to get started on writing fanfics. Like what website is the best, what plots are best to start with, what tropes to stay away from etc. I've started lots of projects before and I don't want this to be something that i start and quit because it's too hard.

TL;DR basically any advice you would have liked to receive when you started writing hp fanfiction.


** Write what you like. We can't tell you what to write. Popular ships and tropes will get more attention, but unless you are only writing to get the most reviews/comments/kudos, it's better to write what you are interested in. Write what you would like to read.

Writing is a journey. You're not going to start out perfect. No one does. After years of writing, I still notice a huge difference between what I've written a year ago and what now.

I crosspost on AO3 and FFN. I try to have my chapters be at least 2k long, but that's pretty long when you start out writing. You can use [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] â€˜s weekly threads to get feedback and attention.

Write a good summary that actually gives readers an idea of what your story is about and take your time tagging it correctly.

*** God, so much this. If you try to write something you're not interested or excited about, why the heck would anyone else want to read it?

I'd also add that you should - especially for your first story - watch a YT video or two about story structure and create an outline of what you'd like to happen in your fic.

For my first story, I outlined 32 chapters (nothing crazy, just 2-3 sentence summaries per chapter of what was going to happen) before I published chapter 2. The ironic thing is, i "outgrew" my outline halfway, but the important part was I had an idea of where the story was going.

Doing this will improve your story immensely, keeping it from meandering away on unimportant tangents and focused on a coherent plotline. That alone will put it on a higher level than 80% of fics.

The last thing I'd say is try not to worry about how popular your story is. This can oftentimes be impossible, especially when you see stories that would have been stale 10 years ago getting raved over, but it should always be your goal to write a story that *you* know is good. Take pride in your work, and it will get recognized eventually.

That's all I've got. Happy writing!

** I would say stick to shorter stories at first, one-shots or something with only a few chapters. Don't immediately jump into trying to write a sprawling epic that spans from the age of the Founders to Harry's great grandkids graduating Hogwarts.

Starting with the big stuff right away is a good way to get burnt out and overwhelmed.

Also, if you get negative reviews, don't dwell on them. They are from jackasses that don't deserve your attention.

** Tips I would give:

- Write what you want to see. I often find words flow out easier when I'm writing something I don't see in fanfics but wish I could. Example, writing a certain character in a house no one ever puts them in. It helps to make your work stand out a little more because it's fresher to readers, and you have complete freedom to write how you without accidentally falling into a fic mold created by multiple variations of the same idea. Also it's rewardijf to bring life to your ideas. This doesn't have to be in regards to your whole plot, can be small details too.
- Going off the last point, don't box yourself in with canon restrictions or fanon favourites. Remember you have complete freedom to write anything so write what's best for your story!
- I think for HP posting on Ao3 and FFN are best. You will probably get more constructive criticism there. Wattpad has a slightly different audience but it doesn't hurt to post there too. I find that on Wattpad I mainly get readers who loves to read romance and smut and will comment a lot because of their paragraph commenting thing.
- Some popular tropes that I think will never lose its appeal is Enemies to Lovers, Time Travel, Soulmates, etc. Personally, the more difficult the situation appears to be, the more intriguing the idea is and the more challenging it becomes to write it which is fun!
- I think everyone's had enough of Lord Potter Black Peverall Gryffindor Ravenclaw Slytherin, so I would stay away from something like that where Harry goes to Gringotts one day finds out Dumbledore has been lying and stealing from him and that he has 17 lordships
- Know how you want your story to end. This can evolve as you plan it, but I often go in headfirst into writing with majority of the beginning and middle planned, and then my fic falls flat as it goes into a mediocre end. Knowing how you want it to end will help you build to it better.
- Good resources for researching are the Harry Potter Wiki, HP Lexicon, TV tropes (my favourite for plot ideas)
- Stepping away from your fic for a bit is encouraged. When I get frustrated with how something isn't working out, I save my work and don't look at it for weeks or at least a month. You come back to it a fresher perspective and can spot flaws and will be able to better figure out how to proceed.
- Check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lw6sti/as_fanfic_readers_or_fellow_writers_what_are_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][this thread]], it's very helpful!

I hope those tips help, the other comments are very good tips too. I think most of just write what you want/what makes you happy because ultimately it should be for you. Happy writing! :)

** Buy and read books on the basics first -- even if it's a For Dummies book. You'd be surprised what basic lessons you can miss/need to learn.

Next, On Writing by Stephen King, any books by Barnes and Noble on writing craft, On Writing Horror by the HWA (despite the title, the lessons inside apply to any fiction-writing), and finally any non-fiction books by Nancy Kress.

You can find them all on Amazon's kindle fairly cheap. If you can't afford them, just join a GPT site, do a survey a day or something until you can redeem for Amazon credit, and buy them that way -- by the time you'd have enough to buy another book, you'd have read through and learned from your previous purchase.

** Just write what you want to write and try to write it to the best of your ability. It's pretty much a given that your first fic is not going to be your best, but you have to write it in order to get to your second and then third and finally the fourth, which you will end up liking a lot more.

** Write what you want to write. Is there a character to like? A line in the books you could expand on?

And it doesn't have to be chapter stories! I only write oneshots because I can't plan a plot to save my life but I find that more fun, it's nice to know there's an end I'm sight and to work towards a goal without the pressure.

Use prompts to challenge yourself. You'll be surprised at what comes out. And it's comforting to have a brief sometimes, as opposed to just coming up with something entirely yourself.

And if someone messages you about joining a competition, JOIN!!! Best decision I ever made. My writing has come on so much and the people are fantastic. And wonderful community.

** I agree with everything said above, but I'd like to add; write for yourself! This is something you are doing for your own enjoyment, so don't pay too much attention yo the comments/reviews.

Sure, some people write great, constructive reviews, but there are bound to be some negative ones. Don't worry, everyone gets them. The trick is noot to let them affect your writing; you can't please everyone, so don't even try.

Hope this helps, and good luck!

** For me, it started with just getting a bit bored with what I was reading and having a hard time to figure out what to read next.

I kept notes of all the random ideas I had over the years and I occasionally did writing prompts as well. One day I latched onto a prompt and started turning it into a story.

I think one of the best things I am doing with my fic is putting an OC in one the main character spots. There are also quite a few in the story as well here and there.

Having OC's keeps the story fresh and keeps you from falling into predictable paths that you might if you were just following the Canon.

** Remember that the writing process is separate from the editing process.

My recommendation would be to write with stream of consciousness without actively editing, which can hamper your flow and curtail your creativity. It can be hard to do. I sometimes get caught in edit mode to make something perfect when I should be getting thoughts on (figurative) paper.

** Try starting out with Drabbles. They aren't much but I started doing that. You don't even need to publish those. Just send em to a friend or something and have them judge/criticize/praise whatever.

Don't write something you don't want to. That's just a bad idea
