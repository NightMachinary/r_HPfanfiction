So, when we are introduced to Boggarts, Professor Lupin says that no one has ever seen what they look like when alone.

However, in book five, Alastor Moody glances up with his magical eye and immediately identifies it as a boggart in the desk, which implies that he has seen one. And considering that Remus knew that Moody's eye was magical, he had to considering his relationship with him, does that mean that Remus lied to the the third years? Or that Moody doesn't see an untransformed Boggart? If the latter does that mean that the Boggart knows it is being viewed as it happens and instantly transforms?


** Moody probably just never told him that he'd seen what a boggart looks like.\\
An alternative is that Moody hasn't told many people so the official stance examiners would expect is that noone knows and Lupin really would rather not say "Well this one auror I know can see through walls and says it looks like this, no I don't have an ounce of proof".

*** I'm now imagining Moody being absolutely swamped by puppies, having a psychotic break and his mind switching to that akin to a dog because of his father's attempts to train him in the Inuken.

** There are two explanations for this I think.

1. Lupin doesn't know. No one can be expected to know everything. Moody sees the boggart's shape when alone.
2. Lupin is correct. Moody sees the boggart, having assumed a form. I consider this more likely.

** Or the boggart transformed as soon as somebody was in the room, so what Moody saw was the greatest fear of the person closest to the desk.
