I'm looking for ones where for some reason Hermione has to relive her life on the other side. Fics where she finds out she's related to them are alright, but I'd like to see ones where she has to navigate through pureblood society first and foremost and time travel/reincarnation/whatever fics are better for that than ones where she's just mentioned in someone's will in a canon following universe. Thanks in advance for your read!


** Hermione time travels her way into a pureblood family in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt Of Time]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] . In both she is still a muggleborn though, she is just pretending to be a pureblood (not sure if that's important to you). Both of these are really great fics and definitely worth reading if you haven't yet. Linkffn(8581093, 10772496)

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** linkao3(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt) has Hermione reincarnated as a pureblood, but I'm not sure if it's the sort of thing you're looking for. It's also WIP.

Roundabout Destiny has already been mentioned.

linkffn(The Brightest Black by Enigmaticrose4; Desperate Measures by MaryRoyale) has Hermione adopted into the Black family as a child, but she's still born muggleborn. Both are also WIP.

  Cassiopeia Black wasn't the sort who was willing to just sit idly by while her House fell down around her. When Cassiopeia is given a Muggleborn witch orphaned by Death Eaters, she uses magical adoption to make the baby a true Black. Pureblood!Hermione. Slytherin!Hermione.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.
