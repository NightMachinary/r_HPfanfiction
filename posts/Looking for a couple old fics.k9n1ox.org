Trying to find anyone with archived copies of a few old fics from circa 2005ish:

​

"Caught in the Act" by Grander- Lucius catches Hermione writing a scandalous love letter to Ron, and blackmails her into becoming his personal assistant. He eventually seduces her into becoming his willing mistress.

A few Ron-Pansy fics by a writer calling herself gyde_trauda. She also used the pen name "Where is truth."

​

"Pariah" by Maegunnbatt. Pansy finds her spot in Slytherin, usurped by a new student, Teeny Nott, and finds herself ostracized from the rest of her housemates. Falling in love with Ron doesn't help things either.
