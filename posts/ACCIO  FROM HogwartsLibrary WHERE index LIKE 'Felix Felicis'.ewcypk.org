*** So it's a programming joke about summoning any book with the reference Felix Felicis correct? Does the LIKE also allow for close variations as well?

**** It doesn't but SQL is a written language and spells are verbal so it would probably be based on how the words are said and not spelled

***** Cool, thanks for the answer, really nice of you. Since HP is, kinda sorta generally, soft magic that should mean the intent is more important that anything else. In this case knowing how exactly that language works should help make it an easier to use magic, maybe?

So, free thinking here, that would mean that the more in depth and precise a programming language is the more precise your spells could become. I understand logic gates easily enough. So building a language up from n/and, xn/x/n/or would be possible to describe incredibly complex spells after building a language from the base level right?

I just play around with circuits and logic gates for fun with the kids. Not any real in depth knowledge here. Just thinking about the possibilities of building a magic computer. That would be cool since magic can affect the atomic level easily enough. I'm rambling now at this point, just think it's cool to be able to cast a spell and have a magic interface that is a computer whenever you want.

Like Tony Stark hologram tech cranked up to 10, multiplied a few magnitudes of order and made so any witch or wizard can use it. Seems really cool.

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to put it all down.

****** Fair warning: I'm not a computer engineer so my knowledge of circuitry is slightly incomplete.

Okay, so first off Canon Harry Potter magic isn't well defined which makes it infinitely more difficult to discuss because we don't know what we're working with.

The first difficulty is that electronics work by there being two states: high voltage and low voltage (or in cases of memory magnetized and unmagnetized). I don't know if Magic could be designed to work in such a way.

In my head, I've thought of using runes like a programming language. If each rune had its own meaning you could string them together to make a spell, give it a name like Wingardum Leviosa (so no one would ever accidentally use the spell), have some way of turning it into a spell (like by burning the paper with a different spell), which then creates the spell that everyone can use.

Or course magic just does whatever it wants so there a chance you could cause the apocalypse by casting a new spell. Or far more likely it does nothing because it got confused half way through and gave up (which computers do all. the. time.)

Of course there becomes the issue that what if two people name a spell the same thing, what would the magic do? Do you have a spell that performs two different ways depending on which spell creation you are closer too? If one spell is performed more often does it get precedence?

Back to the question at the end: at first I thought about creating a runic table that could act like a holographic interface (which is infinitely more easier to do since magic can manipulate light and thus create holograms), but I realized if you could inscribe runes on the table, you could make into a spell which is way cooler.

******* I was thinking of using magic as a mutliphase system. If it can rearrange electrons, neutrons, and protons easily at the minimum it can control those forces as well. (Transfiguration is permanent according to what I can find from the books and JK's words on the subject.)

Since magic in Rowling's world let's you do cool things like play with fire (flame freezing spell) it should be easily able to make stable controls of states. So you could have 118 variables in 4 different states each as a single operator. (Ignoring states like Bose-Einstien Condensate and Time Crystals for now.)

Now pack all of that into a programming language and use it to cast spells. You could make a spell based hologram so easily. You're absolutely right, it would be easy cooler than an enchanted table.

That hardest part would be making the code streamlined enough to be workable. But that's the wonder of magic, it should just work anyways.

I figure the biggest obstacle, besides the insane mathematics needed to build it, would be sustaining the magic as you used the spells. But that's not something ever addressed either. Even magical exhaustion is an entirely fan creation. There is no magic fatigue or anything similar written in the books. We don't actually know how they access magic or where it comes from. Just that some are more powerful than others and that's it.
