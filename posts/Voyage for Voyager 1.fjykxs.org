Voldemort was not blind to muggle progression in space travel, astronomy was one of his favourite subjects. So in a bid to have part if him live with the immortal stars, he places a horcrux on voyager 1. Now Harry and his team need to travel 21,000,000,000 kilometres into space to find and destroy the final Horcrux. Who knows what mythical and magical beasts live in the infinite abyss never explored by wizard before.

**** They didn't destroy the Horcruxes, instead they obliviated Voldemort and transfigured him into a ring. In the sequel he's in a high-magitech containment box, slowly recovering his memories. In the end they send him on a hundred thousand lightyear journey to the center of the galaxy.

**** Not sure, I personally couldn't tolerate Yudkowsky's writing long enough to reach the end. But other people seem to think it's good, and it was the first thing I thought of from your prompt.
