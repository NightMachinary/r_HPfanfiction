I kind of feel like an arse for saying this, but it really bugs me for some reason. It isn't normally bad enough to turn me away from the fanfic, but I swear any time one of the gang talk about wanting to get something of off the candy trolley, or when Harry brags about going on a vacation with good ole godfather Sirius I die a little inside.

*** There's a couple more spelling ones:

- The 'L' thing (Travelling is British and Traveling is American).

- -ense vs -ence - the class is defenSe, not defenCe for example.

- Cheque (UK) vs check (US) for payment.

** The ones that throw me out of the story are:

- Little Whining instead of Little Whinging.
- "Graduation" from Hogwarts. In America, graduation has pretty much lost all meaning, with everybody from kindergarteners to dance classes having a graduation ceremony. In the UK, it's a university-level thing only. At lower levels, /they just leave school/.
- Pancakes. Since I learned that American-style pancakes are not a common food in the UK, I notice it whenever it appears --- and it's /everywhere/.

*** Everybody drinking coffee. Yes, I know that even in UK they eventually learnt about good coffee (thanks Costa Coffee for that), but in the mid 1990s' I still got that wild look from the stewardess of BA when I asked for coffee, “you really don't know what you are asking for”. And I didn't, I got horrible weak Nescafé, and I quickly realised that the only right answer to The Question was “Tea, please. Thank you.”

And of course, every time when a boy gets with his girlfriend “to the second base” something little dies inside of me.

** I don't notice it most of the time unless it's very obvious American slang. I live in the US myself so it's what I'm accustomed to.

Actually, I notice the reverse far more often. I'll see fanfics or crossovers where an American character will use British English words instead of American English(like "whilst" instead of "while")

*** Hmm.. I think Im the same way... but tbh, most of the writers from the uk or Australia and Ireland I read are pretty good at American picking.

Sorry Canadians. As a Michigan boy I see a lot of you and I visit your country quite often as well. We dont really speak or write much differently at all. And before you ask no, most Americans didnt even know you were involved in the war of 1812. And we have no hurt feels over it.

**** Canadian to American, nah not too different. I'm born and raised in British Columbia and been in NY/MA for 3 years now. Accents, yeah upstate NY picked out my NV born husband who lived in BC for 7 years as "Canadian". The main differences I see are the regional things. Ie. In MA now, packy for liquor store, bubbler for water fountain. Most of the rest of it is close enough.

** Please try to remember the following: 1) Many if not most fanfic writers are young Americans. They are, accordingly, amateur or hobbyist writers. 2) British and American English have drifted so far apart that they are essentially two different languages. I have to watch British shows with closed captioning because I can't understand you any more. So asking a young hobbyist to learn your language so you can better enjoy the free story they've written on their own time is a bit much; and finally, 3) You chose to read the story.

I completely understand a sense of pride and possessiveness for the British when it comes to HP. And deservedly so---I doubt any American writer could have nailed it the way JKR did (although I could do without the subsequent commentary). But when complaining or Britpicking all the young American fans who fell in love with the HP universe and wanted to contribute to it, please try to take pride in the fact JKR inspired the world instead of being upset that the world doesn't talk the way you do. Just a thought from an old American who rediscovered a touch of magic in HP.

*** It is absolutely nothing to do with pride or possessiveness. It's about ruining the atmosphere of a story and breaking the immersiveness.

A few Americanised - or Americanized - words here and there don't spoil anything, and people can get a wee bit precious about them. The problem comes when somebody totally ignores the differences between America and the UK. If a story has Harry putting on sneakers to go to the mall, the author clearly can't be bothered to do the slightest bit of research so I won't be bothered to read the story. If you want to set Harry Potter in America, do that. Some stories have and there are some excellent examples.

**** You're conflating “ignore” with “don't know”. That's my point. By your words you're assigning intentional disregard. I'm telling you it's not people ignoring anything. It's about them NOT KNOWING. And because of language differences and their own age and amateur status, that's not going to change. If it bothers you that much then you can choose not to read fanfic written by Americans.

***** That's a good point about not knowing. As a Brit myself, I wouldn't expect writers from other countries to have an extensive knowledge of British culture. One example: I regularly see stories where the Dursleys refuse to buy Harry glasses or pay for hospital/doctor visits because these things would cost too much. Actually they are taxpayer funded through the National Health Service and would in almost all cases be free. This is the sort of thing that people from other countries might easily not know about.

****** Usually I just explain this away to myself by imagining that the Dursley's have private healthcare because they're snobs - and seeing as they can't be bothered to pay for Harry they can't be bothered at all.

***** If you've read the original books you should be aware that there are differences between UK and US culture. If you aren't, then you're skim reading and not thinking about what's on the page. At that point, it becomes "ignore" by default.

I beta for an American writer and 99% of his word choice goes unchallenged because it's not important. On the other hand I've changed a few things because they were anachronistic or culturally wrong, and he accepted those changes because he wanted the story to be believable.

You are encouraging people to do no research and to engage in lazy writing. That's a very unhelpful attitude.

** I'm going to just have to disagree with you. Vehemently. Your position is built on a frankly offensive sense of entitlement. You're demanding young people writing as a hobby who give you free stories to make their hobby into a chore for your personal enjoyment. That argument might hold water if you were a paying customer. You're not. It might hold water if these kids were make a living off this. They aren't (if you find any who are, have at them). In sum, these kids owe you nothing, and you are entitled to nothing in return. Edit. Dang it. Responded to the wrong one again. I need new glasses.

** My trying to watch Misfits or the last two Dr. Who's was like watching a foreign language film. Capaldi and ...the lady whose name I can't remember are completely unintelligible. Language is organic and evolving, and British and American English are evolving along different paths. We're still the same written language, but the verbal language is drifting, as is usage. Which was my point. Asking young amateur American FanFiction writers to learn your slang and usage is just a little on the silly side.\\
Edit---Replied to the wrong post. Sry.

American slang is super annoying when reading a fic that's supposedly set in the UK.
