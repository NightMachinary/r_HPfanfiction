My first real Harry Potter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13648964/1/Lacuna][fanfiction]]! linkffn(13648964)

During the First War, Sirius pulled a DH Hermione and completely changed his girlfriend's memory and identity. He then sent her to live abroad in order to protect her from certain Death Eaters.

For the past 15 years this woman has been living as a completely different person abroad, with no knowledge or care about Sirius' situation.

The summer Voldemort returns to his body, the memory charm Sirius put on her breaks, and all her memories (and emotions) return to her. She comes back to Britain, rejoins the Order, and moves into Grimmauld Place. (Cue some intense cleaning and redecorationg--this woman LOVES nice, comfy things).

This fic explores her process of forgiving Sirius for messing with her life, Sirius' general post-Azkaban healing (now that he has someone actually concerned about his mental health), as well as the changes in storyline and characters' lives that this OC brings about.

There's a nasty Death Eater from the past who keeps popping up, and Sirius gets to make himself useful. The Longbottoms also play an important-ish role, as does Luna Lovegood's mother.

I've posted four chapters and am working on the fifth right now, but I do have a general direction I want the story to take. I'd really appreciate any sort of constructive criticism or suggestions about smaller plot points. Even if you hate it or have no interest in reading, I'd love to know why.

Thank you!

Oh, and the story itself is not nearly so solemn as the blurb's writing might suggest. I do try to lighten things up and add some humor, though whether or not I'm actually funny is up for debate.

This is inspired by a Marlene McKinnon fic I read quite a few years ago but didn't save. I've been looking for it recently, but no one seemed to know anything about it, which makes me super sad. I really loved the memory modification premise, so that's where this story came from. If you think you know the Marlene McKinnon story I'm referring to, please lmk! I'll love you forever.

  In 1980, Sirius modified her memory and sent her away, determined to protect her from the horrors of war. In 1995, she steps into Grimmauld Place and back into his life. The Second War looms, and as they struggle with old wounds and new enemies, they find each other once more. This time, neither will let the other go. OotP AU with First War flashbacks.

*** It's not that one unfortunately :( I've read all of Innocent, and the fic I read before was much more focused on just Sirius and Marlene's relationship. She also doesn't think he's guilty for like half the fic
