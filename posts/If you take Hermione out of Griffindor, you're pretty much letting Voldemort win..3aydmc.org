** Keywords of this post: in cannon. Ron and Harry could arguably step it up when they see their grades completely slipping. Arguably, they got by without her the first two months.

As far as the stone goes, Ron and Harry wouldn't have noticed the trapdoor, nor cared enough about it to research it. Whether they get involved in it depends on your view of Dumbledore (manipulative Dumbledore gets them involved regardless, canon Dumbledore doesn't). Dumbledore's protections would most likely have held, as Voldemort shows no real way to get the stone without Harry, and Dumbledore was only 5 to 10 minutes behind the trio it seems.

Second year the school might have closed. This would be an interesting fic actually, one that I haven't read yet. The school closing opens up soooooo many options (alternative schooling, new building, etc).

As far as letting Voldie win, I don't think so. There are so many logical, in universe ways for him to be dealt with in a realistic manner that I don't think he is guaranteed a win just because Hermione is in a different house. Her being in a different house could just mean she is more involved or less involved. At some point, she will be involved regardless, as most of the kids in the school are. Just because she isn't in Gryf, doesn't mean that voldie will win. I think she can be just as determined and resourceful coming from a different house in the later parts of the war as she is in the early parts of it.

*** Slytherin!Hermione is unlikely, but possible given associations with Merlin and the fact that canon!Hermione is ambitious. They'd come across her in first year for sure as Slytherin and Gryffindor share classes, and they'd remember her from the train.

Hufflepuff!Hermione would pop up in second year when there's the subplot with the Puffs accusing Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin, if not before.

Ravenclaw!Hermione would be unlikely to befriend Luna or Cho independently, but if canon!Padma was different enough from her sister, they might become friends. It would be interesting to see if Ravenclaw!Hermione had a bond with Flitwick similar to her bond with McGonagall in canon.

If Harry/Ron hadn't pushed them together and let them appreciate each other's different sides and get closer, though, I doubt Hermione would have befriended Ginny or Luna, although a Ravenclaw!Hermione would probably have intervened to stop Luna being bullied, given that she was intuitively protective of Neville on the Hogwarts Express.

We do? Yes, Dursleys suck, but Harry doesn't show any signs of what you describe. He regularly talks back to them and isn't shy about telling Hagrid that he does quite well in school. If this is about him wanting to be "just Harry", I'd say that people who thrive on being tabloid celebrities --- which Harry is, in the Wizarding world --- are a tiny minority, and Harry likes being known for things he feels are his and that he enjoys --- like Quiddich. (Would you really rather read 7 books with Gilderoy Lockhart as a protagonist? OK, well, maybe...)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think that's overstating the case a bit. Judging from canon evidence, the only reason why most adults can't cast it is that it's only taught at the DADA NEWT level, and only a small fraction of the populace takes that, especially in peacetime. 14-year-olds were able to make progress on it in a few weeks, investing much less time and effort into it than Harry. Harry was practicing before a Boggart, yes, but that speaks to his emotional disposition more than skill: the very same disposition --- wearing his heart on his sleeve --- that lets him push through Dementors and cast a Patronus also cripples his Occlumency, so it's a trade-off.

Harry's biggest gifts are not magical --- it's his ridiculous dexterity and reflexes and his stubbornness under fire. Had he been a Squib, he could have been a champion race car driver, a stunt pilot, or a special forces commando.

As for leadership, I don't see it. The main reason people other than his close friends listen to him is that he is the Boy-Who-Lived (and, later, TWT winner). He is not organised, does not plan, does not manage resources. His biggest leadership experience --- Dumbledore's Army --- was organised by Hermione with Harry as an instructor and a figurehead. His major acts of "leadership" end in disaster as often as not, with the Department of Mysteries visit being the most prominent.

I like this vision, but I think that this is more like what Ron /could have been/. Unfortunately, Hermione gets to be Sailor Exposition in canon, and Ron's potential is underused, and Ron's planning skills are limited to chess. :(

Also, Hermione isn't just good at looking up information, she's also very, very good at magic. People often forget that.

**** First, I would pay my weight in gold to read books about Gilderoy Lockhart because that would be HYSTERICAL. I will retract my opinions on Harry having slight feelings of inadequacy though.

Re: harry being gifted and the patronus: I'm using my skills as a teacher to make this judgement: usually you only introduce certain skill sets earlier or later because students cannot handle them earlier. I introduce MLA in 9th grade, but it won't really stick until 11th grade (it's just a maturity thing). I think Harry is naturally bright, though, and his magical skills can't be forgotten. He learned accio in a night (it feels--in thanks to Hermione who practiced with him). I also agree that Harry's non-magical skills are what push him to be as excellent as he is. Do I think he's Hermione level amazing @ school? No. Ahhh, our boy.

Harry is also thrust into a leadership position BECAUSE he is the boy who lived, is what I'm getting at. There are a lot of people who flounder in leadership positions and while Harry repeatedly says that he would rather he WASN'T in this type of position, he does take up the mantle quite well. The DoM is definitely something that backfires on him, but I think that is in part thanks to the emotional pull he felt because he thought Sirius was in trouble. You don't go on to be the youngest head of Aurors by being poor at leadership.

As for Ron's planning being limited to chess, he's actually super instrumental in DH when it came to breaking into the ministry to steal the locket, not to mention after that he has the idea to get the basilisk fangs, etc. His brilliance is sprinkled all throughout the books but they are often overshadowed by Hermione. I still stand by the fact that it is Ron that provides the magical background that Hermione and Harry do not have. I'm 99% sure there is a scene in the books where Ron is like "why are you researching this? This is the answer--" bc it's basic wizarding knowledge.

I love Hermione a LOT but I feel like the fandom as a whole has this tendency to shove themselves squarely up her butthole and forget that she has her shortcomings as much as the other two. (AND YES. HERMIONE IS SO EXCELLENT AT MAGIC AND I LOVE THAT. MUGGLEBORN AND KICKING ASS).

That may be true for the sorts of skills everyone has to learn or skills that have other skills as hard prerequisites --- and even there, it's a matter of prioritising: mathematics may be an integrated body of knowledge, but one can teach fractions and negative numbers in either order. Patronus, however, is an elective. From what we see about people learning it, it's taught in the NEWTs because it's completely useless to anyone who doesn't deal with Dementors (and doesn't know Dumbledore's trick of using them to send messages), so there's no point wasting most students' time during the pre-OWL years.

Now that I think about it, I am not sure whether there exists a Muggle discipline that's anything like Charms. Unlike Potions and Transfiguration, which appear to build up coherent bodies of knowledge and skill, each Charm is a discrete spell, and while some are more difficult than others, they can be learned in nearly any order. Maybe it's like learning a new dance or a new piece on a musical instrument?

Anyway, notice that Remus was the one who suggested the Patronus Charm, and he didn't portray it as a very long shot, and it wasn't a surprise that he pulled it off. My headcanon is that most wizards and witches think that the Patronus Charm is harder than it is due to Ministry propaganda: it reduces the effectiveness of their preferred terror weapon.

Ultimately, I think that Harry is plenty bright, but the word "gifted" is a bit stronger than that; and fanon often treats him as this untapped genius...

I don't think that's accurate. After the Summoning Charm was introduced in the Charms class, he spent a long time trying to learn it and failing miserably: from GoF, "Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework -- the only person to get any, apart from Neville." He did, eventually, get it, at the last minute, but it took a long time to work up to that.

The way you wrote it, it sounded like a character trait or talent, rather than a position. Overall, I think that a lot of people do a lot of things on Harry's behalf or in Harry's name (e.g., Potterwatch), but him actually leading people in any meaningful way? We don't see much of it either way. Neville gets to do more "leading" off-screen in DH than Harry does through all the books.

Indeed. The weird thing is that people feel compelled to invent flaws for her (like Authority Worship), when her canon flaws like her belief that she knows better for everyone and her casual ruthlessness when she feels justified are much more interesting. (Briefly, take Harry and make him a Dumbledore-grade genius; you'll get a guy who spends even less time on coursework to spend more on Quiddich and hanging out with friends, and breezes through what challenges do arise, coasting on raw talent. Now, take Hermione and make her a Dumbledore-grade genius; she'll be figuring out what sort of Greater Good she wants to impose on the world a week into her first year at Hogwarts.)

Even if not abused as much as in fanon, canon!Harry as a child goes to school and is bullied, does what seems to be the lion's share of the housework and gardening, and literally lived in a dark cupboard under the stairs sleeping on a ratty blanket, never mind having toys or kindness shown him.

In that sense, Ron has always had companions and relative freedom, which is why his laziness is more of a vice, I think, while Hermione, although probably a lonely child, has likely had comfort and treats, as well as all the books she could want, from her middle-class dentist parents.

** Another thing occurred to me... Suppose that Hermione is Sorted Gryffindor, /but/ she runs to a different washroom, and misses the troll. So, not only is she not friends with Harry and Ron, she is actually angry at them over what she feels is a betrayal (because she thought that they were friends, and then Ron called her "nightmare"), not to mention annoyed at them for getting themselves (and, sometimes, her) into trouble. She refocuses on her own studies, much more reluctant to help others; she mostly hangs out with Ravenclaws.

Eight months later, Harry and Ron (and Neville and/or Seamus and/or Dean), having somehow solved the Philosopher Stone mystery without Hermione, prepare to go after the Philosopher's Stone, and proceed to run into her, and she is sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it. She knows the Petrificus Totalus jinx, and she's not afraid to use it...
