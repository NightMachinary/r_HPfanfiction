Any good story where Harry's bad. He doesn't necessarily have to be a Death Eater though that is the plot I would prefer.


** This is a crossover, between the Dresden Files and Harry Potter, but the crossover part is very limited. Mainly, it just borrows a single element from the Dresden Files and parts of the setting - there is no prerequisite to read DF before this fic and it'll still make sense.

Anyway, there's these silver denarius coins - 30 of them - and each of them are host to a fallen angel. Taking up one of these damns one's soul, but also provides nigh-immortality and tremendous power (sourced by Hellfire).

Premise goes - Harry finds one of these at like age 6 or something. He fucks shit up. It's pretty awesome. While he isn't exactly evil, he's definitely chaotic good. And that's pushing it.
