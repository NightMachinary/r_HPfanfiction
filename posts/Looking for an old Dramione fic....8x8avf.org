I read this YEARS ago, but what I can remember is that (post Hogwarts) Hermione was a healer, I think she was divorced and had a daughter(i think from ron, but not sure) Draco was an ER patient at St. Mungos, can't remember why, Hermione took him back to her place to recover for a few weeks, Ron found out he was there and totally lost his mind. I think Harry found out and was leery but accepting. That is all i remember. Thanks.
