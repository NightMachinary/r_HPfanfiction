Hello! Looking for anyone's help, information, and tips regarding how people sort and order their follows and favourites.

It gets tedious looking through fics when you have hundreds of favourites and follows so if anyone has anything to share please do!

Thank you!!


** If you use AO3, I've seen people add tags to things they bookmark. Not very useful for [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], though. Making a document/spreadsheet can help, especially if you organize by tropes/pairings/aus/etc. so you can find something you want to get to. If you do it in Google drive, you can bookmark it for easy access.

** I don't use the in-site system, personally. I just bookmark them in my browser and sort them in folders by whatever the most prominent element of the fic is - if it's Lord Potter-Black-I-Write-Sins-Not-Tragedies-Ambrosius-Gryffindor-Slytherin with his feckless anime side-wenches, then I'd file it under Lord Potter. If it was a fourth year fic, I'd likely end up filing it under Triwizard, unless whatever ship it was was more prominent in the story than the tournament.

I have a 'to-sort' folder where I put the bookmarks of the fics I've finished so I know which ones need sorting, then another 'to-read' folder with occasional subfolders there if I get a lot of recs for a specific request.

** I second both of the organization methods that have been mentioned so far (browser bookmarks and Ao3's tagging). Aside from that, I've also started using the [[https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/25670-fanfictionnavigator][FanfictionNavigator]] script to mark fics that I've read but not liked enough to bookmark.

** One way I like to do this is by leaving really detailed reviews that encourage the author and leave me breadcrumbs. I'll say things like "I like [this very specific thing in the fic that only happened in this fic and in nothing else]. Can't wait for an update."

Then I can look back through my reviews to see what I've commented on and if it's still ongoing.
