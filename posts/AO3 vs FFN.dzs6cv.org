I have a story up consisting of almost entirely OCs in the HP fandom. I began crossposting to FFN. I only have 3 chapters so far.

​

AO3 says I have 43 views and 1 Kudos.

​

FFN says 15 views, only 3 of those made it to the 3rd chapter.

​

What's going on here? Is this the norm for Harry Potter? Does the FFN crowd not like OCs?


** Numbers are too small to be statistically significant, don't worry about that, and just publish what you have? Do you write to have fun or do you write to be successful? If the latter, than you are opening yourself to the world of hurt.

** You've got to consider what people search for. I expect your story will continue to do better on AO3 than FFN because of the tag system. In a story with pretty much no HP characters, FFN leaves you very little to attach to your story for people to find you. You're basically only going to get those who are sorting by newest updated, and even then that'll only last while your most recent chapter is new.

AO3 lets you tell people more about your story than just with character tags, so it's easier for people to actually get to your fic to read it.

** I think OCs are generally a turn off for most readers... they are reading fanfiction because they love the original characters and are looking for more time with their beloved characters. I don't know if it is a AO3 vs. FFnet thing or not. It is easier to search on AO3 for characters, ships, etc. as well as filter out tags that you want to avoid.

***** TBH I find AO3 comment sections to be waay too coddling. you can't criticize anything about a story without being bombed and told: "don't like don't read." Ususally not with those words.

I find the tag system of AO3 makes Authors/Readers-in-the-comments-section unprepared for criticism because generally someone who reads the tags, won't bother reading, but if they decide to take a chance, end up not liking it, and decide to share that in the comments, they get bombed.

On FFN you seem to get extremely polarized reviews, and unlike AO3, theres no real comment threads for people to follow a conversation/argument. It's just a bunch of jumbled comments, which eliminates ganging up on someone who has a differing opinion.

I generally like FFN's system better, but AO3 is easier to find good stories that you're looking for.

As far as the OP's question, I personally dont read OC-centric stories. 9.9 times out of 10, its a self-insert, and even when it isn't, theres generally a bias towards the OC.

****** I definitely see where you're coming from. I do like AO3's system better, especially when it comes to more complex fics as you can actually have a conversation with the author about some things that maybe weren't so clear, and you can bounce some ideas off of them as well. And yeah, OC stories are generally not my thing. The only OC story that I actually love is the Calista Snape series by Arinus. Terrific writing and great characterizations.

** If I see OCs and only a summary I am less likely to read it, AO3 having Tags helps that if the tags are good I give it a try something I am way less likely to do if there aren't and AO3 consists of a lot of filter possibilities helping to spread the fanfiction on ffnet you have to mainly rely on you fanfiction being part of communities

*** Also consider the fact that there are much much more Harry Potter fanfictions on ffnet than AO3 meaning I personally Filter less on AO3 and go through all of the summaries containing a specific character while I couldn't and wouldn't do so on ffnet

** I think OCs are great. It gives the characters more opportunity to explore the Wizarding world. With OCs you run less chance of breaking existing characters. Personally I am a fan of Wizarding world fics. New characters in Wizarding world , probably a generation or two ahead of trio and doing their own thing. Also giving throwback to the old guys just to keep some anchor to existing characters. The stats for now are low to say something conclusive but keep going.

** A) AO3 works by tags. Not knowing what type of story you wrote, it might be easier to find or stand out on AO3 more. Haphne, gay protagonists, bashing, etc. all do better on AO3. FFN has more of a 'rich get richer' approach - once you get momentum/attention, it's easier for people to find your fic. In FFN, you can really only search by characters, and all your characters are OCs. Of course you're not going to get as many views there, compared to AO3, where you could search for any 'theme' tags.

B) Pretty much everyone here goes through both AO3 and FFN. If people have seen it on AO3, they're not going to reread it on FFN.

C) People are probably seeing that you only have 3 chapters and dipping instead of reading it through. There are more fics on FFN, so it's easy to dismiss a fledgling fic and try something else.

D) If you posted on your FFN that you're crossposting, they probably just went there, because you apparently upload there first.

E) Some people browse FFN on third party apps to make reading easier, so maybe that's the case here.

F) Are you sure the formatting carried over?

G) Join a community on FFN. There are plenty for OC fics. That's how you get views, in my limited experience.

I don't know about other people, but if I like a fic then I make a point of favoriting/bookmarking it on both sites. I try to help the authors I like get more recognition for their stories, even if I'm just elevating them a tiny bit in search results.

** 1) what's the fic called? I'm always short on good OC action

2) I often search on AO3 due to the tags and then read the fic on FFN if it's on there as the app allows lots of customisation if font and background colour so it is nicer to read.

** OC's are extremely unpopular in just about any fandom unless they're linked to an already existing canon character.

IMHO OC's are really unpopular because having them defeats the purpose of a story being fanfiction. The more OC's you add the further you push your content away from being fanfiction at all.

It's just my opinion but if I wanted to read about a ton of OC's, I'd just go pick up an original fiction book somewhere.
