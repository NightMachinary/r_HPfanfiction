--------------

The Dursleys were enjoying a picnic until the Queen came and in her hand was a crystal which sucked the Dursley into a trial\\
Maria Ushiromiya:[ Red]The Trial of the Dursleys starts now the Court of Heaven and Hell will begin(/str)\\
Vernon Dursley: What is this you freaks Maria: This is the Court of Heaven and Hell where both Angels and Demons try, judge, and punish people like you in fact here's the prosecution\\
Gaap: Demon of the 33rd hell Gaap here\\
Ronove: Demon of the 247th hell Ronove here\\
Dlanor: Heavenly Inquisitor Dlanor A. Knox Here\\
Will: Heavenly Inquisitor Willard H. Wright here\\
Erika Furudo: Erika the Detective here\\
Petunia Dursley: where's Dudley\\
The Queen of England: look behind you\\
And so they look to see everyone they have known excluding a few like Arabella Figg sitting down Wax like even including the tortured face of Dudley\\
Vernon: What have you done with Dudley!!!\\
Maria: don't worry their lives are in your hands Petunia: Huh\\
Maria: you see this is a trial to find out if you two kill Lily and James Potter\\
Petunia: It was Voldemort\\
Maria: can you prove that\\
Vernon: of course just ask that freak\\
Maria: huh oh yeah might as well start the recreation\\
Vernon: What are you talking about\\
Maria: The recreation of a game board that proves your Guilt\\
Petunia: How can a game prove someone's guilt Maria: it an Alternate World as people call it the crimes will most likely prove your guilt And so Pictures float by First of Harry's Cupboard next was of the teachers or Dudley's and Harry's old school's third was of executives at Grunning another came by of Dudley's friends and finally of Most of the Pivet Drive residents all containing scenes of horrible murders of who each picture belonged to and so the trial started and it was a one-sided battle with the power of the red truth\\
[red]Two of the culprits of this game are the same as the masterminds behind Lily and James Potter(/str)\\
[red]The Dursleys have Caused the death of Harry Potter(/str)\\
[red]Harry's death was intentional(/str)\\
[red]Harry's death wasn't a suicide(/str)\\
[red]Harry's death is the reason all the other deaths occurred(/str)\\
and so the fact that Dursleys killed Lily and James Potter became the truth the punishment they get removed from their lives and thrown into the abyss Dudley's soul was split into 15 pieces everyone else who was a defendant fate was as life began again they were all convicted of crimes regardless if they did it or not the only way for all this to be reversed if the Dursleys manage to prove someone else is the killer in an infinite cycle to this day a second truth for it was impossible writing and writing in an abyss slowly driven insane trying to find a second truth as for Harry well he was sent to another world after his parents' destined deaths in every fragment to live a better life and still this ending remains the truth.
