In this fic Harry and Hermione at some point go through an adoption ritual and adopt a girl after her parents are killed. The ritual causes the young girl to change and take on the characteristics of both Harry and Hermione.


** Was the girl Voldemort's daughter? Because it kinda sounds like you are describing The Augurey.

*** Nah, there isn't any ritual in The Augurey. But it's a great fic.

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.
