I absolutely don't want this thread to descend into an argument about the merits of JKR's opinions about the trans community. If it does, I will delete.

I'm just curious how those who disagree with her opinions manage (or not) to separate the art from the artist.

I still want to read HP content but I find her comments troubling and I'm struggling a bit with if it's ok. I think I feel better about reading fanfiction as it's not her writing, but I don't know.

Still pondering and looking for other opinions. Thank you.


** Copying what I replied to a comment on a similar post on the book subreddit today:

#+begin_quote
  Death of the Author is an academic concept, not a moral one, and it isn't one that helps us when clearly the author is alive and well.
#+end_quote

THANK YOU. If you feel gross financially supporting JKR (like I do), don't just use DotA to absolve yourself of guilt.

#+begin_quote
  You can also read the books again with a discerning eye. Figure out which messages come from the same place of bigotry. And then ensure that you know and live better than those messages. If her books DID teach you toxic shit, then unlearn those messages asap.
#+end_quote

This is what I've been doing, along with not giving her any more money. There's plenty of critical reread podcasts out there if you want second/third/fourth opinions, plus you'll be supporting creators who are (hopefully) not transphobic. I highly recommend the Gayly Prophet podcast for hilarious intersectional analysis, and the Shrieking Shack podcast for a "these books could have been written a lot better" analysis.

** I've always subscribed to Death of the Author - if it's not on the page it's not canon. So I've always taken information from her interviews and tweets as optional.

That said, the books have some dubious shit on the page. The goblins are anti-Semitic stereotypes. The house elves are happy slaves. Arthur Weasley is "benignly" racist against Muggles.

In a school full of teenagers, where we hear plenty of gossip about who's dating who, the only same-sex relationship is an implied - /not/ explicitly stated - romance between a Dark Lord and someone who regretted that toxic romance/friendship. (Seriously, it would not have been hard to toss in a line at the Yule Ball, "Seamus danced past with a wizard Harry didn't recognize" or "Hannah was dancing with a witch from Beauxbatons". Ta da, Harry knows one single LGB person.)

The GOOD guys repeatedly send an abused child back to his abusers, and that "mother's love" protection is a decision the author made. She could just as easily have decided that Lily's protection was powered by people who share her love for Harry, instead of people who share her blood.

Speaking of blood family. The supposed message of the series is that blood doesn't matter and our choices define us. But that's not what actually happens. The child characters are almost all defined by their parents. Harry is a carbon copy of James - Harry's Patronus is a stag because his father was a stag, even though he doesn't remember his father. Dudley is a fat bully because his father is a fat bully. Draco is rotten because Lucius is rotten. Goyle and Crabbe are hulking goons because Goyle Sr. and Crabbe Sr. are hulking goons.

Which leads me to Evil Slytherins vs. Good Gryffindors. Even when Gryffindors are bullies (Mauraders), they grow up to be noble warriors against evil. Even when Slytherins are victimized, they grow up to be Death Eaters. Our choices don't define us, our Houses do.

Don't get me started on how all the adults are useless and Saving the Day is up to an eleven/twelve/thirteen-year-old.

...so all of this is a long winded way of saying that JKR's prejudices are absolutely on the page.

I deal with it by thinking about it when I read. I remember that these are flaws, and then I remember that there are good parts too. Should the philosopher's stone have been protected by a first year plant and a logic puzzle? No. Is it hilarious when Ron yells "are you a witch" and exciting when Hermione figures out the riddle? Yes. Overall, despite their flaws, I think these books have literary merit.

#+begin_quote
  The goblins are anti-Semitic stereotypes
#+end_quote

It's a small thing in the grand scheme of things, but imo people should always make the goblins different in their fics. For example, I'm currently writing something that will feature Goblins, and I'm essentially completely AU-ing them, because their depiction in the books is dogshit.

Generally, I'd recommend anyone who doesn't know how to elevate their depiction to reference Tolkien's portrayal of Dwarves in LotR. They're also based on semitic people, but unlike JKR, Tolkien actually took inspiration from those cultures and portrayed them as seriously awesome and capable. (He also alluded to the false stereotype of greed by creating the so-called "Dragon SIckness", a curse spread by Morgoth and the dragons - I'm sure you can see what he was intending by having the so-called "inherent greed" be actually a curse spread by the satan analogue)

#+begin_quote
  The house elves are happy slaves
#+end_quote

This one is a bit more difficult to solve. You could AU them of course, make them unwilling slaves who're freed and slay their masters, but a good alternative imho is having Dobby start a civil rights movement for Elves that quickly gains steam as other elves see Dobby isn't dying or going crazy like they were always told free elves would.

I will say also that making their slavery "a good thing" by having them require their bonds to survive is an objectively wrong authorial decision.

#+begin_quote

Yup, JKR seriously fucked up there. I doubt she regrets that decision either. However, the community has LGBT representation firmly in the bag, and it's only looking up from here.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is actually part of a worrying trend I've observed over storytelling in general lately. "Blood", Familial connections or sometimes outright genetic superiority is used as a plot device, and framed as a good thing. For example, Rey (from the new star wars movies) wasn't a strong force-user on her own merits, she was strong because she's related to Palaptine. In a similar vein, Credence (from Crimes of Grindelwald) isn't just a randomly powerful wizard, he's powerful because he's related to Dumbledore.

Many more such examples exist. I fear that it's a greater trend and that storytelling as a whole is currently backsliding into elitistic narratives.

#+begin_quote
  The child characters are almost all defined by their parents
#+end_quote

This continues on, too, with names: All of Harry's children carry the names of dead people. Why? Why can't they have their own names, unconnected to some random-ass person they never even knew? What honor is there in naming a child after someone else, instead of giving them their own name to grow into?

I try where I can to give any children mentioned original, good names (and not "hugo", either), but many people seem to just aquisece and don't seem to see the problem you create for the child's psyche if they have to carry the weight of a name like "Severus".

#+begin_quote
  Our choices don't define us, our Houses do.
#+end_quote

Which carries over into fanfiction as well, sadly. Even positive slytherin fics make them smarmy and unlikeable rather than the group of kids they really are. No teenager could stand the level of "politics" seen in most of these fics, they'd go insane and start a brawl just so there's a bit of excitement in their lives.

Adding to this is the whole trend of "allies, not friends" that's seriously fucked. Kids and teenagers don't know what an ally is. They barely know who they are themselves. They create friendships as easily as breathing, but most fics that circle around slytherin seem to imply that they never have social get-togethers or cliques or any sort of friendship that isn't based on egotistical benefit.

To be honest, part of this is also just a complete misunderstanding of what defines Slytherin in the first place - it's not the house of smarmyness, it's the house of /AMBITION/ and /CUNNING/. Both of these can be linked and create a volatile concoction that would fuel many, many amazing stories - but most authors seem to think "ambition and cunning" means "cartoonishly evil and vicious" rather than "intensely focused on their goals" or "unafraid to interact with a situation that presents itself" or "incredibly charismatic and making as many friends as possible". JKR herself created a character that followed the last example: Slughorn.

#+begin_quote

I honestly wish there were more stories that just had the adults as their protagonists. I'm very sick of everything having to be handled by a child. I was once a child, and I know that even child-me would prefer adult-me to handle situations.

So yeah, competent adult fics are my jam.

(And this doesn't even touch on the massive yikes that is sexual content in this community in general.)

Sometimes people don't know. I didn't make the connection until someone pointed it out to me, because I'm lucky enough not to have to deal with anti-Semitism. So I don't judge fanfic authors who go with canon depictions - but if they exaggerate the stereotypes or if their characters say things like "greedy little fuckers should all be killed" then YEAH I assume they're racist assholes.

#+begin_quote

I also like fics where people come in from other countries and are like "of course we pay our house elves... You don't?" And British house elves learn about French/Russian/American house elf culture.

And I get the argument that house elves are based on brownies. Brownies of folklore were insulted if someone offered them money or clothes. But brownies of folklore were also insulted if someone, y'know, insulted them, and they would destroy the jerk's house before they left forever.

#+begin_quote
  All of Harry's children carry the names of dead people. Why? Why can't they have their own names, unconnected to some random-ass person they never even knew?
#+end_quote

I noticed a trend in canon. Every time we know the middle name of a magic-born child, their middle name is the first name of a relative. For the firstborns of a gender, it's the parent of that gender: Harry James, 1st son of James. William Arthur, 1st son of Arthur. Ginevra Molly, 1st daughter of Molly. Draco Lucius, 1st son of Lucius. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian, 1st son of Percival.

For non-firstborns, it's the name of some other relative. Regulus Arcturus, 2nd son, grandson of Arcturus. Percy Ignatius, 3rd son, nephew of Ignatius. Ronald Bilius, 6th son, nephew of Bilius.

The only exception is Tom Marvolo. (Remus J. Lupin has neither a middle name nor a known father's name in the books, only in extended canon.)

So, I /completely/ headcanon Harry's and Ginny's kids as Random-name Harry, Random-name Sirius/James/Arthur/Ronald, and Random-name Ginevra.

#+begin_quote
  I honestly wish there were more stories that just had the adults as their protagonists.
#+end_quote

I get that these are children's stories with children protagonists. But I have read so many good fanfics where Harry's still a major part of the plot and yet the adults aren't useless. (Example: Quirrel goes through the obstacle course, can't get the stone out, kidnaps Harry to make him try, and now Dumbledore has arrived to save the day, called back by McGonagall on Harry's warning. Example 2: we need a Parselmouth to open the Chamber of Secrets. Stay back, Harry, and watch this wicked cool battle between trained adults and a legendary monster.)

*** The problem with the dursleys abusiveness is that this is predominantly a coming of age/quest saga and in that style, the young protagonist needs to have no authority figures to justify how they go on their adventures. Otherwise there needs to be a realistic reason for why caring guardians aren't involved, which takes up plot development time etc and needs to be managed. It's a lot easier for the protagonist to be orphaned off/ with people who don't care. I don't think this common plot device should be held against JKR as an advocation of child abuse

In /A Series of Unfortunate Events/, the good adults are too stupid to see through Count Olaf's disguises. In /Coraline/, the good adults are too busy to supervise her.

In /Harry Potter/, the good adults tell Harry that his abuse is necessary and he must endure it. That's a choice JKR made. That's shit.

I can also take some solace in purchasing anything I want second hand so she doesn't see a cent of that money.

** honestly, i just don't engage with anything created by her anymore. i used to reread the books quite often; i no longer do so. from a certain point of view, i don't really engage with HP content that isn't fanmade.

as a trans person, it's easier, and more enjoyable, to just. read fic that includes trans characters, queer characters, characters of color, etc. and to read fic that explores moral questions and follows clear logic and isn't filled with plot holes.

if you're not supporting her financially and don't hold her views, you're not doing anything wrong, OP. just, like, don't buy more of her books and don't buy official merch. if you have to buy the HP books, get them secondhand so your money isn't going to her. that kind of thing.

so much popular literature and other media was created or owned by shitty people; Rowling isn't the first and won't be the last. the actress who played Shuri in the Black Panther movie is violently transphobic; it doesn't make you a bad person for liking the movie or for buying comics! and that's one example. we still read Lovecraft and listen to Wagner; what matters is that we know their shitty beliefs, note it when we see it crossing over into their work, and support those harmed by it.

it's an unfortunate fact of life that horrible people can create good content, especially in a society where marginalized people's creations often do not have the opportunity to gain traction; we can still enjoy that content, so long as we don't inadvertently promote their views or support them financially.

what's more important, in my view, is promoting content made by marginalized people. in this case, trans folks. engage with fic and art written by trans writers. if you buy merch, shop from trans sellers.

imo, it's always better to say "support and uplift trans people" than "fuck terfs." if you're not actively supporting and helping trans people, finding Rowling "problematic" is performative and does nothing.

If someone makes a nice painting of an Aurora Borealis and is also a serial rapist, or a murder, or a Klansman or whatever that doesn't make the painting look any less nice. It doesn't give the painting some horrible meaning or change anything really. I can absolutely hate someone or disagree with their views but if they write an interesting story, or paint a beautiful painting, or direct a groundbreaking film them I'm still going to consume that art as long as the art itself isn't about whatever horrible thing the artist did and in the case of fanfiction the original artist doesn't even have any direct input.

Frankly, I think people are only up in arms about her work because she's still alive. If she was dead, I'd have no doubt that every would still be reading HP and exalting it.

In the US, you have the constitution and declaration of independence, written by slave-owning rich white men. In the more apt general entertainment realm, you have multiple instances of praised works being created by bigots. Walt Disney, Ronald Dahl, and the list goes on horrifying long. And these opinions don't come from a good place like JKR's opinions seem to do.

People can do this, I think, because works take on a life of their own. The constitution is not interpreted as it used to be. Disney's movies, works, etc are praised separately from the creator's ideals. And I do believe this is true. When I think about the constitution, I don't think about the 3/5ths clause or the protection of slavery. I think about the 14th amendment and the 13th amendment and the ideals espoused in the preamble that are constantly being strived for, even if they weren't by the original writers.

  I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman who's older than I am and wonderful. Although she's open about her past as a gay man, I've always found it hard to think of her as anything other than a woman, and I believe (and certainly hope) she's completely happy to have transitioned. Being older, though, she went through a long and rigorous process of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged transformation.\\
  I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I've outlined. Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they're most likely to be killed by sexual partners. Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of colour, are at particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who've been abused by men.\\

  A man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a Gender Recognition Certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law. Many people aren't aware of this.\\
  The fourth is where things start to get truly personal. I'm concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex), because they regret taking steps that have, in some cases, altered their bodies irrevocably, and taken away their fertility. Some say they decided to transition after realising they were same-sex attracted, and that transitioning was partly driven by homophobia, either in society or in their families.\\

She is concerned with the possibility of predators, and the possibility that people are rushing into transitioning. She provides evidence to support her thoughts (the accuracy of which is questionable).

So JKR is coming from a place of good intentions. Her views have frankly been conveyed in a respectful manner on twitter and her website from what I've seen. Obviously, her personal history is coloring her beliefs. I doubt any predators are really getting a certificate to go perv in a bathroom. But I don't think her belief that the application process should be more rigorous comes from a bad place, nor do I disagree with the idea itself, namely for the last reason she details - it is a something I have encountered myself.
