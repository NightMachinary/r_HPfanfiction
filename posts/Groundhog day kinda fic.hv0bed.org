:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was this fic I read a long time back where Harry (I think when the fic begins Harry is like 9 or 10) dies in someway and wake up like a week before he died. It goes like this for a while where he keeps dying (I think at one point he came across a death eater living in surrey who tortured and killed Harry). At the end of 4th year where Voldemort gets a body I think Harry's revive ability also transfers over to Voldemort so that whenever Harry dies Voldemort also comes back in time with him and vice verse.

I think the story ends with Harry/Hermione but I can't be sure.

Edit: spelling
