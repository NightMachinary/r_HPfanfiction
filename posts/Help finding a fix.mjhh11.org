:END:
I don't remember the whole basis of the fan fiction but I remember a few scenes Harry is in the ancestral home of the potters I believe with either a ghost or portrait ancestor and he does a spell on himself in front of a mirror showing what magic is on him it shows a tracker and a magical binging in the form of ribbons and once the binging is removed I'm pretty sure a simple stunner reduced a training dummy to splinters
