** In "Rebirth" by Athy, Herakles "Heri" Jude is Voldemort's lover and gets reincarnated as Harry Potter. In his old life, which he remembers in full thanks to some difficult research and work he pulled off as a necromancer, Herakles is descended from an ancient and powerful line of Roman wizards. WIP and possibly not to be finished, but well worth a read, especially with its interesting take on necromancy. If you're not much into slash, Voldemort is absent throughout most of it and they're still in second year, so not a lot of sexually graphic things are described.
