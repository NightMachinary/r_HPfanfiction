(likely heavily-AU and probably counts as crack, though I'm imaging it as "crack treated seriously").

​

Tom Riddle was never a particularly charismatic man. Though he managed to gain some followers through his magical skill, many still looked down on his "impure" blood. And even among those who didn't know of his parentage, he wasn't able to garner that much support. But he had a trick up his sleeve - a mastery of the Imperius curse and other mind-manipulation spells.

​

So Tom Riddle---no, that's too muggle of a name---/Lord Voldemort/, begins to build himself an army of followers. It didn't matter who they used to be, because once he was done with them, they were loyal to him.

​

Possible further details:

- Some of Voldemort's followers are genuinely loyal to him without any mind control (these would likely be the Inner Circle members)
- Just because Voldemort tried to mind-control someone doesn't mean it was necessarily entirely effective (thus allowing for possible double agents)
- Since Voldemort gained power through mind manipulation instead of purely people who agreed with his goals, he will likely have support from a wider range of the population, with a special focus on controlling strong or influential people.
- Under this prompt, I feel like Voldemort is far more likely to be successful, so at a bare minimum, he probably left a larger mark on the current wizarding world than in canon.
- There would be a LOT of paranoia/fear about people being secret agents for Voldemort (or if Voldemort already won, paranoia among the dissidents about being discovered).
- In order for Harry to have a chance, he'll probably have to have something like a talent for occlumency.
- A plot point could be trying to free people from the mind manipulation.
