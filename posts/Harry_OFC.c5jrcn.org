  Twenty years after a falling out with the rest of the Marauders, Remus Lupin has completely cut himself off from the wizarding world and opened a restaurant in the muggle one. Unfortunately for him, his past comes back to haunt him in the most irritating way possible: his restaurant seems to attract the weirdest possible customers, both magical and muggle. Episodic, Remus-centric.

** While this isn't really my thing and I don't know if it's any good, linkffn(Potters against the World) does exist. Gabrielle is also involved though.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
