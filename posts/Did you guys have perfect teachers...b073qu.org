I've seen so many comments that some Hogwarts teachers are awful and realistically should have been fired (usually Snape, but a lot of people point out Binns, Umbridge, Lockhart, and others).

Sure, you may go for broke and fix everything in your fix-it fic. That can be pretty satisfying and I have no problem with that. I'm just skeptical that OBVIOUSLY any competent headmaster would immediately fire those teachers in any realistic/rational character fic.

Look, I had the privilege to grow up in what's considered one of the best American school districts. Nevertheless, I had teachers who I would rank right along with Snape and Binns. But but but--Snape ABUSES the kids! Surely one of the more loving teachers or students would have spoken up?? Yeah, and my geometry teacher happily targeted and tormented kids in class and made them cry on a regular basis. Did any of us go running to the principal? Not that I'm aware. As far as I know, she carried on like this until retirement at a ripe old age.

The canon teachers are entertaining cause they're relatable to the teachers that actual students encounter. I'm sure if you think about it, you can remember your teachers, including a "strict and competent" McGonagall, a dry-as-toast lecturer Binns, and so on.

EDIT: it has been fascinating to hear about people's similar/different school experiences around the world. Thanks guys, I've really enjoyed this!


** lockhart would've been great to have had in school. he's like the lvl 500 version of the teacher that goes on a long tangent about a story from his youth until the clock suddenly chimes and the lesson ends. and somehow he's surprised every time it happens.

I always assumed that OWLs and NEWTs were exempt from Dumbledore's "no end of year exams" declaration; only because the school doesn't set them. An outside testing board comes in and proctors the exams. In particular, cancelling OWLs messes with the 5th year students because they need to get certain grades to move on to NEWT level classes the next year. NEWTs create a different problem in that most professions appear to require NEWTs in certain subjects; but it'd be much more feasible to just postpone NEWTs, whereas postponing or cancelling OWLs creates more logistical problems.

***** I wouldn't it put it past Dumbles to do that to graduating students if he thought it was worth it. He hired Lockhart and condemned an entire year of students to his teaching, after all. If he cancelled the exams at school, the students would still have the opportunity to arrange their own exams with the Ministry.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][From Pottermore's bio page on Lockhart:]]

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that ‘there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.

He loves being an entertainer and having an audience to brag about his family or tell tales about whatever bullshit he can imagine.

** I went to a state school in the UK. It was a good school, but still your average comp.

I had some AMAZING teachers. I had some teachers I hated at the time but looking back were excellent. I had a handful of truly awful teachers.

Two stand out in particular. A maths teacher who would put all our test scores on the board and point out I had the lowest every time, enjoyed putting me on the spot and humiliating me on front of the class, And ended up leaving me with a severe anxiety around maths that I still have to this day. Another was an NQ history teacher who was still stuck in her cool girl phase. I was good at history but for some reason she just took a personal dislike to me and would make up rules to punish me, isolate me from the class, just generally be rude. By this point I was older so didn't care as much - it actually became a running joke in my class. I remember once she stormed out for no apparent reason and someone just quitely went "god flo, how could you do that." She always gave me low grade and then one day she had a go at me for something stupid and I just walked out. Went straight to my head of sixth and said "I am not being taught by her anymore, move me to another class." He did, and then my grades shot up and I went on to do history at uni.

The thing is, both of those teachers have gone on to advance in their careers. I know both of them had complaints put against them, but in general they performed well in observed lessons and got their students through the exams. It's hard to sack a teacher, and to be honest a vast majority of complaints are probably from the parents of absolute nightmare children who feel they are being treated unfairly but aren't. When I look back, yes my maths teacher was unfair, but I never paid attention and frequently didn't do my homework. My history teacher, by all accounts, was popular in the staff room and helped a friend of mine out through a really difficult time.

Then of course we had absentee teachers. My drama teacher used to frequently not turn up, so we taught ourselves. I know she was put under disciplinary action but at the end of the day she had mental health issues and strong union representation.

The only teacher I knew to get fired was my form tutor, Mr cooper. Oh Mr cooper, you were not meant for teaching. Who knows what the final straw was for you? Maybe it was when your students turned up to the exam and realised they had been studying for the wrong paper, so all but two of them failed. Maybe it was the complaints that instead of teaching them, you just put Shrek on. Not once, but several times a term. Maybe it was when the head teacher expressly told you that you could not take your students on a school trip, but you secretly did so anyway, taking them white water rafting without any insurance. Maybe it was because you left one of them there.

Whatever it was I hope you are living it up on that cruise ship you work on now.

** Okay, let's try to analyze this realistically (at least from a middle class American perspective).

Binns is a parody of the coach who's required to teach /something/, so he teaches history. He lectures straight from the book, and no one really learns anything. I had one like that who was actually fairly engaging, but he also literally gave us the answers to the tests under the guise of a "study guide," and he wasn't the only teacher in the school who did that. Realistic, except that he should have been forcibly retired when he died on general principle. Muggle schools tend to have pretty strict retirement ages.

Lockhart is a fraud who didn't know the material. His students might think he's entertaining during the school year, in a muggle school, he would have been fired after his first year after half his students flunked the standardized tests. Realistic inasmuch as he probably wouldn't have been fired before the year was up.

Umbridge is a career bureaucrat who has the +school board and mayor+ Ministry on her side and is strictly teaching to the curriculum. She is a symptom, not the disease. In the muggle world, she'd get letters of complaint, but she wouldn't get sacked until and unless her actual crimes came out. Realistic in the larger context of the corruption going all the way to the top.

Snape is very intelligent, but not good at teaching, and appears not to like teaching or children. In the muggle world, a chemistry teacher with his accident rate would have been fired or forced to change subjects, but that might not be a fair comparison to Potions class. Insulting his students, verbally abusing them, making them cry, ignoring Hermione's need for medical attention in Book 4. All that might have gotten him some letters, but probably wouldn't be enough to fire him, unless some kid recorded him ranting, and it went viral. Unfair punishments, if they could be proved, might get him a reprimand, and if they happened often enough and went on long enough, it might be enough to push him over the edge, but that would be a hard sell. So...honestly, borderline, but not for the usual reasons.

Trelawney is half-faking it, but in a subject so subjective that it might as well be Art by muggle standards, so it's hard to judge her there. However, she is also a drunk, and that would /definitely/ get her in trouble and plausibly fired, so I'm going with unrealistic on this one.

Hagrid's safety record is...probably not as bad as it's made out to be. In fact, it's probably /better/ than Kettleburn's, who was constantly on probation. However, he's not fully qualified, so in a muggle school, he never would have been higher in the first place. Unrealistic, but for a different reason than usual.

I think the real complaint here is that Hogwarts is supposed to be the best school of magic in the world, but with teachers like these teaching core classes, it sure doesn't feel like it is. An world-renowned private boarding school that strives for excellence ought to be able to get a full set of good teachers, and Hogwarts looks to be struggling on that count.

He just gave us “cute” nicknames. And also touched and complimented us a LOT.

“BuT tHeY wErE bEiNg FrieNDLy!

** I had one music teacher/musical director who was a hardass, and while he never yelled or physically touched any student, he was a tough critic who singled out the slower students to the point of bullying. He had favorites and encouraged kids to critique each other, as harsh as possible, "because that's how you learn". This teacher was never disciplined because he was very talented and nurtured/coached his favorite kids into winning competitions, and they said that he was a decent guy once he winnowed out the uncommitted.

However, that was many years ago. If you take educational training courses for secondary education in this day and age, you'll have to go through seminars, background checks, workshops, conferences, and progress evaluations. If you don't deliver outcomes on a yearly basis, you will have superiors breathing down your neck. You will have parents making an outcry for little to no reason, like their kid not getting a form signed is /your/ fault. You will have coworkers side-eyeing you because if you don't have tenure or seniority, poor outcomes lead to being shoved off at the end of a year, to a worse school district filled with problem kids.

The difference between fictional magic boarding school and modern day schools is, imho, parental involvement. In fiction, parents and authorities need to be kept out of the way to allow kids to have adventures. IRL, child safety is the top priority, parents believe their child is a snowflake, and treat them as children at 17-18, when in magical society, a wizard or witch would be considered a full-fledged adult.

I think a lot of it has to do with parental expectations. Maybe if the kid whines that their geometry teacher sucks, the parent is like "yeah so did mine, so what?"

**** Standardized tests are just a minimum of performance in some areas. Living in any place where the number of positions at "good" schools is tiny in proportion to the number of people with degrees in education will cause schools to be very picky about filling places. People can be replaced easily, the market is competitive, which is hugely different to the wizarding world, which has a limited population, of that, few academics and scholars capable and willing to be teachers.

Hogwarts' lenience on the quality of its teachers has a lot to do with how difficult it is to fill vacant positions. The DADA position has eaten through its teachers since 1957 (34 professors at the start of Harry's first year), and how many other people could teach Potions, other than Snape, Slughorn, and possibly Dumbledore himself?

That's one of the issues I see with people and Fix-It fics applying modern standards and logic to the wizarding world of the 1990's. The circumstances and situation are totally different. Have parents send letters to Dumbledore and Snape about the teacher professionalism, and they just read them and do nothing about it, because what else can they do?

** Preach. My kindergarten teacher locked a friend of mine in the closet for dawdling over his assignment, then went to lunch and left him there. (Poor American school district.)

My first grade teacher died, and the substitute was used to teaching fifth grade... and kept trying to feed fifth grade material to first graders (that went well).

The gym teacher screamed in students' faces for the slightest mistake. Not every small child is an elite athlete who is motivated by that... some of us honestly didn't know which order to run around the bases in and burst into tears.

My fourth grade teacher had taught my older brother, hated him, and never hid her disdain for me from day one--- I couldn't possibly be anyone but my brother's clone in her mind.

--------------

Fast forward to my father getting a promotion and my family moving to an elite school district. Every one of those teachers actually was amazing.

--------------

Fast forward to another promotion, another move, and my parents slapping me in a private school.

One teacher was so unable to control the class that she couldn't physically keep the students in the room. They'd just leave and stand in the hall and chat. No one made it stop. Didn't learn much Latin that year...

Another teacher didn't bother to read the AP French syllabus and taught us from the wrong books so we had no chance on the test. I went to college and had to beg the head of the French department to give me a chance at the higher level classes... my test score reflected my not having had the opportunity to read Pierre et Jean, not my inability to understand French.

A third teacher would sit with teenage girls on his lap, hands perilously close to going under their skirts.

** Growing up with HP books, I found all the teachers extremely relatable. I had my fair share of Flitwicks (those were the best), McGonagalls, Lockharts and Binnses. And Snapes, yes. My Technical Drawing teacher (why the fuck did we even have Technical Drawing in highschool?) constantly underscored and picked on me because she was best friends with my aunt's mother-in-law, and that woman hated our side of the family with passion. That resulted in me refusing to put any effort in my work, which fueled her insults even more.

At Uni, we had that one Professor who was extremely knowlegeable and good at her subject, but loved to play favourites at random, and her attitude towards other students ranged from dismissive to outright bullying. Like Snape, she was very well-spoken, sarcastic and could bring students to literal tears with a few contemptuous remarks.

I'm not from the US or Western Europe, and it's extremely hard to get a teacher fired where I'm from, unfortunately. I only know about a computer studies teacher from my former school who had an affair with a 16 y.o and got fired, but then he was hired by another school, got fired again for sending pervy texts to schoolgirls, and now he is teaching in yet another school.

Anyway, I think that having all the teachers at Hogwarts be wholesome and competent and supportive would make for a very boring read, regardless of how realistic/unrealistic it would be.

** My English/French teacher in grade 9 was fired for grabbing students. There was a lot about her that didn't seem right throughout the year but that's officially why she was fired. There was also my grade 7 math teacher (who was not qualified to teach math and gave me 4% on a unit test because I missed the whole unit and he made me write the test anyway) who my class tormented enough that he retired two years later, but... that's different. And my grade 1 teacher who made me do grade 2 work, yelled at me for doing grade 2 work, and generally stressed lil baby me so much that I started chewing on my hair.

Other than them, I had a lot of great teachers, but also a lot of teachers who might have been unprofessional if they weren't so generally likeable. I had teachers who would talk back to the students in the same tone that students would talk back to them, but since it felt like they were playing around, it wasn't hurtful.

Personally, I think Snape is an interesting, flawed character, but I would square up with him if he was real. His ‘bravery' is commendable, but that doesn't mean that his actions as a teacher are excusable. He should NEVER have been allowed to be around students. So no, I didn't have perfect teachers, but I can say with confidence that the schools I went to would have never allowed that inexcusable behaviour and abuse of students if they had known it was happening.

** During my teacher training I had the wonderful joy of being paired with a teacher, who reminded me of Snape. He insulted students, he screamed, he had high expectations of students but told them in the same breath that they couldn't reach them, he was a ticking time bomb (no warnings just straight to shouting), he clearly hated his job and the students.

He hated me even more because the students liked and prefered me (very easy to do just be nice, treat them as human beings and don't mock them when they have problems following). This man sat in the back of my lessons and loudly mumbled how shit my lessons were and that I was teaching the students wrong things. Which confused the kids and made them scared of participating in my lessons as the man was a ticking time bomb and they were trying to protect me from his wrath.

​

Well he once mentioned in the staff room that he would gladly hit his children at home so I called child services on him and they followed up with a check up, especially because his children's teacher said that his daughter once mentioned that her father would hit her. When they asked him questions he lost his temper and now has to do anti-aggression training. They also spread doubt on him being allowed to teach.

** Honestly, people on this subreddit have some unreal standards for all manner of things. Whenever anything falls short of these ideal utopian heights, they're all up in arms. I don't know if it's because they're that idealistic or just insanely sheltered.

They rail about how bad Snape is, but compared to some IRL teachers that I've heard of, Snape is pretty tame.

I can count at least 3-4 teachers from school and college who were exactly the same as Binns - they'd just drone on and on and have next to minimal interactions with the class.

I've had teachers who were more or less like Lockhart in the way that they had no idea what the hell they were doing.

I've had teachers take two hour long lectures on topics (stuff that I painstakingly took notes for) only to announce at the end of class that that stuff is out of syllabus and was just something interesting. I've had points deducted from me for challenging (challenging in as polite a manner as I could anyway) chemical names of compounds. I've had teachers who'd show up drunk/drank on the job. And the teachers who made girls cry with snide remarks, there were enough of those.

Granted I don't think I've ever had anyone as bad as Umbridge, but I have read about similar cases in the newspapers. By similar, I don't mean punishing students to carve themselves up - I mean punishing students so harshly that they faint and so on.

At the same time, I've had some absolutely brilliant teachers as well.

As far as I know, she carried on like this until retirement at a ripe old age.

** I'm Norwegian, though from the relatively middle of nowhere, and here are some highlights of terrible teachers I've had.

*Swimming teacher:* didn't care what level you were at, you were going to do the tasks assigned to you or die trying. Why wasn't he fired? Because the school covered for him on the grounds that there were no other teacher that could teach it. He was finally fired 5 years after I left primary school. To add some context here. I've got a 1/3 lung capacity and he forced me underwater even though I barely made it back up again. Nobody liked him, student or parents.

*Middle School Social science/Geography/History teacher:* Takes whoever explains first's side. No matter the fact that it was 100% illogical.

*Middle School Science/Math teacher:* He taught the A and C groups of Math and English, they averaged your grade between Math and English and put you into a group for it. Now, for the C group he barely did anything. Showcased one example upon entering a new topic and then here's your tasks for the week. He also was pretty biased towards his homeroom class, giving them the benefit of the doubt and even giving them answer sheets of his tests.

Compare that with my GED math teacher last year and we got showcased tasks for the first math class of the week and usually the second to last one as well. Depending on how things went. Odd how most people there got a lot higher grades, which we even saw in that year as we had substitutes and on the test we had there most of us plummeted 2-3 grades. Only one went down 1 grade and he'd been sick for most of that period and doing self study work at home instead.

*High School First Year Economy teacher:* 2 students of 20 managed to do any sort of work after August. Didn't consider showing how to do any problems calling the rest of the class morons. But our class used up the schools goodwill on getting our Norwegian teacher exchanged with another one. Then we get around to April/May, and we get the second year teacher for a while. Suddenly we all understand it while the 2 'prodigies' barely manage to keep up. She stopped teaching the next year. Odd that.

​

So, does bad teacher = firing, no. But it's definitely something a school should think about. That swimming teacher had had complaints going back to when my oldest sibling was in that school. So it wasn't unknown but the school and possibly the district worked to keep the status quo. I'll note that most people from said district considers it one of the more corrupt ones. Now take from that what you will.

A history teacher in my first high school was fired after grabbing a student and hitting them upside the head. Teachers and students *did* speak up. What makes you think Dumbledore would have listened to people speaking out against Snape? Snape was a useful tool.

I never had a teacher threaten to poison my pet. I never had a teacher insult my appearance. I never had a teacher refuse to help after seeing a student assaulted (fights were frequent in my middle and high school). My teachers never threw away my work in front of me refusing to grade it because they didn't like me.

** I have a theory about why people despise Snape so much. Think about the who average Harry Potter fan is. Western, attending school when the series was coming out, nerdy. And what happens to nerdy kids at school? They get bullied. And it's not just the nerdy ones -- lots of kids get bullied or do the bullying, and then feel guilty about it.

So this means that bullying is a subject that is not only extremely relatable to the average HP fan, but often touchy as well. Especially when perpetrated by a teacher -- someone in a position of authority who is supposed to prevent the bullying in the first place.

But, let's take a look at other things Snape did. Like, betray a homicidal megalomaniac /to his face/. Snape could have been captured, brutally tortured, and killed at any time during at least several years. He played a desperate role and arguably, without him, Harry, Hermione, and Ron would have lost the war and been brutally tortured and killed themselves.\\
You'd think that would carry more weight than they bullying. Especially since Snape was bullied himself -- bullied so much, in fact, that Sirius nearly killed him /as a joke/. Funny, huh?

But, here's the problem. Who actually experienced that? Who was almost murdered by their bully in school? And who faced a Voldemort, tricking him, while knowing their death was only inches away? Who sacrificed their life for a memory? No one. And so Snape's positive contributions -- while extremely impactful from a plot perspective -- are absolutely unrelatable. While his negative contribution carries so much more weight because it's something lots of people personally went through.

Tl;dr People relate more strongly to things they've personally experienced, therefore bullying carries more weight than winning a war/facing a death eater.

But then I thought about it from a perspective of emotional distance. People relate more strongly to events they've personally experienced. And while many have been confronted by bullying, few can claim the hardships Snape lived through. So naturally, the bullying is assigned a higher gravity. It's a subconscious decision rooted in the inherent safety and comfortability of our lives, where the largest “danger” often comes from a bully in the school yard.

Also I don't think Snape was trying to expell Remus for being sick specifically, he clearly didn't know about him being a werewolf, or why would he knowingly go inside the Shrieking Shack on a full moon? It's Sirius's actions that would cause Remus's expulsion or even execution if Snape was killed or turned.

James saving Snape from the situation his friends created and that would cause them great trouble otherwise wasn't that noble of a deed, but a thing any person with an ounce of a common sense who is not a psychopath would do. Especially since James as an animagus wasn't in danger of Remus himself.

Lily stopped being friends with Snape because of calling her a Mudblood, and generally heading down the wrong path. We don't know about him bullying anyone in his Hogwarts days, beyond retaliating to the Marauders. Nothing in what he did at that point justified trying to kill him. And let's be honest here, the Marauders didn't bully Snape for his bigotry. They started it from the moment they laid eyes on Snape when they were 11, and it escalated from there.

  ‘What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?' demanded Snape.

There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?' ‘He's ill,' said Lily. ‘They say he's ill --'

  ‘Every month at the full moon?' said Snape.

  ‘I know your theory,' said Lily, and she sounded cold. ‘Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?'

  ‘I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.'

  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.

  ‘They don't use Dark Magic, though.' She dropped her voice. ‘And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there --'

Through this conversation, there is no way Snape didn't figure out Remus is a werewolf if Hermione figured it out in third year.

I do agree with you that the Marauders weren't exactly beacons of perfection though.

Snape didn't exactly wanted Remus executed, but he did want to expose him. I think the execution was sort of my own deduction, since considering that Buckbeak was to be executed for attacking Malfoy, if Remus actually did bite Snape Remus would most definitely be executed.

And Snape's resentment in this scene is totally understandable. He was almost killed, but it was completely swept under the rug, and everybody continued to think that the Marauders were such great guys. That situation was probably one of the big reasons that contributed to Snape becoming a DE.

Anyway, this is why I mostly avoid reading fics set in the Marauders era altogether. If they aren't justifying every bad decision Snape ever made, they are spinning the Marauders (usually minus Peter) as the greatest group of friends ever who did nothing wrong, and that dirty Snivellous totally asked for it anyway.

I've had teachers that were jerks and even some that made kids cry, but what they did was at least connected to the material or classroom behavior. I can't see arbitrary harassment based on personal grievances being tolerated in most instances.

I'm sure there are examples of teachers that bad that have remained employed, but generally I think both of them cross the line.

Many of the teachers were unprofessional in their dealings with pupils, i.e. outright bullying some while showing favouritism to others, among a number of other unseemly behaviours that I shan't name. But many more were polite, forthcoming, and driven to motivate others in the subject they loved.

Trelawney is pissed as a newt in class. That'd = instantly fired.

Hagrid didn't Graduate School. Wouldn't be allowed to hold a Teaching Post. That, and his idea of Safety is "What's safe for Hagrid" as he's fucking huge and could punch out the Troll from the first book, not "What's safe for students" and well... his illegal breeding for the Skrewts.

McGonagall isn't a bad teacher, after Flitwick and Dumbledore she's probably the best one we see, she's a shit head of house because she holds too many positions and can't properly give her house the support they need. You'd want her as a Teacher, just not as your head of house.

** Did I have teachers who obviously played favourites? Definitely. But abuse would never be tolerated at any of my schools. One teacher inadvertently humiliated one of my classmates when she failed an assessment and he was given a talking to and she was allowed to retake the internal, even though she had failed of her own fault. One of my friends was kicked out of a club for cursing out the teachers, but it was the teachers who were reprimanded for kicking her out in a rude and unprofessional way. Once my school got so many complaints about one teacher's incompetence that he was demoted to a relieving position the next year. Another was reprimanded by the deputy principal for ruining kids shoes by making them run in the mud and rain.

These are not everyday occurrences of course, but it gives you an idea about the standard teachers are held to at my schools. They are very nice public schools but certainly not the nation's best, which Hogwarts is meant to be.

Relating this back to the teachers - Hagrid and Snape would have been sacked for child endangerment and abuse, respectively. Now that I think of it, Hooch would be investigated for her recklessness with flying lessons. Fake Moody too, for performing Unforgivables in front of kids. Trelawney and Binns would depend on what kind of grades their student were getting over the years.

Obviously wizards aren't strong in administration or legislation at all, so Hogwarts would never be as strict as Muggle schools in the first place. But I was definitely disturbed by how much teachers got away with in HP just in the context of my own experiences.

Snape in the muggle world would be an ex-con and former member of an terrorist organization. He would never get hired as a teacher. The best he could get is to be hired by the government to be a spy in the terrorist organization.

Umbridge literally tortured students. I honestly doubt parents won't notice scars on their children's hands and not take legal action. Plus you need qualifications to be a teacher and if the government just assigns their leader's secretary to be a teacher there would be a media shitstorm of epic proportions.

** You know, people might also say that Snape didn't actually teach. My counter argument is that there's nothing much to teach except the basics. And, we didn't really see the basics in the book because: • We only got to see the first class in the book • It might have been in the text. Or some other reason.

Secondly, as [[/u/evolutionista][u/evolutionista]] referred to Slughorn, I'll give my views on his and Snape's teaching methods.

Slughorn asked them to identify the potions to get the class interested, and then told them to brew the Draught of Living Death,( if I remember correctly, a very difficult potion) out of the book.

~Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. ~

He gave no advice, as far as we can see, to anybody.

Snape, though he didn't ask them to identify the potions, held their attention and interest with a lecture. (And some snide remarks. They were interesting for me because I just love sarcasm. Maybe not interesting for Harry, sadly.) Anyway, he gave instructions on the board, most likely modified, as he didn't make them refer to the text. He also helped students, directly for Slytherins, and indirectly by ridicule for the rest. Though he did take the ridicule a bit far, that's not my point.

So...yeah. Sorry, it's too long.

*** Wasn't brewing Draught of the Living Death part of a competition? I don't think he would've helped anyone then. Not to mention Slughorn elaborated on each of the potions after they'd been identified, though it was more about their properties than how to make them:

#+begin_quote
  “Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room--oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . .
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “It's liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”

  The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.

  “Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off. ”

  “Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.

  “Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally. . . ”

  “Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.

  “Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days. ”
#+end_quote

Slughorn was encouraging to his students, and liberal with praise - if a bit concerningly generous with the kind/amount of information he gave out. His first class was several times more engaged than we ever see with Snape. If he wasn't so negligent and biased against students like Ron (especially when he sat right between two of his most-praised students - Harry and Hermione) he could have been stellar.

*** We only saw Slughorn teach at the highest levels, though. By that point, all the students in the class had demonstrated mastery of the basics in their OWL exam, and he was preparing them for even more rigorous testing.

If one were to compare Potions to something like chemistry, then at that level I would expect some degree of lecturing, a lot of assigned reading and perhaps at-home exercises and prep work, and then an in-class lab (or in-class potion, in this case) that was largely unassisted by the instructor, the results of which would constitute a significant portion of the grade.

It's not really fair to compare Slughorn's approach to teaching advanced students to Snape's approach to teaching novice students. That said, I think we agree that in terms of classroom management, Snape maintained a much more hostile climate and favored humiliation and terror as a disciplinary and instructional tool. They both played favorites, but Slughorn favored individual merit (even over family connections and wealth) and rewarded successful students with his attention and networking opportunities and simply withheld his good favor from less promising pupils, while Snape empowered his preferred bullies and personally relished terrorizing the “easy targets,” and was equally indifferent to the education of disfavored students whether they were academically gifted like Hermione or struggling like Neville.

The Hogwarts teachers are exaggerated portrayals of recognisable in teacher character types. The characterisation in the early books is dramatic, often to the point of gentle parody. Hogwarts is anachronistically lawless and divided, which allows these dramatic portrayals.

Some teachers you click with and you have a wonderful, others make a year hell. I could name names and tell stories, but I don't want anyone getting doxed.

One thing that really shaped my school career was how my teachers dealt (or didn't deal) with my learning disabilities. Some teachers would work with me and what I needed, others would say I was making it up. Over the years I learned to advocate for myself and by the time I was 14 and heading off to high school, I had enough confidence in myself, and I knew my parents had enough confidence in me, that I stood up for myself and didn't let teachers (or other students) bully me any more.

But before that? When I was young and very naive? I had a few truly horrible teachers that if I could talk to them today, I'd tell them /exactly/ how I felt.

Did any of the teachers I complained about get fired? No, but they certainly got a ding on their record, and I may have made myself unpopular, but I didn't particularly care. I never got along with the popular kids anyways, and the Anime Club kids were always happy to see me.

** The argument that you shouldn't complain because others have also had it bad, and you might have had it bad when you were a kid and YOU didn't complain is a tired and incorrect one.

Firstly, fanfiction is and always has been written as a desire to fix things or alter things or even just exist in the space that the writer enjoys. It's not unrealistic to want the things that you see that are fixable to be fixed.

Secondly, sure, they're good characters to read about. But they're also laughably bad at their jobs, some of them, and it's not some slur on the face of the original author of the whole book series to say that. I mean, the tv show Pete and Pete had the same constructs--nearly every adult in the entire series was laughably bad at something, and it was usually their jobs.

I went to a terrible school district. It was in a shit poor neighborhood and when I was 18 and had a job if I missed the bus my mom had to come get me because none of my coworkers dared drive there at night. Our superintendent let really terrible ideas through in a vain attempt to make things better, and one of the results was that in sixth grade, every student was placed in a class based on their prior grades, with all the 'best' kids in one class, so on and so forth through five homerooms. They didn't make this a secret, and it did a lot of damage to the psyches of the kids who did their best and were still in the 'worst' homeroom. They didn't even give the 'best' class students one of the worst teachers, and they were the only class of the five that got to do animal dissections.

Your point is somewhat valid--regular schools allow terrible teachers to teach. It's not unheard of. But a cinematic and literary universe doesn't *have* to follow those rules, and fanfiction certainly does not.
