Stories where they're watching Harry and other events in the Wizarding World through the HP series after their deaths, maybe with Sirius and Remus joining them as time goes on. Pls and thanks!

  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"
