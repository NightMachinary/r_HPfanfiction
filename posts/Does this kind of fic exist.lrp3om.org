Is there such fic where Harry is both the biological son of both James and Severus, and that makes him have two biological fathers?


** I can think of one at the top of my head. It's a fic where Harry went back in time, and James and Severus are his fathers. The major drawback is that 60% of the characters are bashed.

*** Not to mention that the author seemed to forget, for a large portion in the middle, that it was a time-travel before suddenly bringing that aspect back into it.
