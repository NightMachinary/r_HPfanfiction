:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it may have been a time travel fic. Sirius had already joined Voldemort and they swapped him for Trelawney, who was under some variation of the imperius curse, after they figured out Dumbledore wanted Sirius to die. I also think Harry may have given his blood willingly in the ritual and said something like “Blood of an ally, willingly given”. I can only remember bits and pieces but it was good so I want to read it again. Any help at all in finding the fic would be appreciated :)


** Lmao I read that fanfic too! I'm so frustrated rn, I can't remember the fic either.
