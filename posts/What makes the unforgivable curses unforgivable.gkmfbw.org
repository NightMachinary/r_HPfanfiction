Sure they do terrible things but other things can kill torture and enslave you. Love potions for example can brainwash too but don't have that same reputation. I know for example with crucio you have to want to cause pain. But that can also be true if you use a different spell.

I know its not quite explained in the books so I was wondering what theories and headcanons people have for what sets the unforgivables apart. Its fine if its not your own and you've seen it in a fic or something and really liked the idea.

  *What makes the unforgivable curses unforgivable?*
#+end_quote

Legal fiction. I'm not even kidding. For all we know, only the Ministry of Magic for the United Kingdom categorises these three curses as 'unforgivable'. You know why? Because of the Unforgivable Curses Act of 1717. That was a national law, not an international one.

You can kill someone with a number of spells, some taught to first-years. You can torture with potions and jinxes if not the simple Muggle way. You can manipulate someone's act with magical contracts/vows, compulsion charms and potions. Of course, when it comes to the latter, nothing is as efficient as the Imperius Curse, but you simply have to find a way around that.

*** This seems most logical Its entirely possible too that these got super popular so Ministry outlawed them but then others got more popular and Ministry realized there were creative ways to accomplish the same things and didn't bother outlawing the different variations.

** I also think it is because of the fact that they are the only curses that cannot be blocked by magical shields like protego (in the books).

** It's because they are designed only for evil. For the Cruciatus you have to /want/ to cause pain, to enjoy another beings suffering. For the Imperius, you must want to subjugate someone utterly. For the Killing Curse, you have to hate.

It's not necessarily the effect that is unforgivable, but the fact that to function properly, the spells must be cast with pure malice. Diffindo can be used to torture, or it can be used to trim hedges. The unforgivables are one-trick ponies of evil.

**** i mean i understand the mechanism but there are curses literally created to cause the recipient nothing but pain. You for example clearly want to hurt someone if you use a degeneration curse on them. And you can do so while having the same intense intent that would allow you to use crucio . Yes Harry accidentally used something like sectumsempra and got ideal effects of the curse while he couldn't do the same with Crucio. But again someone like Bellatrix would use sectumsempra with the knowledge it was only used to torture and hurt someone and do so with the same intentions required for the cruciatus. So what makes crucio so much unforgivable in her hands than something like sectumsempra? Sure some of these curses are unknown to the ministry Death Eaters for example have loads of awful curses mentioned that likely are unknown to the mass public that are meant soley to be painful. But then why bother to have unforgivables at all and not just look at design of curse/spell and intent of individual?

** Short answer? They can't be blocked *magically*.

Longer answer: Because they work on emotions. You have to *really want* to murder someone to use the Killing Curse.\\
You have to really *want* to inflict pain to use Cruciatus correctly.\\
And for the Imperius, you have to have the iron will to corrupt someone else's will completely, to make them do *anything*.

*** But why is it so much worse to use a spell thats activated by those emotions rather than use a spell for the same intentions, ( to kill, torture or control) while having those exact same emotions, but just doesn't require those spells to be activated by those emotions and cam achieve the same results ( kill torture control)?

Well except for the magical blocking like what you mentioned. But it seems the mechanisms of getting that curse to work also has a strong effect on the classification too and it confuses me a bit. Why is just a act of it being activated by a negative emotion make it worse than being used while feeling and being guided by the same negative emotion.

**** Because it matters. There is a difference between first degree murder ans manslaugther. In law, intent is important. For the same cime you can get different punishments depending on premeditation, intent and many other things.

So when you use a killing curse that does that and only that, your intent is obvious. That's premeditated murder. But when you use a spell or a curse that could be used to incapacitate or some other purpose, there still remains the question of your intent. That is for the prosecution to prove and judge/jury to decide. Same with the other two. Torture curse only tortures. Imperius only subjugates.

Tldr: when you use unforgivables, there is no question of intent. You are guilty, period.

***** i suppose thats true but why use them at all then ? Killing curse you could argue is most efficient. But what about the others? Isnt this just a easy way for people to get away with premeditated murder with fewer consequences just by using a different spell? Say it wasn't my intention can't prove it if its not a unforgivable unless you use truth serum but i assume that isn't allowed normally.

Although i guess not premeditated you could in that moment decide to kill and have the necessary emotions to activate it. Doesn't require forethought.

****** Because if you want someone to do something they would otherwise not do and if you have no ethics, what better way to do it than with an Impreius? If you want to torture someone so completely that they feel beaten and hopeless, and would do anything to make the pain go away what better way than to use Cruciatus?

When you have no moral qualms (e.g Voldemort and Bellatrix) and no respect or fear of the law (e.g same), than why not use the most effective tools in a wizard's arsenal?

******* Yes but what about when you do fear being detained? Which most people do fear Azkaban. Pretty much everyone who isn't Voldemort or Bellatrix . So really its only a good idea for Voldemort or Bellatrix to use it pre Voldemorts takeover. And its not like people don't know what they did you didnt have to make these spells illegal to have grounds to toss em into Azkaban forever.

You are still capable of being just as malicious without these spells. Love potions brainwash you its a great legal alternative to imperio. For torture how do you know cruciatus is best method? Most efficient maybe but torture isn't supposed to be efficient i mean minus the killing curse isn't it all kinda redundant?

******** That unforgivables are illegal doesn't mean those other methods you mention are legal. Their legality depends on the intent behind their use and the results. Yes, you could use love potions to control someone. But that would be illegal. Not because you used love potions but because you acted to oppress someone's freewill. And a love potion couldn't be more effective than practically enslaving someone to your will. It leaves behind traces. It needs to be reaplied. And it doesn't make your target do what you want. It makes the target obsessed with you. Ron on HBP couldn't function as an effective agent. The girl he was obsessed with had undue influence on him, yes, but he wasn't an extension of her will. He couldn't even think straight to act. He was basically a puppy without a teeth.

** Here is an excerpt from a folder of lore that I create to establish consistency for my fiction:

#+begin_quote
  *The Ikias Magical Threat Classification*

  Coined and assembled by Chief Warlock Ikias Annudrian, it is the ministry standard for classifying and rating all magical spells. It usually flies under the radar to the general public, as they do not teach it in school systems. It isn't too important since the ones taught are levels 3 and below in Hogwarts. 

  Everyone is familiar with the level 5 spells, the unforgivables. Banned outright by the Ministry of Magic in 1717, for their ease of use and simple magical structure. The killing curse, imperious curse, and cruciatus curse accomplish their goals it too short of time with minor effort, save for intent (the cruciatus curse).

  Though unforgivables aren't the only spells classified level 5. Reason being as the term unforgivable might bring upon unnecessary notoriety and popularity. It's better that people are aware of the prime 3 unforgivables as one-way tickets to Azkaban.

** The only things i can recall as a possible rationale is that you have to truly hate in order to use the killing curse, you have to truly want to torture someone in order to use the cruciatus curse. And based on that it is supposed that this level of negative emotion twists your soul when you use them. Hence they being unforgivable eg the wizarding world doesn't like that stain..

We all know that a levitation curse can kill just as easily. Levitate someone a hundred feet up over some rocks then let them drop.

Yeah it's pretty crazy that you can use a love potion to make someone "fall in love" with you and have sex but that's considered no big deal but if you use the Imperio curse to do the same thing you're sent to Azkaban.

*** I don't know if you have to "hate" for the Killing Curse, you just have to intend the other person to end up DEAD. It's not like sending a cutting curse and accidentally catching them in the carotid or femoral artery so they bleed out. You intend them to die; you are not trying to wound or disable them so you can get away. That takes it out of the realm of self-defense into revenge at best, or murder at worst. The Cruciatus is straight-up torture: to successfully cast it is to admit you wanted that person to suffer unbearable pain. In the first war, even the Aurors needed a special law passed for them to be allowed to use the Killing Curse.

Also of note (which I've seen exploited in a few fics) is that Moody specifies in GOF chapter 14: "The use of any one of them *on a fellow human being* is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban" (emphasis mine). So you can use the Killing Curse to euthanize an animal (or, say, to fight off a Hungarian Horntail). It also means the law doesn't protect magical beings such as house-elves or creatures such as centaurs: only humans specifically.

why are these 3 curses singled out when, as Snape put it, the dark arts are a multiheaded, nefarious, and unending hydra monster thing?
