** Hey, I read it all, a couple points I wanted to bring up:

First, good job on the writing. I would have wanted to see more of Snape's feelings through his facial expressions, not just his dialogue.

Second, the ending didn't make sense in regard to Snape's character. He would not publicly announce the best person he knew was a "mudblood" in front of the entire Slytherin Common Room.
