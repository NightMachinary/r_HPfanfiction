Are there any good HP/PJO stories in which Harry is a demigod that are not DZ2's Twice Blessed challenges?

I'm looking for ones where Harry is still a male, and while I being straight prefer straight pairings if there is a pairing I'm ok with slash. Preferably no Twice Blessed Shenanigans.


** I think linkffn(13274956) fits your requirements? WIP but being regularly updated; there was a new chapter just ereyesterday.

** I'm not sure what it is about DZ2's stuff that I just innately dislike. Perhaps it's the format he/she posts his/her chapters as? (You know, the authors' notes that take up about 1/4th of a chapter in word-count and the constant reposts of the stories' summaries, or something?).

***** It's not a major issue. I've just always been bothered by gender swapping of characters. It always seems pointless and either adds nothing to the story or is just an excuse to make the character a Mary/Gary Stu, at least in my experience.

****** Yes well, dont worry, the characters of fem Harry in his stories are nothing like Harry at all. Like totally new people and it adds to the story . Give it a shot.
