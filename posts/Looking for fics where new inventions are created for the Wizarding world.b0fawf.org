Looking for fics where the main characters are also studying muggle subjects (or already have a lot of knowledge, though as 11 year olds you certainly wouldn't know everything) and they use their knowledge to invent something for the Wizarding world. This Sherlock Holmes crossover (a study in magic by books for change) is one example, they invent a sort of mobile phone using the Floo network as a base linkffn(7578572)


** linkffn(The Arithmancer) series mostly focuses on Hermione inventing spells, but since she also learns some muggle chemistry there's quite a few mixed inventions later on. Examples include laser charms, spells to rearrange molecules for all kinds of purposes, and soul magic rituals to destroy Horcruxes.

linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This?) has a Nerd thrown into the HP universe, with canon knowledge. Not very serious. Wacky inventions including a flying MURICA camper van.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

** Linkao3(Disillusion by Hermione Granger by Esama). Will the bot work in this case?

It is a one shot set in an AU. I can't disclose any more without giving spoilers. But, it does deal with inventions.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
