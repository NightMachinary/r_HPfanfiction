#+TITLE: I'm sure we've all seen a ton of fanfics use the concept of a Magical Aura™ that appears around powerful magicals and measures their strength. Firstly, how do you feel about the concept, and secondly, to not have it be a very shallow power measure for Harry, how could it be actually explained?

** I think a variation of it seems fitting. Not something that literally measures their strength, though - but having extremely high concentration of magic /warp/ the air around them slightly, a more extreme version of the way magic fries electronics?

Well, I kinda like that - where it's a sign of power, not a measure of it.

It's used like that in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), where the most powerful magic users (called mages there - people like Flamel, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc) have that sort of aura if they don't reign in their magic. It can make them feel like strange, inhuman figures - and I think is fairly well done.

I think anything that puts a concrete number to scale it off of is not a particularly good system - it loses a lot of the charm in that, and often is just a lazy way to just say that character X is stronger than Y. But it can be used well in a descriptive manner

** I always have it either as a bit of a parlour trick that isn't at all hard, or a hereditary thing that is either like tongue curling kind of thing like super not a huge deal but genetic.

So in canon Hermione's hair sparks when she's angry, and I have carried that through as like, the Blacks have always claimed that's a Black trait (a la Bellatrix) and they sort of get away with it because they intermarry with so many lines, but then Hermione does it and Draco freaks out because she's muggleborn.

I'm not particularly strong with cellular biology but I always think of the spark hair or aura flex as something cellular, like your skin cells leak Magic? but who the fuck knows how that would work lmao

** What makes a magical person different from a nonmagical person is that their soul is capable of reaching out and claiming parts of the surrounding world, and altering those parts to the person's liking. The part of the world that's been claimed by a magical person's soul is that person's aura. Accidental and wandless magic are rapid alteration of the contents of an aura, but most alterations are much slower and subtler "passive" magic in order to save energy and avoid causing confusion. Hogwarts is so strange because centuries of students have all layered passive magic after passive magic on it.

The "proud to have a witch in the family" attitude Lily's parents had is the remnants of a genetic instinct from before there were wands or the Statute, when things just kept going better in the presence of magical people, and so nonmagical people in the same communities tended to be more successful. As a result, an instinct to be friendly with magical people in order to exploit passive magic was selected for. Because of recessive genes, Petunia didn't inherit this instinct, and was resentful of not being the favorite child.

Under this system, wands work mostly by resonating with the soul and directing it to claim far away things in a certain direction, at the expense of range in all other directions. When you point a wand at a matchstick, you're telling your soul that it should prioritize including the matchstick in your aura over including, for example, the air behind your back. But also your wand helps your soul understand your words and gestures as requests for specific magical effects.

If you want to write OP!Harry, say that the killing curse disrupted the anchoring of his soul to his body, so it's able to reach further from him, and his aura is bigger than it ought to be. But this piece of magical theory is just as interesting without this detail.
