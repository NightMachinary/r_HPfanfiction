I just finished Irish216's /Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum/, which is complete...except for the lack of an epilogue.

Looking for (preferably) large AUs that are complete. Send help before I'm committed to St. Mungos for being heartbroken from reading too many incomplete stories. The fact I managed to go through his two big stories in four days probably means I should be committed anyways.


** even though there's a steep decline in quality after the first half this is one of the most extensive AUs that I've ever read and the world building is pretty great:

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** My story "Patron" is an AU, and complete. Another long AU story of mine, "Divided and Entwined", should be complete in one and a half weeks - two more updates left.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
