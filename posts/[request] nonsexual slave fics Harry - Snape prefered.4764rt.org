Do they even exist? Googling it seems to mainly be Harry/Snape sexual slavery fics, but I read one incomplete were Harry gets Snape as an inheritance after year 1 and was wondering if there is anything more similar out there? Or were Snape maybe becomes a slave as part of an azkaban sentence after the battle of Hogwarts?

EDIT:

I guess I just thought there would be some kind of nonsexual slavery fics out there. I just wasnt in the mood for like porn geez.

Also, if there are other pairings out there that would be interesting , too. Just, I guess I think of it as a character study? What if ... but I didnt want to see any dingly bits ;)

Thx for trying lol. :D


** There is one I know off. Slave child. However, Harry is the slave (not sure if that's what you were looking for?) and its more of a mentor fic tbh. A lot of angst and comforting going on.

** linkffn(2896200) sounds like the one you're looking for. Enslaved linkffn(2806184) is completed and by the same author. The only other nonsexual slave fic I can think of (other than Slave Child) is Better Angels linkao3(Better Angels) .
