Looking for a maurauders era fic where either James or Lily are a beauxbatons/durmstrang student and transfers to Hogwarts in their final year.\\
I've read Tender Fire ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177896/1/Tender-Fire]]) which I absolutely LOVE but it only had four chapters and hasn't been updated for over three years.\\
Please recommend some good fics.
