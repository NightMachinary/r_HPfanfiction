Not slash, so basically a Harry pairing but I'm tired of reading from Harry's POV so if there's something with the girls POV in it too, that'd be amazing!!

I love drama, I love angst, I LOVE adventure. I want something that more than just romance.

I really love canon Harry so I'm hoping for something that sticks to his canon self as much as possible (Gryffindor, nice/kind, friends with Ron and Hermione) but if there's something good that doesn't fit this then rec it anyway!

Im not too crazy about Slytherins so if there's one where he's paired with a girl from either Gryffindor or the other houses, that'd be better. Though, from what I understand Harry/Daphne is a popular pairing so if you have any good Haphne ones I'd love to check it out!

No Harry/Hermione pls and no Weasley bashing :)
