**** I've been doing a similar thing, I wrote a little python script that strips the entire story from ff.net but then I have to format it in word etc to make it work (easier than writing formatting though tbh).

***** Unfortunately I don't know anything about scripts or formatting lol The downloader they shared works very well and quickly, my problem is I don't think any of the available formats can be opened in word. Not too big of a problem though; at least I can read the stories when my shitty internet is out.

Err, good luck with that. ffnet doesn't make it easy. I can scrounge up some fics for you anyway. I'll apologize ahead of time that I'm not a fan of dark harry or good voldemort, so I don't have any of those to offer. Instead these are mostly long, 100k word+, completed fics.

Ditto the Honestly Harry Series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2818448/Captain-Compass][Captain Compass]] which is entering year 4 now, as well as the Firebird Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] which is in the last book.\\
All four of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1490083/Matt-Silver-3k][Matt Silver 3K's]] fics are very good! especially incorruptible. That one and Breach are fairly dark.

There are a lot of other authors you should check out as well, such as [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Egankaifan][Gankaifan]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Edriftwood1965][Driftwoord1965]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ekb0][kb0]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Esprinter1988][sprinter1988]]. All of them tend to write longer fics and actually complete them.

** I loved The Black Heir and its sequel Vindico Atrum. They're both on ff.net. I'm sorry, I can't remember the author's name off the top of my head. Vindico isn't finished, but the author has promised recently that it won't be abandoned.
