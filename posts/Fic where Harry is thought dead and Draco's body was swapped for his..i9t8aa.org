Looking for a fic.

Most likely is H/G but is not necessarily the case.

The point that stands out in my memory is that Harry is believed dead. When his "body" was found it was strung up in Diagon Alley after being tortured, but in reality it was Draco's transfigured body, which was then subsequently buried by the burrow.
