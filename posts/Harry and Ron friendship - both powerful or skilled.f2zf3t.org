Looking for a fic without Hermione featuring too much. Harry and Ron have each other's backs and are both pretty powerful or skilled in their own right. Maybe brilliant synergy? But they work very well together

Lol someone has high standards.

Other than linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12656823/1/Granger-Who]]) when Harry and Ron are in 1st year, I can't think of much.

*EDIT: Linked wrong fic. Fixed.

  Hermione Granger was sorted into Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor. What do Harry and Ron get up to without her? Covers first year. Complete for now.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.
