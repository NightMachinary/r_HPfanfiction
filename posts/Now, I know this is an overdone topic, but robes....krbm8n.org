I have this very weird headcanon for everything in the Harry Potter universe. I'm mostly book in the interpretation of the Hogwarts robes, but I tend to go by the original illustrations for what robes look like in everyday wear. That is a judge out on the town or a geneva gown.

To me it makes more sense to imagine robes as a form of outerwear, that's more formal in nature, and modern wizards wear things under open robes. The Hogwarts uniform is this kind of ancient-traditional style because Hogwarts is all about tradition, like a lot of boarding schools. I mean they sell themselves as the premiere magical school in Europe. This could explain why school robes are specified because I don't believe they mentioned the colored trim in the books, even though it makes sense to be there. So Hogwarts school robes would be closed-front robes that you don't wear anything underneath, which is how Snape's underwear was shown when he was flipped upside down. Additionally, we can be fairly certain Harry didn't get any uniform clothes beside the robes, because he'd probably wear them instead of Dudley's cast-offs because he's always complaining about Dudley's clothes.

The closed-front thing likely carries over to dress robes, so Harry's dress robes would be a similar article of clothing to his school robes but emerald green and probably cut a bit differently. But everyday robes, based on the illustrations from every run of the book I've seen, have the robes being open in the front, like a geneva gown with more mundane clothes being worn underneath. Not sure if I'm misremembering, but I believe in the books that Tonks was wearing a Weird Sisters tee when Harry met her, but... as for what's worn under the robes, I imagine more formal wear, or possibly things similar to a cassock. Probably detachable collars on button-up shirts as a more modern fashion development. Simply because I can't imagine them still having ancient robes if they developed in fashion any further. Also, can you really imagine Lucius Malfoy without a cravat?

Since the worlds are kind of more integrated than is really let on, which we can see as in the first book wizards are celebrating the fall of Voldemort in a public muggle location. As well as having entrances to their main government facilities in a muggle bathroom. This allows wizards to live and walk among the mundane and just be seen as a bit weird, possibly working in the fashion industry. The ones who we see who really suck at muggle fashion are those who live in entirely magical or mostly magical rural areas. This is a subject where I have to move away from pure canon, as there is absolutely no way that wizards could go so unnoticed and actually maintain their secrecy if they were all so incredibly terrible at muggling. On the subject of muggle fashion, Fudge's bowler cap is great evidence. It's a mundane hat, literally every other hat mentioned is one of those stupid point hats.

Anyone else noticed how Fantastic Beasts ignored a lot of the previous series' costuming? I like it more honestly. It's much more, “they're wizards who live around muggles” than, “we're hack costume makers who only designed these to allow specific outfits to happen.”

Wizards who live outside muggle areas would tend to have the same issues with trying to match the culture that anyone has, the fact that looking in from the outside makes it look insane. If you look at all the varieties of clothes we wear, just in a single city block, it's an incredibly diverse selection. Even if wizards wear similar, but still noticeably different clothes, it's hard to match someone's fashion without looking weird.

I remember seeing someone comment that under closed front robes, wizards most likely wear long underwear, which makes a lot of sense to me. I'd say the main issue

I have is that a lot of the time, we try to make all the wizards dress the same with minor differences to separate them. When looking around us, we see an amazing variety of clothes in all sorts of styles surrounding us, all with their own unique stories. I can't imagine the wizarding world without trying to give them their own world. But the most important thing to me is to try to give the wizards a world within a world, that feels like we peeled back a layer of the mundane to find something more magical, not something so homogenous that we describe it all with the color of their robes. Where they get to be the Wizarding World, rather than feel like a Universal Studios attraction. I'd like to hear your thoughts since... well I overthought it a bit.

Sorry about the length TL;DR Let's talk about wizards clothes

Thanks for all the responses, it's great fun thinking about all these ideas.

***** Thanks. There are wizarding areas, if all the wizards lived and worked in them, they would be celebrating in those areas. They wouldn't go into the muggle world just to celebrate on the streets, they've got streets too. It's not a sign that all wizards live in the muggle world, but it at least points to wizards being around. Additionally, they're spread out in London, not all centered around Diagon Alley. We can see this with how the entrance to the ministry is in muggle London. I'm talking the employee entrance, which you enter through the toilets. St. Mungo's is in another place entirely. I'm not talking wizard and muggle world's overlapping completely, I'm trying to argue that in their daily lives they'll walk past each other.

** I was actually really upset in the movies when I saw Draco Malfoy in Half Blood Prince in a muggle suit. Him and his family are pureblood wizards that despise muggles and anything related to muggles which makes its hard to believe that he would wear a muggle suit.

It's one of the things that after the second movie (iirc) that they changed drastically, I think it may have to do with the fact that Chris Columbus stopped directing the movies. You'll notice that Harry's muggle clothes actually fit him in the third movie onwards. Its kinds sad, because clothing/fashion is one of the ways that the movies could have highlighted the differences between muggle and magical cultures.

** I actually like that the movies switched up the fashion a little bit. The Hogwarts uniforms are, imo, so much better in the movies than the plain, monk attire (with pointy hats) that canon implies.

Even movie [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/48/f6/0b48f6c7685a50e073a97a70cb02568c.jpg][Death Eater]] 'robes' were just an outerwear and they had shirts and pants underneath.

I would have liked to see some more Medieval/Ancient/Pagan elements on their clothing however, maybe just some patterns, or jewelry, idk.

** I haven't thought much on school robes, as I was heavily influenced in my idea of those by the films, but my opinion on non-uniform clothing is that most people just don't wear ‘robes' as we consider them at all.

The Statute of Secrecy went into effect in the late 17th century, so it is likely that ‘muggle' fashions of that time were considered fashionable by wizards as well. For men's clothing, I think that not much would have changed initially (a fashionable suit from 1680 is not drastically different from a suit from 1750), but that muggle style changes would filter in as they happened thanks to muggle born, but delayed by several decades (until those muggle born grew up and became the generation in power). Thus the regency-style tailored suit would become fashionable not in 1780-1830, but 1830-1850, and the more modern suite of the 1860s on would become popular around the turn of the 20th century. I think it is likely that during Harry's time, it would still be common for men to wear suits as the norm, though suits which would be slightly outdated, perhaps 1950s-60s (such as Fudge's pinstripe suit), though pure bloods may be even further behind.

Women's clothing, on the other hand, I see developing a separate style from the Muggle. Women's fashions tend to vary much more drastically and much more frequently. There are basically 4 overarching style periods in Men's clothing, spanning three centuries, whereas women's clothing can often be identified accurately to the decade, and sometimes even to the year, based on fundamental features such as silhouette.

Thus, I imagine that while men would wear suits that are at least superficially similar to muggles, women's fashions would be radically different.

I don't have an idea of exactly what would change, but I suspect there would be an even greater focus on impracticality among pure bloods---a dress that limits one's range of motion is of no concern to a witch, who can use her wand or her house elf to do any menial tasks, and thus does not need to have practical garments.

On the other hand, I suspect that for less traditionalist/less wealthy witches, practicality would feature even more prominently---a witch who practices dueling, for example, would not want to have clothing which would disadvantage her or provide an advantage to her opponent. Certainly the meter-wide crinolines seen on muggle royalty and aristocrats would be unconscionable in a duel. It is possible that some women may adopt trousers around the same time as men (the late 19th century), or that they would adopt the masculine breeches even before that. I cannot imagine there being nearly as much pushback against it as there was in the 1920s onward in the muggle world, given that wizarding society seems slightly more progressive on gender issues. Hogwarts admitted women long before muggle institutions founded in the same period (such as Oxford, which only began granting degrees to women in 1920), women held high-ranking public office before muggle women could even vote (if one accepts sources such as the Fantastic Beasts films and Pottermore), &c. (Despite this, I still imagine that some sexism remains, and that there are some areas in which wizards are less progressive than muggles)

As to Hogwarts uniforms, I don't think any of these fashion trends would apply; Hogwarts students wear a /uniform/, and like muggle schools such as Eton or even Smeltings, uniforms are less beholden to the whims of fashion. No man would wear bright-orange knickerbockers and straw hats as an adult (though perhaps some wizards may, assuming muggle clothing to be more different than it is), nor would they wear an Eton jacket except at specific functions where such is called for. These uniforms are quite old, and are kept as tradition; it is likely that the Hogwarts uniform is similar.

Nonetheless, I am not sure that robes would be the standard; Harry's school list calls for /work robes/, which implies that they may be something more akin to a lab coat than a uniform. Only the pointed hat is specified as being for day wear. It may well be that students are not required to wear the work robes at all times, that the list omits the basic uniform parts for some reason (perhaps an assumption that they will be provided by one's clothier without the need for specifics)---wizards are not renowned for logic, after all, so such an oversight is not entirely outrageous. The call for work robes specifies that 3 are required, whereas the number of uniforms needed may be up to the individual.

Alternatively, it may be that they do wear their work robes at all times, but that they are able to be opened to show the clothing underneath, or closed and worn without underclothes based on personal preference.

*** Wow, this is really well thought out. I love your thoughts on gender equality showing up in clothing. Because it makes since for the wizarding world, since magic is the great equalizer. Like guns, but with more applications. I think we'd see more similarity in fashion like male-female clothing in our world. They're technically the same items of clothing, but are cut very differently, to show off the aspects that men and women want to show off. With the level of gender equality that we're speculating about, I'd expect to see even more similarity. So quite possibly we'd have pants for witches arising well before pants for muggle women. But on the same note, practicality isn't really an issue for witches. Perhaps practical clothing would arise out of the dueling circuit like you mentioned. Because the fact that you're beating someone up is no reason to not look good. Then looking good gets noticed, and people copy you.

You're likely right about purebloods going for more impractical fashion, because we've seen that pattern in wealthy people throughout history. I'd expand that idea to wonder whether overall wizarding fashion is less practical and more formal, since they have magic, so practicality would be more about comfort and range of motion for people in unusual career paths than everyday use. As above, I'd expect the fashion to expand from those who practicality is important to.

I wouldn't expect fashion to develop so far away from muggle fashion, as they are side by side worlds. There would probably be ideas spreading along both sides when they had common ground. I don't think wizards would simply have old fashioned clothing, but different clothing. Same concept, different execution. Because wizards have had the same amount of time to develop fashion as muggles, and at least similar historical situations pre-statute of secrecy.

The reason I try to justify robes at all is because they're canon. I found the illustrations made sense, and seeing robes as outerwear made sense.

** As I said in the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/krjz19/robes_in_hp/gibqhpd/][other topic]], going by the book, /any/ kind of "robe" is closed. That's what a robe means. An open robe is not a robe, it's a cloak. A robe is a bag you pull over your head. Fashion history is (sadly) pretty clear on that, so if wizards wear "robes", they look like monks, and that's it.

I'm with you, though, that I find this state of affairs unsatisfying, and basically do the same thing you suggested; when writing, calling a "wizarding robe" just about anything that's at least half-closed (i.e. needs to be pulled over the head), but still has buttons, lacings or other things that can make it more form-fitting than a bag. That's a lot nicer, but nothing in Canon indicates this is what is meant. The robes aren't described further, except for that we know people don't usually wear anything under it, and that's why you can only rely on the word itself for understanding -- for which the result is what I wrote in the first paragraph.

*** Thank you for the comment.

Your comment on the other thread makes sense. I'm sorry for the seemingly inaccurate terminology if it was confusing, but you've got the definition slightly wrong. While your thinking of a monk's habit is correct, as it is a robe, there are many forms of robes other than that, all over the world. A judicial robe comes to mind as a predominant theme in European and North American countries. An accurate definition would be, "a long, loose-fitting garment." This definition comes from the Oxford English dictionary. The etymology is actually insane, as it has the same roots as the word "rob," as in thievery. Gotta love English. I recommend looking into it if you like that kind of thing.

But many robes are open-fronted, which isn't surprising, as it's a piece of outerwear. You see them commonly worn over cassocks, such as judges, barristers or, in some protestant churches, as a pulpit robe. What Snape was wearing in the movies is a cassock, differentiated by its form-fitting nature. It's surprisingly common to be worn under a robe. In Eastern nations, the only thing I can think of that would count is a haori, as despite there being longer garments, I'm bad with eastern clothing.

A cloak is pretty easily differentiated from a robe, as they usually don't have sleeves, and you're correct that they are generally open in the front. Now since cloaks look incredibly awesome, they deserve more representation. Additionally, they were worn up to the end of the 19th century, and in some places further, so they aren't that out of place.

What you said about form-fitting in your original comment was completely correct, and it drives me insane as well. It goes completely against the definition that we agree on. Only time I'd rather have the movie uniforms at the expense of canon. The idea of robes that I had was a monks habit for Hogwarts students and a Geneva gown of various colors for the discerning modern witch or wizard.

We can tell that they're wearing something closed in the front due to what you said, the shown undergarments. Additionally, there is very little reference to them wearing anything under their robes, so that's probably the common behavior. This means that what they're wearing isn't a Geneva gown, as those open in the front naturally. I think we're in agreement that they are likely wearing something similar to a woolen monastic robe. They never mention colored trim, but it feels likely that there are badges and trim for differentiating the houses, as teachers never have an issue awarding points to the correct house, even when they're first meeting students. I've had a lot of new teachers and none of them have ever managed to remember my name from the first attendance.

The reason that the open-front design stood out to me is that it was used for most of the book illustrations. It provides an idea of robes as everyday wear outside of a Hogwarts uniform. I picture it as a Geneva gown, as that looks right to me, but you could also see it as the slightly more accurate open academic robe, similar to those worn at graduations.

However, there is another option, which makes us both wrong. That's where Hogwarts robes do open in the front, but they're worn closed in the front, but when worn casually students wear them as outerwear over more muggle styled clothes. I dislike this option likely for the same reason you do. It makes their fashion kind of incomprehensible, and completely homogenous, which is completely unrealistic. Additionally, there's no evidence pointing at this possibility at the expense of other options.

Umm, I think that's it, if you'd like me to clarify any point, reply away, I don't want to be unclear.

**** Apologies, I think I meant a coat. It's the same word as cloak here.

But that aside, I'm fairly sure the origin of a "robe" was what I said, i.e. closed/pull-over-the-head garments. I recall that being my conclusion when I researched this issue. The broadening of the term to include items like judges' robes (or even bathrobes) happened later. So if you wanted to assign an image to the word, without knowing any further particulars (as is the case for the books), I think the most fair interpretation is to stick with the closed-fronted type. And yeah, like you said, this also fits with wearing nothing underneath.

I don't have access to the images, though. I do know Rowling drew those: [[https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/drawing/jk-rowling-drawings/]]

That seems to indicate closed as well. But regardless, I'd be happy if it included open(-able) robes, that'd provide more variance. I'm just not sure that's supported by the evidence.

What I came up with for myself, incidentally, was a three layer thing. A shift/underwear, and an inner robe and an outer robe, where the inner one was closed (and could be fitted using lacings, e.g. like a bodice), and the outer one was loose fitting with fairly large neck and/or open front -- like movie-Kingsley's, which I think is awesome ([[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/bb/8b/fabb8be61b60ae32683bd5bd8fe8478a.jpg]]) --, so you could see the inner robe and combine colours and materials.

***** I refuse to concede on the definition! That's literally my only specialty! The connotations, which I do agree with, aside, the definition quite clearly arises from the Frankish, "rouba," which meant spoils, as in what you get by pillaging. This led into the Old French, "robe," which meant the same thing, but could indicate clothing. Clothing and high-quality fabrics were incredibly valuable at the time, so they were stealing the sorts of garments we're talking about, which were generally worn as outerwear by wealthy individuals, because lots of fabric is expensive. Over time, the word shifted to indicate the form of clothing that I'm talking about. This about the time the word got inducted into the English language. Which was at least Early Modern English, as I recall a few mentions of robes in Shakespeare. So it's been there for a while. Your other evidence for this point is better than arguing definition, since our opinion on definition doesn't matter, nor is it really relevant besides clarifying our respective points. Though it is interesting. The most evidence definitely points to closed-front robes, as the main body of the books points to that. The definition thing is totally fine.

The illustrations I was thinking of were the Mary Grandpé illustrations. But all of her illustrations were of casual Harry in wizarding wear, never Hogwarts uniform. But she has open front robes, and they were the editions I spent most of my time reading.

But of course, we're fanfiction authors, and that's why I like my open-fronted robes. The only real evidence for them is the fact that Wizards don't blow the statute of secrecy by walking to the Leaky Cauldron. Since I can really only justify them through illustrations not by Rowling and logical necessity, I don't have a very strong position. But I'd like you to go back and read it again, because I want to hear your opinion of my idea of wizarding fashion for my headcanon. I know I try to base it on the canon as much as possible, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it as a headcanon, with how insightful you've been on this thread.

As to yours, that sounds more canon to me. However, it doesn't work for my headcanon, because I have to imagine the wizarding world as actually being undercover in the muggle world, otherwise the story crumbles for me.

** Wizards and witches use robes in canon because it's the trope of wizards and witches - same with the pointy hats, they're the trappings of a stereotypical 'witch' culturally. We see a similar thing with the animals Hogwarts allows as familiars - cats, toads, owls - or with the use of broomsticks as transportation,

For practicality, it also serves to differentiate the two worlds.

In terms of wizard wear, the uniformity often displayed in fics is because people aren't always that interested in clothing, and Hogwarts with its dress code (of needing a certain type of robe) is usually at the center. Add to that a very small population in canon, and canon typically going for 'eccentric' clothing choices (over something like trying to do a real/serious possible culture clothing wise) and you get what we have. (Also, robes being not-commonplace in our world means that for a lot of people it's not easy to describe them beyond color + standard adjectives like 'fancy' or 'old/torn/dilapidated'. That would extend to a lot of older clothing styles too - vs standard modern clothing, where we have a lot of examples to draw from daily life)

*** You've got a very good point. I don't want clothing descriptions, but I'd like to help people have a world to draw from, so they don't have to do it
