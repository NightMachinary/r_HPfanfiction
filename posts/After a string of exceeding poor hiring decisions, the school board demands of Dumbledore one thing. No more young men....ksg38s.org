** “Albus, why is Alastor setting off your Young Man Detector?”

“I don't know, Minerva, perhaps it's broken.” He picked up the device whirring on his desk and peered at it through his half-moon glasses.

“Also, why do you have a Young Man Detector?”

“Oh, you know me, I like to collect strange devices.”

** "In that case, I would like to hire Alastor Moody to be the defense professor next year. He is not a young man, but is in fact quite old."

/One year later/

"Dammit, Dumbledore."

(But really, the only people Dumbledore hired who might be considered young men at the time were Snape and maybe Lockhart. And /maybe/ Quirrel when he was originally hired as Muggle Studies professor.)

***** Oh, I don't know. Lupin was what? 33? 34? That's young in my book, and would definetly be in Dumbledore's.

****** "Young, relative to Dumbledore" isn't exactly saying much. I'd say that mid-thirties is pretty solidly into adulthood. Not quite middle-aged, but still too old to really be called a "young man" without it seeming condescending.

*** I don't know if “he” refers to Dumbledore or Snape here, but either way, wtf? They certainly have their flaws, but there was no suggestion in canon that either was a pedophile.
