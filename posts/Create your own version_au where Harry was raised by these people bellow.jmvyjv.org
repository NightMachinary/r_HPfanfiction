You can use AUs like Wrong boy who lived and Dursley leaves Harry in a orphange If you want to. PS:Use your imagination!


** 1: turns out that Dumbledore's completely experimental blood wards didn't hold and the Ministry is really bad at keeping secrets, so Lucius one day shows up at the Dursley's house for some recreational murder and takes baby Harry home to train him as the next Dark Lord.

2: Voldemort wasn't willing to completely cut himself from public life during his conquest and wanted to have a possible alternative in case he lost, so he created a secret identity as a former Durmstrang student that became an academic and created a bookstore in Hogsmead dealing with obscure books, alone the way he ends striking some really unexpected friendships and major grudges, two particularly relevant ones are a burning hatred agains Frank Longbottom for having messed up a (perfectly legal) very costly experiment and then refusing to pay by accusing him of supporting Voldemort; the other was James Potter when he went into the store looking for information about how to become an animagus and the two stuck a conversation with Voldemort eventually becoming something of a mentor to the Marauders and growing quite fond of the four young men head and heals above their classmates in talent who he could relate to. As a result when the prophecy came about Voldemort just decided to pretend the Potters weren't a possible threat and focused on the Longbottons with disturbing glee, and then Harry is born and Voldemort finds himself surprised and oddly touched when he is named godfather by the family (incidentally he unearths or created the Fidelius charm for them, no way in magic that he will let his precious godson grow up alone). Things come to a head on Halloween when he finally gets the location of the Longbottoms and goes deal with them, one of his followers (none of them know about his secret identity of course) who heard about the prophecy is the one to whom Pettigrew went to turncoat, the follower then goes after the Potters to win some minion-points with Voldemort for showing initiative in disposing of a threat while Voldemort takes his time torturing Frank, he receives a signal through an enchanted item when James dies though and goes running to Godrics Hollow leaving Neville an orphan but unharmed. He gets there right after the follower kills Lily and has an acute access of rage throwing around killing curses and other torture spells that completely screw up forensic detection later on and cause damage to the house while reducing the follower to a pile of ashes. Then he hears Hagrid entering and decides to just desilusion himself or get out of the house. When he calms down and becomes aware that he is now little Harry's primary caretaker (and that child-raising is a full-time job) he sighs but deactivates the Dark Mark, it is not like a seventeen years hiatus will matter much since he is immortal. Voldemort does a bit of guess-work and then moves some strings to reveal Pettigrew was the true betrayer resulting in Sirius been kept free and Pettigrew being sent to a particularly dark and unpleasant cell, investigation is utterly baffled about what may have occurred on GH, being only able to pinpoint that Voldemort was there, three people died there and that James and Lily both died enough time before the third as to make them responsible for the death unlikely, coupled with the disappearance of the DM some believe the BWL cannon version, others (including Dumbledore himself since there isn't any scar or sign of Harry having been in anyway involved) disagree, but since they can't come up with a better explanation the BWL myth takes root. Since Dumbledore can't find signs of the Blood Protections (as the follower didn't give Lily the choice of stepping aside) he doesn't oppose Voldemort gaining custody and so Harry ends raised by Voldemort.
