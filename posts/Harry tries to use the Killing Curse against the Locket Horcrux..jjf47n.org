"Actually, there is one spell we haven't tried yet." Harry said softly, looking at the heavy locket. Despite their best efforts, nothing that they had thrown at it had do much as blemished it. They had captured it weeks ago, losing Grimmauld Place in the process, but it seemed to be all for naught. The magic was acrid in the air as they stood around the clearing that had been host to their latest failure. The clearing became as silent as the grave as Ron and Hermione realized what he meant.


** I'm not sure there are many directions to take this prompt in.

On one hand, in a canon-compliant magic system, this doesn't work:

"The killing curse, not a soul killer, does not remove someone's soul. One, it does not replicate the effect of the dementor's kiss. Two, Fawkes dies because of the curse. He survives because pheonixes can be reborn from death. Fawkes retains his soul afterwards. Three, the concept of death differs greatly from a "soul killer".

Indeed, horcruxes are notable because of the last reason:

#+begin_quote
  *‘But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,' said Ron, ‘why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?' ‘Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.'* Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, *‘Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.'* ‘Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,' said Ron. Harry laughed. ‘It should be, actually! *But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,' said Hermione. ‘But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.'* ‘That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,' said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort's soul as it vanished. ‘And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but, obviously, it came back good as new.
#+end_quote

It's the destruction of the vessel that destroys a horcrux. The creation of a horcrux demands the destruction of the vessel and soul to prevent its functionality. The killing curse may kill someone, but it leaves their soul intact." (From previous comment of mine.)

On the other hand, if the killing curse did work, assuming a different magical system, I'm not convinced much would change. Sure, the locket would no longer be a horcrux. They wouldn't need to get the sword or worry about it being taken. They wouldn't go to Gringotts. But ultimately, they'd fall into a stalemate. They wouldn't be able to figure out where Voldemort's last horcruxes are, without Voldemort finding out about his missing horcruxes. And that forces the same race to Hogwarts. The stalemate would probably be compounded by Harry focusing on the Hallows even more.

*** Wait. So how does Harry stop being a horcrux? His body doesn't get destroyed. Does dying also mean that the vessel is broken beyond repair?

*** Isn't killing curse canonical way to get rid of a Horkrux? Not totally sure but I think it was mentioned somewhere and obviously it sukcessfully de-Horkruxed Harry himself.

On the other hand so is basilisk venom and yet Horkrux survived that one so some leeway is there... If Harry just tripped headfirst into basilisk maw to provide more info and further this theory.

** The long silence filled the clearing. Ron looked piercingly at Harry but his friend avoided his gaze. Hermione stared in middle distance, silently waging pros and cons.

The killing curse.

They all knew why no one proposed it before.

It was what makes creating a Horkrux possible in the first place. Words from that one book Hermione read to them wafted between them silently. /Murder tears the soul apart.../

Not-Moodys' lesson rang true, /'you have to mean it, you could all point your wands at me and yell Avada Kedavra and I wouldn't even get a nosebleed/'. To sukcessfully cast it, one of them would have to truly mean it. To summon such hate was unconceivable to tree young wizards. One of them would have to potentially risk their soul broken.

"Actually, there is one other way we did not try yet" mused Ron after awhile.

And then they Yeet'ed the Locket at a Dementor.

*** Dude don't be ridiculous, how would that even work?

His /Avada Kedavra/ coloured orbs, however, now that would work!

** I can see a way to play with this.

Maybe each time Harry builds up and casts with the needed hate the soul fragment in his scar is empowered, or he takes on it's hate. So each time he destroys one of the other horcruxs with AK he himself becomes more like Voldemort - more hateful, less forgiving, less caring, more likely to cast to maim and kill rather than just stun or disarm.

In the end, no more Voldemort (except maybe Harry's scar?) but a new Dark Lord who is just as evil but maybe worse overall since he is still sane with an intact soul?
