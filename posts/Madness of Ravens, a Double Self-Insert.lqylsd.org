  “Of course you'd measure the value of a human being by their ability to get some fake approval points designed to turn children into obedient, unthinking citizens,” James said.

  Lyra frowned. “What else would I measure a person by?”

  “There are more important things,” said James. “Like their personal wealth, their talent at tax evasion, and their faith in God.”

  “What God in particular, James?”

  “Satan.”

Madness of Ravens, a double SI written by my friend AutumnSouls and myself, have recently broken 60,000 words! It's mostly a self-indulgent story, although we do have an actual plot at this point with some side-plots in the distance as well.

We pride ourselves on our third-person writing, non-Mary Sue OCs, and canon butterflies.

** Wow, this is a really really impressive fanfic. Like wow. I haven't read an self insert this good in ages. A double self insert is such a unique take on it as well. Good jobs guys.

Also Lyra/fleur better be a pairing.
