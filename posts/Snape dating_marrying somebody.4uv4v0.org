I remember reading a very good fic a while back where there was a Snape/Burbage pairing that tied loosely into the plot. No Hermione/Snape please.


** linkffn(1795399) Starts off extremely meh but gets quite good. Snape marries an OC and it's not completely terrible. Also has two sequels.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*Come Once Again and Love Me*, linkffn(7670834)

*His Greatest Wish*, linkffn(6548167)

*The Moment It Began*, linkffn(3735743)

Eileen Prince is portrayed differently in all three fics, from complete victim to normal witch to scary iron lady.

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

*** Second The Moment it Began and His Greatest Wish. Was going to recommend them myself. Haven't read Come One Again so can't say anything about it.\\
Just a heads up, I find Snape in His Greatest Wish a bit OOC. Snape suddenly becomes a lot less jaded all of a sudden whereas The Moment It Began still feels like Snape and all his jaded glory. Either way, I enjoyed both fics very much and His Greatest Wish is still my favorite between the two. It's a bit fluffy which I enjoyed whereas I TMIB was a bit more serious.
