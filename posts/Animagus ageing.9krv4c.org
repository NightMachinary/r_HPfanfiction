**** Not sure, I mean, most wizards don't become them. I'm sure Sirius reaped the benefits when he broke out but I don't think he was expecting that.

***** If you only become one during wartime it could be incredibly useful for escaping/spying. There's also the question of whether it might have been of more use in previous eras. In say a period where wizards are out in the open having access to powers like that could be far more useful than it is now that they are in hiding and have a magical government for clearing up people's minds.

*** What if your form was one of those turtles that are biologically unaging? You could technically stay in that form and never die from age.

Sleep in turtle form and live that much longer in human form.

Find a way to remote control a homunculus while your real body stays in turtle form and you've obtained unconventional immortality.

** It's an interesting idea, but doesn't feel like a very plausible one to me. Isn't Skeeter a beetle animagus? Or some kind of bug anyway? I think that was revealed at some point and knowing her, she used that form to her advantage all the time to eavesdrop in on interesting people for a story. So, surely, she'd be a super old lady by the time the books are over with all of the excitement going on in the books.

*** Totally, completely implausible, going by canon. However, for the sake of fanfiction I'd be really interested in seeing a story which played with an idea like that. She would definitely have a much harder time spying on people, Pettigrew couldn't live with the Weasleys for years etc.

** Would Voldemort have tried to become a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii][jellyfish Animagus]] as a path to immortality?

*** Tom Riddle stared down at the book. He'd been searching for further information on Horcruxes and yet here was a detailed study of the turritopsis dohrnii. He shook himself in disappointment and almost went to slot the book back into the shelf. As he turned away from his table he heard the click of shoes on the library floor. He muttered a curse as Madam Bodley stalked into the restricted section alongside Professor Dumbledore. There was no way he could sneak back in there whilst they were both there.

He hesitated for a few moments before settling down at the table with a small, disgruntled, groan. He flipped back to the section on the jellyfish, biologically immortal? That sounded interesting at least.

______

/Three weeks later .../

'What are you doing Riddle?' One of the older boys in the Slytherin dormitory shouted, throwing a book at him.

Tom wordlessly banished it and ignored the interruption as he continued to float over a tank of saltwater. He kept up his mantra under his breath, 'Think like a jellyfish, be a jellyfish. You are a jellyfish ...'

*** Oh, I know, the point in a sense is to envisage a rather different world in which this is the case and imagine how things would be as a result of this. I'd just be quite interested to know if there are any stories which have done this. The number of things which you can find in fanfiction which disagree with canon is immense, so what's one more?

** That... that's a wonderful explanation for 1) why so few people do it, and 2) why James, Sirius, Remus and Peter looked so old in the movies. I...

I...

I really don't know how to deal with this revelation.

*** It really appeals to me. Of course within canon it's totally implausible, but I kind of wish it had been the case (it might have stopped Pettigrew from being weird enough that he decided to live as a rat for thirteen years). I'd love to find a story where it was the case, it would definitely make me feel happier about why there are so few animagi.

*** Yeah, but it does beg the question about Snape and Lily.

And why Remus? he only transforms once a month (13 times a year) for 6-9 hours. And we have no idea what a werewolves lifespan would be regardless.

**** Dark magic ages you badly? And Lily was obviously a secret plant by the Department of Mysteries or else she would have got into trouble because of the trace when she was transforming teacupt etc after coming back for the holidays.

**** I took Remus looking old for his age as being caused by stress: partly from being a Werewolf and hating that part of himself; and partly from Survivor's Guilt caused by the deaths of James and Lily, the presumed death of Peter and the presumed betrayal of Sirius.
