So I've just finished reading In Servitude to the Dark and its sequel but like most good fanfics it not finished (but was great anyway) and it shall never be finished. Does anyone have an recommendation for a fanfic similar to this, going with the themes of Dark Harry but serving the Dark Lord on not entirely equal footing but not servant level loyalty?

HP/TM or HP/LV slash is perfectly fine

Thank in advance :D


** Could you link these fics please?
