**** I also agree. Andrius just does really good fluffy stories in general. Wish they'd do another.

  In an act of desperation, Harry invites Flora Carrow to the Yule Ball. He never expects having to entertain her twin sister Hestia too.

***** Offtopic, but since it sounded like you have read more of his stories, would you recommend his longer fics? After having re-read Ice Cream and now Twins, I was wondering if I should give them a go, but they don't sound like my usual reading. So thought I would ask if you read them.

****** i found weeb/adventures to be pretty funny. geek was solid too with a similar feel. I would think that if you didnt know much anime/gaming culture it would somewhat go over your head and not really be as engaging.

******* I have been pretty deeply rooted in anything gaming for the last 30 years, anime is a bit newer for me but I have seen the most standout series since a friend got me hooked by making me watch "Elfenlied" like 15 years ago. Was pretty fuckin disturbing, but as I said, it got me hooked. And I have read my fair share of HP crossovers with various animes, many of which I didn't know before.

Sounds like I might enjoy those stories, will definitely give them a try. Thanks for answering!

******* I just read it. Was an interesting take on what might happen if Hermione gets too much political power.

Weird thing, I clicked on review and it looks like Andrius removed the story from his profile while I was reading it :D
