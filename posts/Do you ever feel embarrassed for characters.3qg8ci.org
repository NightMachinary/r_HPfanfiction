Do you ever read a story, and the character does something that just makes you uncomfortable, or embarrassed? For me it is usually when Harry is trying to be cooler then he is. I bring this up because I am trying to give Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time another try, because I see it recommended here all the time.

I can get over Harry burning a guy with a bag of lighter fluid and then flicking a cigarette at him, this is cheesy, but at least it is Hollywood-esque. What I cannot get over is the following paragraph found in chapter 5:

'I cut the wee little thing short again, my hard eyes blazing and my voice strong and sure. "I invoke the right of Palaver with Chief Forst the Overseer, Director-Manager of the London Branch of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Under the laws of your nation, your father's father, goblin, I, Harry James Potter, invoke the Treaty of Atlantis and all rights owed Wizard-kind therein. I claim the Claw of Ragnarok unbroken!"'

I think I physically cringed in embarrassment when reading this, do people find this cool? It kills me on the inside. So, does anyone else have things or instances where the characters have embarrassed you by proxy?


** Yes, I cringe a lot, especially when Harry is yelling at Dumbledore in the Great Hall for stealing his money and bribing his uncle to buttrape him, and then smirks because the Goblins emancipated him or some shit so he has wandless magic now or whatever. Alienating all his allies in the process.

Generally when he's acting especially idiotic and pathetic. There's a line to how much he did it in canon, and authors constantly step over it by miles. Or when the author plays it as if Harry is acting cunningly, but he's really just acting stupidly, because the author apparently can't actually write clever characters.

Overall, I can't stand 99% of fics.

** That's what I like to call "Heavy Handed Harry," and I fucking hate Heavy Handed Harry with the passion of 10,000 burning suns. He is incredibly boring to read, and yes I think it would be accurate to say certain things I've seen HHH do are pretty embarrassing; such as when he gets naked in public and points out scars from his muggle beatings, etc. The claw of ragnarok unbroken just made me ^{nope} out of that story though, more out of a desire to not be bored by HHH than embarrassment.

What's worse even than how painful it is to read (I couldn't make it past the first chapter) is how effusively praising all of the reviews are. I couldn't find more than a couple of negative reviews. Other than that, everyone who reviewed */enjoyed/* this level of unapologetic douchebaggery.

**** To be fair, though, anyone who actually has taste either got out of there as quickly as was possible or soldiered through the suffering just to leave a review that the author most likely will ignore.

Bad fiction gets some good reviews because people want to help. Total crap fiction gets no good reviews or nearly none because each and every one of those is a lost case and unless you are doing it out of sheer stubbornness and misplaced pride leaving any sort of review accomplishes nothing but wastes your time.

**** You got me curious, so I checked the first chapter of what you linked. I will partly disagree with you. This case of HHH (welp, we even have an acronym for it now) seems not /that/ cringe worthy, especially compared to some of the other fics out there.

That said, I wouldn't say I am a rabid fan of the story, but for different reasons: the introductory prose felt a bit weak, and secondly we have the 'Henry' 'Peverell' trope, which /might/ cause 'embarrassing' moments later on, but it could also be handled well. Anyway, chapter one hasn't given me reason to really hate it either.

Most importantly, in this one Harry is seventeen when he acts like that, which makes it a little more believable than those other fics where an eleven-year-old Harry starts making grandiose proclamations in the Great Hall or the Slytherin common room. (DZ2's Demon of Hogwarts comes to mind.)

And when he is caught, like by his son, peeing?

** I think one issue with this is American authors trying to write British characters who have a very specific sense of humour and sarcasm; teasing; banter. I've heard mentioned before that some American readers find Harry, for example, to be a bit of a dick, where British readers would just see him as a bit cheeky or a bit of a tease.

That is to say, American fanfic authors will sometimes take things too far in the wrong direction, so we have things like super-cool!Harry or mean!Harry that can seem really OOC.

Pervy Sirius is another one, and super-heterosexual!Lupin - these tend to crop up in very Americanized story settings and I've always thought its the direct result of taking a character's core attribute like 'cool' and thinking of all the things that would make a character cool....in America. Unfortunately this isn't always the same as what JK, as a British woman of a certain generation would have written, and so it can create a bit of confusion sometimes.

OOC is fine in an OOC or deliberately AU setting, but it can be jarring when it suddenly pops up in a setting that's trying to be otherwise canon-compliant.

I've edited the original to make it clearer. I've never seen a /macho/ Lupin as such, but I've seen authors go all out to give Lupin excuses to talk about his heterosexuality - as if to make it /absolutely clear/ that he's /not gay/. And it shows.

***** Indeed, it's a reaction to slash fanon I'd assume. Personally I kind of like the idea that he's either gay, but chose to be with Tonks as a matter of seeking normalcy, or bi but prefers women for the same reason. It adds a bit of extra tragedy and depth to a man who spent most his life quite literally a stranger in his own skin.
