** ahh the veela, the pinnacle of sexuality. Good choice. These are all gonna be smut cuz look at that pairing, also most of these are vela/soul bond and many of them include harems / multis but considering the pairing u asked for I'm assuming thats not an issue.

the unexpected result of... [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=315]]

Harry Potter and the Veela Sisters [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4979758/chapters/11437501]]

harry potter and the veela bond(which even if your not gonna read just scroll down and read the author notes/ satirical disclaimers they're pretty funny) [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=276]]

not completed but does end at a good stopping point and some fantastic rough scenes in it Path of Conquest [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=987]]

Incase you thought path of conquest is the darkest fics get; look no farther than the one-shot gem that is: A Veela's Worth

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1213]] ((well not techinally harry/gabby/fluer it is harry/multiple veela )because nothing says family bonding like breeding a granddaughter to ritualistically de-flower and subsequently kill before their age is in the double digits)

Taking his Ex-girlfriend as his slave, and geting a very attaractive nine year old wife, Harry begins to form his army against those who would stand against him. An army of loyal slaves to carry out whatever orders he gives.

***** No, just no.

At best this is a guilty pleasure fic, and even that is kind of pushing it. Dude I'm a fan of bond fics and even I can barely stomach this one. The infatuation both sisters have for Harry for literally no reason (first chapter), Harry freaking the duck out at Ron for literally no reason. Sirius calling Harry pup. The incredibly unnatural dialogue from every character.

I don't mean to be a dick, but the only way anyone could call this fic good is it it's compared to My Immortal.
