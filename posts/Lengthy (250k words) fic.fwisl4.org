** Heart and Soul is super long. (A bit too long if you ask me- it took me several tries to get to the end. And there's no girl/ girl action which is a rather large disappointment.) Honour Thy Blood is also a favourite of mine. Don't listen to the skeptics- it's good fun.

** The Cupboard Series is close to a million words overall and covers all seven years of Harry's education. Well worth a read.

Starts with linkffn(The Cupboard Under The Stairs by Stargon 1).

DerLaCroix has some decent and lengthy fics as well; I just finished linkffn(Rocking The Boat) (fun, complete, but leaves some dangling plot strings; its sequel seems abandoned) and I'm currently reading linkffn(Cold blood by DerLaCroix).

** I just finished a story that's 858k+ words. Summary from story page: Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

"Letters" /by TheEndless7/ is among the better Flowerpot stories out there. It is perfectly reasonable and realistic, as far as I remember, and, most importantly, highly interesting.

But it is also among the shorter ones, falling short of the 250k+ requirement by about 50k words.

It's still a really good read, one I wholeheartedly recommend.

​

Aside from the previously mentioned Honour Thy Blood and Stepping Back *TheBlack'sResurgence* sadly has no other finished works. The Green in the Grey is getting steady updates but is still both rather short and unfinished.

But *TheBlack'sResurgence* is definitely, in my opinion, among the, if not /the/, best Fanfiction Author out there. So I can only mirror the compliments he's gotten so far in the other replies.

** The Resonance, Revolution & Resolution trilogy is about 1.5m words between the three books. These are great, detailed, a Severitus. Not really any pairings as such. I've never managed to finish all three, I end up distracted by another fic / end up too busy with real life that I'd have to restart reading again.

Also!

Harry Potter and the Summer after the War is only about 170k, but it has a sequel that flows seamlessly from it that is ~500k, called Harry Potter and the Winters after the War. This one is a Hinny, but super believable and their relationship is a plot point but certainly not the only one.

The Legacy Preservation Act is a good ~300k Marriage Law Haphne, with a side of Tracey Davis/Neville.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** The first two fics I ever read: After the End by Sugar Quill... linkffn(282139)... and The First Day by little0bird... linkffn(4367121)

And just to break up your Harry-centric fics in case your mood changes while abroad, I recommend downloading A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro... linkffn(7937889). Doesn't do much of anything around pairings but I think it's a fun take on Snape's story.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
