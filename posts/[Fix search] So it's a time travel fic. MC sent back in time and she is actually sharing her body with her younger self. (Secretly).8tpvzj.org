So yeah. Don't really remember who it was. Either Hermione or Tonks maybe? Pretty sure female.

She had to minimize changes for fear of paradox. Totally silent, passive passenger in the body. Ended up getting caught in it. I believe she could take control of her body at night.

Umm there may have been some communication via letter while sleeping.

Edit: I think her presence in the body may have been sporadic. And less frequent later on.
