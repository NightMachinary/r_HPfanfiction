**** It was this one. I doubt that you're talking about this, since it was explicitly said that they'll be in love even in the summary and it was obvious from the beginning.

***** Nope was definitely the first one. I /did/ read the warnings, I forgot about them once I saw how professionally Hermione was handling stuff, all the details and getting her to the place made me excited and I Though, yep she's gonna bash this mofo-she's Hermione granger, then the romance started and I was like boo.

****** Well, I can definately see that many people would dislike this version. It kinda became interesting in a different way starting from there. I've been chatting with the author after finishing it and she said that many people expected a much darker story where they are enemies until the end, but it just turned out differently, somethign much more unique in my opinion.

** Hmm, Obi and Narcissa Malfoy pairing?

I'm guessing you're reading In All Things Balance. Good series :) though I wish the author would continue with the third book as well as his Star Wars X Game of Thrones crossover he's writing right now.

Is it really that much to ask, that he double his amount of writing and mental bandwidth for stories, and maintain the same, if not improve, his update timing?

And apparently I'm a wizard, because not 12 hours after posting this comment did the new chapter of his GoT X Star Wars crossover come out.

Which got weirder due to Harry having married X-23(Wolverine's Daughter/Clone) and Hermione being one of Logan's descendents.

**** First one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244792/chapters/25133094][How could one will cause so much chaos?]]. The pairing is one of the sideplots though.

second is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11472012/chapters/25722840][Harry Potter and the Golden Ring II]]. It's pretty twisted, and unfinished due to creator existence failure.

****** Unfortunately both of the ones I read have been taken down and are not on the way back machine. Although there are still references to them all over Pinterest and various podcasts.

So...the fics were written by amberiscool333 and the other by cluesblues. You can pm them on Wattpad and ask for copies.

I thought about starting a YouTube channel a few years ago and the one and only video featured these stories.

If you're ok with putting up with my cringey bullshit you can get the synopsis for both of them.

Here's the link. I'll work on getting the email used to set the Wattpad account working. I might still have them in my library.
