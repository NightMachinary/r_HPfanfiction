Goblins are naturals at everything underground, especially mining. But when muggle geologists can scan the ground everywhere for signs of oil pockets or ore deposits, it'd be extremely hard for goblins to mine without getting detected, so they'd probably be legally restricted to areas hidden from muggles. Borders drawn on the surface that restrict where they can dig underground probably aren't going to make them very happy. I'm considering this as a source of conflict in my fic, eventually (late 21st century) resulting in space goblins hollowing out asteroids and living there, evolving into taller creatures with less dense bones due to low gravity, unable to return to Earth. What do you think?

PS: Beltalowda!


** Why do you think that muggle technology can bypass magic? That muggle scanners/satellites would be able to detect a place hidden by magic to prevent muggle interference?

*** Wizards wouldn't trust goblins to properly secure their tunnels against muggle technology they don't really understand themselves. It'd be more of an excuse to oppress the goblins really.

**** I think the space goblins sound very cool, but I'm really not into the "goblins as oppressed victims" sort of storyline

***** It's typical human history that every group has tried to oppress every other group whenever they had the chance...

Why should relations between groups that are actually different species be any better? The HP world is full of bigotry (hem hem... Umbridge) it's quite likely that there are a lot of wizards that don't exactly like goblins, and a lot of goblins that hate wizards, it's practically a fanon joke that history of magic is 99% goblin rebellions that must've happened for reasons, I think if certain wizards found another excuse to limit the rights of goblins with international support they wouldn't hesitate.

**** Neither species requires the help of the other to hide from muggles. Both have hidden themselves for centuries and that remains true even in the muggle age of technology.
