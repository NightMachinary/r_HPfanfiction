In the world of HPFanfiction, readers complain when Harry Potter (or some other character) travels back in time and does nothing to change the events from occurring. These authors are wise beyond measure as they know not to tempt fate. For Fate has an unusual way of dispensing with authors who try to stray from canon.

"Oh. Your Harry Potter travels back in time and prevents Voldemort from coming back to life at Tri-Wizard tournament?" Fate murmured angrily. "You can change the timeline all you like. Guess who's going to have a second job? Guess who's going to have a writer's block? Guess who's going to leave a bad review making you loose motivation to write?" Fate smiled. She was downright nasty when she wanted to be.

While there are some stories where the timeline is irrevocably changed, only a few stories have been successfully completed. She couldn't manipulate everything but she damn well ensured that most writers that make someone go back in time and change timeline would not finish the story.


** I'm surprised you didn't use the meta tag.

Some examples of fanfics taking into consideration Butterfly Effect type changes to the timeline include The Cursed Child, [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/][Nightmares of Future Past]], and linkao3(The Heir of House Black).

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

***** /No/, why would you want it to /breed/?!

BTW your flair is not bad advice but should include a warning that the series is incomplete.

****** It can't breed if it's gay.

Not when I'm (slowly) writing a fan made sequel.
