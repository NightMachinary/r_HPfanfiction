** I think it's worth at least trying once. If you feel like you want to drop out, then no, it's not for you. If it /is/ for you, it's rather a fun ride that scratches a few itches canon leaves. It has its problems, but there's a lot of fun stuff in there.

I found the ending pretty satisfying, and the way a few running gags were wrapped up. I don't at all regret having read it and one day will probably read it again.

*** Yeah I agree with this. It seems to be a super polarizing fic and it's definitely not for everyone. However, despite the problems it has, I found it to be an enjoyable read.

It's decently written and has some interesting and unique plot ideas, and some pretty exciting segments. But it also often seems like some scenes are thin window dressing for the author to use to push forward his philosophies or some lesson about logical fallacies, rather than being there to tell a story. And the main character can be an annoying prick at times. And it has some pacing issues, where it sort of meanders a bit in the middle. This has nothing to with the fic itself, but it's also sort of annoying that a lot of it's fans, whom haven't and probably won't ever read any other Harry Potter fanfiction, think it's the best possible version of Harry Potter and some flawless masterpiece. It's definitely an enjoyable fic to read, and I get this it appeals to some demographics that wouldn't be into most other fanfics so I'm not saying those people should read more, but the epitome of writing it is not.

**** I suppose even the action-heavy parts of HPMOR, such as the Azkaban scenes, focus a lot on introspection. Personally I love that type of thing. It's a bit like Death Note or other stories that delve into strategy and headgames. What's going on in the minds of the characters adds to the tension in a great way, but that may not be the right cup of tea for some people.

I clearly said I read it twice (even though the "re" in reread got left off accidentally its still pretty clear) and I clearly enjoy it, based on the fact that I said it was worth rereading.

All I said was that I felt like one arc was a slog both times and from that you inferred a lot of incorrect things about who I am as a person and what I like in stories I read.

Kind of comes across like the "you have to have a high IQ" style fans of Rick and Morty (which is, by the way, a show I enjoy very much).

You brought up Death Note, and that's an anime that I have watched at least a half dozen times and own on DVD.

As for why I didn't enjoy the Azkaban arc, I can't really tell you that (though I can tell you how it made me feel), as its been a while since my reread (and it's be a while before I might possibly read it a third time). If I had to speculate, it probably had to do with a combination of the tone and the pacing. I remember it feeling like it took forever (hence the word slog). Fittingly, it felt like the soul of HPMOR was sucked out during those chapters.

** Here's a mini-review I had posted on a different site a while ago:

In a nutshell, if you mostly share Yudkowsky's metaphysical assumptions and his hopes for the future of humanity in broad strokes, you can enjoy the /first half/ of the fic: it was amusing, downright hilarious in places, and didn't take itself too seriously at the start; it had about the right mix of references (pop-cultural and scientific) that I knew about and that I didn't know about and could learn something from.

The author did take on board a lot of fanon. There was all sorts of wizardly nobility stuff, character personalities taken straight out of mediocre power fantasy fic, and magic that functioned like a battery (though Harry didn't get the biggest one, so I guess that was OK). I didn't mind much the deviations from canon, as long as the author kept the digs at canon to a minimum. It also had its share of inanity, such as characters bursting into song at the Sorting, but it could be chalked up to the author's unfamiliarity with the fandom culture, and it was fairly isolated.

Over time, though, the fun stuff was largely supplanted in favour of Serious Business Slytherin Scheming with basically two people having any agency. I recall largely skimming through the second half of the story, because I did want to see how it ends. (My verdict: Meh.)

There is, also, a price for enjoying the first half of this fic: in order to enjoy the amusing interactions, you should try to stop thinking of the characters as representations of hypothetical human beings---canon or not---with distinct personalities, motivations, feelings, and thought processes. Rather, you need start thinking of them as acrobats or dancers in a tightly choreographed dance, or perhaps archetypes personified, like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell'arte][Commedia dell'arte]] characters, acting out a morality play.

The saddest cut of all, though, is that if one wanted to write a Rational!Protagonist fic in HPverse, the most logical Rational!Protagonist is Hermione, not Harry. To make Harry one, Yudkowsky had to literally have someone completely overwrite his personality (which, admittedly, is more honest than most Smart!Studious!Harry writers, who don't provide even that much justification). To make Hermione one would have taken a few tweaks to her circumstances and interests. (Now, I understand why Yudkowsky chose Harry: his goal was didactic first and foremost, and not nearly as many people would have read a Hermione-centric non-romance fic as would read a Harry-centric one.)

So, I'll end with a plug for a fic that I don't think has been mentioned in this thread: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin Drew]], which is, in a way, what HPMOR should have been.

*** *Commedia dell'arte*

Commedia dell'arte (Italian pronunciation: [komˈmɛːdja delˈlarte], comedy of the profession) was an early form of professional theatre, originating from Italy, that was popular in Europe from the 16th through the 18th century. Commedia dell'arte is also known as commedia alla maschera, commedia improvviso, and commedia dell'arte all'improvviso. Commedia is a form of theatre characterized by masked "types" which began in Italy in the 16th century and was responsible for the advent of actresses (Isabella Andreini) and improvised performances based on sketches or scenarios. A commedia, such as The Tooth Puller, is both scripted and improvised.

That's because the first four chapters were written as one-off parodies; it wasn't until chapter five that the author was seriously trying to write a coherent story. [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix/][Daystar's Remix of Rationality]] is a re-write of the first four chapters that corrects a lot of the problems you're probably thinking of.

#+begin_quote
  As the story starts a bit rough around the edges, I decided to experiment with a rewrite of the first four chapters to examine how they might be "smoothed out" to try and better match the depth and brilliance of the rest of the story in tone and characterization, and add more context so as not to assume the readers are familiar with the canon series.

Now enter fanfics, where you get a lot of new content for the world/characters we have come to love. It's not all sunshine and roses, but there's a lot of material to choose from to scratch that itch.

On the other hand, I would never have gotten into HP fanfiction if there wasn't so much amazing variety. Sometimes I think that HP fanfiction is as numerous and varied as all the genres of books in existence, and I'm happy that the fanon community has grown and evolved through the years. I never get bored with it because I always stumble upon a story so unique that my interest is piqued again. If I restricted myself to canon compliant (or canon-similar) stories then I would have gotten bored very quickly.

****** I mean, if only the most popular pairings were around (canon pairings, Harry and Hermione with Snape or Malfoy or both), I'd have noped out faster than you can hit "close tab". And canon compliant usually equals boring since you know the outcome.

And I'm all for diversity of ideas. I'm writing one story where Andromeda Tonks adopts Harry, one where he and Tonks travel across Europe while basically using the plot of the 2003 video game Freelancer (which is a space RPG) and I've finished a couple oneshots, one where Hermione gets a crush after being treated to a kebab.

But the overall goal in all of those is to play around in Rowling's sandbox. Harry isn't going to shout "Heil +Hitler+ Voldemort", Hermione isn't going to end pureblood heiress. Sure, I might have to invent nations like a magical HRE equivalent or take a look at Lithuanian grammar for some OC names, but the overall world is still the same. There's Harry, Hogwarts, magic, Quidditch, flying brooms, Voldemort, Death Eaters and so on. Not all of those will always play a quintessential role, but they are there.

**** The point of fanfiction is to use elements of an original work to create your own story.

In my opinion, a fanfic author ought to find a reasonable justification for inconsistencies it addresses, or eliminate them outright from the setting.

What's more fun to you, that every single wizard and goblin in Britain is a blithering fucking idiot, or that there's an actual practical reason unknown to both ickle Harrykins and the reader why the wizarding banking system is set up a shown and it's not actually exploited even if it seems easy to do so by RL standards?

MOR is basically written around the first part. To me, that's pointless and basically unreadable. Sure, crack is a genre too, but then you have to play it for humour, which isn't MOR's aim.

This is all subjective of course, but then I /did/ state from the beginning that this is just my point of view rather than an objective definition of fanfiction and its aims.

***** Harry starts out thinking that everyone is an idiot, because he is arrogant. Yes the story is written stating Harry thinks he is smarter than everyone. Yet none of his theories are proven showing how stupid the wizarding world is, and in fact all of them he tries fail.

HPMOR is much less a look at how amazing smart this Harry is perfect, and more a look at silly confident this Harry is in his intelligence and how he almost ruins everything by thinking he can do everything alone.

I understand the writing style is not to many peoples liking but stating it misses the point of fanfiction is unfair. HPMOR is a story that is unique made from using elements of the original work. The main inconsistencies it addresses is non permanent transfiguration and that the universe shouldn't want people speaking latin in order to perform magic.

** I'd say its worth reading. It brings up some interesting ideas and takes on canon, it squeezes in all major plot points from across the series into the first year, the characters have clear motivations and there's a clear theme its going for, even if you disagree with it. It's also well-edited, which is better than 95+% of other fanfics. Yes, it has characters acting OOC and depends on some author fiat, but overall I thought it was pretty good and worth the read.

It's also the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10][third-most favorited fic on fanfiction.net]], it has [[http://www.hpmor.com/][its own website]], etc. If nothing else, if you enjoy HP fanfiction as a whole, its good to take a look at it and understand where people are coming from when they praise or decry it, regardless of their opinions.

It can be slow going at times, though- early on has a decent pace, but later on you'll get chapters of actual story progression bookended by character thoughts and reactions, or stuff like fun action scenes (inspired by Ender's Game) that start off as a fun exploration of magic and character relationships, but end up dragging on after fulfilling their intended purpose. The epilogue alone is like 6 chapters long. Also, rather than "Harry Potter + Science," its more like "Harry Potter makes a guess about the nature of magic and it works out every time." A lot of plot points are resolved with a similar set of tools.

**** Hmm, I think EY views fanfiction, HP fandom, and the fanfic community in very much the same way he views the academic and scientific community: with utter contempt and as something he doesn't need to be involved in. This was more apparent in the early days of HPMoR. In that way, I don't think he exactly intended HPMoR to /be/ a Harry Potter fanfic, and it doesn't really fit in this community, even though it obviously /is/ a fanfic that goes through a lot of the HP fanfic cliches. He wasn't big on HP lore when he started (I think he even said at one point that he hadn't actually read the books, early on), which was obvious in some of his ‘take that's about the books as I recall from when I first read it, long ago, and the plot and characterisation was very much not the point of why he was writing.

Like, if you came across a Chick tract in which Harry Potter learns that he needs to pray the sinner's prayer and regularly attend a Baptist church, even if it had a few genuinely amusing moments it probably wouldn't fit well with other HP fanfic and you wouldn't expect it to have a big following here, rather than in a community of Chick tract enthusiasts.

What makes you say that? HPMOR contains many hat-tips to other Harry Potter fanfics (Wastelands of Time, A Black Comedy, Getting the Hang of Thursdays, etc.) Also, the story contains a lot of tongue-in-cheek comedy about trends in the fanfiction community (OT3, the popularity of slash, etc.) Overall, I get the impression that EY enjoyed reading Harry Potter fanfiction and respects high quality fics.

But the stuff about slash and shipping, particularly early on, was the same tired old stuff you used to hear from people who would never deign to read fanfic and generally had a very low view of it. Hohoho fanfic is all fangirls writing yaoi. Like the fics where the author sticks in endless notes explaining that there is no slash or romance in this fic, no siree bob, and just to make sure let's have the characters have a vaguely homophobic discussion in which they make it clear that they aren't gay.

Well, I suppose this serves as an illustration of the degree to which you can't trust what you read on the Internet, if nothing else. A lot of times it's hard to refute the stuff that people make up, but at least this case is nicely, crisply refutable. Ch. 14 was posted pretty early on and contains a Getting the Hang of Thursdays reference, or let's see, Ch. 9 even before that and The Mysterious Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks... I'm trying to think of what HP fanfiction reference would be visible before Ch. 9... I suppose the reference to Atlantis in Ch. 7 would count as a Wastelands and/or a general fanon reference, but that's harder to prove. I could probably find something even earlier if I looked. References to other fanfics are ubiquitous throughout HPMOR, and indeed it's a story set in the world of Harry Potter *fanfiction* more than a story set in the original Harry Potter per se. I'd previously read tons of HP fanfiction, so that was the universe where HPMOR popped into my head.

None of those references were suggested to me; they're all fics I encountered on my own. Many of them appear in my Favorites on my FFN account here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong]]

The Internet is full of accusations that are hard to refute. It's worth paying attention when some of them are shown to be definitely, factually false. It should make you reconsider all the others, especially the ones that consist of vague, hateful assertions about an author's state of mind. Even if that was true, how would people come to know it? Are they telepaths?

My advice to OP is to try reading HPMOR, see if you like it, and absolutely ignore anything said on the Internet about what I had in mind or how I felt about J. K. Rowling or what my purpose was etcetera. Just blank all the angry screaming about the author out of your mind, look at the story as a story, try to follow what's going on in-universe, and forget all the allegations of invisible, unfalsifiable evil intentions going on behind the scene. I'm sad that so many people are coming into this fic with blatant lies about the author's grand malevolent intentions twisting their interpretation of what's meant to be fun and chaos. I meant the story as a story.

I also meant it to be enjoyed. If you don't enjoy a book, stop reading it and leave it to others to enjoy. Why can so many people not handle the thought of somebody else enjoying a book they didn't? Is the world so small?

Here's what should be said in response to OP's question (and I'm glad the top-voted comment here said more or less the same thing). Some people enjoy HPMOR a whole lot. Some people don't like it. Try reading some chapters. If it turns out you're in the former group, continue. If you're in the latter group, stop reading and spend the irreplaceable hours of your future existence experiencing something you enjoy instead of something you hate. If you're in the former group, don't post unmarked spoilers on the Internet, so as to preserve other people's future enjoyment. If you're in the latter group, don't tell other people that they're not allowed to enjoy it, so as to preserve their possible enjoyment.

There isn't so much happiness in the world that you should be trying to destroy every bit of it that doesn't gain 100% of your own personal approval. Some people really did like HPMOR a lot, they had some happier hours. I'm not sure I understand deep down the view where these moments of happiness are terrible and cannot be allowed to stand.

  Like, if you came across a Chick tract in which Harry Potter learns that he needs to pray the sinner's prayer and regularly attend a Baptist church, even if it had a few genuinely amusing moments it probably wouldn't fit well with other HP fanfic and you wouldn't expect it to have a big following here, rather than in a community of Chick tract enthusiasts.
#+end_quote

Look, I've read enough Chick tracts to know that in a Chick tract Harry would probably end up burning in hell and (probably) Hermoine would be the one repenting for her witchcraft and praying the sinner's prayer. Those things had a bit of a pattern to them and they would definitely single out Harry as the one who went to hell.

As a Christian I find them pretty abhorrent, but they were definitely weirdly engrossing to read back in the day (partly due to them being comics).

****** Hey, they had one where the literal anti-Christ humourously learnt about Jesus and repented: I think Harry has a chance in a more recent tract. I agree that they are weirdly engrossing, and many people enjoy reading them, but you wouldn't exactly expect them to fit in well in a Harry Potter fanfic forum rather than a discussion forum for people who bought into that brand of Christianity, and the plot and characterisation would always be sacrificed so that the point could be made. Any discussion of them in a HP fanfic community would be likely to upset Chick, if he were still alive and read such discussions.

​

I mean I can imagine a Chick tract version with Harry as the one repenting. It'd probably have Ron die and be the one burning in Hell (which would appeal to a much to large portion of this fandom) and Dudley as the one witnessing to him. It'd probably be Dudley or another Dursley in that role for any version.

​

But I still hold that it would be Harry. There's be a lot of material to use for when he is in Hell and asking why he is there after stopping Voldemort, etc.

Oddly enough, the author later made comments on reddit contradicting the explanation of magic that Harry came up with. EY might have meant it as an object lesson for why making a hypothesis that fits the observed evidence isn't enough. The hypothesis has to be tested, otherwise a different explanation might end up being the truth.

Its important to both understand those concepts (unlike a lot of the pseudoscience and hypotheses that are thrown in the story) and have characters who you can trust when they tell you about those new ideas. Instead, we get a lot of author tracts from Harry and Quirrell, neither of whom is a very reliable narrator, especially if you'r saying that the explanations of magic in the story are wrong.

For example, Harry's "experiment" about magic heritability was really weak (it was designed to make someone question their point of view rather than actually prove anything.)

  Dear "Deputy Headmistress McGonagall" (kindly note the air-quotes there)

  Let me first congratulate you on making me smile with regards to your insane letter regarding the impossible existence of magic, let alone the even-more impossible existence of a school where one can become a wizard -- or witch in the case of the /females of the species/.

  However, the only thing that amuses me about your pathetic excuse for fun and games is the creativity that must have gone into naming those books and creating such interesting topics. Now, don't get me wrong, I admire and appreciate LARPing as much as the next boy, but I have never had any ambitions to join any of them: whether they're Tolkien fans, Pratchett fans or even King fans, let alone the embarrassing LARPers who go around in Lucas' gear and call it normal.*

  So, if you want me to actually consider your joke even an iota of truth, it's going to take something truly spectacular; therefore, I cordially invite you to arrange the necessary proof and deliver it to my address on the anniversary of my birth: July 31st.

  If you convince me, I'll attend your "school" but if not, I have the names and addresses of several well-known therapists and psychiatrists who can help you keep your jokes in better taste.*

  As a wise man once said: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and, sorry, but even my hunger for knowledge and your amusing book titles barely qualify as that.

  Ball's in your court.*

  Yours sincerely,

  Harrison James Potter

Oh god, it starts with a key so you know which punction is thoughts and which is parseltongue, /just see how she handled it in the damn books!/ (Half Blood Prince is the one you want, one of the visits to Dumbledore's office).

Oh gosh, this is going to be awful isn't it.

Oh yes, just randomly italicise words for emphasis, that's not jarring at all. (Note to self: make sure not randomly italicising for emphasis in own fics).

I love the way the author has taken things Rowling actually did well and made me realise that by doing it badly. The whole way the Dursleys are shown to be abnormal being the main one so far.That and handling 'Thoughts' and //parseltongue//.

As was previously said, it was readable. I enjoyed some of the sillier bits that didn't take itself so seriously, but once it got into all the pseudoscience it got slowly more irritating to read, although by that point I had invested enough time into the fic that I wanted to finish it. Finishing, however, felt more trying to swallow a gross pill with only a tablespoon of water. It's doable, but it's uncomfortable and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

I personally really don't recommend it, but it does have a cult following so it is likeable by some.

From what I've gotten from this thread is if you go into it with an open mind, expecting to hate the main character, accepting the pseudoscience, and understanding that you really can't take it too seriously, you'll like it at least a bit.

For sure though, read a bit yourself and try it out. The first few chapters set the tone for the rest of the book well enough that if you don't like them you probably won't like the fic as a whole.

I wish you luck in deciding, as this sub sure enjoying hating HPMoR.

1. Does the idea of an AU where /everyone/ is much, much, *much* more intelligent than canon appeal to you?

2. Do discussions about science, rationality, materialism, metaphysical philosophy interest you and are you okay with long monologues on these topics?

3. Can you be okay with a somewhat smug, unreliable and socially inept protagonist, who's a brilliant thinker for an 11 year old and likes to consider himself an adult?

Another way to go about it might be to read EY's short story [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/n5TqCuizyJDfAPjkr/the-baby-eating-aliens-1-8]["Three World's Collide"]], which has nothing to do with HP, but might give you an idea whether you like his style.

It is a bit hit and miss. I think it's enjoyable from a novelty fan fiction stand point. It's a new idea, one I hadn't seen before and I like a long story that takes a fresh view of things.

"I was only joking around," Harry protested, as the sounds of hysterical laughter went on nearby. "Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted into Gryffindor! Joking around isn't enough to do that!" Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking breaths.

** Oh man... You just had to ask about /that/ one?

Just to be clear. I personally adored it. It has tons of problems, but I can't help but be in love with it despite that, i'm just the kind of person that really appreciate this story.

But as for if YOU want to read it... that's more complicated. This subreddit has a love/hate relationship with HPMOR, it is incredibly popular, but simultaneously incredibly niche. It helped spawn off an entire sub-genre of fanfiction and original stuff called "rational fiction", or "rationa/ist/ fiction" (there are few distinctions, but that's not all that important now.) For more of that see [[/r/rational][r/rational]] which absolutely *adores* MoR. It was formed as a reaction to that very fanfic, after all.

The writing isn't the best in the first 4 chapters, but thanks to its incredible popularity someone has already edited it and posted it themselves. Just the first four chapters though, as those are a bit more infamous. It's the same story, just better edited. Here's that link, btw.

exploring all that goes behind that intention is sort of a journey in and of itself, more than i care to explain fully within the confines of this reddit post

there is, or was, this whole sort of “rationalist” community thats built around the authors ideas, and it all ultimately leads to the leader who thinks that we have to prepare for the eventuality that a general aritificial intelligence will be created that will function as an ultimately powerful god and control all of our lives

** The biggest potential draw back to /methods/ is how "educational" it can be or tries to be, if happen to be very well-educated yourself. Harry values science and logic. It reflects in his decision making and our insight into his thought processes. Much of your time will be spent reading about scientific studies, psychologic experiments and (often completely internal) discussions about missing links in magical theory.

This can seem rather pretentious or preachy, and tends to screw with the text-to-time relation somewhat. The length of some stories do seem to just come down to how hard Harry needs to think to solve all the problems /just right/. The pacing handles more like a science fiction novel than a magical children's story, so previous experience reading that genre would /probably/ help.

If you can get past or enjoy the talks about science papers, you are in for a hell of a ride, my friend. Personally, I will heartily recommend /methods/ to anyone giving fanfiction a shot. I've been a serious bibliophile since age 5, and /methods/ convinced me that fanfiction was probably worth trying out at age 19. Hell, I got my 50-year old and equally bibliophiliac dad to read it, and he had a blast with it (though that guy eats books like I eat cheeseburgers). It manages to go through a wide span of different tones and themes, and manages to do most of them pretty well. There's humor, horror, drama, mentorship, intrigue, intrigue with your mentor and /plenty/ of mystery. It knows when it's time to screw around and suspend disbelief, and when to get serious, emotional and angsty as /shit/.

TLDR: Mostly pacing differences in comparison to other texts in general. Can be kind of boring or pretentious if you already know a lot of the scientific topics. Protagonist is comparable to Miles Vorkosigan, according to my dad.

The story was written by an actual genius, and it shows. If only so that you can experience such damn fine writing, reading it is worth it; it's better written than the vast majority of actual published fantasy novels I've encountered in the last few years.

Also... the actual story is pretty damn nicely good. Just saying.

For me, the problem with the fic is that HP's magic system and setting is whimiscal and well, magical. Finding "rational" explanations for every little thing just robs the magic from everything. And once some flaws are introduced into the priors, the conclusions become more and more wrong (IMHO) until I can't enjoy it as a "rational" take, I can't enjoy it as a more traditional whimsical tale, and so I can't enjoy it.

Clearly many others have enjoyed it, more power to them. But for those of us who did not, we have just as much right to tell people what we disliked about it, if only to save someone else who might have similar tastes a few hours of slogging through Terry Goodkind level didactic text.

Emotion, not logic or rationality.
