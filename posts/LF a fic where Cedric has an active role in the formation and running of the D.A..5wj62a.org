Cedric survives the graveyard and next year helps Harry/Ron/Hermione form the DA.

Anything like this?

*** I read the first couple of chapters and got turned off by a couple things that normally annoy me. These things were manifestations of what strikes me as overly protective paternalism. In particular [[/spoiler][Dumbledore insisting that Harry be kept completely in the dark about what's going on, and insisting that it isn't safe for Hermione to visit Cedric without an Order minder]].

Do these elements go away?

**** It's my favorite fic, Minisinoo is a professional writer and I think her work is among the best written in fandom.

Edit. Its sequel is unfinished it that turns you off, fair warning.

** I might be mixing it up, but try: Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) as well as Linkffn(Path of Decision) which is a Sandman crossover that requires no knowledge of Sandman, and is pretty good. Cedric had sort of a leadership role in the DA, along with Harry.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.
