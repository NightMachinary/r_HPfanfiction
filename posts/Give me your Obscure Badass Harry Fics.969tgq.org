I've read a lot of HP fics. A lot. Sometimes, it seems like all of the ones I come across I've already seen and am beginning to think that I've read all there is to be read with my pickiness. So I leave it to Reddit: Give me your out-there, obscure fics that I am most likely to not have read. Some constraints I would ask for: - A Harry-centric fic where he kicks ass and takes names, not under Dumbledore's thumb. - Maybe he learns some not known branch of magic, or possibly ancient magic? - Hopefully over 20k words, and not too far above 150k - Preferably complete, but I know many master writers quit before they get the recognition they deserve on their works - A pairing isn't necessary, but if there is one, maybe not Ginny? (Don't like her too much.) - The traditional bashing (Ginny, Ron, Molly, Dumbledore) is accepted (and expected with this type of fic, but it is not necessary) That's it. Hopefully some hidden gem will rear it's beautiful head at me with this. If you give me something amazing, thank you. If not, thanks for reading this far anyway. - Lord


** linkffn(Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath) fits all your constraits, no bashing. Writing is pretty good qualitywise also.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
