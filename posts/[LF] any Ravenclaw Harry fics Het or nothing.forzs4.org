So I'm looking for good Ravenclaw!Harry fics. Any Harry/female pairing is ok, no pairing is also good

Only requirements are that it's written decently and it's multichapter.

Thank you!

Have a good day.


** I'm pretty sure this is abandoned but is one of my favourites. Admittedly, it does get a bit iffy near the end, but it is outstanding at least up until the last 6 or so chapters. linkffn(12740667)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** Harry McGonagall is pretty good. Professor McGonagall decides, shortly after Dumbledore drops Harry at the Dursleys, that it doesn't sit right with her, so she goes back and gets him. She drops him with some relatives of hers and he gets raised by people who love him.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
