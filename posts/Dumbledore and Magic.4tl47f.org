I was thinking of attempting a Dumbledore mentors Harry fic, but I wanted to get a few bases down before I went into it seriously.

Magic-wise, I'm thinking of a system where magic is exhaustive, unlike the limitless canon approach. On top of that, by nature with most things, some wizards are stronger than others. I think that's more canon aligned as with Voldemort and Dumbledore.

For Dumbledore, I've written a few base scenes and he's an interesting character to say the least. Basically I want to know what you think 'his voice' is, and how to balance it with a mentor relationship.

Overall, I just don't want to hit any cliches and produce a sub-standard story.


** Really, what you have to ask yourself is what is your story offering that hasn't been done a million times already? What is so interesting about your magical system needs that you need to change it from canon? Are you changing it just for the sake of changing it, or are there specific plot elements that you wish to include?

*** I've seen this idea for magic before in fanfiction so it isn't unique, nor is it super interesting compared to canon. However plotwise I found it relevant for the scope of fights that were to take place, and Harry's personal character growth.

** Magical exhaustion is... unsubtle. And it's been done to death. I like the concept that casting doesn't cost you anything, it changes the nature of duels. Instead of being a war of attrition it becomes something like a chess game. Look at how Albus and Tom counter each other in their duel in book 5.

If you take the time to design a rock-paper-scissors type magic system you can write interesting combat where the reader understand the rules.

Just because casting doesn't tire you, doesn't mean that fighting doesn't. Running, dodging, injuries, adrenaline, all these things can offer everything Magical Exhaustion does with none of the draw backs. If Harry is duelling for his life, he should be getting his hair a little mussed.

*** I gave the headcanon and first law some light skimming, and I agree with what was said about, hard magic and light magic(I think I prefer the hard magic). I think I'm going to still keep magical exhaustion in there, because I don't building a million houses by magic in one day is feasible, but I won't mention it, like it will be indistinguishable from mundane tiredness and simply 'power'.

It depends on how much you care about canon-consistency, really.

In canon, what drives this "strength"? Both Voldemort and Dumbledore weren't just "strong", they were also geniuses with extraordinary drive to change the world to be more to their liking and unshakable confidence in their ability to do so, who also worked hard to get where they were. Conversely, the weakest wizards in canon (early Neville, Crabbe, Goyle, Lockhart) were lacking in either confidence or intelligence or had magic very closely aligned with their personality. Everybody else was somewhere in between, but nobody really stood out of the pattern: no wizards with low intelligence or weak emotional disposition who are nonetheless very powerful, for example, nor anyone brilliant and confident but weak. In fact, it's worth remembering that most of Neville's dramatic improvement in OotP happens /before/ he gets a new wand, from working hard and building up his confidence in DA.

So, non-magical traits (general intelligence, confidence, will, and personality, and just plain hard work) already explain so much of canon variation in "strength" of wizards, there isn't really much room for an arbitrary "strength" metric on top of that.

Canon Harry has a surfeit of will, his "proudly wearing his emotions on his sleeve", and his drive to protect all serve to empower his signature spell --- the Patronus --- and he is significantly above average in general magical ability, as a result of his above-average intellect, strong will (which hurts him as often as it helps), and no small amount of hard work --- even if he doesn't enjoy it. However, an AU Harry who could benefit from being mentored by Dumbledore --- a Dumbledore-grade genius /and/ a hard worker capable of mastering magic that only Dumbledore could teach --- would be a Harry in Name Only, IMO.

If it's a Naruto-style AU where everybody has an arbitrarily "chakra capacity" mostly set at birth that determines their power, all bets are off, of course.

*** I'd disagree with you there, on the point of canon wizards following mental strength = magical strength. The most standout for me is Hermione, clearly she's showcased as the most intelligent witch of her year, possibly moreso, and yet we don't see her as a 'mini-Dumbledore'.

On the point of Voldemort and Dumbledore I'd also disagree, yes they were intelligent and knew far more magic than most people, but one line has always stuck in my head from the ministry battle, it was when one of Dumbledore's spells crackled with power, which reinforced my idea that some people have more 'power' than others, though you can dispute how Dumbledore achieved his power, but I inferred from the narrative that he was always powerful, even in his youth.

For all my well-known pro-Hermione bias, I would never claim that she is anywhere in Dumbledore's league in terms of intellect. Dumbledore was a twice-in-a-century genius. Being smarter than anyone else in her Hogwarts class of about 40 would put Hermione around 99Â±1th percentile in general intelligence. Using the conservative (and nonsensical) figure of 3,000 wizards and witches living in Britain, that would mean that about 60 of them about as smart as her, and using the more sensible figure of 15,000, that's about 300. Certainly not a mini-Dumbledore.

Next comes personality and will. Hermione has the drive to make the world a better place --- whether the world wants it or not --- and confidence in her ability to do things she puts her mind to, and, indeed, when she opens a textbook and executes the instructions, before she even boards Hogwarts Express, the Universe obeys. Once she gets there, she is invariably the first in her year to learn a new spell when it's taught to everyone, as well as new magical techniques such as nonverbal casting and apparation. So, yes, she probably is the most powerful magical in her year in general-purpose magic.

But, the notable exception --- the Patronus Charm --- is also instructive: we don't know how long she would have taken to learn it had she joined Harry in his lessons with Remus, but facing down an actual Dementor, a socially conscious worrier like Hermione would falter: how can she ever be unconditionally happy in a world where House-Elves are enslaved and mistreated, where money and blood are worth more than truth, and where nobody ever gets an early start on their homework unless you nag them? Whereas Harry, who is braver and not as thoughtful can put these concerns out of his mind and /just feel/ the joy needed to sustain a powerful Patronus.

So, she actually fits the pattern perfectly.

To be precise, some /spells/ have more power than others, or at least have more impressive visual and auditory effects. :P

He was a genius who came to Hogwarts with the will to change the world for the Greater Good. His OWLs Transfiguration examiner claimed to see him do things with his wand that she's never seen before (IIRC). That sounds like skill and finesse to me, not sheer scale.
