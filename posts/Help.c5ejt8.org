#+begin_quote
  On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son and flee to France. She trained him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard. But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, Harry is forced to return to his once-home, and he finds himself engaged in a game he might not want to play.
