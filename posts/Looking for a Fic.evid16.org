Hi I'm looking for some good fics where Harry grows up in a good household. It could really be any household, as long as they're good to Harry. I just want good things for Harry :')


** Of course, I suggest linkao3(14078862), what did you expect?

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** And this ia the entire premise or just a side note? Many many fics have it but it's not the main issue.

Eg. Methods of Rationality

Edit: E.g.2 For the love of magic.

In both cases Harry grows on a better household, but that is nowhere near the central topic of the fanfic.
