So I was thinking about writing postwar fics, but I can't think of a good antagonist which isn't just the same shit again. Voldemort returning, Death Eater loyalists, a pureblood KKK, it is basically still the same conflict which happened in the books already.

An economic crisis is not really likely since there was no massive government war debt which strangles the nation akin to RL Britain and no massive reparations akin to Weimar Germany. Also, taxation and ledgers don't make good antagonists.

So what would be a good, NEW antagonist for Harry and co to face let's say a decade after the war?


** A goblin rebellion. Shockingly, I haven't come across a single finished fic with this as the main plotpoint, although maybe that is because it would take A LOT of worldbuilding to make it work.

You could choose between having very much nasty goblins and more likeable goblins. If you choose the former it can become a nice action fic where you explore the usage of different types of magic in battle etc. The latter on the other hand could lead to a more serious fic which questions the wizarding world's morals.

  A goblin rebellion.
#+end_quote

One side has wands, the other does not. Since we know that Goblins are susceptible to the Imperius and have no comparable counter, that won't last long.

And to make things even more one-sided, with the advancement of firearms, the gap between what Goblins can come up with and what wizards (and especially Muggleborn) can field gets even larger. Hermione can go shopping in the arsenals of the former Warsaw pact, the Goblins cannot.

**** You could set it post an act that gives goblins (and other non-humans) wands. Like there is a wave of progressive laws post-war, the goblins get wands, still think they're being treated unfairly (correctly or incorrectly) and then rebel. It would be up to the author to even the playing field.

Unless they wanted to right a misery piece about how horrible and unjust the war was and just have it be hugely uneven, but that sounds like a different fic than what you want.

They would not be on the same level as wizards, even after a decade, and the average wizard was already laughable. What you described might work as an "adult next-gen" antagonist, but not for Harry's generation in their prime.

****** Here's a plot for you, following the war and Hermione's progression to Minister, with the help of Harry and his influence she begins to make changes to the world. Owning a house elf is illegal and they must be employed for their services. Werewolves, vampires, veela, muggleborn, pureblood, goblins, centaurs, giants etc all have the same rights and are equal.

This leads to the goblins rebelling to overthrow the wizarding world through a seties of assassinations only made possible by the access they now have to the wizarding world. Harry manages to survive and save Hermione and they work to stop the Goblins destroying the world.

Alternatively the usual plot for a post war is that muggles discover and declare war on the magical world.

How? Given how cowed they were by Voldemort, it seems unlikely that they have the capacity to actually impose their rule even with regular magic. I can see goblin terrorists or economic warfare, but actual goblin rule is as far-fetched as Poland conquering the world in 1939. After all, from what we see in canon, Harry is the strongest wizard around after the war by a good margin (Voldemort, Grindelwald and Dumbledore were far superior, Bellatrix and the like about equal if I had to guess). He could end the rebellion singlehandedly unless you come up with some kryptonite, which always feels cheap. Even if you give Goblins wands, it would take them a decade to catch up to the immediate postwar situation, and the magical world would have mostly recovered at that point (and the wizards have a hard core of veterans from that war, even with their dead. Combat experience is far more important that weapons/tools).

Unless they willingly first strike their major cities with nukes, muggles have no chance due to the imperius curse alone. At which point they will rule over ruins.

And why would Muggles declare an unprovoked war on something they cannot defeat.

** A Muggleborn dark lord, who had suffered greatly in the 1970s, fled for another country, built up a massive business empire and massive network of Magical exiles in the Muggle world, has just taken down the MACUSA and massacred its leadership.

A few survivors are asking the Kingsley Administration for assistance, claiming this new dark lord will soon have the US Muggle government under his/her control and may employ nuclear weapons against Wizards.

Representatives from the new MACUSA, however, claim that they would absolutely abide and honor the Statute of Secrecy. They further state that the core reason for taking down the previous MACUSA administration was their extreme corruption and their increasing inability to maintain the SoS. Chaos ensue at ICW. They further ask world Ministries to extradite surviving members of the previous MACUSA for their various 'crimes'.

Unable to come to a decision, Hermione volunteers to go on a "fact finding mission" in the USA, only taking Dean Thomas and few other Muggleborns with her. Ginny is faking her presence in Britain under the Polyjuice.

** First of all, you should avoid the dark trap of all adventure/fantasy stories: my story must be more dramatic than the previous one, my heroes and my antagonist must be more significant than the previous one. It is not enough to save hero's girlfriend, now you must save whole village. It is not enough to save a village anymore, now you must save New York. Next time it is whole nation, whole Earth, universe, and some stories went even beyond that. The end result is a disaster like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame][Avengers: Endgame]], which is just the catwalk show of all of their heroes and antagonists without any story and any characters. And yes, it is just an evidence of the total depravity of humanity (as if we haven't got enough of them) that this silliness was the highest grossing film of the series (well, I haven't seen any other of them, so I can still keep hope that other ones were less stupid than this one).

So, whenever you read “worse than Voldemort”, run away, somebody is victim of this syndrome. Even linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) fell into this trap, and it is the first fanfiction story I've read, which persuaded me that it is possible for amateurs to write for free literature worthy of reading. Fortunately, the adventure story there is just in the background keeping Harry busy, it is not central of the whole story. And some sub-stories of it are genuinely good.

My point is that you don't need literally the Earth being shattered to carry on your story, because the story is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][the only thing which matters]]. Who cares for the fate of Romeo and Juliet other than few of their bereaved relatives? And couple of hundred millions of happy viewers.

Having said that, there is still a lot of what could be the plot of post-war adventure story (like any time in the human history):

- hunting runaway Death Eaters, e.g., linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian),
- other resolving some post-war issues: I hoped for somebody to rewrite “Augurey” into something like that ... [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g0hwbu/augurey_revisited/]] (ignore the inane Harmony-related discussion below, that was not the point),
- you still can have regular detective stories like linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian;M.I.T.: Muggle Interface Team - Haunted House: Dead by Northumbrian), it is actually what linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) is all about as well,
- and any other plot for any other story you can imagine.

I always liked the idea of the ancient past coming back; all we know of the Founders era is basically that there was 4 of them who started a school. What about some Dark Lord from 600 years ago making a return? Or his/her ghost instructing a young person how to be evil?

Centaur's bows do seem to have magical properties, they seem to function a little bit against shields from deathly hallows. Magical creatures definitely do pose a threat to the average wizard, if far less than another wizard would. They can't win a protracted conflict, but they can cause panic and fear. Acromantula may be easy to kill for anyone with a NEWT in defense, but they're still scary as fuck.

What they can do is throw the wizarding world in chaos, especially with a few nudges from wizards in the right place to support the shape shifting wizard.

**** so make magical creatures competent too, all these creatures are magical and have been around for thousands of years to create their own types of magic.

Merepeople are powerless alone but in groups they perform powerful rituals to protect themselves, the merepeople build incredible protections over their home and become a base of operations for other creatures.

Goblins have been at war with dwarves since the two nations began, incredible war machines are in the possession of the goblins and dwarves who can level cities in minutes if they are worling together.

Centaurs may not be the most powerful warriors but they information they can predict is vital to the effort of the magical creatures. They srmtay back from the front line and council on the best actions to take.

Werewolves are still wizards and witches themselves who are often forced into the muggleworld to survive, they are knowledgeable of muggle technology and have warned the other creatures to be cautious and have plans to counter it. When not in wolfy form they are soldiers, medics and help in other roles.

What you described is massively over-buffing the opposition to give them a fighting chance since they would be slaughtered in a straight-up fight. I mean, your goblin solution is literally nukes in spirit if not in letter. That alone is enough to ensure a pretty unchallenged rule of terror for them. And you turned centaurs from "vague, pointless predictions" to "sees the future".

Basically, what you are saying is that a baby could beat a heavyweight boxer if you gave it a 5-ton exoskeleton and an AI to operate that. At which point it is no longer the baby, but the author devices which win the day. And the author aid has to be too strong to be believable in order for them to win.

**** I'm thinking politics, as MoM has been independent for years and it only led to a civil war and the rise of Wizard-Nazi. And obviously Wizards sucks at politics and democracy. The English Government would probably want to act and absorb what remain of the wizard community. They already experienced multiple wars so they would have a lot of good ideas and a solid plan for rebuilding wizarding britain.

In theory, the two communities could exchange manpower for rebuilding, medical technics, history books, and so much more.

In reality each would try to overpower/absorb/erase/abuse the other community and prevent the other to reciprocate. Wizarding world is broken, but still more powerful because of magic, Muggle world is suspitious after discovering that magic is real, but have the numerical superiority and technology. Each would try to take advantage of the other, without pushing too much so that the other don't attack. Each have the ability to crush the other. I'm thinking Cold War, invisible threats, spies and tensions everywhere.

Imagine religion, science, art, and how the knowledge that magic is real would influence it. Imagine the discrimination toward parents of mugglebornes.

Now think bigger. The war stopped in may 98. A month later the European bank opens. How the other countries in Europe would react? How would the European union and the launch of a new European money be impacted by the disappearence of Secrecy?

I think the first thing that comes to mind is obviously "muggle have guns. They can start a war and shoot wizards". Yeah. But there is so much more than that. It also depends on how much you stick to the muggle lore of the books. I personnaly hate how muggles are all describes as stupid, violent, or both. So I don't think muggles would instantly think "oh wow. Wizards exists. Let's murder them". Why would they try to kill wizards when they can use them?
