So here's a thought that I never quite came across a concrete answer to.

Do the petrification victims stop aging when they freeze up?

I mean, that would make sense given the nature of the affliction, but I feel like that would have been a bigger deal for someone like Colin who was under for like six months.


** I would think I that aging would stop when you're petrified. Since it stops all functions your body wouldn't change any. Hair/nails don't grow, bladder doesn't fill, and you don't get hungry or process anything.

Likewise, I don't believe that once the petrification ends that the person catches up the time they missed. That would be wild.

Basically I think if a 12 year old was petrified for 20 years, he'd be 12 with no effects other than mental strain when he realized how long he'd been out.

** I actually had this idea previously that a tamed basilisk has medical use. Petrification is the wizard version of cryonic suspension.

Get your lower body blown off on the battlefield? A trained medical basilisk wearing a mirror hat petrifies you so that you can be fixed up later.

4th son of a noble house with no chance to inherit? Get petrified and have an enchanted floating vial of mandrake potion ready to restore you if your house dies out and you're the only one left to inherit everything. You're basically teleporting to the future.

**** Killing is easy. There's lots of ways to kill.

Like seriously, any death eater could have tossed a fiendfire into Harry's bedroom at hogwarts whenever they wanted. The only reason he wasn't instagibbed is because Voldemort wanted theater and never really took him seriously.

Healing, indefinitely preserving a living person, teleporting to the future, these things are not so easy.

Cock a doodle doo.

Also, only parselmouths can control basilisks (per Fantastic Beasts) and there's not so many of those. So likely the person attempting to deploy the basilisk gets killed too.

Well, you could always learn the language the old-fashioned way. It would take rather a lot of effort and talent, but it's an option.

You could also have just the one or two Parselmouths worldwide who demand great pay to come around for a few minutes and order each would-be-Basilisk-master's Basilisk to always obey said client.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

**** And since she was only using it to take two extra classes (right?), we can roughly assume 180 days in a school year with a max of two hours per class equals out to a rough max of 44 days gained. So it sounds like it cancels out more than you'd think.
