:END:
So as I was looking for something to read, I stumbled upon linkffn(Learning to Breathe by onoM), which reminded me of a story I read a long time ago with a similar premise. Harry was raised by Sirius, Remus, Tonks, and Moody to be a soldier, but he wasn't very good at social interaction. I can't recall why, possibly a marriage contract? But he was introduced to either Daphne or Susan and whoever it was helped him adjust to normal life. I'm also fairly certain that Voldemort wasn't yet defeated in this one, and that reason along with the pairing in Learning to Breathe being Ginny is why I don't think its that. Honestly, I'm having doubts on whether this even exists, but does it sound familiar to anyone?

**** It was so long ago that I don't remember. It starts with Harry on the train in 6th or 7th year and he's only there to learn what he's fighting for. Harry appears at balls and gatherings and takes out death eaters who try to kidnap people. I remember there being scenes of obstacle courses?

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

******* Sadly Hermione is too young in this story to properly bite the adults heads off. If I were Lily and James, I would never speak to Sirius and the others again for how they raised Harry.
