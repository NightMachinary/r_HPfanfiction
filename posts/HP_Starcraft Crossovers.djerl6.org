This might be a bit of a stretch. I've never seen this type of crossover before, yet I'm curious if there are fics from this category.

A Ghost MC? A Templar/High Templar MC shooting out psyonic storms? A Dark Templar MC? Or maybe a Zerg MC greater than the Queen of Blades?

Are there fics out there set in this universe?


** Catalyst on FF? Obs: First post, dont know How to link the right way.

#+begin_quote
  When Abathur, Evolution Master of the Swarm, is cornered by Terran forces, he believes he is about to die. Across the galaxy, a last ditch summoning ritual tries to find something that could fight Voldemort. Neither of these events go as expected. Now Abathur, trapped in the body of a Terran, must rebuild the swarm on his own, and attempt to avoid getting killed in the process.

** The tag you want is "Request." Can't say I've seen any such fics, but I'll be watching this thread with great interest.

*** Actually according to the list that is presented before you post, this is the proper flair. It's supposed to be “Seeking Recommendations”.

** Most Harry Potter / SC crossovers have emphasis on Zerg over literally anything else. They either become zergfics and just Zerg everything into the Zerg or it's catalyst.
