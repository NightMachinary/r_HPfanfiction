** I'm not sure if this counts, but my protagonist here has self-esteem issues and no friends. Things do not work out well for him.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

*** Thanks for the rec, but Harry in canon does not seems particularly shy nor especially socially awkward, unconfident and dense at best. He's actually incredibly well-rounded for someone with such shitty childhood.

Although some canon characters like Neville or Ginny in her first years fit the description.
