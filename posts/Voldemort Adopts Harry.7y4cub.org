  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

** Sounds like you are describing this fic: voldemort adopts harry because he needs a parselmouth heir to take the title of lord slytheryn. Thus, so he can pursue politics

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
