  Dedicated to my friends in the Teachers' Lounge. Lord Voldemort's attempt to possess the soul of Ginny Weasley was successful, but his triumph was not without consequence. Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts.

** Linkffn(The counterfeit cousin by Tsume Yuki) is about diary!Tom picking up Harry pretending to be his cousin.

It's probably abandoned, but I don't think it ended in a cliff hanger.

  In which Lucius Malfoy decides to off a political opponent with a little black book and Tom Riddle finds himself with a new body and a lot of catching up to do. Of course, the orphan beneath the stairs is just happy that a family member finally came to rescue him. A Tom adopts Harry, somewhat dark fic.

** Linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders by severusphoenix) has diary Tom become a fairly important character. He's still not a 'main' one, per se, but he's very present and very much a player in the plot.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

** Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) has a diary!Tom as a main plot point. I'm in the middle of another fic where he's one of the main characters, but I can't remember the name. I'll keep looking for it.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
