On mobile so sorry for formatting.

Okay. So I've been on ao3 and looked through there options and I got really frustrated. Every other story is either non-con or crack. Nothing wrong with that, you do you boo but I want a deeper story. I want more romance, more wooing and love. Stories I want (obviously you don't need to check all of these boxes, just one is fine)

Voldy has to be the one pursuing Harry, if possible. Love gift, presents, letters , the whole shabang. Bonus points if Harry isn't at all receptive and Voldy grows on him as time goes by.

Kidnapping story's are some of my favorite, provided they don't have non-con in them. Bonus points again if Harry was kidnapped to save him from something.

Arranged marriages fics are my lifeblood , again bonus points if Harry doesn't like it in the beginning but his husband woos him to his side.

Betrayed Harry running to supportive Voldy is also good. Doesn't matter who betrayed him. I'm a sucker for some good angst + hurt/comfort .

Basically any story you think is a good showing of what a real health relationship between these two might be.

Thanks for any suggestions.


** The closest thing I can think of is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27497785/chapters/67238704][Death Never Stopped Me Before by ElliahRose]]

It has lots of Voldemort attempting to court Harry.

Edit: Still can't get fanfic bot to work.

  “Oh my love,” Voldemort sighed. “Aren't you tired of this endless running? You don't look well. All this writhing in the dust like a hunted animal doesn't suit you.” Harry struggled against the binds keeping him in place, his breaths coming out in sharps pants as he twisted away from his touch. He's a monster, he reminded himself, forcing himself not to think about how gentle he could be with him. How much he missed his touch. You need to run from him, run far, far away. You are in the middle of a war! “I'm tired of chasing,” Voldemort continued, stepping closer to Harry's struggling form. “Of indulging this little game of yours. Let's stop pretending there's anywhere you could run where I would not find you.” He paused in front of Harry and knelt down, a hand reaching out to caress his cheek possessively. “Let's stop pretending you want to be anywhere but my arms, hmm?” “Go to hell!” Harry spits, jerking away from his touch. “I'm not yours!” “And that, my love, is where you're wrong,” Voldemort said with a crazed smirk. “Nothing, not even death, could keep me from you. You always have and always will belong to me!” *Expanded summary inside*

  Voldemort has won. Hogwarts and England are his, but satisfaction is fleeting when Harry Potter, who vanished during the battle, begins to appear in his dreams, fighting for survival in a frigid waste land. As Voldemort grows close to Harry, murderous intent gives way to lustful desire and when he succeeds in bringing Harry back from the Drift, their lives are irrevocably changed forever.

  "This room is the perfect size for a tree,” Harry says. “A tree?” Tom asks, dubious. “Yeah,” Harry says. When he gets no response, he looks up over his shoulder to see Tom is watching him with furrowed brows. “You know, a Christmas tree.”He looks toward the corner of the room, which is bare but for a spare chair that no one ever uses. Tom follows Harry's gaze then asks, voice flat, “Why?”  In which Harry remembers a promise he made to himself long ago and decides it's time to fulfill it. AKA: In which Harry and Tom decorate a Christmas tree together. Eventually.
