** A lot of the names are 'distinctly British', as in, have strong Scottish, Irish, or Welsh roots. Others are just whimsical enough to be considered magical. There's often symbolism involved.

** I can't find the original post, but I found this google doc on this sub a while back and have found it useful for naming characters: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzgkqj9aJ4o1DPOWmruWMWEdOl1rnmkRnFt7kJIejnU/edit#gid=0]]

A lot of the older characters have names from Greek/Roman mythology (which makes a lot of sense considering JKR's education) - Minerva, Sybill, Aurora, Pomona, Remus, Quirinus, Merope etc.

** Uhh... /Points to Sally Smith of the Original Forty/ Even Rowling had some average sounding names.

*** Aren't the Wizarding Smiths descendants of Helga Hufflepuff ?

**** Yes, but Smith is one of the most common surnames in the English language, so Sally could just as easily be a Muggleborn Smith.

***** I like the idea of Sally being a Hufflepuff who tries to make friends with Zacahrias since they have the same surname while he tells her to piss off and struggles not to say the m-word

** To be honest, much of what you are describing sounds like what is called Apophenia. You know which are purebloods, and which are muggleborns, and you accept that these are just 'right,' even if there isn't necessarily any reason to do so. As an example, many in Western cultures find the mythology and names in japanese anime as 'exotic' and 'mystical', but this is mostly due to not being exposed to it all their lives. Not trying to insult you, but I find its useful to take a step back and consider, as a whole, why I or others conclude something that doesn't necessarily follow logically.

Realistically, most of the major families have names that would not be out of place in modern Britain. The ones that seem...more outlandish I suppose (ex. Dumbledore, Flitwick, etc.) seemingly had a tendency to appear earlier in the books. Its rather funny because the more outlandish the name, the more likely the person was to be either a bad guy or notable magically (or one of the bad guys - see Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, etc.). This is doubled down on too when we find out Tom Riddle changed his name to the stranger "Voldemort" because of how muggle his name sounded. But names have a tendency in Harry Potter to be indicators of character importance and role (in FF as well).

In general though, I would say the names are probably related to what muggle culture each descends or traces to. For example, the Malfoy's may claim Norman or French ancestry due to the nomenclature. But the strangeness of the names can best be seen as the length of the lineage prior to our current date.

Just some thoughts. Cheers.
