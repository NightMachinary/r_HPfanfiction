** I've never seen it before, but I only found this subreddit a month or two ago when I was disappointed with Cursed Child (yes, took forever to get around to reading it--did not have high hopes) and looking for recs--would never have read it without your link here!

 

I was active in fandom ~2003-2006ish, so to me most of the "what is fanfiction?" seemed rather strange --it's a very simple and pretty obvious concept. Overall I would have liked more links and less commentary in general. /Why/ there are so many evil Dumbledore or Draco in leather pants or super!harry fics isn't nearly as interesting to me as "What ones are good?" and "Do I like them?". To me the cliche/trope section is best conveyed with a glossary type section--trope or pairing + 1 line/link of description + rec (or rec thread link), but that is an insane amount of work.

 

Actually, I'm not actually sure the cliche section is necessary at all, because cliches aren't always advertised in the summary or chapter one so they aren't necessarily more helpful than the spelling/grammar/initial characterization in distinguishing the good from the bad (and for an audience of new readers all the cliches are new--even if I now avoid Gray!Harry like the plague, the first several I read were entertaining). Your section on finding good fic--search by favorites/reviews, see what authors you like like, search for rec lists here and elsewhere--is, I think, much more helpful to your ostensible intended audience.

 

Two small things--I was surprised not to see fictionalley mentioned in the list of sites. They don't seem to be very active now, but I remember their quality/chaff ratio being generally higher than ff.net's. Also there is no link to 'My Immortal' when the intro mentions bad fic--this seems to be a severe oversight. The graph stefvh mentioned also sounds cool if it exists.

 

Thanks for writing the intro. I generally preferred lj and other smaller sites to ff.net for harry potter and learning about scryer is helpful.

*** My mother gave me the script as a christmas gift (she even took the time to pick it in english instead of French, since she knows I prefer reading in the former language) I have yet to open the cover.

I'm sort of scared/reluctant, especially since I heard about Delphine.

#+begin_quote
  There are other characters that get the pity treatment as well, such as Draco and Snape, who are made out to be sad and lonely instead of twisted murderers.
#+end_quote

Draco didn't murder anyone.

I would add that Draco and Snape are way too complex (like many main characters) to be simply tagged as 'twisted murderers' but that's my simply opinion. I agree with the pity treatment though.

#+begin_quote
  ex: Amelia Bones is a fan creation in all but name and title...
#+end_quote

We know quite a bit about Amelia (name, family, job, attitude, looks and even death). I would have used Daphne Greengrass as example. She's simply mentioned in the book (we don't even know how she looks like) but she's HUGE in the fanfiction world.

And I've been here since the start of the year and I didn't notice the Intro. I just saw it. I always thought it was the button that brought us to the front of the subreddit (as as clicking on the HP Fanfiction). In hindsight, I realise that it was a kinda stupid assumption on my part.

And good job for writing that introduction. It's helpful.

*** I won't lie, that particular section is almost entirely opinions, and I count his his actions in book 6 as close enough, not to mention whatever else you can imagine took place off-screen. I also choose to completely ignore anyone who tries to defend a character who abuses a child from age 11 to age 16, regardless of their motives. Snape appeared to be a trusted lieutenant of Voldemort's before he even killed Dumbledore, and I imagine the support he'd have to give to achieve that are not limited to the occasional sleeping drought.

Regardless, thanks for taking a look at it. If you find anything else that is disagreeable, excessive, or missing, I'll be sure to look at it.

**** I don't agree but I understand. I edited my post to add a comment about Amelia Bones and about the link in the top box.

And like I said, good job for that intro. Cheers.

***** Hm I suppose Daphne would have been the better choice there. I don't know why I chose Bones as the example.

Name: Amelia Bones | Daphne Greengrass\\
Family: Edgar + Susan | Astoria\\
Job: DMLE Director | Student\\
Appearance: described clearly | nothing at all\\
Attitude: Described clearly | just that she was in Pansy's gang\\
Death: Killed by Volde | unknown

You're definitely right there. Do you think it's worth changing? Even with Cursed Child I think Amelia's name will get more recognition, if that makes any sense at all.

Not really. I was only wondering if there was any particular reason that you chose Amelia. I agree that Amelia would be recognised so that does help in a certain way.

****** Notably, in fanon, Daphne is generally /not/ in Pansy's gang, and her attitude is not as consistent as Amelia's, if that makes a difference.

  abuses a child
#+end_quote

I don't think he was abusing Potter really. Calling him a celebrity and an idiot wasn't just to Potter; it was how he taught (albeit he's not a great teacher). Also, Snape saved Harry's life countless times during the books (Broom Incident, Shrieking Shack, etc.)

#+begin_quote
  twisted murderer
#+end_quote

Draco didn't kill anyone, and Dumbledore literally told Snape to kill him. Also, they are in a war, and I think there is a difference between murder and fighting for your life.

  While fanfiction did see another boom in 2007 and again in 2010, the release of the final book and movie respectively
#+end_quote

The final movie, DH2, was released in July 2011, not 2010.

Also, I'm wondering if it would be an idea to include a graph of the number of fics posted each year starting from the beginning of the Three Year Summer (2000). I'm quite sure that someone a while ago posted this here.

It was 115,000 last I checked. AO3 is growing fast. I don't know if the other figures are up to date.
