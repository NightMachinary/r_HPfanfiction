I'm in the mood to read some great Weasley family stories. I'd rather it be focused on the Weasley's, or if not then there are several good moments with the Weasley's through out the story. So say it's Harry's point of view, that's fine just as long as the Weasley's have some good moments in it.

Bonus points if Bill and Charlie are in the story, even if it's just for a little bit or through out the story would be great either way.

Anyone can be the main character not just Harry, so if one of the Weasley's were the main character for instance that would be even better.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Any Era. (Meaning it could focus on Molly and Arthur when they were younger as well).

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No character bashing, no Harems, no super smart or super powerful Harry, a little smarter or a little more powerful then he was in canon is fine just don't make it unbelievable.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine.

** If you don't mind that its fem!Ron, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl series]] features the Weasleys in very good roles.

Bill and Charlie appear as kids in the "Leapling" prologue, which features a seven-year-old Charlie as the POV character. Charlie also appears in a couple of chapters in "Weasley Girl."
