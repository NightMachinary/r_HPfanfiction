** "meets" implies that they don't know each other. But I don't think that Harry did not introduce his children to Luna as they grew up.

** He spoke the password he was given from his head of house Professor Longbottom. "Wrackspurt" a term Albus was all to familiar with, growing up with his eccentric Aunt Luna popping by whenever she wasn't running Hogwarts or on another one of her crazy adventures. As he was guided up the rotating staircase, he couldn't help but worry he had gotten into trouble already. The sound of his 'Aunts' voice calling through the open office door, and the smile on her face as he walked in dispelled all worries he might have had.

Sitting in the chair opposite her desk was someone Albus wasn't expecting to see for a few months. His father gave him a kind smile, and a pat on the back as Albus took the seat Luna pointed to. His nerves came back in full force, but his father revealing his invisibility cloak and the serious expressions on both his Father and the Headmistress' face told him this wasn't going to be the ordinary first year he expected..

*** I could see her retiring or at least training someone to take her position maybe after James Sirius Potter graduated or something to that affect? That way she could be there for a good portion of the new batch of Weasley's, as well as at least one more Potter.

** I'd imagine that the Weasley and Potter kids would know Luna Lovegood. My goodness, the Next Gen would be so well acquainted by a ton of influential people!

I do want to read stories based on that, like what it's like to be around a bunch of famous/well known people? Probably wouldn't even phase them, or they probably wouldn't consider them famous.

Like with Neville Longbottom, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and such, wouldn't consider them famous, while outsiders would.
