I think it was a story where magic was harder to use and you needed actual components to cast spells, like how it works for potions. I don't remember much about the story besides that, I think Harry might have not needed the components to cast, but I'm not sure if that's just my mind bleeding all the wandless magic Harry stories over into this one.

I think Hermione was a pretty important character in the story too.


** Sounds like a D&D styled fic, so I assume it's linkffn(8096183). Last time I read it there was only 8 chapters, so who knows

** Was it, like, a medieval fantasy AU? I think I remember the fic you're talking about if so... I think Neville Longbottom was the son of the King of magical Britain?

*** That's not quite it, though I do like that story. I don't think the one I was thinking about was that unique of a world.
