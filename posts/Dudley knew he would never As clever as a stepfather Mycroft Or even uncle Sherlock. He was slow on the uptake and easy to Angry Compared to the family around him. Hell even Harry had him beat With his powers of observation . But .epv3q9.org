Uncle Sherlock Had taught them both to box, Harry was ahead shorter than him but quick on his feet. While Dudley was big for his age and had a right hook that could bring down an ox. Dudley was the Peace keeper of the family if you could believe that, Quick to Anger , But with a temper that fizzled out just as fast, He couldn't hold a grudge to save his life, And he could actually talk to ordinary people without losing his mind. He had become a go-between for his uncle and brothers and the rest of the world. The Holmes family User-friendly interface if you will, His passion was boxing But his mother still insisted he sit his GCSEs At Eton And Go on to Oxford or Cambridge. It didn't matter to her which, His father , Mycroft insisted He was bright enough when he applied himself. He said Dudley could blend into the crowd. Better than most young man and the boy's skill at street level spy We're still a point of pride for his father, Most boys learn how to ride a bike from their father, Dudley and harry learned Sleight of hand and And how to do a proper dead drop in broad daylight.

Harry had the advantage with his magical skills, But Dudley Could actually work computer without frying the motherboard, this fact hit harry Particularly hard. When the newest game system came out, Mycroft refused to replace them More than eight times a year. Limiting Dudley snd Harry's Technological gameplay. They both learned multiple foreign languages at the drop of a hat( it paid To grow up in a household where your father would randomly curse in Bulgarian, If you wanted to learn the good swearword you had to pick up quick, Because by the next week he would be on to Latin and Greek.).

As they grow older, Dudley and Harry's Educational paths Diverged One went to Hogwarts the other to Eton College . Both still loved by their parents, They remained in constant contact via owl mail ( By halfway through Dudley's first time at Eton. He had gained a reputation as a skilled fighter And a bit of a maverick. He was mad lad who trained an owl to deliver mail between him and his brother.)

After years of the education wore on Harry and Dudley's Provided them both with a Much needed outlet. Harry. Sent Dudley. Meticulously thought out study schedule courtesy of his dear friend Hermione, Dudley with the help of his circle of friends would provide the scientific research Harry Occasionally needed, It turned out a basilisk Died just as easily from a Molotov cocktail to the head As it did with the sword into the brain. Harry had to do some fast talking to cover that one up especially when Dumbledore sent professor Snape down To collect the carcass for potion ingredients . That incident in their second year resulted in their father hiring bodyguards for both the boys, both school Unfortunately refused to Allowed them on the grounds , Both headmaster Witherspoon of Eton and Dumbledore have refused to bend in the face of their father's fury Instead A compromise was found Both Harry and Dudley. Would be allowed to keep the guard dog With them at school, Dudley the luckier of the two got snickerdoodle as His trusty companion, While Harry got to Pick out a large dog from the local Kennel. He ended up picking a massive black dog that Anthea called a Grimm The first time she laid eyes on it. The massive black dog was christened Sniffles that day .

Dudley observed as the days we t on And odd intelligence Behind snuffles eyes. He stuck to harry like glue and Protected his back Almost as if the dog expected an attack.
