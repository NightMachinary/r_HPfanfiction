what theme would you go with if you were asked to redesign the HP covers?

I was thinking about how the Knight bus would fit much more for the third book cover, since the first and second are the train and the car. and that made me think a continuous theme would be better than just covers that correspond to the actual book. It could be characters or places, beasts, houses, objects (that is for the adult versions of the books)

I would go with dark creatures:

1: troll

2: basilisk

3: dementor

4: grindylow or the dragon

5: thestral

6: inferius

7: nagini


** Places could be interesting...

1: Hogwarts

2: Burrow

3: Hogsmeade

4: Graveyard

5: Grimmauld Place

6: Cave

7: Godric's Hollow OR Forbidden Forest

** Or you could do the objects (similiar to British adult covers)

1: Stone or Sorting Hat

2: Diary or Sword

3: Marauder's Map

4: Goblet of Fire

5: Prophecy

6: Pensieve

7: Deathly Hallows

** Doorways/Archways

1: Third Floor corridor or The Mirror of Erised

2: The Chamber of Secrets door

3: The tunnel under the whomping willow or the shrieking shack.

4: The maze entrance

5: The ministry entrance, the department of mysteries corridor, or the death arch

6: The cave entrance

7: The gates of Hogwarts
