Can anyone please send fanfics where Hermione is not a close friend of Harry's. I am looking for some variety where another strong female character takes the place of hermione like sets say Susan Bones for example.

** The Darkest House, the Brightest Witch (or maybe it's The Brightest Witch, the Darkest House. I can never remember) replaces Hermione with a different brilliant young muggleborn, with 1 major difference- her father is involved in some manner of organized crime, and she inhereited his attitude that it's only against the rules if you get caught.

** Laocoon's Children - copperbadge

It's a Harry in Slytherin AU, but he's written as pretty likeable. Unfinished series, but there's two and a half longfics and all the background “Stealing Harry” AU to get into.

I have a hard time with Hermione. Mostly on the grounds that “smart” is a single trait and not a whole personality. (I'm currently writing a Hogwarts Yr 8 longfic, and I've had to send her and Ron to Australia to rescue her obliviated parents because I just can't enjoy writing either of them!)
