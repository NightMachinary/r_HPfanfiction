** You don't have any more preferences? Because they most be thousends out there (of which of course the overwhelming majority is garbage). And have you already read the "standard".

If not, linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) is propaply the most known time travel fic. Harry, ROn and Ginny back into first year, a good one.

Then there is linkffn(Delenda Est) Harry/Bellatrix. It is often recommend, I personally could never finished it as it has two point which in my opinion destroy everything build so far, but I know many here disagree so you might like it.

Than there is of course linkffn(Wastelands of Time) with Harry the Time Warrior. It is not the normal "go back in time" but in the end, it is the best time travel fic the fandom can offer. Exepct maybe...

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) a beautiful journey of Jasmin Potter. She lives for 5000 years and we see her regaining her memories and raising Merlin, brilliant writing.

There is linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) not as good as newcomb's ohter story "what you leave behind" but still exellent writing. Beware thought, few chapters and didnt updated in ages.

linkffn(Timely Errors) throws Harry into his parents 6 year for a few weeks. A neat little story with enjoyable interactions.

linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is) has Harry reborn as Sirius elder brother. An intresting plot point in unfortunatly less than stellar writing, okay none the less.

Last +but not+ and least.... there is a last one that gets too recommended a lot. But unlike Delenda Est I just cant see the appeal in this garbage, but alas many here disagrre so see for yourself: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past).

*** To be completely fair to Nightmares of Futures Past, it started in 2005. It is a bit flat and cliche filled to me, but that's because it STARTED those cliches. It may not have been the first time travel fic, but it's definitely the first popular one

**** And more to the point, it doesn't go overboard with many of the cliches.

Vernon's a bigger arse than before? It's all but stated there's Someone Else trying to pull strings.

Snape's a villainous villain from Villain-ville? It's pre-DH, the fandom was split down the middle on Snape's allegiance.

Malfoy? The kid could pull off Serpentsorsia as a second-year.

Politics? The most we really see outside the custody hearing is that one party at Longbottom Manor. And it's more a bunch of stuffy old people being stuffy and Neville barely escaping being bored out of his skull.

--------------

And it avoids a lot of the tropes that are, in my mind, worse. There's no soul-bonding, no Daphne, no Dark!Harry, no Daphne, no sage!Luna, no Daphne, no evil!Dumbledore.

**** Well, of the ones recommended, I would say /Backward With Purpose/ is the best. In fact, it is one of my favorite stories in the fandom. It is fairly long, has sequels (though you don't /need/ to read them) and there absolutely is tension and a lot of ups and downs. It even comes up with a way to slightly change the past they're going to. [[/spoiler][Prophecies predict the future and by coming back in time, Harry, Ron and Ginny have changed the future.

** One of my favorites is linkffn(9622538). The first chapter drops a big bomb that gets pretty much ignored for the rest of the story so far. It comes up occasionally but does not play an important role in the story (which is a good thing if you ask me.)

Unfortunately the story is likely dead. It's currently in year 3 and while there was an update a few months ago after a long hiatus, it seems the author is on break again. I can't guarantee that they'll start writing it again.

Still, it's one of my favorite Slytherin Harry's and the time travel is well done. The planned pairing seems to be Harry/Luna which I'm not a big fan of but it doesn't really come up much.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** Some that I haven't seen listed here are linkffn(Pride of Time; The Apprentice by Deborah Peters; The Moment it Began; Come Once Again and Love Me; Ananke; A Fall Through Time by Ariel Riddle; Hogwarts: Marauding the Timeline; A Bad Death Eater Gone Good; Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is; Choosing Grey by Beta Gyre).

Most of these are complete or not actively updated (but absolutely worth the read). I wasn't sure what pairings you were into so there is a mix of SSLE, SSHG, TRHG, and gen fics.

The Moment it Began is the "classic" time travel for the SSLE ship, but I like the situation for Ananke the best. Ananke is regularly updated. Come Once Again and Love Me has two characters out of place in their time...

The Apprentice has a very IC Snape and isn't very predictable. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure it's abandoned.

The Hogwarts fic is very fun with the Marauder drama.

A Bad Death Eater Gone Good hasn't been updated in a while but is definitely not abandoned. It's a Draco time travel and is well written.

Choosing Grey has a very interesting Tom Riddle. His character is very intriguing, making the story great. Hermione doesnt "turn him good" but she is a good influence on him.

I also like Delenda Est, a Harry/ Bellatrix fic that is perfect the first half and meh the second half.
