I've already read A Black Comedy by nonjon and Oh God Not Again! by sarah1281 and enjoyed them immensely. I also loved The Lie I Lived by jbern. Some character I love in these are Harry and Sirius goofing off together and any time a good Luna appears.


** Read everything else that nonjon has. Even the ones that aren't crack are still awesome.

Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/][Make A Wish]] by Rorschach's Blot. It has a few sequels that are quite good, but not as good as this.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6487391/1/Why_is_it_Orange][Why is it Orange?]] By Grinning Lizard. Short crack oneshot.

*** Hell, do yourself a favour and check out Rorschach's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/1/Odd_Ideas][Odd Ideas]] file. 126(!) chapters of so much unadulterated crack consuming it in public would probably net you the death penalty in Asia.

**** Thanks for that! I'm glad it provided some other facfic definitions. All these terms and acronyms confuse me.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Sword_of_Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]]. It's slightly WTF??!? but it's a very funny read.
