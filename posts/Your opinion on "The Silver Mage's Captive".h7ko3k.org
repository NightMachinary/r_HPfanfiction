I recently heard a lot about linkffn(The Silver Mage's Captive by Canimal) but always very mixed opinions. So tell me what you think about this fic. Would you recommend reading it? Why or why not?

And since it's only on ff.net and I therefore don't have any tags to help me out, could you give me some general warnings on what to expect from it?

I for example don't like major character deaths and avoid those on ao3.
