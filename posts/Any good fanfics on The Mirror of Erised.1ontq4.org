The Mirror of Erised is an amazing magical item but is never told where it came from or a purpose for the mirror (good/evil intent on using it). Is there any FanFictions on the mirror?

Set in the third book, with a tactfully done low-level H/Hr ship. A good little mystery, with the Mirror playing a key role.

A crossover with Dr Who. A Weeping Angel manages to find its way, via Harry's boggart, into Hogwarts. Good fun, effectively captures the feeling of a Dr Who episode in terms of pacing and plot.
