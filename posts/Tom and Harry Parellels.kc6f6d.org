What are your favorite fics where Tom/Voldemort and Harry are paralleled? They can be shipped together, or enemies, or friends. It was always one of my favorite parts of canon and I love seeing how other people explore it or interpret it.

For example, in Dead Things, when Hermione tells Harry he's turning into the next Tom Riddle, he says they were always too alike for their own good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]])

I read another one (can't remember what it's called, sorry but I think maybe it was Drarry?) where just before they face one another in the DoM, they stared at one another to take it all in. Who they were to each other, how the other was really the only one that could understand what the other had went through, that sort of thing, before they attacked.

Can be one-shots or long fics, but no abandoned ones please.


** This one is kind of depressing, but

  Ginny had dreaded for years admitting to Harry that she'd been dosing him with love potions. But his response was something totally unexpected.
