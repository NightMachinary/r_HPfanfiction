TV, pens, nuclear bombs, smartphones, internet, guns, etc.

I'm looking for fics where magic is better than technology in any and all significant ways that you care to name.

Preferably done so that the magical equivalents have more of a magical feel than just "heres a TV that runs on magic instead of technology". Things that serve the same purpose but better, not an /exact/ 1:1 equivalent. But I'm pretty sure that the pickings are slim for this sort of thing as it is, so I'll take what I can get.

 

Any recommendations?


** I'd not recommend it otherwise (especially because I hate the mixed first/third person narrative) but it fits with your request.

  Hogwarts brought home the immense differences between the muggle world and the magical. No plumbing, no electricity, no modern conveniences like toilet paper, no heaters, no insulation, no cell phones, no television, no video games, and on and on and on. You'd think that the magical world could benefit from all of this, right?

  Contrast that with food that can't go bad, wash basins where the water stays perfectly pure even if you wash shit off your hands in it, chamber pots that not only immediately destroy your waste but clean you completely as you stand up, and shower "pools" about a foot deep that surround you in a vortex of water, ripping any and all dirt off your body and make any massage setting on a shower head seem pointless.

  Compare radios to a wizarding wireless system that could relay information from its broadcasting center directly to the local units without actually broadcasting all over the place, old family albums to pictures and portraits that moved --and sometimes talked, and post to the ridiculously fast and accurate owl mail system.

  Sigh in envy at beds and robes that always maintain whatever your body considers a comfortable temperature and the fact that a first-year's charm would instantly banish sweat and nullify body odor and bad breath; for that matter, a second-year's charm could immediately clean your clothing, making washing machines pointless.

  Despite the lack of focus on personal entertainment, we wizards are a pampered lot; I'll never complain.

  I wasn't really exposed to it in my first year, but I've since come to understand why purebloods associate muggles with the word "filthy." Compared to wizarding society, muggle society is dirty and unsanitary. If you stop and consider exactly how much effort that the muggles put into being sanitary, that's really saying a lot. Even the most sterile hospital room can't compare to how clean the wizarding world is. No matter how fast the Internet gets, it's not worth the headache of dealing with computers when I can reach anyone, anywhere, with Hedwig in about five minutes tops. The communication mirrors I possess make cell phones look outdated, and I'll take Pensieves over video cameras any day.

  As I quickly realized looking around Hogwarts in awe, it wasn't the wizards that need to catch up with muggles; it was the muggles who need to catch up with wizards. They've been doing nothing but catching up all along.
