  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

The Snape Chronicles is the most unappreciated fanfic on FFnet, and I'm not just saying that. It takes you from before Snape was born right to his death, and no part is skipped over. Usually any fanfic makes Snape out to be a bitter, petty old man or a romanticized anti-hero, but this fic portays him differently than we usually see. It takes in, not just his wizarding aspect, but the muggle half of Snape as well, with topics like the space race and social issues of northern England. With what little (but yet so much) JK Rowling gives us about Snape, Rannaro fills in everything. Even if you hate Snape (or love him), read it. Keep in mind, this is not just HP book 1-7 in Snape's point of view, it takes a whole lot of time and chapters to even get to Harry's sorting.

** I'm reading this right now. I thought making Snape a space nerd was a really fun idea and probably made me relate a little too much to his childhood character, and his early childhood years flowed really nicely. Now I'm at the point where they're at Hogwarts and I've slowed down reading since there's something a little off about the pacing and characterizations here. I get the feeling that the author really gets English industrial town settings but isn't quite there with Magical Britain (which is fine, if you think about it JK Rowling is the only human who really gets magical Britain). My thoughts so far.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

** One of the qualms I had about the fic is the under emphasis on the Marauders--Snape animosity and bullying. Maybe that's just me being influenced by fanfiction, but I think that Snape really hates the Marauders, especially since his worst memory is them bullying him. If he hadn't been bullied, I willing to bet that SS/LE would be canon. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

*** I agree. Having given up after his first year at Hogwarts, this was one thing that stuck out at me, and ultimately caused me to stop reading.

That, and the depressing characterization of life in a coal town in Thatcher's Britain.

It's pacing is a major problem as well. I don't recall exact numbers, but it was something in the line of a full 100k words before he even got to Hogwarts. And whilst the author did his/her best, it just wasn't interesting enough to warrant that - as most pre-Hogwarts fics are.

All in all, I'd give it a 3.5/5, rounded up. Certainly decent quality, but has some fundamental issues that pull it down. Ultimately I round up because some of my problems with it are personal ones - wrong tone for me, lack of interest in Snape's character - and I can see how it would be worth the read for someone else.
