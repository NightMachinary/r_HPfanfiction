Has anyone found any ‘Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived' fics where the ‘wrong' bwl is actually sympathetic and friendly with Harry/fem!harry, maybe even teams up with them? Would prefer no death eater apologism or unhealthy relationships.


** Quite depressing, might make you cry. But its really well written. It really stands out from a see of sheeps.

I really like the authors writing style.

​

And my personal favourite - not a wbwl but he does have a little brother - their relationship is focused heavily plus harry is super bad ass . The story is just wow.
