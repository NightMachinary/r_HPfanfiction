I think that I am a very tolerant person. I am a straight male and while I don't read slash I am okay with it. But mpreg just rubs me the wrong way. It's just so bizarre that I can't seem to accept it. It really bothers me on some level. Are there others that agree with me. I am just hoping for a frank discussion.


** While I /love/ slash, I'm not particularly fond of mpreg.

I'm feeling extremely lazy right now so I'm just going to c+v a comment I made about this over at [[/r/fanfiction]]:

#+begin_quote
  I lean towards slight dislike when it comes to mpreg, tbh, though I can read and enjoy it if the fic is very well-written and the mpreg itself is well-executed. One of my main issues with it is that the pregnant character tends to be nauseatingly OOC. Like, yes, I get that hormones are a thing and whatever, but come the frick on. Pregnant women don't undergo complete personality changes when they're pregnant, so why would men?

  There's also a disbelief factor when mpreg exists in universes where it shouldn't. I mean, Harry Potter using magic to get pregnant? Plausible. Dean Winchester getting hit with a curse that causes pregnancy? Plausible. Spencer Reid (Criminal Minds) suddenly getting knocked up by a normal human dude? Not so plausible.

*** This. I don't have an issue with the concept of mpreg, but every one I've seen turns the character into a ice-cream craving bipolar nut job, and usually ends with said character becoming essentially barefoot and pregnant.... Can't have a job, gotta stay home and take care of the babies and look we've got another on the way! Um, no. So I think my issue is that it's usually written in a way that would be highly sexist if the character was a female... Admittedly, I haven't read many mpregs, so I may have just had a bad sampling.

*** Good summary. I don't look for it, and don't care for the vast majority, put there are some good ones. And most of them include scenes of the "how is this even possible! freakout" variety, which seems pretty valid, even in magic universes. And to be readable, they do have to make effort to stay in-character. The two I'm thinking of actually spent fairly little time on the pregnancy itself, mostly skipping right to the consequences.

** I for one would love to read a biologically plausible mpreg fic (e.g. with a trans man). There was one rec on this sub but I've already read it :/ idk, it's a fairly interesting premise.

In that line, I wish authors would go the whole damn hog with mpreg. You (man) want to have a baby? By Jove, you /will/ carry that baby - in your brand new female body. Like being Polyjuiced for nine months straight. I want a fic where their partner can't be attracted to them anymore, a fic where they hate the way they look in the mirror, where they're bordering on dysphoria. Not the 99% of "assbabies uwu" crap.

** I'm not fond of pregnancy. Or infants. Or small children. I don't have enough experience with them to write them plausibly, either.

That said, I have a start to a story where Albus Dumbledore and his spouse, Afton Perks, have a number of children, the youngest being Sally-Anne. Afton holds political power, while Dumbledore just handles the school.

It doesn't depict pregnancy, but it discusses it in brief. It mentions a magical artifact used to induce pregnancy, how Albus and Afton discussed which of them would be pregnant, and how often they had children.

(When I mentioned this story previously, people got angry about it, complaining that it made the Order of the Phoenix much more powerful. And I'm like, have you seen /any/ fan fiction? Nobody has a problem making Harry strong enough to arm-wrestle Thor and out-magic Boccob. Splitting Dumbledore's political and personal power into two people, though, is apparently beyond the pale.)

** I'm not interested in mpreg, which is distinct from not liking it. I'm not interested in fpreg, either. They just happen to be tropes/narrative devices that don't give me what I seek in fanfiction. I could say the same of overpowered Harry, to take another example. Not interested, but I can see why other people like it. Pregnancy in fiction, male or female, often focuses on family or relationship drama or sappiness, and I'm mostly not here for that. (Well, okay, I'm totally here for relationship drama, but in a different way.)

Setting the stereotypes aside, mpreg allows writers and readers to play with fantastical elements and possibilities, which is true even if the majority of those fics are poorly written or overindulgent or show an absolute failure of characterization. The writer gets to fool around with something biologically impossible (unless the character is a trans man) but not outside the realm of imagination.

For some people, sure, it's a kink. A lot of fanfic is about heightening normal levels of reaction and experience, emotional button-pushing, satisfying the id. Those fics only work for readers who share that kink and enjoy that level of exaggeration. Other fans enjoy mpreg for the body horror, or the examination of wizarding culture, or the impact on a particular ship dynamic. Or it's thrown in as part of the larger picture, no big deal, no reason to stop and exclaim over it, just an accepted part of the background, and the writer would be justifiably annoyed if someone insisted their story was stupid because it didn't have a Grand Unified Theory of Mpreg right there in the text.

As with everything else in fanfic, if the writer is good, it will be a decent or possibly even brilliant story, and it won't be less decent or less brilliant for having mpreg (or fpreg) in it. Mpreg doesn't automatically make a story bad, and it doesn't deserve to be jeered at and considered a sign of immaturity or horrible writing or <em>femaleness</em> just because it exists. (It also shouldn't automatically be equated with slash, because the two things aren't interchangeable. Meaning, it may occur primarily in slash pairings because the writer wants two men to have a baby or they overidentify with one of the characters or they find pregnancy erotic and might be turned on by the idea of pregnant men or they're writing a "male character freaks out" comedy trope - but it's not inherent to slash fic. And bad mpreg stories aren't a blanket condemnation of all slash stories ever written.)

I wonder if the reaction to mpreg here reflects a (general) male attitude toward pregnancy and the belief that it's considered the ultimate societal marker of femaleness/femininity. It seems like a fairly bog-standard trope to me, and the visceral, pearl-clutching reaction on this sub is baffling. (Gross! A violation! Shudders! The worst! - that sort of reaction.) It's not that surprising or out-there a variation on Stuff That Can't Happen in the Real World, especially when you have magic to handwave it. The insistence that it violates biology or that the story is bad/ridiculous if it doesn't include a carefully worked out scientific explanation sounds like an "ew, ew, get it away from me!" excuse, since you can legitimately say, "Because magic." Or, in Stargate Atlantis, to cite another fandom, "Because mysterious alien technology." Fanfiction uses shortcuts and narrative crutches all the time - unless, as is also true, the point of the story /is/ the tech or the biological transformation or whatever, in which case, go to town inventing the pseudo-scientific details of your magical MacGuffin.

Anyway, yes, I roll my eyes at some pregnancy tropes, the same way I roll my eyes at some bad-ass Harry tropes, but mpreg is simply one in a host of fanfic clichés that seem perfectly normal to me. Some I like, some I don't. It's entirely unremarkable. And I /have/ read stories in which mpreg figures as a plot point and still enjoyed them. But as a general rule, I avoid it, just as I avoid fpreg, just as I avoid kidfic - unless I trust the author. At that point, anything goes.

I agree. The same thing happens with certain slash pairings too.

**** It's just not that far-fetched a scenario in a magic-saturated secondary world, and it's far from the most radical or bizarre or uncomfortable plot point HP fandom has devised.

Yeah, a fairly large percentage of this sub either doesn't like slash (which is fine, everyone reads according to their tastes) or actually thinks it's a violation of the characters' masculinity/heterosexuality and decries it as horribly OOC. Having seen what passes for Harry's characterization in some of the fics recced here, I firmly believe it's in the eye of the beholder. And slash is as much a part of Potter fandom as het fic, so I have no patience with anti-slash snobbery.

** I love slash and read it all the time. But I don't really like mpreg. I just don't get the point - you might as well just adopt or use a magical surrogate or something. And even if mpreg is magically /possible/ that does not mean that the characters would want to do it. I cannot imagine canon Harry wanting to carry a child - he would be grossed out by it I think - and I think it is usually Harry who gets pregnant in these fics. And also, if you want a fem!harry, just write that fic. It is already totally AU, so you might as well just make it make sense.

The fics where I have seen it used "well" do one of two things - either the mpreg is "off screen" and/or implied at the end of a fic or the mpreg is used as a "get together" plot device similar to a bonding spell or a potions accident (basically the characters have one-off sex and have to deal with a surprise pregnancy). My only problem with the latter is that I think a potions accident makes for a more creative fic.

Another gripe I have with mpreg (or pregnancy in fics in general) is that I have seen it used as a plot device so much more often in slash fics than in het fics. And if het fics don't use it that much, there is a reason! Why does slash want to appropriate a het plot device that isnt even that great?

The thing is that the focus of mpreg is often 'building a family', while I think het fics the focus is more 'get these two characters together'. Het fics do often have epilogues with kids, so at some point there was pregnancy. It's just no one ever marks that specifically or has it as a major plot point as it isn't really an issue.

** Male pregnancy [[http://imgur.com/nGMErwH][is older then dirt]]. TVtropes has a reasonable [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse][article on it]]. As does [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Mpreg][fanlore]] and [[http://www.fanhistory.com/wiki/Mpreg][fanhistory]].

When you say you don't mind slash, what do you mean? Do you read it? Do you read explicit slash (ie, malexmale porn)? Because, for a lot of mpreg, explicit male slash is included, and the /focus/. If you prefer not to read explicit slash, you of course are not going to enjoy mpreg.

What, exactly, is it that you dislike about mpreg? If you read slash, it isn't homosexual relationships, which I think is the stumbling block for most people. Is it the biological aspects? Because most mpreg do not discuss the actual birth or biology behind it all. Is it the loss of control over ones body? Because that is what women feel in normal pregnancy too (ie, if it was a female would it still be an issue?) Is it that most mpreg stories also heavily feminize the pregnant character? Because most slash does that to the bottom/sub character anyway. Or is it something else I haven't mentioned?

I don't mind mpreg, /as like any trope/, done well it's good, done poorly it's unreadable. When people say they will not read mpreg, but like slash, I wonder if they have only read terrible mpreg. For example (maybe not OP, but others reading this thread) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/221208][The Silent World Within You]] linkao3(221208) and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4129527][The Green Vial]] linkao3(4129527) I think are reasonable mpreg stories. If you can stand 1st person POV, I've heard good things about [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2449031][Appallingly Wrong and Irreparably Broken]] linkao3(2449031).

** They're wizards. It's magic! lol

Anyway, male slash relationships have been around since the Roman era at least, and during Roman times it was an open and accepted part of their society. Since wizarding society is so much behind the times and filled with tradition and old lore then, it would be plausible that slash relationships have /also/ been around for quite some time (whether openly or as the-secret-that-everyone-knows), especially in Pureblood society where all sorts of incest happens. Therefore, given the length of time slash has been around, some wizards at some point must have come up with something to get themselves heirs = mpreg.

Swollen ankles, swollen breasts, morning sickness, rounded belly, et cetera - I honestly have no intention of being involved in the pregnancy process at ANY time in my life, and by no means do I want to hear about it, whether it's being written in a logical, biologically possible way or a nonsensical one.

Especially when the focus on the pregnancy process usually only leads to terrible baby names, the idea that having infants = true love, and that it's totally fun for a fanfic to be taken up by hard, sharp-minded characters cooing over infants.

Any baby-having is a red flag.

To be fair, though, the easiest way---if you have access to supernatural means such as magic---to allow a man to become pregnant in a way that doesn't result in death in agony is basically shifting their insides to accommodate for it, at which point they aren't fully male anymore and thus you can't really call it “mpreg” unless you are doing it just as a technicality. And I think stories that do /that/ are fine, and so are the stories that have such a thing already established in the setting (a webcomic titled “Oglaf” does that, though it's a really minor point, and I didn't mind it existing at all; likewise, there's an old movie titled “Junior” that revolves around this and I didn't find it bad in it either).

But played the way it tends to be in many “mpreg” stories, it's basically nothing more than a cheap cop-out, often done by someone who has no idea about pregnancy at all (and sometimes no idea about sex either) and changes characters in ways that don't make sense whatsoever. And terrible and cheap cop-outs are terrible, that's something that has to be said.
