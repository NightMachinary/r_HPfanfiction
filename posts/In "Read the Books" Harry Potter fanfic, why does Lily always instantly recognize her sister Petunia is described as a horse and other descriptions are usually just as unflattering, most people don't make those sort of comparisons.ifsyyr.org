** Even if Lily wouldn't use those sorts of descriptions herself, she could easily have heard other people make them. Snape in particular seems like the type of person to say that sort of thing, and we know for sure that he knew Petunia.

But even if that weren't the case, there are plenty of clues in just the first chapter of PS:

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive
#+end_quote

Literally the first words in the book. Petunia is the older sister, so depending on when the reading takes place, Petunia could already be married to or dating Vernon, and could even be living at number four, which would make this a pretty big hint. Of course, Petunia probably also wouldn't have any contact with Lily, so it's plausible she might not know about Vernon, especially if their parents are dead by that point. But if the author wants to, they could easily justify Lily knowing about Petunia and Vernon anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours.
#+end_quote

That's the only physical description we get of Petunia in chapter 1. It's not particularly distinctive, but it's also not so unflattering that Lily couldn't realize it sounds like her sister.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister
#+end_quote

Depending on when the reading is happening, this could be a dead giveaway. But even if Lily and James aren't dating yet, it does narrow down her identity quite a lot.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?'
#+end_quote

And there, on page 7, we get Petunia's name. At that point, Lily has either figured out who Petunia is or is in denial.

In the chapter 1 of PS, Vernon know about "/the Potters/" and "/these people/". So unless he blindly believes everything his wife says, it is very heavily hinted that he met the Potters at least once even if they do not have regular contacts. Rowling also said in an interview that they had a meal together, that went wrong (I think James used Magic), but that's not really canon.

Anyways, Lily should be able to confirm that the "book" talk about her sister in 5 pages max, with all the "hints" in the first chapter.

**** Yeah, but any meeting between Vernon and James wouldn't have happened before Lily and James started dating in their seventh year, at the earliest. How long he and Petunia were together before that and if Lily knew about him are unclear.

So once again, it all depends on when the reading takes place.

***** It's true, but even without Vernon, as long as Lily entered Hogwarts, I think she should be able to put all the pieces together by the end of Chapter 1.

The discussion between Dumbledore and McGonagall (not to mention their own presence) gives so much information that it is almost impossible to not understand that she is the "Lily Potter", which means that Petunia Dursley must be her sister.

****** By the end of chapter 1, sure. The fact that Lily, James, Sirius, and Petunia are all named should make it obvious. I was looking specifically at the parts focusing on the Dursleys though to see if Lily should be able to identify Petunia based solely on how she and Vernon are described, which only takes us about halfway through the chapter.

******* I don't think the description alone would be enough for Lily to identify her sister, especially since she is only called "Mrs Dursley" in this part of the chapter. Petunia may correspond to the description ""/thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck/", but so does a lot of woman in the UK.

The informations given by Vernon pov should give her some very big doubts: the name "Potter", Mrs Dursley is called Petunia, bad relation with her sister, colored robes and owls, magic . . . but maybe not enough to be totally sure.

And as you said, the end of the chapter make it obvious.

*** Plus the Dursleys were big on propriety - so it would be odd for Petunia to get married and not invite her sister.

** First of all, whenever we think about the portrait of Dursleys in the books, we have to remember that we see them through the eyes of teenagers who was previously abused by them. The portrait is quite certainly not faithful to reality (that is not to say they were nice people or that they didn't abuse him).

Technically I liked these [[https://www.deviantart.com/lanermahaner/art/Witch-Weekly-Magazine-Cover-Petunia-Dursley-2-605080691][two]] [[https://www.deviantart.com/loonalucy/art/Petunia-Dursley-527038990][portraits]] of her. Certainly not a candidate for Miss Universe (or Mrs Universe in her case), but with some care she could look more or less representable.

*** In my opinion, Fiona Shaw was a good cast for the character, and comes very close to the appearance I imagined for her. If she was blonde and younger (Fiona Shaw was 43 when she did PS while Petunia in 33/34 at that time), she would be perfect. And since they aged pretty much all the adults in the film, I can't really complain about the 2nd point.

Also, Harry had riddiculously high standards when it comes to appearance. Even in his head, I don't think he considered more than 10 people attractive in the 7 books.

*** Except you're wrong right in the first sentence. That first chapter is not from Harry's PoV; it's from the godly narrator's that knows everything. That whole first chapter is just telling us everyone's feelings of the Dursley's.

**** I wonder whether even that narrator is not that much godly, but somehow reflection of Harry's memories. Notice, how we have very limited point of view of them. For example, we never see more than what would Harry see (or hear from the later recounting), we never find anything about their background thoughts, assumptions, or feelings. We just get the same what Harry would get.

If you tried to write any story involving Dursleys, you soon find that what we have in books are not real humans, but really just caricatures of humans, and you have to work around that (that is not to make them better but more real).
