  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I really like linkao3(11676102) and its sequels, which AFAIK has unique pairing. Yes, it is probably something completely different, than what you would like.

And of course, linkffn(9566537), linkao3(16405130), and linkffn(2163835) (just first nine chapters of this, then it turns into super!Harry weirdness, which is boring) which by definition are unique pairings.

  turning up to his ex-boyfriends wedding without a partner on his arm is something oliver wood refuses to do. which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't painfully single when the invitation to percy weasley's wedding dropped on his kitchen table one monday morning. with three months to find a love to take as his plus one, oliver seeks out the first person he can find who will agree to fake-date him for an evening. it's just pure coincidence that the person ends up being hawaiian shirt wearing, bar-tending marcus flint.

******* You won't find much Harry/Cho on FFN either. Or Hermione/Terry Boot. Or Harry/Lavender. Or Hermione/Padma Patil. Or Ron/Tracy Davies. Or... I think that you get the idea.

*** Harry/Draco aren't rare pairings. I'd say that Severus/Draco isn't as common, but not exactly a rare pair either.

**** Yes, Drarry isn't a rare pairing, Severus/Draco is the rarest pairing I have but I understand how it can not be seen as a rare one.

However the Harry/Draco isn't the dominant pairing in the story, the Severus/Draco is and the Harry/Draco does cause some Ansgt given the circumstances to it have happened.

So if that's still your cup of tea you could go check it out.

*** It's pretty impressive how I keep seeing your name on really downvoted comments like that. Could it be bots downvoting anything that's slash related?
