The last time I tried writing, it was a complete disaster. I want to get better, it's just I don't know how. Suggestions on tropes and, well, anything would be appreciated.

‚Äã

Here's the short fanfiction for reference, but beware: it may make you want to gouge your eyes out (I will fix gramatical errors later if I don't die of shame and embarassment first).

Edit: I am aware that James was a chaser in canon, however I had the idea for the fanfiction before I found out, and I wrote it as I originally planned.


** To paraphrase Walt Stanchfield. We all have a lot of bad words in us. The sooner you get them out the better.

The only way to get better at writing is to write more. Read more books. Read books about writing. Read writing about books.

Off the top of my head, there's a lot of details which could be worked in more seamlessly or eliminated. You don't need to tell us that Snape was in Slytherin or Sirius was in Gryffindor, the reader knows this. You don't need to call him 'the Gryffindor teenager' when a handful of lines later you have him going back into Gryffindor tower. If the reader needed reminding of Sirius' house, you did it perfectly with that.

You need to think some things through. Sirius is a pureblood kid. How does he know anything about the Wizard of Oz? It's a great line, and I get the temptation, but it was a bit out there.

Other than that, you have some good turns of phrase. I particularly liked

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúYou really buy into those lies? My grandmother died. My mother died. My cat died.‚Äù He mocked. ‚ÄúHis grandmother has died four times now. His aunt, eight.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúOf course I don't. I just respect his privacy, and come up with far more sane conclusions.‚Äù Lily whispered, collecting her parchment and leaving her frustrated friend behind. ‚ÄúAnd I find it disgusting that you've kept track of that.‚Äù

*** For real. My first fic has been lost to the sands of time/hard drive changes but my second fic is still online:

[[https://ficwad.com/story/29591]]

It's /awful/. While I'm far from the finished package, the progress I've made since that fic is significant.

Of course, improvement requires a desire to improve and to critically self-evaluate. Otherwise you turn out like Megamatt, writing millions of indistinguishable words.

** First off, the best thing to improving your writing is just to keep writing.

Second, fix the grammar. I know you said you'd fix it later, but the repetition of the errors makes me think you're unaware of the proper usage. Look up to properly use quotations for dialogue.

This:

> ‚Äú... /sane/ conclusions.‚Äù Lily whispered....

is incorrect.

> ‚Äú... /sane/ conclusions,‚Äù Lily whispered...

Always a comma, not a period. Exclamation points and question marks are used in place of a comma. You can also write sentences like this if someone is continuing to speak:

> "And,‚Äù Malfoy continued, ‚Äúwhat exactly are you doing here, anyways'?‚Äù

‚Äã

Third, your writing feels very prescribed. It's always dialogue, description of person talking dialogue with same person. Then starts over with a new person. This mean the story doesn't feel very dynamic or engaging.

Keep writing, try new things. I apologize for the gruffness of this response, but I thought it was easier to be direct in my critiques. Everyone starts somewhere, and I've definitely read a lot worse than what you wrote.

** Well, I haven't read it all. It perhaps needs a few more details to explain what actually is going on. But it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, believe me.

There isn't a short cut. Practise, read, (not too much fanfiction though), practise, read, etc. etc. [[/r/writing][r/writing]] is a good sub and there are masses of lectures and podcasts online. (Brandon Sanderson's are excellent).

*** Okay, thanks. I realized when I was writing it that I was focusing too much on my crappy dialogue and not on describing what was going on. I guess I knew what was happening, but not writing it down well on paper.

Thanks again!

** It is NOT terrible. At all. I'd second what most of the others said about practise. And maybe look at books about creative writing? I know many people think literary theory is dry, but once you know the tools, you can play around with themüòä

** Doesn't seem horrible to me. Just needs a little polishing. What might really help is looking at works of fiction you like and look at how they tell their stories (point of view, tense, what information is/isn't given, suspense, etc.). Writing is a form of art and looking at other peoples techniques really helps.

I also find that a good rule of thumb is to not include for the sake of including (your readers don't need to know everything) and to not omit for the sake of omitting.

For example; you really don't need to include that Lily is 15yo at the very beginning. At the same time, there's no reason to call her 'the girl' when Sirius clearly knows her name.

*** And of course writing also includes a lot of rewriting. If you don't like a part, fiddle with it until you do.

Also, a good beta can make a world of difference, sometimes all you need is a fresh set of eyes that can look at it a bit more objectively

***** Basically a beta is a second reader. A bit like an editor if you were to publish. Many people have their friends beta for them, but you could also try and find someone else who would be willing to do it.

*** Ooooh thanks soooo much. If anyone wants to add comments, please do. This is my second version:

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsajbfE6BbJzINUz1G_DLnVLV6TlfeyYd6CoUqbLnQE/edit?usp=sharing]]

Keep in mind grammar is not fixed yet.

My main problem is James. I've been trying to intregrate him into the plot more (hence he being the climax) but I've been having a hard time.

** One exercise worth doing: decide what your story is about and ruthlessly cut everything that doesn't serve it.

Note that different stories can be about different things: events, "what-if"s, characters, relationships, themes, exploring the world...

Once you've gotten good at seeing what serves what in your story, you might decide to wander a bit. But then you'll be doing it deliberately
