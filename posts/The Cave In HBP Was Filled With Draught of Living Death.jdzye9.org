So I read a fic (don't remember what it was called but if someone does please link it) a few months ago where the cave where the locket was located was filled with a lake of inferi but the water was the draught of living death.

So the purpose was for the person trying to steal the locket to drink the potion which would cause imense pain and a desperater need for water, realise that summoning water didn't work and would therefore try to drink from the lake, which would trigger the inferi and pull the person under forcing the to ingest the potion putting them to sleep and keeping the person fresh for Voldemort.

I think makes alot of sense because Voldemort who thought he was the only one who knew about the horcruxes would like to know not only why the person was there but also how they got there and if they knew about the other horcuxes

I don't know it makes alot of sense to me.


** Seems like an enormous waste of resources when the inferi will take care of the problem all on their own without making a lake of a difficult and somewhat expensive potion.

*** The Inferi are fairly easy to manage for a skilled wizard, though, and that's the only type who'd be crazy enough to hunt down Voldemort.

There's no guarantee that they wouldn't be able to just burn everything the second they see just a free horde of inferi wandering in a cave. The mixed trap allows for not just capture but torture and probably easier legilimency.

**** You may recall they're not wandering. They're sitting at the bottom of a sea-fed lake.

***** Except they're not. The cliff is (admittedly, only slightly) /above/ the sea. And if there wasn't a bunch of potion or maybe, as you say, seawater, the inferi would be wandering.

****** I think the Voldemort had in mind that the person going there would be alone and therefore be the only one to drink the potion incapacitating him from thinking clearly

** It's a particular thing that comes up in at minimum several fanfics. I know Apex by JustBored21 uses it, and I've read several others. Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987, maybe?

** To be honest, the cave always seemed to be a bit overkill compared to the other hiding spots. Like... the one in the Gaunt's shack would be pretty obvious for anyone who looked into Tom Riddle's background. A cave he visited once on a field trip? Much harder to find. And all those protections for the locket? When he just gave the diary to Lucius Malfoy and literally left the diadem entirely defenceless in the Room of Requirement?

This indicates that Voldemort isn't particularly worried about someone finding his Horcruxes. Though considering he totally went overboard with the protection of the locket, it's certainly possible that there is Draught of Living Death in the lake. It wouldn't even have to be a lot, because it is so potent that even one drop can kill.

It's not canon obviously, because Dumbledore drank some of the water and we didn't see any side effects, but it's certainly an interesting idea for fanfiction, because it would mean that Regulus isn't dead.

*** I think the protection of the locket had more to do with the locket itself not the soul he put in it. I think the fact that it was Slytherins locket apealed more to him than the fact that it would become his horcrux.

** Voldemort already set the only 1 wizard allowed trap, so why didn't he fill the basin with draught of living death? Sure there's no torturing your enemy, but it seems like a safer way of defending the horcrux

** I remember reading one where they removed the inferi and filled the lake with old munitions from sunken WW2 battleships. When Voldemort checked in on it, he narrowly escaped a massive explosion. Can't remember which one it was.

** I think that that was Dumbledore's reasoning but it would still not make sense since Voldemort was not aware Regulus had stolen his Horcrux and replaced with a fake locket.
