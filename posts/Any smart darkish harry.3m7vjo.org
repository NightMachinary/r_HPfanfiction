I'd like him to be ruthless and a bit selfish. I have read most popular evil harry fanfics so, unless you have one that's a bit under the rader I will probably have read it.

** I may be a fool for recommending what I feel is probably one of the CURRENTLY best known HP fanfics, HP and the Methods of Rationality, but I brink it up anyway because of the fact that depending on your definition of ruthless, Harry most definitely IS, though not through intentional desire to hurt others. More in that he ruthlessly achieves his goals. And even in situations that are more game than anything, he let's his darkside take over and even frightens or intentionally scares those around him (hiding behind his weak rationalization that "it's better for them anyway to be forced into these difficult scenarios..."). Not to mention, many themes explored are quite dark and/or mature. And there is significant focus on dark themes and occurrences in the latter half of the book.

Hope this helps :)
