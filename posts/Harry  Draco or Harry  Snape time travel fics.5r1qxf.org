Are there any fics which are like this? Where it's the original story but then the 2 characters time travel back (without realising the other had until later on in the story) and possibly end up working with each other on the time travel timeline? Sorry, my request is not phrased very well, English is my second language. Edit: no slash please

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** linkffn(5396819) It's abandoned and incomplete. It's been a very long time since I've read it, so I can't vouch for how well it's held up. It did have an interesting premise that was never really realized, since the author stopped long before it got to that point.

  Harry Potter wakes up one morning in the body of his ten-year-old self. This time around, he declares, no way anyone's going to die! -And it's gonna be totally awesome- "People shouldn't meddle with time, Potter." Little did they know...
