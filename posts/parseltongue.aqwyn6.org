** Parseltongue is a whole different language. It's only written as English in the books for reader convenience, because otherwise you'd have no idea wtf is going in the Gaunt Shack during the flashback scenes.

Canonically, Herpo the Foul spoke Parseltongue, and he was Greek.

** Parseltongue is snake-language. To anyone else, it just sounds like hissing regardless of whether the Parselmouth(or the snake) is French, English, or anything else.

From the point of view of the Parselmouth, Parseltongue would be understood/"heard" in their native language, I'd imagine. So just like Harry "hears" Parseltongue as English, a French Parselmouth would hear it as French, etc...

** What [[/u/4ecks]] said. Parseltongue isn't just "speaking in hisses", it's a language composed of hiss-words.

Though I will also note that it seems there are regional variations in Parseltongue: the Boa's words were translated in English as "/thanks, amigo/", so probably Brazilian snakes have a specific word for "friend" that isn't used by English snakes, which a Parselmouth like Harry feels is broadly equivalent to "amigo". (Harry's example shows that Parselmouths tend not realize they've switched languages unless you point it out to them; I have speculated there's some sort of built-in Confundus Charm to it.)

***** It is NOT spam! :( And I'm using lots of them because I am happy and Achille is my best friend so I love talking to him, and also I love snakes too and Harry Potter so I get super happy and excited, so I use more smileys to show how much more happy and excited I am than usual. :)
