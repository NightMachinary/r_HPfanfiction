:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I've been trying to find this fic all day and it's really been bugging me, I hope someone knows it!

I read it a long while ago and forgot most of the details, even weirdly forgetting if there was a romance between Hermione and one the dementors. I understand the title makes it sound cracky, but from what I remember it was an extremely well written fic, where the dementors ended up liking Hermione and trying their best not to make their natural presence too oppressive and even taught her about how baby and toddler dementors are educated and taken care of along with how dementors handle their place in magical society.

It's just one of those fics that my mind keeps coming back to every now and then and I'd love to read it again. Would really appreciate the help!

** It wasn't the Parselmouth of Griffindor was it? There's a subplot like that in between years 3 and 4, but it's been years since I read it so I don't remember very well
