Some say time is constantly in flux, that even an action as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can potentially lead to massive repercussions down the line. Others contend that time is a river, and that the ripples caused by even the largest falling stone will eventually disappear.

I favor a mix.

For instance, killing off Hermione in the first book is likely to have significant consequences. However, some things are likely to happen regardless. Consider: Lupin's hiring was partially a result of Sirius breaking out of prison; Sirius only broke out after seeing the picture of Ron and Scabbers in the Daily Prophet after Arthur won the galleon drawing and took his family to Egypt where they got their picture taken. It is entirely possible that something significant happening to Ron or Ginny could effect what the money was spent on and thus whether Siruis broke out or not, *but* it seems likely Lupin would still have been hired as he was essentially the second or third to last option Dumbles had.

How much flexibility is there? How many events are the result of small things and how much is the result of something that would be very resistant to change? Are changes for the sake of changes good (presuming they are decently written of course)?

Consider the Triwizard; I know I've seen alternate versions of the tasks before, but this actually seems like the sort of thing which is very unlikely to change. Importing dragons is a major bureaucratic hassle, it was unlikely to have been a spur of the moment decision but rather the result of months and months of paperwork and committee meetings and so on. The Tournament itself has probably been in the works for nearly a decade, anything short of a major bombing is unlikely to derail that.

Is a little AU flavor an absolute necessity to stave of the dreaded Stations of Canon, or merely a nice touch? What are some of your favorite AUs? Least favorite? Ones that got some things right but then completely missed the mark elsewhere?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] Harry's curse scar renders him blind so he acquires magesight; Harry never goes to Hogwarts and has little meaningful interaction with Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a baby?]] Crossover with Naruto; Harry is trained as an assassin from a young age and emerges with both power and major personality differences. (crossovers are a border case, but I am in love with this fic)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] Significant differences in several core rules of magic; Harry is raised by a loving and science minded family.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/Harry-Potter-Without-Harry-Potter][Harry Potter without Harry Potter]] Harry dies as a baby, his ghost left haunting Godric's Hollow forever, and the challenge of beating Voldemort in the hands of Percy Weasley.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] Harry gets a little extra magic from his dad that changes quite a lot.

Please note: Every fic is at least a little AU because it is not canon; but a good AU is one in which something about the world itself is significantly different giving the crew new obstacles to overcome. Things like Time travel really don't count by themselves.


** I'll be honest, sometimes in time travel stories it is super annoying that the main character refuses to change anything because that means their knowledge will become less valuable. But not everything changes and reliving a life while causing minimum ripples is boring.

Some stations are practically inevitable such as the Sorting (though the house might be different), but if something is the same then it's fine to not focus on it so much - describing the event in detail is probably unnecessary and may be suited to a flashback so the actual story doesn't feel too slow-paced. I find that trying to describe event significant event that occurs in canon can really slow down a story.

Honestly, while some stations make sense, if you can justify having them switched up then it's often a good idea even if it seems like a stretch. - with the triwizard tasks, having a different task may seem unlikely but it might provide a fun unique challenge, keeping the story fresh.

By the way, does a story where Hermione died in book 1 exist? Because I'd totally read it.

Harry is a self-interested Ravenclaw and Hermione dies at the troll's hands (club?).

The fic has its flaws, but it is not shy about running off the canon rails, which keeps it refreshing.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** I would kinda think so? I haven't read it... Blindness comes sort of close because her parents pull her out of Hogwarts after the troll, but then she is still very central to the plot so...

I remember another fic where she gets pulled out and then attends Durmstrang. Hmm.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

get out reeee

Fundamentally, a lot of it also comes to what's interesting to read. The tasks have been done countless times, so changing them is good, but doesn't make a fic AU. Fics that closely follow the stations of canon aren't /really/ AU- fics that upend fundamental assumptions about canon are.

#+end_quote

People new to HP fanfic are likely to be confused if you diverge from canon without an obvious reason. Old hats are likely to be bored by rehashes.

Personally, I can't stand to write about Harry Potter as a protagonist or POV character most of the time. I have a WIP about Tom Riddle in the late 40s (which I might eventually return to), and I have another about Hermione Granger circa 2010. This doesn't even give me an option to maintain the stations of canon. As for AU, the first is close to a single point of departure fic, and the second has backstory involving Harry going to Azkaban around 1995, breaking out, enduring a siege at Hogwarts, killing Voldemort, and seizing control of the Death Eaters, then conquering much of Europe in the name of eradicating Dark Lords.
