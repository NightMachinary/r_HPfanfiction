** Hey everyone.

I don't really much care for writing, however I love to read other peoples work, and have been reading fan-fiction (mostly HP) for at least the past 7 years or so. I have also done a little editing and beta-ing for some friends.

Aside from fanfiction, I just recently passed my final exam for my medical science degree, and will hopefully soon find a proper job.

This isn't so much an improvement that the mods could do, and is more of a pet peeve of mine. I personally hate it when an author posts something about their story that they are working/finished here, but then don't provide a link for it. It doesn't happen often, but it just annoys me a tad when it does. Especially when it sounds so interesting.

*** Congratulations on your impending nuptials. I'll share this small bit of wisdom I've acquired in my own adventures in matrimony.

A marriage is a partnership. It requires clear communication, compromise, and only remains successful so long as both partners agree on their goals.

A wedding, on the other hand, is a game show. Everyone dresses in ridiculous outfits and are directed to perform stunts and say embarrassing things in front of an audience usually at the direction of a charismatic man with a microphone. The whole event feels bizarre and is best enjoyed for the comedy of it. At least the winners go home with fabulous cash and prizes.

Don't confuse the two- a great wedding is a day of insanity that you can barely remember, if you do it right. The marriage is 10,000+ days of work at a project that may never be completed, but the benefits are awesome, so long as the company is worth it.

** Who am I? I'm Perspicacity (a play on words on my last name) on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I've written a few things.

By day, I slay evildoers by sharpening the scissors of armageddon and handing them to nincompoops who happen to inhabit the Oval Office. By night, I'm an amateur pianist, metal shredder, epee fencer, crap parent, and sounding board with an epic-class score in emotional intelligence.

As for what to do to improve the site, let's put a limit on the number of times Starfox's fics are linked a week, especially when linked against story requests that are really not good fits.

Look, I get it. Y'all have found Jesus and are tickled giddy that he's a Redditer named Starfox who's interactive and is the solution to everything. It's like, "Wow, interactive religion." It's just that sometimes, I'd rather talk about nachos. I don't need to rediscover my relationship with the Holy One every time I get a hankering for that cheesy, corny, spicy goodness. Every third post, perhaps? Is that so much to ask?

** Hi, Hi!

I am Lindsey, (FN: Lindsiria) and I tend to write darker fanfics, though what I have is very outdated.

Right now I am writing an 18 chapter story where Voldemort forces to Harry to join him. I am currently finishing up chapter 9. However, I am not going to be posting it until it is completed. If anyone is interesting in beta'ing and helping me with plot points or how to improve it, I would be thankful. I am still trying to come up with a title and summary still.

Outside of fanfic, I am a 25 year old woman living in Seattle, Washington with degrees in Political Science and Computer Science. I am working as a developer, and currently job searching for something better. Lastly, I have a SO of almost five years.

As for improvements, perhaps a general searching pinned topic that goes over common search requests we get. I also agree with updating the General Recommendations. Perhaps a vote for top fifteen fics people enjoy. Do something similar to [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]] lists.

There are just so many writers and so many genres of stories that it's hard to know what you might like / want to read at any particular moment. If we had an introduction thread, authors can post about their genre and readers can scroll through and find something new.

Another fun thread might be the "I Need a Beta", where betas can go look for business and writers can go looking for betas. At a glance, So see a fair-few beta requests, and I'm not sure if they stay afloat among all the "I'm looking for..." posts.

** Hi everyone! I'm SteamAngel on here, or FeatheredFeline on FFN. I'd prefer the latter, but apparently someone else came up with the same username as me so a universal username is a no-no.

I'm a British ex-student who is in limbo trying to find work, keep on top of my mental health and try to decide on what I want to do with my life. Life is a bit meh as a result, but I have food, shelter, nice people and fanfiction in my life so I can't complain. And the weather has been really nice for the UK of late, which is the real shocker!

This sub is probably the site I visit second most often on the internet, after [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] :') I love the recommendations and the silly humour and the prompts and well, the community really.

To my shame, I've [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12404980/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alchemist-s-Tale-Book-I-Calcination][started a fanfic]] but haven' made much progress in several months. I have about 15k words written in the draft and a heckload of notes, but my three major stumbling blocks are:

- Focus. I've had issues with my concentration span in general for a fair while, but I find it very difficult not to go off on tangents instead of working on the writing.
- Actually making some of the important decisions. The most prominent example is just deciding which House to place Harry in (I have arguments for all four, ugh). I still have a big fear of getting stuff wrong, I suppose, which is really hamstringing my progress.
- I'm trying to do too much! I started writing this because I haven't come across anything that quite fulfils all the things I think are important in a single fic. My notes cover all sorts from magical politics to personality development for a beaten down Harry to magical history to the nature of magic. I know it's possible to do this well, as several of the more popular fics do have this kind of variety, but it's rather ambitious.

In terms of the sub, I don't really have suggestions off the top of my head. There have been a lot of repeated posts recently, but I also think there's been an influx of new users so that's understandable. I feel like more discussion on writing would be welcome, but that's dependent on what people are currently working on and how much they're happy discussing before posting.

I'm just writing this to express my feelings towards this sub, and they are very positive.

The part I like the most is that this community is in equal parts /chill/ and /moderate/. Almost all other hp communities I've participated in inevitably turn into draconic echo chambers with a few vocal members leading the charge, while for some mysterious reason this sub has maintained a tolerant attitude, with everyone doing/promoting their own thing without being pushy, there's no excessive drama and the moderation is almost invisible, yet present. All very good (and rare) things.

I'm mostly interested in Sirius as a character, not so much in anyone else, but I do like playing with Rowling's world. I've also recently written a Cursed Child fic which probably no one will read but I needed to get it off my chest so did it anyway. It's mostly been betaed now but I don't know if I will post it. I'd rather keep it to myself than post it and get no response at all.

  how is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hpffn][r/hpffn]]? How can we, the mods, make this subreddit better?
#+end_quote

I quite like this sub; it's not not really geared up for people like me to be honest, but none of them are anyway, so that's okay. It's energetic and enthusiastic and I like to see what people are talking about. Personally I might find a weekly 'looking for a beta/offering to beta' thread useful, though it might only work for the more popular kind of fics.

** It does seem, as per usual, that I am late to the party. I assume whatever I say will either be ignored, downvoted into oblivion, missed, or plummet to the bottom and remain there for all eternity. However, I do have quite the things to talk about.

  How are you guys doing?
#+end_quote

Badly. Writing is the only thing that keeps me going, the flow of the soul, a cry for help on paper. However, everything is so much worse because, while I love to write, I'm not particularly good at it. I can get the words out, I can set a scene, I can make somewhat relatable characters... I just don't have enough of a grasp on English to utilise it properly. I'm also afraid to finish chapters, especially on the novel I'm writing, because when the final chapter is done, what comes after? My story will be done.

  Is life going all right for you?
#+end_quote

Read above. I do feel like I am improving mentally. Not physically, not sociably. I feel as if I started to walk across a bridge -- one that was on fire. I shied away from the torched side, clenched my arm when burned, and gasped when it began to crumble behind me, but I can only keep moving into the flames. I'm certain I may make it across, but I am just as certain that I will be burned for the journey.

tl;dr: I started to get help for all my mental issues.

#+begin_quote
  Who are you?
#+end_quote

I'm a twenty-four-year-old male that was born and raised in a small town in Australia. I hated books growing up because they were all I really had and I resented them. I loved the knowledge they have, I love the comfort they provided, but I hated them because they were easy and humans were hard. I hated the Harry Potter series because, as an abused child, I resented everything. I hated he had a way to escape. I hated that he found happiness, even if it was fleeting. I hated he had friends.

However, sob stories are not what I like to do. You asked.

#+begin_quote
  What am I writing?
#+end_quote

I know you never asked, but I'll offer.

1. My main fic is one that would be downvoted here due to quite a few reasons. It's a Harry/Draco romance, which, as we know, anything that contains slash is instantly downvoted. It also has a few spelling and grammar issues due to the age of it. It contains a complete AU where Neville is the Boy Who Lived and Harry is... Harry is pretty dark throughout. I wrote it to write a genuine dark Harry story with no redemption.

2. My next fic is one that revolves around the son of Salazar Slytherin, who survived for a thousand years. This fic has massive world building, very little romance -- none of which is with the main character, who is 8 -- and a pretty radical change in beliefs. It explores the Founders Era in depth that I hope hasn't been done before. This one I might promote.

3. I have been on and off drafting a vampire Harry story for the longest time. Whenever I write it, I give up and restart it, making no progress at all.

4. Same as above, but a necromancer Harry who pretty much joins Voldemort as a valued asset.

5. And, finally, a fic where the main character is Tom Riddle's twin brother. I haven't gotten too far in this besides names, a few changes, and exploding on both their characters.

That is about it. :P

** Hi everyone,

I'm Roguepen (same name on FN) I do less writing then I want to and far more reading then I should. I've been in and out of here looking for things to read at my boring retail office job and you all put out such great recommendations. It's inspired me to start writing again and finish my project.

I'm making plans for my master's degree down the road, no more getting yelled at by customers or micromanaged by the (eventual) office manager. So a thank you to you all for making my life more bearable . Overall, HPF is pretty good and life is going well.

** I'm from California. I got into Harry Potter fanfic somewhat late- in like 2014 or 15.

I have a question. I've been reading about earlier stages of Harry Potter fanworks, and recently I've been reading the story of Msscribe and her alt accounts. The story mentions the collapse of the Gryffindor Tower website due to infighting, but it links to a wiki that is now defunct and doesn't show up on the wayback machine for an account of it. I'm kind of interested in this. However, I can't find any factual accounts of the collapse. Anyone know how it went down?

** Hi. I'm brad. I've been blind since birth (I can see light and shadows) How am i? Not bad, I'm planning to visit a friend in America in a couple of months and think I'm going to really enjoy it.

How can the mods make this subreddit better?

Well I'm not sure about that but I do have a huge collection of fan fiction (over 9 point something gigs of the stuff) but as far as I know, at the moment i'm unable to post it.

I think I should be able to post it for those who want to enjoy fan fiction offline.

Small request for subreddit style: can we get the (## new) for thread post comment counts to show up in a brighter color?

** Sup, have been enjoying the sub on and off for a few years now and have three suggestions

1. Add the frequently recommended stuff to the bot under it's major tags so when someone new asks for Harry/tonks or whatever someone can just have the bot put the really common stuff. Plus it might make people pay more attention to those lists and they get updated more frequently

2. Add a quarter-yearly post for new pics similar to the book club but more for fics new to that period of time.

3. Less of a mod thing and more of a general request to the entire sub, but I would really love to see some more general discussion about types of fics, why they're good or bad, and how to improve upon their flaws. Like how people tend to make jokes about Indy!Harry fics that have infinite trunks of awesome and unbelievebly helpful goblins, can those be done better with those elements, and how would you do that.

But without all of that I would like to thank the mods and subscribers here for the truly massive amount of free entertainment I have gotten here. Sirius-ly awesome community.
