I hate mpreg, and I will immediately quit a fic if it has it, even if it's good. Coincidentally this also seems to go along with the crappy soul bond trope, which I also hate, so please none of that.

Are there any fanfics out there where a vampire or Snape or whoever tries their best to convince Harry to let himself have a baby with them, but Harry shuts that shit down? I dunno but I really need this after the shit that I've seen...


** Dumbledore trying to convince Harry to become, effectively, Mrs. Snape is the McGuffin that starts the action in linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter). It's a 3-way cross with Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon. There is a completed sequel, also.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon
