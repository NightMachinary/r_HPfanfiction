*** You mean "patient zero". Seriously, wish fulfilment fics like those were a fricking disease for a long time. You couldn't actually read one without groaning once per chapter.

Oh, and Goblins? Goblins aren't human. They've probably been trying to be helpful to the entire wizarding world by toughening them up through war & prolonged financial strife while the wizards reciprocate through progroms & genocide. They might think them and the wizards get along just fine with how many times one has done the other a favour by killing off their collective weak.

Goddamn, but those fics... The number of times I've read variations on the theme of 'lets subjugate him again like we've done for the past ten years-oops lol that didn't work because there's a bystander in the way now'.

If you're going to bash Dumbledore for being a master manipulator who's secretly a Dark Lord (or a Perfect Lionheart caricature-the wtf factor of that Dick Dastardly costume or the whole stealing /fucking landmass/ was just, like, whoa man, your dealer must be Jesus or something 'coz that was some divine shit you musta been smoking when you wrote that), then actually /make him a master manipulator/dark lord/.

You don't even have to up your writing skills to do it! Just turn Dumbledore into Palpatine and have Snape play at being count dooku/Gendo Ikari. There, almost as shitty, but does the bashing some justice. Besides, Snape in an epic beard. Come on.

If you write fics like that where the bad guys are so good they won against the other bad guys & fooled the entire wizarding /planet/ (head of the ICW, remember?) into believing they were the good guys all along despite that little thing with Grindelwald then said bad guys /will not lose/ without a fight that makes the second blood war look like a disneyland ride-if only because they can call on a /planet's/ worth of backup, often of the good guys' variety as well.

Which means that, when you get Dumbledore tossed into Azkaban for sealing a will due to extraordinary circumstances related to national security, you fail at everything, full stop.

Oh, and their end-game must be something other than 'squashing that idiot Riddle' too. If you have /the/ most powerful & wise wizard in the books as being evil & dark without anyone knowing it, then he must have a reason for not simply retiring and spending a couple of thousand years being immortal & evil in a side dimension of his own devising where he can make his very own Lord Of the Rings-style epic sage with a clone of him as the bad guy while he does research before spending the weekend lazily watching the weekly Epic Final Battle between Good & Evil through his Evil Crystal Ball.

He must have a reason to put up with everyone's bullshit instead of mass killing the lot of them & teaching their clones to not be idiots by having them collect the corpses of their idiotic progenitors.

That's what you have to find out. What is the greater good for a totes evil Dumbledore? Bear in mind that 'Greater Good' credo. It may be that his goal is actually noble & something that everyone should get behind-world peace in muggle & magical worlds, colonising space, making magic available to muggles for technological & scientific advances, preventing the endless cycle of Dark Lords coming up, ensuring the survival of humanity beyond the end etc etc etc... It can be literally anything big enough to justify keeping the wizarding world under his/their thumb with a potential view to enslaving the muggle world as well. But it has to be big enough, otherwise the Greater Good can be achieved by enslaving a resurrected Voldemort & the Death Eaters that escaped jail and have them do the heavy lifting for you... which is a possibility too.

But yeah, for the love of all that is cliched & evil, make it /work/ instead of saying 'this guy's evil, so wish-fulfilment-Harry will kick his ass by talking to a goblin'. Cliches are cliches for a reason-with a bit of work, they can be good. They can be fresh and original and all that. You just have to make it work by, and I get that this can be hard, figuring out why character x would go so far or stoop so low. Once you have that, you can turn the 'bash' into something so much better.

So, if you write a wish fulfillment fic, make it work by not regurgitating bullshit. The good guys almost never win, but do win when it counts. The bad guys have to struggle with their roles and their reasons, be they beset by moral dilemmas or psychological problems. The side characters have lots of reasons to allow shit to go through-highlight why they do so. Nobody should be perfect. No situation should go completely, if at all, right. Blind spots, paranoia and stubbornness are attributes to all involved. Good intentions or plans don't work the way they should. Everybody's guilty of sloppy reasoning.

In short, if you're going to post your 'rocks fall, bad guys die' fantasies, please bear in mind that other people will read it too. Consider them. Make your fic something more than a bad 2d copy of a bad 2d copy of a bad 2d copy of a bad fix-it fic whose origins have been lost to time.

Make it work, for all our sakes. Only you can halt the spread of wish fulfillment syndrome! Consult with a competent beta reader today!

Yup. We all know these ones. I'm sorry to drag Wolfstar into it, but let's be honest here, the majority of writers who do this in the summaries seem to have a thing for it. Not that I blame them entirely, but still.
