Iâ€˜m okay with smut but there has to be at least some plot. Bonus points if Harry is a professional Quidditch player.

No slash please

** "Loose Cannon" is pretty much exactly that, Harry joins the Chudley Cannons and has relations with lots of witches: linkffn(13452914)

There also some plot with Harry developing "light magic" and trying to reform Wizarding Britain.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
