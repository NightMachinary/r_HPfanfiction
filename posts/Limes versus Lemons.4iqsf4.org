Can someone please explain the difference in lemons versus limes? I see "warning: lemons ahead" or "warning: contains limes" and I'm not sure what I'm being warned about half the time. Just smut? Slash? Anything smoochy? Why a lemon? Why a lime?


** As far as I know, Lemon means the story will have graphic sex scenes. Lime means suggestive scenes, but nothing too graphic.

** Allegedly, Lemon came from an anime series called Cream Lemon alluding to explicit fanfiction due to Cream Lemon's rather explicit content itself. Lime then got co-opted to mean nonexplicit but adult oriented, I presume since they wanted to continue the motif.

** Put simply, lime is "mature" and lemon is "explicit".

** I'll never understand why they don't use passionfruit. I mean, the name would be perfect.

*** Because the name has history. It derives from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_Lemon][Cream Lemon]] and limes are lemons without all the lemony goodness.

** Lime is like a milder lemon. In general, lemon is the much more widely used term, although they're strictly speaking not allowed on fanfiction.net (as they would be rated 'Explicit' rather than 'Mature'). Limes are barely allowed afaik.

If you're looking for stories that contain lemons, your best bet is probably AO3 and filtering by 'Explicit' or maybe 'Mature' - it's also got a better pairing search system, although there's less total content, especially for Harry Potter, compared to fanfiction.net. There's also a few sites dedicated solely to [Harry Potter] smut, but I don't know any off the top of my head.
