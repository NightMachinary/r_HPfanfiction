Have you ever felt like a writer just doesn't understand the character they are writing? What are some tools they can use to help better understand them? I find personality quizzes on the character's behalf to be helpful. Just found this one, and it was so fun doing it: [[https://ejadelomax.itch.io/sortinghatchats]]

** - James and Lily in any fic with the WBWL premise : both were ready to die to save their child, there is no way Harry would end up with the Dursley unless they are dead or in the same state than Neville's parents).
- Dumbledore in any Manipulative Dumbledore fic : he refuses the post of MoM because he doesn't trust himself with power after his youthfull mistake, not because he has some convoluted plot to finally take the power he was offered from the start.
- Any fic with a Indie Harry : as said by SirYabas, he always end up the arrogant kid Snape think he is. Also, Canon Harry flyed in the middle of Fienfyre to save the life of an enemy that had tried to kill him moments before, but Indie Harry will refuse to go into the lake to save his previous best friend (abandonned months before) because he doesn't care about him.
- Probably any fic with a perfect character (hello Hermione) or bashing (hello Ron) : Rowling characters all have qualities and flaws.

** JK Rowling and Severus Snape? /s but kinda not

In terms of FF I read a lot of Hermiones who are willing to diminish themselves so that Harry or another of her friends/love interests can take the credit. Right away that is out of character for me. Hermione will sacrifice for the greater good /for a friend/ or for a cause that she feels is too important, but otherwise, she wants that sweet credit for herself and craves praise and encouragement from her teachers and authority figures. (Unless there's an in-story reason, explained at some point, for why this isn't the case)

I also struggle with overly heartless or sadistic Harrys for the same reason - if anything, Harry's weakness during canon is that he cares /too much/ about others to risk putting them in harm's way, to the extent that he only thinks to disarm his enemies. Once again, this can be mitigated or removed with explanation, but coming out of the blue its a hard sell for me.

*** Oh, canon Harry does have a ruthless and sadistic streak, and that behavior is consistent throughout the last 3-4 books:

- He had nothing against Hermione keeping Rita Skeeter in a jar for days and then blackmailing her.
- He ordered Hedwig to peck Ron and Hermione's hands for not writing what he wanted to know.
- He unsuccessfully crucioed Bellatrix for killing Sirius.
- He greatly enjoyed Ginny mocking Fleur and beating up Zach Smith.
- He secretly practiced HBP spells on Crabbe, Goyle, and Filch under his Invisibility Cloak.
- He tried to crucio Snape for killing Dumbledore.
- He successfully crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall "You have to mean it!"

If you piss off canon Harry enough, he will be cruel and vindictive. That's why I think his progressions in "The Sum of Their Parts" and "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" are totally credible. A Ministry that continues to behave maliciously and betray him will be met with his ultimate wrath!

**** True, but those come after experiences he's had at Hogwarts or against people who had already personally wronged him or those he cared about. As I said, if there's reason given, I don't take issue with it. I had in mind more the 11 and 12 year old Harrys who plan Saw-like gruesome murder rooms for their enemies which are then described in loving detail by the writer.

I guess it really depends on your interpretation of a character.

If someone asked me to write a fic about Draco Malfoy, I'd write a magical version of the NÃ¼rnberg trials where he'd be sentenced for his war crimes (and Harry saves him from the gallows/dementors as a favour to Narcissa, turning it into a life sentence).

I am quite sure than any Malfoy fan would accuse me of not understanding his character, just like I would accuse them of the same.

** A fanfic with Harry paired with Delphini (I like the idea so i wanted to check up but god, it was bad.)\\
In this one, Voldemort is portrayed as a misundestood revolutionary and idealist and a very good family guy.

But they needed a villain to continue the history so there's a whole nonsense with Grindelwald being a literal Nazi that has an army of muggleborns, god, this fic made no sense at all.

Delphini was just a self insert mary sue in disguise and Harry was useless, there was bashing with all other character's that weren't death eaters and Bellatrix Lestrange was a sane and loving mother.
