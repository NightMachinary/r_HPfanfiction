I just read linkffn(11426651) And was hoping there were more like it where Harry is a powerful mod and gets shunted off to a marvel verse or just the wizarding world is just isn't a big part of the story No slash no fem!harry

  Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

  Harry wakes up in a strange jungle seemingly de-aged and without his wand. He has to figure out how to live in this whole new environment that he has seemingly warped to. And what the hell is a Wakanda? First few chapters will be about entry into the world and not much else. Obviously takes place in the Avengers universe. Will primarily use the MCU as a reference.

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

** *Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe* linkffn(13326497)\\
The original world lost to the world due to Voldemort and incompetent politicians. Harry has his final confrontation with Voldemort and ends up in a ritual to hop realities. Ends up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Has some butterfly effects on the MCU due to his interaction. Powerful MOD Harry. Lots of research and development.

They do go back to the original world near the end.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

**** It doesn't, at least not as far as has been written. There are a few moments where I actually hoped a pairing would happen but which turned out to be a red herring.

So far, it focuses on plot as well as character, though the MC is actually /developing/ as a character at a glacial pace.

Also she's not called "Harriet" so that's a plus
