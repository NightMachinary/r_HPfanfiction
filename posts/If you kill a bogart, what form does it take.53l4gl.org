** In canon they specifically state no one has ever seen its true form so, by canon, it must retain the form it died in.

**** It's possible and could make an interesting fanon idea. Maybe it's where poltergeists come from if the most feared thing is a humanoid or other sentient magical creature.

**** Yes, but there is a difference between something said by a teacher, and a fairly competent one at that, and a ministry official in denial as a way to dismiss someone they don't care about enough to listen to.

** It's a creature that takes the most terrifying and disruptive form it possibly can. When something dies, it becomes an inanimate object, so that leaves only one possibility for a boggart's final form...

a pile of very fine glitter.

I'm not certain that it does. A boggart is a creature which draws fears from a victim's mind and presents it to them as if it were physical. And yet it can only be affected by a spell to disrupt its attack. It feeds on one emotion and suffers from another- amusement, as demonstrated by laughter.

I would conclude that a boggart is most like a poltergeist- a nonhuman spirit that can affect the physical by taking a form. It could be that a poltergeist is an advanced form of boggart who has absorbed enough anxieties from different victims that it has formed its own identity. While it has taken a single form it now uses that unique and disturbing existence to further its feeding. Peeves certainly seems to thrive on outbursts of rage, shame and fear.

EDIT: so to answer the question, I think a dead boggart looks like a small puddle of ectoplasm.
