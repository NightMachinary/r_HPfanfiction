Looking for a fanfiction where harry goes into anothers body. Either by time travel gone wrong, master of death or potions accident etc. The most interesting ones , I find , are voluntary, eg the fanfiction where Luna, and Harry swap bodies and trade lives pretending to be the other. I like the idea of permanent polyjuice. Also any forced?, eg fangirl swaps places with harry and he has to live as said fangirl.
