Where the Death Eaters are more villainous, where the fear of Voldemort's name is showed more in a way that makes sense, et cetra.

Maybe Voldemort had been able to break free of the Diary Horcrux and Ginny was a shell of herself, maybe more deaths of his opponents, so many stories have the Order Members be about stunning instead of killing, whereas in canon Order Members were willing to kill, Remus even told Harry that stunning and expelliarmus was things in the past! So yeah, more stories where the Order does more work, by killing or such of the Death Eaters.

Doesn't have to be all of that, but just something more.

Where the issue between "light and dark" is more morally ambiguous instead of so bone dry.

Not wanting character bashing, each character has issues after all, and I just think character bashing tends to be a way to write something without thinking too much on it. If there is character bashing a little bit is fine, but I'd rather it be minor to absolutely none.

Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but yeah, an author going out of their way to bash on a character is normally a no go.

Not looking for Harem Harry or Lord Potter Harry. Not looking for a Harry that is super powerful or super intelligent. A slightly more smarter or slightly more powerful Harry is fine, but I'd rather it be relatively believable.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Horcruxes can be a thing or not, I don't care either way.

Harry can be on Dumbledore's side or on his own side, would rather not have Harry be on Voldemort's side.

** I am curious about the issue between light and dark being more morally ambiguous part.

How can one go about doing that when canonically one faction wants to eradicate a section of the population based on blood and the other is trying to stop it?

** Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter; Stages of Hope) maybe?

Both stories have very capable villains and a grittier it grimmer story than canon.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
