** Was expecting Warhammer fics that weren't the Inquisitor Carrow series. I'm disappointed :( But here are some fics linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse by HunterBerserkerWolf;Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is;Adas Reborn;Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988).

That second to the last one is a crossover fic. It isn't complete, but it stopped in a non-awkward chapter. The last one just updated. It isn't a super!mc fic. It focuses on what ASOIAF does best: politics.

  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book One finished! Book Two started!

#+begin_quote
  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.

A 7 part Albus Potter series that was completely planned out before being written and has the most cohesive plot I've read in a fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][First Book]]

The seventh book is being written currently and should be finished by the end of the year.
