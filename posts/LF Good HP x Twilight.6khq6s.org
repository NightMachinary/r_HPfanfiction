Would love to see some Alice x HP but pretty much anything that is good would be nice to read. Nothing with rape or MPreg please.

Edit: Slash is fine


** We talking non-slash? The only non slash hp x twilight stories I have found are Chrysoclorous which is a decent Harry x Rosalie fic, and 'The girl who imprinted' which is Harry x Leah.

*** Slash is fine it just always seems either rapey or mpreg. If it avoids that I don't mind
