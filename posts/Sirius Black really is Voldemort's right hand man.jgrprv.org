So a prompt where everything that was said and feared about Sirius Black is 100% true:

- He did betray James and Lily.
- He is Voldemort's right hand man, one of his most powerful followers.
- He escaped Azkaban to kill Harry.
- He is still Harry's god father.

Any stories like that?

Additional ideas:

- It was Peter who tracked Sirius down, but got nearly blown up and is now permanently trapped in his rat form, turning back into human will be lethal due to severe injuries he sustained.
- Good guy Peter who tries his best to protect Harry.
- Peter would sacrifice himself to help Harry fight off Sirius Black in the Shrieking Shack and escape.
- Sirius would run off after failing to kill Harry, to find his master and help him resurrect.


** This sounds so fun. I like the idea of some sort of dimension-hopping/time-travel AU where whoever our MC is is just entirely confused by what's going on.

** I think I've heard of one like this. It's Harry goes to Durmstrang and it's HP/TMR slash.

Didn't read it cause slash ain't my cup of tea.

*** That sounds like a really AU though so while might be a good story and all, not quite what I was hoping. Yeah with you completely - Voldemort/Anyone(and especially pubescent boys) is just ... wrong.
