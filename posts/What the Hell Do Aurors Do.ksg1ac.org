Seriously.

We're told they catch dark wizards, but that's not super clear, and when we meet Kingsley and Tonks it's implied that they're hunting Sirius, and function similarly to police. The only thing I can come up with is that Aurors function as magical police, hunting down Wizards committing Wizard crime working with other departments like the obliviators to cover it up when it bleeds into the muggle world. It seems a bit like the ministry just calls anyone who disagrees with them Dark Wizards.


** Personally I write them as the top elite of police, dealing with murders, high level dark magic and top level security, with standard law enforcement wizards dealing with petty/day to day crime. Canon is inconsistent with their role so there is lots of flexibility for an author to carve out what they want from the role, but it should be high level.

** They're the elites in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, I'd say. They investigate, hunt, and capture (or perhaps even kill, depending on circumstance) Dark wizards or whoever else they're assigned to get.

On a slightly different note and in reference to [[/u/RayvenQ][u/RayvenQ]]'s answer (I know it's a headcanon, and I respect that), it's interesting to note that the term /Auror/ originated in book four, while /Hit Wizard/ was only used once (by Fudge in book three) across the entire series and were never referenced before or after Fudge's line.

All in all, if you look at the function of Aurors and how they were mentioned, there's a good chance that JKR wrote them to be the retcon of the Hit Wizards.

However, it's fine if anyone wishes to use Hit Wizards in their story or headcanon. No problem. It can help with the worldbuilding of the Ministry beyond simply having regular DMLE workers and Aurors chasing the Dark threats.

(Perhaps JKR dropped the term /Hit Wizard/ because she didn't want something so close to a contract-killer in the children's books. I'm not sure.)

*** I don't even remember Hit Wizards being mentioned, and I read the books 8 times. But if you say it happened in book 3, it was likely in regards to Sirius Black. Perhaps they are contracted bounty hunters. Or maybe your retcon idea is right. But it certainly makes me think.

#+begin_quote
  ‘You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid,' said Fudge sharply. ‘Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered.
#+end_quote

Fudge in chapter 10 of /Prisoner of Azkaban/.

Here it seems that Hit Wizards were members of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. However, since they're never mentioned again (not even by Sirius himself in the cave in book four), there's a good chance that Hit Wizards were old-canon Aurors.

This makes sense in that the Ministry would've prioritised their own people's safety, and so they had to wait until the Aurors arrived to do the fighting against Voldemort's supposed right-hand man. But, as we know, Sirius didn't put up a fight, though that's beside the point.

***** It's important to remember that the DMLE and the Aurors have different heads. I'd imagine that Hit Wizards are something close to a SWAT team, however, I don't believe that the term is the official term for the position within the DMLE. I'd imagine it refers to individuals specifically trained for the purposes of hurting people, a general term for mercenaries, leg-breakers, and the like. The Aurors on the other hand are the police force and handle all crime, and I do believe they have beat cops. Mad-Eye got most of his scars in the line of duty after all. You have to remember that the Wizarding World doesn't have a military, so instead, they militarize the police in times of war. As far as I can tell nearly all wizarding conflicts are internal, with Grindelwald being the exception as he utilized Muggles to maximize the damage he could cause.

** I'm writing a series where Harry got on as an Auror. He works on solving a mystery that's at the centre of the plot. Really, I think what Aurors do is left open-ended enough that it can fill whatever requirement your fic (or canon, even) requires.

His investigation is a big but admittedly scattered part. The series overall might not be to your taste depending on pairings, tropes, characters, etc. Harry isn't a POV character until the second part, and his investigation starts in the third.

If you just want to read his journey to being an Auror and the investigation, the relevant chapters would probably be:

Spying/creating assets for the Order in Year 7 at Hogwarts (Reign Without a Crown): 1, 3 (until break), 4 (after break), 8, 11, 14 (after break), 16, 19 (after break), 21 (middle scene), 22 (until break), 23 (until break), 24 (until break), 26-31

Auror post-Hogwarts/investigation (Chasing the Storm): 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (after break), 10, 11, 12, 13 (after break), 14, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29-38

** This is my headcanon.

Hit Wizards are basically the SWAT (or SO19 since I'm british) of the Magical world, either set to specific targets (as a result of Auror investigations) or extraordinary circumstances, much like how real world SWAT type agencies act.

Aurors are the Magical equivilant of detectives, investigating, talking to informants, research, etc etc but in times of conflict, can take a more frontline role, giving the MLEP a bit of extra muscle and in terms of skill, are just below hitwizards, posted at/with high value targets, whether that be a location or a person.

Magical Law Enforcement Patrol/Squad are your regular beat cops.

** I imagine them in more of a pre-police sense, when we used to use military officers to keep order. Lot more focus on ending big threats and generally keeping things quiet and calm rather than actually 'enforcing law', all whilst basically being enforcers for the government to keep a constantly armed people in check.

** Yeah, as others have said, it's not clear.

My view is Aurors are DETECTIVES. They need to be intelligent and able to interpret poisons (potions), understand dangerous plants that might harm people, know of spells and such, and be able to fight well.

Hit Wizards are SWAT. They are pure warrior types, designed to breach dangerous homes and deal with dangerous people. Less investigative skills, more kick ass skills and protecting people.

Both are highly skilled in different ways.

** As far as I understand it, where Aurors are an amalgamation, so to speak, of Special Branch, MI5 and Investigative Branch; Involved in Personal Protection (Bodyguard), Counter-Terrorism/Surveillance/Intelligence, and Detective work, hunting Dark Wizards. Highly Trained and efficient specialists, and MLEP (Magical Law Enforcement Patrol) are uniformed Constables. Hit Wizards are the sort of bridging point between the two, responsible for Armed response, Hostage Negotiation, Crowd and Riot Control. Equivalent to Firearms Officers, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the like.

Copied from my answer in another thread, where roughly the same question was asked.
