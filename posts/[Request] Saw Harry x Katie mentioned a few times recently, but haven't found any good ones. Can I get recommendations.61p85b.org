  AU. Harry is saved from Voldemort by an unknown creature after the Third Task, but is injured a way that has strange consequences that impact the life of Harry. As he enters his fifth year, Harry gains new allies whilst struggling to control his new powers, and notices he has had a friend hiding in plain sight. Harry/Katie Bell pairing. Post GOF and AU afterwards. Enjoy!

** Linkffn(7241901) is good, but falls under the "incomplete, probably dead" category.

*** I wouldn't recommended this one. Everything that happens seems so fake and contrived. Unfortunately there's so few Harry/Katie fics that one has to put up with it :(.

  Katie and Harry make a professional Quidditch team, but after having bad relationships, decide to avoid it all together by putting on a show and making everyone think they're together. But will stay a show? Rated T, might change later.
