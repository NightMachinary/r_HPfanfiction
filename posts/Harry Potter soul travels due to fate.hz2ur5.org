Hello, this doc wasn't completed. Harry was transported into a different version of himself that was evil. He has red hair now. He also has Theo younger siblings, I think named Violet and Ivy?. His past self stole a knife from Sirius. At one point, he is fueling at Hogwarts and someone mentions he has a similar fighting style to Bellatrix Lestrange. If this sounds familiar to anyone please help.
