So possibly wizards don't really need them, since they have Quidditch, but what would you come up with for a wizard adrenaline rush?

For example - I'd probably love sky diving. I'm not sure exactly how the mechanics work, but I'd guess jump, and see how long you can go before casting something to flow your fall, or perhaps apparating, if you can apparate midair. I'd guess variation on broom racing, such as brooms that can only go a certain height, and then racing through obstacle courses/woods. In countries where flying carpets aren't illegal, I'd guess surfing would be easy enough. Maybe brooms/carpets that can only be steered with sails?


** Creature running. Its when you find a dangerous creature, attempt to either ride it, or get it to chase you. You escape you live.

Similar to our running with the bulls events.

Another idea is spell crafting as it is seemingly dangerous.

Finally my idea personally, especially in Britain, muggle rushing. Its when a wizard goes into the muggle world for a specific amount of time and trys to live...without magic.

*** Graphorns, Mountain Trolls have scars from trying to ride them. Running of the Tebos, invisible warthogs.

*** I like it!

I've always thought spell crafting to be dangerous in the way scientific experiments can be dangerous, rather than an extreme sport. It's an interesting idea, a sort of spell-crafting competition, rather than a science one.

I suspect muggle rushing would be too scary for half the wizard population ;)
