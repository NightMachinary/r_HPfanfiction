I can just imagine Hermione going,"Someone's shipping me with MALFOY?! *runs to the bathroom to puke*. And Malfoy going,"OMG if another person ships me with that Granger mudblood" *someone ships dramione* Draco: "Wait until my father hears"


** There was a meta fic where the characters were acting out the fics like it was a movie set or play. Mainly background stuff like characters complaining about the fic they were acting out.

** I haven't seen that exact scenario but there are a couple of fics that may be similar.

In the Short Pumpkin Pies: One Shot Collections by NightWing201 Hermione is a fanfiction writer who writes Hunger games fanfiction. She goes a little nuts about her OTP and Harry takes steps to change her focus.

Then the short story I Will Not Marry A Weasley by broomstick flyer has both Harry and Hermione refusing to marry a Weasley irregardless of what the "Harry Potter" books said.

Attack of the Fan Fic Authors by Bobmin is a series of shorts done in the style of other fanfic authors including having the characters referring back to the "script".

[[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Attack_of_the_Fan_Fic_Authors/index/]]

Harry Potter and the Paradigm Shift by Kinsfire also has characters checking the "script"

  A small one shot that several readers have asked me to post. Harry and Hermione both refuse to do as the author wanted and marry and Weasley. Some folk find it amusing. all I can say is read and enjoy.

** Random fanfic author: /ships, say, Harry and Draco/

Harry and Draco simultaneously: Eeewwwww!!!!!!

Harry: Mate, you'd better delete that right now! Aurors can use the Unforgivables, you know!

Author: I thought you could only use them against Death Eaters?

Draco interupts: I AM a Death Eater, and I certainly have enough gold to bribe my way out of the charges. Do you wish to sample that which my Aunt Bellatrix taught me?

Author: Well, uh...

Harry: Besides, I once used the Cruciatus on someone because they spat at my favorite teacher. And that wasn't nearly as offensive as I find this.

Draco: You should use the Killing Curse, Potter, that way we can say it was self defense.

Author: N-n-now let's not be hasty. Do you really think you can summon that much hate?

Harry and Draco look at each other, grimace: Yes/Easily done.

Harry: I might not hate you personally (Draco: Speak for yourself!), but the very idea of me and HIM feels me with absolute loathing.

Author: Presses delete button.

** There's this delicious little fic called linkao3(From Drarry to Snarry) where Snape finds Harry's fanfiction stash (which Hermione supplies because they find it hilarious). It ends with Harry/Snape and is mostly smut but it's so funny hearing Severus' thoughts as he discovers various pairings (think wolfstar).
