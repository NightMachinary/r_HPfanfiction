  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Harry roflstomping the opposition and getting absolutely everything is always fun to me. The creativity is in how Harry actually executes his plot-breakingly awesome awesomeness of course. The more creatively the better but for some reason even if absolutely nothing of value happens and he just hauls in the titles, inheritances and witches, I still feel compelled to keep reading until the story inevitable gets abondoned when no more loot and booty can be gathered and the author couldn't be arsed to come up with an actual plot.
