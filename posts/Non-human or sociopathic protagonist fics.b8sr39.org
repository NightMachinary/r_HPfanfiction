I'm looking for fics with nonhuman or sociopathic protagonists

e.g.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/]]

or

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15294075/]]

or

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10076366/c][https://archiveofourown.org/works/10076366/]]

​

Edit: what I liked about each of the fics:

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10076366/]]: the idea of having lily potter as a voice in your head is cool, plus the slight nonhumanity of the protagonist

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15294075]]: both "AU self of canonically evil character travels into canon" and "non-evil, but kinda sociopathic protagonist to a point where she's more nonhuman than human"

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/]]: strongly nonhuman protagonist basically living in harry's skin and trying to make do

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** Judging by you listing two inwardtransience fics I'm guessing you know about The Long Game? Charissa is pretty much exactly what you're asking for.

I also just recommended linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale by Krahae) in another thread but it fits here too. Harry is a changeling and rejects his humanity.

Others:

Lily has seriously warped morals and fails to understand some of the basics of humanity in linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin)

Hermione is ruthless and loses touch with humanity in linkffn(Lady of the Lake by Colubrina)

Probably most Riddle-centric fics will fit too, but I don't read too many of them.

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
