:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
For the life of me I cannot find this particular fanfic. I remember stuff like Harry connecting with a number of students that either can't or won't return home over the holidays (Muggle board games and activities were a big part of this, I specifically remember D&D and McGonagall's peripheral interest in it), and that it's almost like a healing experience for him over the course of the year where he comes to terms with things and grows. I think it was pretty soon after the war, if not right afterwards. I thought it was by one of the main postwar writers but I cannot find it among the ones I looked at. There's a cool scene towards teh end where Harry and all of his friends are chilling in his quarters and McGonagall talks with them.

​

Anyone able to help?

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
