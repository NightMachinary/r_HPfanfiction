** There was a really old fan fic story---I wish I remembered the name!---where Severus became good friends with James and was civil with the rest of the Marauders. He basically thought of James as a doofus with a good heart and James tried to get him to lighten up. He starts spying on Voldemort and was never a marked death eater/joined for real reasons in the first place, but still gives up the prophecy through a series of fuck ups.

He was nicer to Harry in canon, but not friendly, because looking at him reminded him of the guilt of accidentally having a hand in the death of his two close, only real friends and Harry finally learns the truth towards the end of the story after he's dead.
