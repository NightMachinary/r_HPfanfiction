:END:
I just discovered this sub so my question has probably been asked a few times by now. In the last years i have dived pretty deep into the HPrabbithole and i'm running out of good and interesting stories. I don't want an unfinished, Harem, superharry with a Different background Story.

Are there any fanfics where the Focus is on the Magic, the creatures or the subjects? Where a duel is using your creativity to manipulate Magic and not just throwing curses at each Other? Where they use some forms of magic that isn't in the books?

Thanks in advance for any recommendations


** Have you read The Arithmancer by White Squirrel? Lots of magical innovation, and don't let the maths scare you off.
