Hey HP Fanfic readers. Recently, I took a small break from reading fanfic and was trying to get back into it and read some more fics. I used to have a list somewhere of stories that I wanted to read but alas, I seem to have lost it. Anyways, if you all could post some of your favorite stories that have some genre of romance in there and that are above 80k words. Want something to last me a little while and that has some sort of storyline and development (pls no one shots). Any pairing works for me and I'm open to any tropes or other challenges or whatever, just post the best stories that are around.

Some things that I DO remember reading are:

- The Eight Year
- Three to Backstep
- Harry Crow

Thank you for all suggestions and I will probably read everything that is posted here!


** Stygian Trilogy by Slide. It's next gen, really polished. Has decent romance and really well-written adventure. I think the entire trilogy is about a million words, so you'll have something to read for a while.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

Usually “Harry Crow” would also be on my list, but clearly you've read that one already.

Those are all of my All Time Favorite HP fics, that don't take place in a different universe. Of them; Firebird, The Arithmancer, The Queen Who Fell To Earth, Again and Again, Core Threads, and A Father First have romance to some extent.

Given I was already linking nearly half of them, I figured I'd just give you my presaved list, rather than list them all out again.

** The flair you should be using is 'Request', not 'Recommendation'. 'Recommendation' is for when you want to /recommend/ a fic to others.

**** I'm not sure if you mean sorry as in you're apologising (which there's no reason to. I made that mistake all the time back when I was new to Reddit) or you didn't understand, but I'll assume it's the second. The thing under your post title that says 'Recommendation' is called a post flair. Flairs are used to mark posts so it's easier for people to find the posts they're looking for. The Wiki has a page that explains what each flair means. You might want to check that out. To quote that page:

#+begin_quote
  *Request*

  Use this when looking for fics that fit a certain criteria (specific ship, character, genre, trope, etc.

  /e.g:/ Looking for 100k+ Harmony fics with time travel

  *Recommendation*

  When you have finished a fic and want others to read it, link it this way.

  /e.g:/ I just finished Turn - it is such a good Drarry!
