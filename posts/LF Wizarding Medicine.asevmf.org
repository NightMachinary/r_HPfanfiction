Are there any fics you recommend that feature Wizard medicine/healing in a prominent way? Maybe set at St. Mungo's, a character study of Madame Pomfrey, a character dealing with an illness/injury or a take on a medical procedural type of show (e.g. House)?

This seems like such an interesting but unexplored area. I haven't seen much beyond a character breaking a bone and drinking a quick potion in fics.

Not too picky on setting, character or time period, but prefer something that reads above a third grade level.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.
