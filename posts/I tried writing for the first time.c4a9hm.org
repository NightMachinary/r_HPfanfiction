This is the only time I'll promote anything by myself so blatantly, but I've been reading on ffn for a long time and finally decided to try my hand at writing.

The only reason I'm doing this is because I would like some kind of feedback and I don't really have any close friends that I could ask it to. So please, critique away, but please try to make things constructive if at all possible.

(Also feel free to bully me for self promoting if you so choose)

Anyway here it is, linkffn(13319309)

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore is convinced the Power is Love. Harry thinks otherwise. Follow Harry as he unites Dumbledore's Army into a force with a cause worth fighting for. The path ahead is riddled with difficult decisions -- can he make the right choices? Slight AU, but mostly canon compliant.

** So I checked it out, and it's too early in the story for me to comment on the plot, but the description makes it sound pretty good. If you want to make it easier to read and understand, I would suggest that you work on formatting dialogue. People don't normally speak in long paragraphs. (I know Dumbledore talks a lot, but still). Also, consider which character's point of view you are writing from. Is this story going to be told from Harry's perspective, or Dumbledore's? At the moment, it seems unclear. Anyway, I hope this helps. For a first try, it's not bad.

*** For this part, I used long speech for Dumbledore because he spoke like that in that chapter of the book. I hadn't planned to continue like that, and Harry's speech was much shorter.

As for the point of view, it will be Harry's point of view, but probably mixed in with a few others. The story I want to write will miss far too much if I only write about what Harry personally witnesses.

**** Fair enough. The great thing about fan fiction is that you can write whatever you want, however you want to write it!

***** I've never been much of a creative writer, but I wanted some kind of challenge, and something to try over the summer. Hopefully I'm not too bad at it
