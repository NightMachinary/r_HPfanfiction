I mean in most magical trunk fic, the main idea is Harry buys a magical trunk with lots of compartments, generally with big duelling grounds and 4 storied apartments and fully furnished potions lab with extremely rare potion ingredients....but what if Harry had only a magical backpack which would hold his broom, books, potion equipments, clothes, writing equipments in sectioned parts and a very stylish magical suitcase which would contain a very mini modular kitchen and a refrigerator ( ice box, in some fics I have read), pre-made potions(maybe a small potions worktable? Ravenclaw&Slytherin!Harrys often start making potions practicing quill writing before the letter even arrives), toiletries and whatever the author would like. Want an apartment? Who needs a bulky leather bound 12 compartment trunks, when apartment doors are there, stick them on wall and voila you get a empty apartment for you. They would even engrave your name on the door(Imagine Vernon Dursley's face when he opens all those locks and enters an empty room with a polished door on the wall, HJP engraved on it) And the suitcase would not stand out in the muggle world too(I have read one fic where Harry orders a black leather bound trunk with an animated phoenix and basilisk fighting and I went why would you need that) and travel friendly........


** He gets a backpack in the venom peddler. Stays over at Hermione's house and asks for a hook on the wall instead of a bed :)

*** Oh I liked that one. Nomadic adventurous harry with very different take on his education. Very well written and avoids many many clichés. A fantastic read.

*** The peak of this story is right before the time skips start happening for real. Basically you get this chapter that's like, halfway through the year and Harry just shows up at hogwarts. It's around the mid to late 30's I think. Basically stop reading at that chapter and just read the last chapter where Harry decides to live at Hogwarts.

Everything up to that point is soooooo cute. Such a fun read. I loved MANY different aspects of it, including the view of the founders through Salazar's notes, actual consistent use of the CoS, etc. but the time skips and the SUPER random body modification & “we're just friends but we kiss and snuggle” with both Luna/Hermione was.... so bad.

**** Oh, there's absolutely some issues with it. I feel like the time skips were a matter of... 'I need to finish this, but I don't know what to say so....'

I really enjoyed the exploration of diagon, personally, and the backpack does heavily feature in the early part of the fic. Which is rare: usually he'll buy the bells and whistles trunk and it's never seen again lol.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

** Well I'm going to follow this post for recommendations.

I read in some random fic that a wizard's trunk used to grows with them. Like they get a basic wood and metal trunk when leaving home and spend years updating and modifying it with what they learn and want during the course of their education according to old culture when pre made stuff wasn't available on stores.

Like in early Hogwarts days, when Hogwarts was just started and people had little to call their own they were taught runes and Arthimancy and enchanting and stuff as basics and they had to do their own work because nobody could do that for them and it was sort of traditional to upgrade your own trunk and trunks were used because basic materials, wood and any type of metal (metal was basis of differentiating between rich and poor) used to make them was most successful in holding enchantments and runes.

** Maybe materials. Hermione's bag can carry a lot of stuff, but I can imagine that upgrading it to a full on room or anything. It is not just expanding the space, you would need to be resistant to at least minor damage from the inside, air filtering and temperature control at a minimum. I tend to head canon enchanted items as a limit to how much magic can be soaked into any particular material, hence the need for gold/gems/phlebotimum. Starting with a large, solid trunk as a base seems intuitively easier, and you have more flexibility with the materials. In the other direction, a portable workshop seems like it would be incredibly expensive, even before you consider everything inside of it, so you make it out of hardwearing materials because you really can't afford for it to be damaged. Perhaps having the starting template being a box makes it easier to create normal looking rooms inside, as you are copying and expanding the same space, solid walls included. Also, even if the user may not particularly care about what someone thinks about their trunk, if it looks flashy with good craftsmanship and high quality materials, it may be more likely to catch you eye in a shop and you would be more willing to trust you life to the magic that stops it collapsing in on itself and pureeing everything inside.

Finally logistics. It might be possible to climb through the opening of a rucksack/suitcase if there is space on the other side, but it doesn't seem ergonomic. Yes, perhaps it could expand to fit you, but at that point whether it is an expanding suitcase or shrinking trunk becomes somewhat academic.
