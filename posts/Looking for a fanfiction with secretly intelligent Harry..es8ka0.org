:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a few years ago when I was really into Harry hiding his intelligence (or just putting his Slytherin side to use).

The one scene I can remember is when Harry has to talk to or deliver something to Snape, and as he's leaving the classroom he absentmindedly stops another student from adding something to his potion (because it would explode). Harry almost makes it out of the classroom when Snape stops him and questions why Harry stopped the student or just how he knew to stop the student. Resulting in Snape realizing that Harry knows more than he lets on.

Before that Harry had been doing pretty good at flying under the radar, but now Snape knows he's hiding something.

  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think. Alternate from Order of the Phoenix

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.

  Harry Potter isn't normal, he is highly intelligent and strives to become the best. Upon finding out about him being a wizard he has to decide if he wants to give up all the work he put into his studies to get a scholarship for a good secondary boarding school or take his place at Hogwarts.

**** There was a scene on book five where it's similar to what OP said. Snape signaled at Harry to get out of the class the last, and then he asked what kind of improvements did he do to the potion, then after Harry explain that questioned Harry about whether or not he had learned anything in his class and how far his knowledge is at the moment.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
