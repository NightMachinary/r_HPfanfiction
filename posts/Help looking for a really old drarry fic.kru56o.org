Hi all,

I'm looking for this really old fic, I don't remember the rating. I only remember a scene where Draco gets caught cooking in Harry's kitchen. Draco's startled, but Harry's really turned on, because nobody's ever cooked for him before.

Turns out Draco asked Hermione for advice to woo Harry and Hermione told Draco to cook for him. She then made sure Harry would be home before time and catch Draco in the act.

Does anyone remember this? I'd really appreciate anything helping me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!
