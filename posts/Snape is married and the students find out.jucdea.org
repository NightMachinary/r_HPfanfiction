Basically I've read a few variations on Snape getting married to someone within a story and now I'm wondering if anyone ever wrote him as being married already, but also being his charming canon self. And as obviously the golden trio and most other students would never assume the greasy bat to be married it would come as quite a shock if they found out.\\
I'm basically looking for a fic in which they do find that out, whatever else happens is secondary (and no I'm not exclusively looking for some super dramatic story with loads of fainting teenagers; I am just curious how people write that kind of teenaged mindfuck; I also don't really care whom he's married to, as long as it's not Rita Skeeter).


** I don't have a rec right now, but that's one of my recent favorite tropes in the House fandom lol - the ducklings don't believe it but he's married to Wilson, whether recently or for a while, and not really secretly but no one thought to give it a thought given his personality. It hadn't occurred to me that Snape would work well for this too, hope you get some good ones because I'd love to read them now :)

Edit: there's actually one I just remembered where Harry finds out Snape is married - not a huge plot point or anything in the story and no real mindfuckery with him finding out, so doesn't really fit what you're looking for, but if you're interested anyway it's the Rage series by puppyoncrack

** Actually in earlier books I always assumed Snape was so mean because he had at home a nagging wife who walked all over him.
