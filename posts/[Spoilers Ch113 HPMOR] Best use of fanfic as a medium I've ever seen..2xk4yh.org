"This is your final exam.

You have 60 hours.

Your solution must at least allow Harry to evade immediate death, despite being naked, holding only his wand, facing 36 Death Eaters plus the fully resurrected Lord Voldemort.

If a viable solution is posted before /12:01AM Pacific Time/ (8:01AM UTC) on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015, the story will continue to Ch. 121.

Otherwise you will get a shorter and sadder ending."

***** They didn't say the fic is good because it has a lot of reviews; their point was that because of all the reviews the author doesn't have to whore for more.

Honestly, I don't get the cynicism. I'm not a fan of the fic, but I can see how this event can be fun if you like the story - there is no need to assume bad intentions on the author's part (in this particular instance). Although framing the whole thing as the 'final exam' is condescending as fuck.

** This is what thirteen year-olds getting into fanfiction do when they start writing. This isn't some postmodern, 'utilize the medium' attempt, it's shameless attention-whoring. If it is the best use of fanfic as a medium, then the choose-your-own-adventure fics at the bottom of the barrel are genius.

Holding back an ending because you expect your readers to go back and make heads or tails of a 600k+ fic in an attempt to locate the one strategy that you plan on using to end the fic 'happily' is /fucking asinine/. Make a decision on how you want to end it and don't make your readers go back and read it again for more reviews.

***** He hinted at the ending in the very first chapter... Literally the very first chapter. You can confirm my claim by reading the very first chapter. I do not understand the insane vitriol this fic gets here. Of course, I do constantly hear that smart kids get bullied, but as I grew up in one of the academic hubs of Sweden I haven't experienced the strange hatred and accusations of showing off people of above average intelligence tend to get firsthand (a substantial portion of my friends are engineers/scientists of some kind, and the ones that aren't are quite rational people). I've only seen it on the internet.

I have learned why misanthropy is so common among intelligent people outside of my city, though. It would be incredibly disheartening if every time you used your brain you were accused of showing off. Fortunately, being surrounded pretty much always by smart people (I live a couple hundred meters outside the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science in Lund) has made being smart a normal and positive thing rather than an aberration that needs to be smacked down.

********* The exposition was good enough for [[/r/hpmor]] and a great deal of reviewers on fanfiction.net to predict large plot details. Even the (final chapter spoilers) [[/spoiler]["Pettigrew is a metamorphmagus that can't turn back to his original form because the dementors are sucking out his magic"]] bit was predicted by a reviewer well in advance of its reveal based on exposition about how these things work and on what had happened to the Weasley rat in the HPMOR-verse and the fact that [[/spoiler][metamorphmagi were first discussed in the same chapter that the Weasley rat story was brought up]].

And it still seems your dislike of the fic is based a great deal on your dislike of the author, and the "pretentious writing" part does give vibes that you feel he is showing off (and even if he were, why is that a bad thing?). I think Orson Scott Card is kind of a git, but I don't think that's a reason to tell people Ender's Game is shit.

********** Saying the exposition was good enough for fans isn't really saying much. Also predicting final plot points doesn't make it good.

Fine we're really doing this?

Reasons I dislike HPMoR:

1) The author moves from a very entertaining story in the early chapters where he explains concepts of rationality that interest him in the context of a fanfiction. This later changes to him using the HP characters to lecture about things with a vague semblance of plot but the story has changed from being about the plot to being about his agenda. This isn't interesting. I don't read fanfiction like I read scientific papers and this fic borderline requires that mindset.

2) His characters are ridiculously smart for their ages. Now I know there's explanations given but frankly they aren't good enough. Hermione having an eidetic memory doesn't mean she is able to learn and absorb as much information as she does. For many things there simply isn't enough time for the characters to /read/ the information they supposedly do never mind absorb it.

3) Speaking of time; the pacing is horrendous. The thing is stupidly long for a Year 1 fic and frankly highlights the authors inexperience and poor writing skills in regards to actual storytelling (his technical ability is admirable though). The timing is borderline ridiculous and the events simply couldn't happen in that space of time.

4) People listen to Harry and other 11 year olds entirely too easily.I get the author wanted to make a point about that but it's unrealistic and boring.

5) Harry is not an interesting protagonist. He's a Mary Sue and not even in a fun way. Like the whole thing with partial transfiguration that he's just so wonderful for working out? That's ridiculous, for one theirs examples of this in canon, and for two, creating a problem for you protagonist to solve through no skill just "I can do this because no one else has" isn't impressive.

6) The dementors. I don't think the author understands what they are and Harry's method of dealing with them is pathetic.

7) The characters are nearly all emotionless bores. I get the whole idea is "lets be logical all the time, yay!" but when you apply that to nearly everyone you just end up with a bunch of characters that are pretty much identical bar life experiences. Also emotions make for a better story.

8) The author tried to monetise it several times which besides being arrogant puts all of fanfiction in the crosshairs for his selfishness.

9) The author shits all over canon. He makes it quite clear that he thinks his version is better and take liberties that are at times embarrassingly bad (see Dementors). This is where my issue with the author comes in. C.S. Lewis is able to convey his Christian faith brilliantly in the Chronicles of Narnia, if you know that he wrote it in that way. If you don't it's a cool story about wardrobes and lions and rings. MoR isn't like that. After a while you can feel the personality of the author seeping in and Harry becomes a self-insert who lectures about how wonderful all these great ideas are. Ideas that the author either came up with or promotes. Basically he uses the story to brag. Same with Enders Game, there's no point at which Ender talks about how bad the gays are ruining the country, but if the MoR guy wrote it I imagine their would be.

10) Harry is just unlikeable.

11) There's about 50 more reasons that I could get into but I can't be bothered and I have Dendritic Cells to attend to. But here's my final thing. There are plenty of fics on here that get shit on constantly but this is the only one where people will demand a breakdown of your every dislike of it. I can't just dislike this fic I have to write a little mini-essay every time it comes up because fans just can't stand someone else disliking it. Now I don't mean to be rude towards you personally, but it happens every time this comes up and in this sub it happens a lot.

*********** This will contain spoilers.

1) I didn't consider this part a negative. The first parts were humorous, the latter parts made me care. The part I could've really done without is the scene with Draco on the train, since that kind of mood whiplash makes a lot of people drop the book then and there due to how uncomfortable that scene is, no matter how much Yudkowsky feels he needed to introduce his point that "people growing up in a bad environment makes them bad people, but that doesn't mean they're bad as part of their nature" in such a shocking manner. A book needs to make the reader want to turn the page, not drop it in disgust.

2) The part where Harry was ridiculously smart for his age came from most of his personality having been replaced by that of an adult Lord Voldemort, leaving behind a remnant of the original Harry Potter. I.e. it is justified in story. Hermione being ridiculously smart was played more realistically, and Yudkowski has some credence with that having himself been a child prodigy. I myself have held conversations with a couple of child prodigies (one of them was 12 and more mature than most adults I've met on the internet, if a bit paranoid. The other was 14 and a math genius, having had long before that moved beyond calculus) and feel Hermione was portrayed quite realistically. Far more than realistically enough for suspension of disbelief. Also, the child genius is a perfectly acceptable literary trope, and shouldn't be discarded for no better reason than that it is hard to believe or unrealistic, even in a rationalist/realistic fic.

3) Perfectly legit criticism here.

4) Again, this one is justified in story. Firstly, the major players (Dumbledore, Snape, Quirrel) already know what's going on with the kid. People like McGonagall start taking Harry seriously only after some rather major shocks and the heavy backing of Dumbledore. People like those of the ministry or those who haven't had experience with Harry can indeed not see him as anything other than a child.

5) It is revealed heavily in the later chapters that many of the things Harry thought were wrong, that many of the things he did or thought were smart were actually irrational, and that much of his behavior was bad, having resulted from arrogance, ignorance, manipulation and his inability to listen to or trust his elders, and that these often led to horrific consequences and almost the destruction of the world (only being stopped from carelessly breaking the Statute of Secrecy and risking a world war for the Stone by an Unbreakable Oath) and, in the future, potentially the solar system and even beyond (try doing the calculations on what would happen if Harry were to transfigure a significant volume of matter into electron soup). He has some rather severe character flaws. The part where he's smart and does smart things does not make him a Mary Sue. The part where he was able to discover something nobody had discovered before was also justified in story (the wizarding population being incredibly small and very few muggleborns continuing their muggle education) and it also turned out that most of the things he discovered were not discoveries at all, but known, like the potions stuff, or outright wrong, like souls not existing, which was based on an assumption Harry made in a fit of emotion and his unwillingness to check or even consider Dumbledore's claims and relying on little more than his view of Professor Binns and something Hermione read in one book by one author.

6) Divergence from canon, and assuming that something that looks and dresses like the classic representation of Death, makes people think of corpses and kills hope is a representation of death is not stupid. The fact that Rowling based them on her experiences with depression (something I'd like to point out often leads to suicide, i.e. death) does not invalidate this interpretation, especially when Rowling didn't codify it in the books themselves. There's also the little detail that it's very common for people to have existential crises in the form of "If I'm going to die anyway, then why does my life matter? What's the point when I'm going to forget everything and everyone will forget me? Why does anything matter if the universe will experience heat death in the future?"

7) No. Perhaps I have a unique perspective on this, both hanging out in a Swedish skeptic society and thus being surrounded by these types of people and having a diagnosed personality disorder alongside various issues with socializing, but I assure you that there is plenty of emotion involved. I related heavily with stuff like Harry being nearly reduced to tears by thinking of the Pioneer missions and such as the same has happened in the past to me when reading about stuff like the Voyager missions. Also, the part where Harry reacts to things like a friend dying by essentially going numb instead of breaking down in tears is also similar to things I have experienced first hand (unfortunately) and I've also experienced what it's like to be manipulated into doing something immoral by someone you trusted and considered a friend and the similarity of my emotional reaction to that of Harry's in such cases were rather shocking. I could also empathize with the character throughout the book in general, feeling happy when I felt Harry was happy and irritated when he did and such, without his emotions having to be stated outright in the text. They may seem emotionless and unrelatable to you, but I can assure you that the emotion is there and they are very relatable to a great many people. Just because the characters don't necessarily leap with joy or break down crying does not make them emotionless.

8) He has not as far as I recall ever tried to hold chapters hostage for money. Nor have I seen him say that people need to donate. I have heard this claim several times, but all I've managed to scrounge up while actually checking these claims is him giving links to donation pages and saying that they would help in many ways including giving him more free time, something I do not consider immoral, and also explaining that by doing so he has received a great deal more funding and support for MIRI than by going around to universities and holding seminars/speeches. Do note that marketing is a thing, donating is optional and if you are not aware that there's a cause you can donate to you will not be able to choose whether to do so or not. Whether he'd bring fanfiction under fire would both depend on whether he manages to break the law and/or attract the ire of JK Rowling, someone who is rather open to the fanfiction community.

9) Snark is snark, and done in good humor. Actual British humor is a lot more hostile than his American style, and is the main style of humor among such big groups as Monty Python, and it's still (generally) done without vitriol. I personally thought some of Lewis's insinuations (that a girl paying attention to boys/her looks/etc. made her promiscuous/immoral/whatever) to be rather offensive and contrived rather than brilliant, especially when it was meant to be read by children and thus being put in there to essentially shame girls out of behaving in a way he felt was un-Christian, something I feel to be in bad taste with my own values system. Yudkowsky hasn't denied his author tracts being anything but author tracts, and has also done his best to make sure people understand (by way of both hinting it in the text and by stating it outright out of it) that not all of Harry's advice is good, Quirrel's advice is persuasive but unhealthy to listen to without at least a good heaping of salt, and that if there's anyone you should listen to it's Hermione. And again, you do indeed seem to dislike the story at least in part because you think the author is showing off, especially considering you outright stated you feel he is bragging right there. I claim that showing intelligence is not showing off, and even if it were it wouldn't make it a bad thing (you feeling that bragging is a bad thing is not because it intrinsically is. It's because it's a knee-jerk reaction based either on evolutionary psychology or by how you were raised. I've done my best to train that reflex out of myself long before I heard of HPMOR or Yudkowsky and doing so has made me a far less jealous person and much less prone to dislike people I don't actually know), especially considering it has influenced many of its readers to question their own beliefs and to think more rationally. I.e. it has influenced peoples' lives positively, and in at least a couple of cases that I've read stopped people from committing suicide thanks to those very author tracts you hate.

10) I'd argue that the fact that a lot of people disagree with you makes this wrong, but then I realized that a lot of people liking Edward/Bella/Bieber doesn't make me consider them likable, so I'll just settle for stating that I disagree.

11) Then you might wanna consider saying how far you think people should read before deciding whether to drop it or not instead of saying that they shouldn't even try. Your words do in fact matter and you telling people that the fic is terrible and not worth checking out will drive people away from looking at it even if it is something they would have enjoyed. While this is advice I myself would have trouble following when it comes to some books I've read (it's hard for me to recommend a book that I feel is bad even knowing the other person might feel differently) it's still worth consideration, as this particular fic has a track-record of actually influencing people in a positive manner. Much of the critique is pure vitriol directed toward the author and the fandom, just calling the author an asshole, arrogant, stupid etc. and is in no way constructive and in general completely unjustified and uncalled for. It's a rather basic psychological fact that it's hard to convince people to listen to you while you're insulting them.

************ 1) That's your opinion which is completely valid, I just stated why I didn't like it.

2) Yeah like I said I know that, I stand by what I originally said. That explains him being that smart. That doesn't give him the time he needs to learn the things he does. Also look, the author is clearly intelligent and I don't want to be a dick about this but...he /claims/ to be a child prodigy. He didn't finish High School and has no formal education. There is nothing to say he's a child prodigy bar his own opinion of himself. I agree that there are amazing child prodigies out there, like you said that one kid who was great at maths...was he as equally talented at maths, chemistry, biology, geography, engineering, the arts, a musical phenomenon? Cause Harry (and to a lesser extent Hermione) basically are in that story. They are brilliant at so many different, and unrelated, things and that is what makes it unrealistic and just plain boring. Again it works for the essay style the author goes for because more than that would require actual movement in plot and more than a handful of characters. Which I dislike immensely.

4) No it isn't. A child being intelligent may garner some respect but not the kind portrayed in MoR. The fact remains he lacks experience and this is largely ignored by the author due to 'rationality' because he seems to dislike emotion and human behaviour. Just not my kind of thing.

5) For me it's not enough. I've read all but the last 5 or so chapters and very little of those things have occurred. If you're saying they happen in the last 5 or so chapters then that just goes back to poor pacing and character development and still the fact remains that he glides through most of the story unscathed.

6) Divergence from canon is /fine/, welcome even, but he genuinely thinks that is the 'rational' explanation for Dementors in canon which is ridiculous. JK did codify it in the books, Dementors abilities are very well laid out. As for the whole existential aspect, now that is an interesting discussion...unfortunately it's not possible with this fic because the canon interpretation is ignored and it's irrelevant to these pseudo-dementors.

7) Grand you relate away, I can't, I think the entire fic downplays the most interesting and important aspect of humanity and it makes for a very dull story.

8) He has several times said things like "donating would sure speed up the next chapter" and considering I dislike authors doing that with reviews, doing that with money is much worse. A paypal account linked to a fic would be shut down immediately and this is just a more roundabout way of doing that. Also you forgot about him trying to sell merch before JK's lawyers stopped him. Also JK is not open to the community, at best it is tolerated, look up past lawsuits there was a time when she was ready to try and remove it from the internet all together (futile as i'm sure you're aware but take down the top 10 fic sites and most of it will disappear and writing will stop). If popular fics start being monetised then i'm sure she would return to this mindset.

9) Yeah i'm British, maybe the humour is different, I doubt it though cause I do like most American humour. That being said, again, /my/ humour is /mine/. I don't care that you like it, I think it's just awful and due to being aware of the authors personality I think he genuinely believes his version is better and it bugs me. He can own up to using this as a way of promoting himself all he likes, it won't change /my/ opinion of it. I agree that showing intelligence isn't showing off, I disagree that he isn't showing off. Nor do I care that this fic has helped people, that doesn't change a single one of my opinions on it.

11) Look this is a fanfiction discussion board, of course I will give my opinion on it if it comes up. I could just as easily tell you that your words could cause someone to sink hours into reading something they will ultimately hate thus wasting time better spent elsewhere. This particular fic frankly has a far worse reputation than you seem to think, step outside the little [[/r/HPMoR]] bubble and you'll see it's pretty disliked amongst the fandom. It's probably on the same level of distaste as Harry Crow as far as most are concerned.

Thanks for finishing that off my dismissing everything I said just because I don't like the author as much as the story.
