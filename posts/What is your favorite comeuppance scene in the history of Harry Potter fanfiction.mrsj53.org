  "Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day...put it from your mind for now, Albus," Harry replied gleefully in a mockingly-grave tone. Scrimgeour and Bones did not understand the significance of the words, but Dumbledore looked like someone had slapped him with a fish, so they assumed---quite correctly---that Harry was throwing Dumbledore's typical cryptic pseudo-wisdom right back at him. "When you are older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready, you will know."

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** My favorite comeuppance stories in fanfiction are actually for Harry. Even though he's the protagonist and is a good-hearted, well-intentioned person, I LOVE me some Severitus where Snape is like “remember that time you flew a car to Hogwarts? Wrestled a troll? Stunned me in front of a werewolf? Ran around Hogwarts under your invisibility cloak?” Oh yeah, I LOVVVVVE me some Snape calling out Harry for his blatant disregard for the rules under the auspice of “I wanna keep you safe but you suck at self-preservation.”

Snape is the King of Comeuppance. And I'm here for it.

*** I feel like Snape calling out Harry for the troll is peak why people don't like Snape. He's so confident as he calls out Harry for things he doesn't know anything about and/or are completely unreasonable. The werewolf stunning bit is particularly egregious since Snape had made clear his intentions to murder Sirius in that instance, it was obviously the right thing to do.

***** "Snape did not want to murder Sirius- he made it clear he was going to give him over to the authorities." Correction- he made it clear he will hand Sirius over to Dementors that will kill Sirius.

I don't like Harry much, but him wrestling a troll was in no way his fault- he either did it (alongside Ron) or Hermione would have died.

I agree with you on the flying to Hogwarts bit. That was dumb.

I'm sorry people are downvoting you for having an opinion. That happens way to often around here.

***** Fwiw I didn't downvote you. We definitely have a bad downvote culture on this sub and I wouldn't blame you for leaving over it.

Harry asked Snape to bring Sirius to Dumbledore and Snape said he was bringing him straight to the dementors. All three of the people with wands in that scene used expelliarmus at that point to prevent that from happening, which would be murder.

When canon Snape is sniping at Harry, he's not typically justified or reasonable. His first scene is him asking questions he doesn't expect first years to know in order to humiliate him and he never really moves on from there.
