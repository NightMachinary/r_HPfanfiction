I'm looking for two HP fics I read a while back.

One had a scene where Harry and compny end up stealing the entire, or at least, a substantial part of the Malfoy fortune, which was hidden not at Gringotts, but rather a seperate house, then plant a brooch (or something like that) on Umbridge, disguising it as a gift to her, where either Lucius or Narcissa discover it later, dunno which on it was. (I used this scene as it is one of the more memorable ones.)

The second was a Fate series crossover where Zelretch had supllied an unknowing Harry with instructions to the Servant Summoning Ritual. After a near-fatal beating by Vernon, he uses it, and actually summons TWO servants, Saber (Arturia) and Caster (Tamamo no Mae).

Thx in advance to ayone who can lead me to them, or at least a give me some kind of lead.
