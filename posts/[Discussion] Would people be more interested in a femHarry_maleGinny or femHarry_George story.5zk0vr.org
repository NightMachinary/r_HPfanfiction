*** I've considered other lesbian characters, but I want it to transition comfortably to a somewhat parallel epilogue, and that includes kids.

****** Modern science has accomplished this in mice -- [[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6985/full/nature02402.html][Nature article]]. It's hardly unthinkable that magic could do as much for humans.

Polyjuice might offer possibilities. Depends on how you want to manage it. So could more general transfiguration. Or a more specialized potion.

Most kids up for adoption were biologically procreated, and getting a sperm donor would also count.

** Funny thing is, I think a male Ginny would be basically a younger george/fred so I'm not even sure there would be that big a difference

*** Well, there would certainly be different plot points and shortcomings. And Ginny's always seemed more of a spitfire to me than a comedian. The unconventional girl. A lot more tenacious than Fred and George.

**** Well yes, of course, for the purposes of the wrtiting there's many routes that it can take. For that purpose, I think I'd prefer a male ginny, simply because I'd be curious to see how the dynamic of the relationship changes when gender is the only difference

***** Then what about a male ginny who's the only boy with six older sisters? That'd shake things up a bit.

****** I don't see Harry going for someone like that. Ginny had a masculine attitude because of growing up with six older brothers. If put in the same position with six older /sisters/, male!Ginny would probably end up being much more effeminate.

*** They wouldn't be a twin, which removes some angst moments - it's also more cannon, and Ginny is different than the twins, not significantly - but there are character tweaks that would have to be made.

** I'd think both options pretty interesting, since the big part of your story is the genderbend, after all. Its really your decision if you make it femslash or not.
