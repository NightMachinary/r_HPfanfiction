** Luna is awesome. She's incredibly likeable with enough malleability of character to fit most roles she's assigned. Plus her mum died and she was bullied for being different but didn't turn into an absolute arse hole, so she gets a fair bit of leeway as to what she can do. There's also that she never really did anything that could be bashed. Ron could be an arse hole, Hermione could be controlling and a teachers pet, Dumbledore was somewhere between extremely manipulative and outright senile. Even Harry could be an arse at times, not to mention a wet blanket. Luna however, was calm, loyal and an all around nice person. She suffered in the last book and before that she was nothing but nice, never getting angry or anything of the like. She's just too nice to bash

*** She also believe patently false things and refuses to listen to reason about them. I love Luna, but that alone could be pretty easily bashed.

**** So she's a little crazy. The most you can do with that is make her an idiot or slightly insane. I don't really see how those are overly bashable, especially considering she has an actual justification for being unstable (her mother's death, unstable father and mistreatment throughout her Hogwarts stay). I suppose it could be bashed but it feels too much like victim blaming. Most writers don't feel comfortable doing that and instead just ignore her existence entirely if they don't like her.

***** I think she /does/ believe in them, but she also sees how they can provide a helpful excuse / alibi when necessary. That's why she said she saw a Blibbering Humdinger: so that Harry could get away from the crowd and enjoy some peace and quiet.

** The way I could see it being done is bashing her for being so dreamy or spacey. I mean it's not a nice thing to do, but bashing rarely is.

If I /were/ to write a Luna bashing fic, I would depict her as a 30 year old women who's still clinging to the child-like naivete and going on about made-up Quibbler stuff. It doesn't really answer your question because I don't have a fic to recommend, but there you go.

** The closest thing to it that anyone might have ever created is [[https://www.wattpad.com/287522019-the-death-of-all-harry-potter-characters-luna][this weird little fic on Wattpad]], although the author had to make her rather OOC in order to do it.

**** I think I've seen like one? But it was a while ago. I guess if you want to find a story where she's bashed, a Cho pairing or a Ginny pairing are your best bets, since bashing is most often done to love rivals. Having checked AO3 for stories with Harry/Cho and Luna as a listed character, I cannot find any.

** Luna and Neville ARE the least bashed because they are both the true underdogs of the story; because they do not have as much screentime as the heros for us to get annoyed by their flaws and because they are written as being quite naive in a Sense...

Bashing Luna is like torturing a puppy...

An author would have to laje her Very OOC to be able to bashing her...ir exagetate her traits to the pointer of absurdity.

Ideas to bash Luna in a fic:

1)have Luna being up the existence of Snorkacks during the MINISTRY fight and get people hurt because she thought she ser one ?

2)have Luna being up the Rotfang Conspiracy during Dobby funeral and imply that Hermione parents were att fault.

3)have Luna insist that wrackspurts could Exorciste the horcrux on the Diadem and nagg Harry to give Ger the Diadem because she os a Ravenclaw?

** I've never seen luna bashing and it's not something really necessary since she'll just float away if you don't pay attention to her.

Still, most of the time she gets turned into a dreamy parrot that goes wrackspurt this and nargles that in almost every sentence and that can make you dislike her very fast, does that count?

*** In a way I guess. I just thought it was funny that literally every other character can be bashed but most people either avoid it out of feeling, as someone else described it as like kicking a puppy or because “what's there to bash?”

** Luna's like the darling of the HP fandom, so... not much bashing for her. I do remember one fic that came close.... it came out shortly after OOTP and it essentially featured Luna as a total idiot who annoyed everyone and who kept doing harebrained things in the mistaken belief that she was helping. I think the author just mistook her weirdness for stupidity. But even that fic portrayed her as a WELL-MEANING idiot.
