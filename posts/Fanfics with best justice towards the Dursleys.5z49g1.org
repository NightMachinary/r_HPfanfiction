What fics have the best justice towards the Dursleys? I don't mind what level if horrible stuff they did to Harry (minor abuse to super major puke-your-face-out horrible abuse), I just want to see them face the consequences.


** Well, The Accidental Animagus has the Dursleys sent to jail pretty early on. They don't factor much in the story after that, but Petunia appears in the final chapter, where she's turned out a bit better. Pretty satisfying outcome, really.

...Is it strange that I want to see a fic with Vernon and Petunia being de-Grinched? In the sense of learning to accept magic instead of hating Harry and everything, via song and dance and whatnot?

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** How about a grinchy but well-written and evolving Vernon? A Vernon who slowly stops hating Harry as he gets older and has less accidental magic.

** A lot of fics with Bellatrix Lestrange on Harry's side have a good Dursley judging. Most of the time it follows the "you reap what you sow" mantra and have liberal amounts of curses thrown around.

And considering the crimes they are guilty of it can be pretty justified. They are human trash after all. They kept a child starving in a cupboard after all while having four bedrooms available. That can be counted as many cases of attempted murder.
