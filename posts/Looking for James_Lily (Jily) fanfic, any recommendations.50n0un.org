I really enjoy The Life and Times, but the updates are few and far between. Anyone know any good James and Lily fanfiction? Preferably while they're still in their Hogwarts years.

Thanks!


** This one is my all-time time favorite. It starts out a little shaky, but really comes into its own around Ch. 5.

** I absolutely love Jily! I'm so happy to have found a few more stories as a result of this post. Now, here are some more for you (I've only called out some of my more-loved ones, in no particular order):

- "Buried Treasure and Transmogrify" is one of my all-time favorites! (It also has a sequel, "Heroes for Ghosts", but that hasn't been updated in a while; I'll list it here anyway).
- "All Right, Evans?" is another one of my super-favorites! (And, sadly, it also has a sequel which hasn't been updated in a while called "Dangerous Crowds").
- "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" is just...incredible. The level of raw emotion in this story, the character development, the twists and turns, the... literally everything. It's just amazing. However, I feel like it's worth mentioning (Trigger): [[/spoiler][Lily is raped in the first chapter. Now, I consider myself to be fairly sensitive to such things, but I honestly still love this story to pieces, and if you stick with it I really think you will too. I do think that, if you prefer to, you won't miss out by skipping the scene itself (stop reading the first chapter when Lily goes down to the dungeons); the author does a very good job of explaining the important plot points of it in a tasteful (and less triggery) way as the story progresses. Seriously, do give it a chance, I promise my defense of it is well-justified.]]
- "Fait Accompli" is just great, if perhaps a little vanilla.
- "I Loved You More" is very well-done indeed.
- "A Little Deeper In Love" and its sequel "Power The Dark Lord Knows Not" form a very well-developed story, highly recommend
- "Runaway Love" is probably the most blatantly AU thing I've ever seen in my life (It's barely within the HP universe at all really)! However, if you give it a chance, you will undeniably be sucked in, because it is exceedingly well-written, well-developed, full of emotion, action, love, lust, you name it. Really, I was a big skeptic too, but give it a try. (I should also note that this story can definitely get pretty dark at times, but I believe that it balances that very will with the times it gets super-fluffy.)

linkffn(9465821; 10845084; 8528896; 8721412; 8838454; 6707400; 6193007; 2311420; 5750106; 8822740; 11369422; 11660206; 8367728; 5948111; 3327786; 4617323; 4388568)

There are a couple from MuggleNet which are worth a mention, both by MagEd. One is "I'll Pick You Up" ([[http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=83718]]) and the other is "Someone to Watch Over Me" ([[http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=57899]]).

Enjoy! I know I do :)

  With great power comes great responsibility. James Potter had just been granted the greatest excuse to get to know Lily Evans but he could do without the responsibility that comes with it. No one believes he is capable of the title, but Lily is willing to give him a chance and that was all he needed. But is his freedom the sacrifice in exchange for Lily's affections? SEQUEL!

  This is another story of the marauders and the love lives of the group. This is in no way related to The Legacy Series. It is entirely different. Come with our four favorite Howarts trouble makers into traps, tricks, pranks, classes, quidditch and the scary world of the female mind. Broom closets beware none of you are safe. Rated because I get carried away sometimes...

** Ah, now this is something I can help with! I'd be ashamed with how many I've read if I wasn't so proud. :) I only recently started favorite-ing the stories, and I've forgotten the names to many, so I'm sorry this is all I've got. :( Still, you'll find plenty to read here.

  Lily genuinely liked James Potter. He was handsome enough to make any girl swoon, but he was also funny, clever, and secretly kind. Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised.

  You mean to say that Potter's family is coincidentally staying across the street from our beach house for the summer, Mum and Mrs. Potter are now randomly best friends, and they expect me to hang out with that git for two months? You've got to be joking. (Even worse? There's a sequel.)

** I actually only really read Marauder and/or Jilly stories. The Life and Times was one of my favourites too. Since the cursed child came out, I started roaming for some new ones, and came across this one that's recently started. Seems pretty decent so far and the author said in her first chapter that she's nearly finished with it, so hopefully it won't get abandoned!
