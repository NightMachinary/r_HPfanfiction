** This is definitely one of my favorites. Insanely well written. Romance is definitely a side plot.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.

** I've been reading the linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) series. There are some issues with it, but I've been enjoying it overall.

A lot of stories get cross-posted so I'm not sure which of these are ao3 specific, but here are some others I like:

Linkao3(The Changeling) Linkao3(Perfectly Normal) Linkao3(World in Pieces) Linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts) Linkao3(C'est La Vie) Linkao3(The Prince of Slytherin) Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) Linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven)

Some of these are recc'ed regularly so you're probably familiar, I just went through my bookmarks and grabbed any that seemed relevant. One way to find others you like would be to click on the tag from a previous fic and sort by kudos or comments. Ex. [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Pureblood%20Politics%20(Harry%20Potter][Pureblood Politics]]/works) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marauders%20Era%20(Harry%20Potter][Marauder's Era]]/works) - you will likely have to adjust the filters to eliminate slash though, since it's quite popular.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** The HP fandom on AO3 is kind of slash central, so specifying that you don't want slash removes a huge chunk of fics from the pool. Drarry is the most popular pairing amongst AO3 HP fics by a large margin, for example. Of course your preferences are your own prerogative, and there's thousands of het and gen fics for you on the site, but I just thought you ought to know.

The fics I am linking explores the character of Harry as a child, and does quite a good job of it. Please note that Dumbledore is canonically gay, and there is some age appropriate discussion of that in this fic. I don't think that would cross the line into anyone's definition of slash, but here we are. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]])

Ooh! I thought my story was just shit but turns out I've been publishing in the wrong place? Where would you say is a good platform for a story that really doesn't have a lot of sex in it (or any, to be honest), but is meant for grown-ups? I also published on FFN and it's not doing super well either, so I'm starting to think it might just be bad but then I read it and I really really don't think so.

**** AO3 is the right place for all fanworks. What its not so good at is discovery, unless you're writing a popular pairing or story tag. Their version of FFN C2s, called "Collections" leaves a lot to be desired.

I'd suggest promoting your story in places that contain potential readers. Here, DLP and maybe alternatehistory or spacebattles. Would you mind linking me your story?

****** Thanks for linking your story. I will admit I've seen it a few times in my searches. I personally am not a fan of Snape, and rarely read stories from his POV. I read the first chapter, and I suppose it's not quite what I expected Snape's thoughts to be. It also seems to... jump around quite fast. He's meeting Dumbledore, then he's telling Voldemort not to go to the Potters, then he's grieving Lily's death, then he's threatening Petunia, then he's reliving his childhood and his mother's death, then he's with Voldie receiving the Dark Mark... Emotionally I can trace the thread, but chronologically and geographically it's a muddle of moments and feelings.

It's also such a short chapter for how much you've tried to do with it (which is explain to the reader part of Snape's emotional journey up to the point of Harry's orphaning). Many fanfic authors can be accused of using far too many words but in your case IMHO the fic is too dense, and could benefit from more words, or maybe less exposition.

Also, most of the best fics use a hook of some sort to get a reader's attention. A novel addition to fanon, a foreshadowing of some dramatic event, etc. Your first chapter being a rehash of Snape's journey as most Harry Potter readers know it, with a few additions thrown in, is not really much of a hook.

Another thing is the blurb. I distinctly remember reading this blurb and moving on during one of my fic searches. I'm not sure what to say except that some real gems I've found by my eye being caught by an excellent blurb. One of my all time favourite fics, The Dogfather by Hollymichele, has a simple blurb of dialogue taken from the middle of the fic that pulled me in immediately. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/]])

I hope I haven't been too harsh or unfair on your fic. I can see that at ~35k words this is something you've put some effort in. On the whole I'd say it's a decent enough fanfic, but as it doesn't claim to develop towards a popular pairing, it doesn't have a fascinating hook of some sort in the first chapter, and it doesn't have a very compelling "blurb", I'm not surprised that it hasn't attracted more readers. Promoting your work would help greatly, to help prospective readers find it. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to reading what you think up next.

Edit: Trust me when I say I know that critique is much easier than creation. You've written a fic that's at least 30k words longer than any of the abandoned stubs I've tried to write.

** I will definitely check out your recommendation and I really appreciate your comment! I asked for feedback, so... I can handle it not being you fawning all over my work. I thank you for making such an effort to explain.

I agree with you that chapter 1 is too dense. This being my first fic and first piece of creative writing in a long time, I also agree with you about the blurb.

It's really challenging to write something that makes sense as a standalone story but also does not bore the people who know story already. I don't know if I can start at Snape's meeting with Figg in a way that makes sense.

Thank you again!! I think I will finish the story and than rewrite and restructure it.

** **EDITED to link properly Saved the post to check out the recs myself. Please check out mine! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18874543/chapters/44800099]] Snape centered, canon compliant but with a lot of extra stuff, gets dark. 3 chapters away from completion I think. Feedback welcome.

Also recommend the series "memories and dreams" by paganaidd in its enitrety - best fic ever imo. Enjoy! I'm linking to the first story in the series.

  The Prince's very extended tale, from his point of view, as he struggles to protect Harry Potter and anyone else he can, with help from an unexpected source.A story about relationships and love, romantic and non-romantic alike, and about the inner life and the concealment and revelation thereof. Some detours into the lives and inner lives of other characters as well.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

*** Recommending it more because of the world building and the subplot, it's one of the best I've read for a long time, some of the stuff is actually really well thought out. If you do read it, tell me what you think of it.

  On his seventeenth birthday, Albus runs away. Years of arguing with his dad and struggling at school have worn him down, and he just wants to be free. With Delphi's mantra 'the future is mine to make' echoing in his head, he sets out to change his life, leaving everything and everyone behind.Years later, an accidental meeting with Scorpius forces him to question the new life he's built for himself. Is his life complete without his family? Was he wrong to leave Scorpius behind? Is he really any happier now than he would have been if he'd stayed? And does he truly know Delphi, the person who convinced him to walk away?
