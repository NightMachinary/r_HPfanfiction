I've never seen a fic like this but maybe I'm just dumb and haven't looked in the right place. I think it's still a pretty decent prompt though.

Possibly 8th year as I think it would fit best there and everything's put of the way.

Draco has a crush on Harry but doesn't know how to express his feelings towards him. Harry is also not his biggest fan. Whenever Harry (pretty publicly) complains about something he dislikes about Draco, Draco goes out of his way to change that aspect of himself.

Maybe some things like... (Obviously the writer can come up with their own ideas but these were just some examples I thought of off the top of my head.)

Harry tells him he's crap at Quidditch and wants to play against someone who's actually good so Malfoy quits the team.

Harry tells people that he hates how Malfoy and his friends gang up on people so Draco distances himself from his friends.

Maybe Harry's just critical of Draco because he's trying to figure out why he likes someone so horrible (in his opinion). Who knows?
