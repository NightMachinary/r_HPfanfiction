Are there any decent stories out there that take absolutely ridiculous ideas and then attempt to make a serious story out of it? I find that I tend to enjoy crack fics, but more often than not they devolve into completely OOC characters, plot holes, and bad logic (usually caused by the author and his/her characters attempting to skirt or flat out ignore the aforementioned plot holes or how unbalanced the ridiculous idea makes everything). It's almost like I can swallow one big, ridiculous impossibility, so long as everything else follows an internally consistent logic.

I thought that linkffn(11790749) was (sort of) going in this direction, but when [[/spoiler][Guinevere ends up going to live with Harry and the Dursleys]], I found that to be a bit much. Anyone have any other suggestions?

** This is probably the best and most popular parody out there, so I apologize if it's an obvious choice, but I have to recommend linkffn(4536005). Hilarious with great plot and characterization as well.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** 100% linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). If you just looked at an overview of the plot, you would say it's a hardcore crack/humor fic. When you actually sit down and read it though, it's incredibly emotionally complex with a lot of depth and some really very dark elements.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.

** Are you okay with a marriage law fic with some questionable smut in it? If yes, linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) is a HGSS story that is a little messed up at times, but I have always thought of the undelying storyline for this story to be very absurd and something that belonged to a crackish smut fic rather than a serious story. I was surprised by the quality of the story and and how the author eventually manages to explain completely ridiculous premises in a way that more or less makes sense.

It's a marriage law that forces people together is passed and Hermione has to marry Snape and have lots of children with him as per Ministry law. They are both surprisingly more or less in character and the story is good. Warning though is that there are some explicit smut scenes, dubious consent and occasionally violence so read at your own risk. Does have some humour though.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.
