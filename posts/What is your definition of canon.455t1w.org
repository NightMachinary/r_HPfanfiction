It's just been [[https://www.pottermore.com/news/ww-publishing-cursed-child-script-book-announcement][announced]] that the script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II will be published. I know [[/r/harrypotter]] is very excited over this and the play itself, but I was wondering what [[/r/HPfanfiction]] 's take on it is.

What defines HP canon for you? Are you interested or excited for the play and script? What about the upcoming Fantastic Beasts movie?


** For me, Loose Canon is what the author says, including retcons.

** To be honest, I'm only really interested in the main core of books (1-7). I saw the movies with friends because it's just what you do, but I haven't seen them since. I'll probably watch the Fantastic Beasts movie but not necessarily in theater. I did get the illustrated version of PS/SS because I like the style it's done in. I haven't read the other "textbooks."

It's strange because I consider the textbooks, Pottermore, and HP and the Cursed Child to be canon, but I'm not interested in them. I think it's because it's not just JKR, it's a bunch of other people working on it as well. I guess it makes it seem supplementary to me. I'm a little bit afraid of what the Cursed Child will be.

*** I think of the books as CANON canon, and the textbooks and Pottermore to be EXTENDED canon - I'll still reference them if I'm fact-checking for canon, and nothing contradicts the books, so it's technically still canon for me. The movies I treat like headcanons/fanfiction, since they contradict book canon very often. Honestly, I find some fanfics (like stuff by Northumbrian or HalfaSlug) to be more canon than the movies, JK's 'approval' of scripts be damned. For Cursed Child, I'll have to wait and see - if it contradicts characterisations or themes or plot from the books, then I'll lump it with the movies, but if it fits, I'd call it extended canon.

** I think what would generally be accepted as 'core canon' is the main series, 1-7. It is interesting how you draw that line, though. Is it by medium, grouping? I.e. can I only consider books 1-5 canon and draw interpretations from that? I guess it'd then be up to what you choose.

I think I'd personally think of the main series and (probably) cursed child as core canon, then pottermore and the textbooks as loose canon. I acknowledge word of god, but don't consider it canon.

** I consider all original stories to be canon. This means the books but not the movies because the books came first. I'll include Fantastic Beasts, but any novelized version that comes out won't be canon to me. The movie is the original. It's the same with the Cursed Child. The scripted story is canon. Anything that comes out based on that is not. Interviews are all supplementary material. So is the encyclopedic Pottermore entries.

Then, there's headcanon. That includes the canon stuff, whatever I pick and choose from the supplementary materials, and my own ideas that don't interfere with canon.

I'm looking forward to the new stuff. I'd rather brave the new stuff than have nothing new from HP. I watched the Stargate fandom dry up, and it is no fun.

** For me, books 1-7, the textbooks & /Tales of Beedle the Bard/ are canon (it was plot-relevant in book 7, and the textbooks were good as well as supporting a good cause). The movies are their own canon, perfectly acceptable to use as long as the author notes that that's what they're writing from, rather than the books.

Pottermore, /Cursed Child/, and /Fantastic Beasts/ the movie are loose canon, because they came later. Well, Pottermore was during, but it's sort of like the Star Wars expanded universe, to me - you can't expect everyone to have read all of it, so information overload like that I discount from being considered 'non-negotiable canon,' so to speak. I haven't ever been on Pottermore, so I would never know if I was contradicting it, unless someone pointed it out, just for example.

Anything Rowling says, in interviews or whatever, is technical Word of God, but not canon and therefore not necessarily AU if you contradict it in fics.

I would be more excited for the new material if I hadn't already been burned in the Star Wars and Star Trek fandoms. I know some people liked the prequels, and a /lot/ of people liked the reboots, but I had my hopes so high and was so terribly disappointed.... I'm trying not to let that happen again by maintaining a degree of skepticism and anxiety.

** The books are the canon I care about most. I find reading a fic where Snape is a pureblood to be really bizarre. Any place where the movies and the books are contradictory (this happens with characterizations a lot), the books take precedence. The textbooks and the extra writing on Pottermore are nice touches when added to a fic, but non-essential. Using Fleamont Potter is a nice touch, but I'll happily read a fic that uses Charlus as Harry's grandfather instead. I don't consider JK Rowling's offhand remarks and tweets as canon: sometimes they clarify matters, but they often don't really fit with what we already know.

** I have a hierarchy.

1. The original 7 books, as well as the charity books (Beasts, Quidditch, Beedle). Most recent edition takes priority b/c there have been minor 'oops' through the years.
2. Words from Rowling - interviews, Pottermore /writings/, tentative Fantastic Beasts (since screenplay is her), archives of her old site. Most recent interviews take priority if there are discrepancies. Twitter counts as 'interview' as long as it's explicitly something she stated and can be sourced, not just her retweeting something she likes.
3. Approved by Rowling - screenplays she collaborated on, drawings/lists/sketches from her old site.
4. Movie adaptations - for something that's outright not in the books (not something changed, something added), it's considered possible. Never trumps books.
5. Everything else, like merchandise, video games, video game files.

Basically if it comes from Rowling herself, it's canon. Books trump everything. If something lower in the list contradicts the books, then it isn't canon. If it happened a certain way in the books, that's how it happened. For the most part I don't consider the movies to be canon, however if there's something in the movies that adds to the world and is not contradicted by the books or other writings, then sure.

1&2 rank very very close for me, but I do have to make a distinction between the books and everything else. For sake of theory discussion and question answering and stuff, they're the same for me except in the case of contradictions.

I'm always excited for more potter stuff. Especially if Rowling's hand is still in it. If we get to the point Star Wars got where there's fifty authors writing competing and disagreeing EU works, I'll be less excited. But, this story isn't over yet. The movie will expand our world from that small chunk of Europe to potentially the rest of the magical world, and that's /exciting/. I'm less excited for Cursed Child because I don't care all that much about next gen +because I'm an awful person+ but I'm still horribly interested.

For example, I have no interest in Harry's grandfather being named Fleamont. Adding that information in Pottermore did nothing to make Harry's family more interesting. On the other hand, having Harry being the grandson of Dorea Black (as fanon assumed for a long time) connects Harry to so many other people in interesting ways.

*** To clarify, however, with Disney's buyout, they changed how the Star Wars EUU worked. Before, there was a complete /mess/ of differing layers of "canon", some of which were superior to others. It contradicted itself regularly, even in the better books and games. When Disney bought Star Wars, they moved all Star Wars works, barring the six movies and the 3D Clone Wars cartoon (all of which are Canon), into the "Legends" continuity. It's still a writer's resource, but they essentially wiped the slate to clear the crap out of the universe. After the buyout, everything that is created under the Star Wars label will have the same level of Canon: that is, "it's true. All of it." Films, books, games, all are now equal.

** For me canon is what a character in a story/universe could possible know and which could affect the story. I would argue that this makes, for example, new schools that JKR announced as non-canon.

Why? because in the universe of Harry Potter they were never mentioned and they never affected the story anyway. Canon is like a neat self-contained package that should not need further word-of-god explanation. When authors go ahead and "reveal" stuff after decades, it feels like someone explaining a joke after everyone has heard it and laughed.

*** This seems like a distinction between canon of the Harry Potter /stories/ and Harry Potter /universe/. I wonder if we'll several different canons based on the book/movie.

I mean, the seven books exist as the story of Harry Potter. What he sees and knows are what we see and know for the most part. That forms this self-contained story. What matters elsewhere is irrelevant to /this/ story.

The Harry Potter /universe/ is different. It's not centered on one person, country, or generation. JKR is building and writing down the rules for an entire world. This is all relevant to the functioning of the world.

So - for some - the book series might have it's own canon, the new movie will have it's own canon, but the wizarding universe would include all of them.

Do you consider The Cursed Child canon with the Harry Potter books because they're following the character of Harry Potter and affecting his story? Or is that a separate entity too?

** Primary canon: 7 books, minus the inconsistencies in the badly written last two ones.\\
Secondary canon: 8 films and the auxilliary material published during this time (Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts booklet, Tales of Beedle).\\
Tertiary canon: Pottermore, the Cursed Child play, Fantastic Beasts movie, JKR's old website, her interviews, etc.\\
Fanon: Everything else

Primary > Secondary > Tertiary and Fanon.

Main reason for this is that the books on their own (minus the confusing mess that is Wandlore etc.) make sense, and the movies agree with them for the most part. Minor differences such as the colour of Hermione's Yule Ball dress, Colin and Dennis Creevy being replaced with OCs etc. are easily ignored -- or adopted where they make more sense than the books. One example is the appearance of Narcissa Malfoy, in the books she is a natural blonde, but I prefer her film appearance where she has the Black hair with a blonde streak.

Pottermore, JKR's interviews, and the +money grabs+ new material are generally badly thought out and do not make a whole lot of sense (Hermione suddenly being black???), much like parts of the sixth and seventh book did, so I give them the same credence as I do fanon material.

TLDR: To me only books 1-5 are canon, everything else has variable degrees of canonicity.

** Canon is the seven books plus the three additional books (Quidditch through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard). No more.

The movies are sort of deuterocanonical, in a way.

Anything that JKR says in interviews or anything on Pottermore or anything that's in this new bullshit she's coming out with, I don't consider canon whatsoever.

--------------

And I guess, in a way, I consider the /Alexandra Quick/ series to be in there too, as JKR never really expanded the universe past Europe (at least until now). Inverarity's a better writer than JKR, anyway.

*** Yeah, JKR is going the way of the Lucas. Her original idea was fantastic. Everything after, just... leave it alone.

** The books, and any statements or writings made by J.K. Rowling and intended to be canon.

For all that I might wish otherwise, I can't--believe me, I've tried more than once to internally revise some point or other of the book, but it doesn't stick. It wouldn't matter if J.K. Rowling said Harry Potter was a bright-purple gryphon instead of a boy, I'd still consider it canon.

** I have three levels of canon at minimum.

Pure canon, which i take as canon, with any self-contradictions chosen in favor of the side that makes more sense. WOG is included in here, but i don't particularly care about this, since i just can't keep up with everything, and pottermore doesn't interest me.

Partial canon, Which takes the books and nothing else.

And stablized canon, which takes the books, and then patches up the bits of wizards are complete idiots or other nonsense with fanon that doesn't defy canon, but can increase it's stability.
