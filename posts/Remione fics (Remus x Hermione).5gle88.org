I searched online for Remione but it just showed me Fremione fics instead.


** I really like Misplaced Moony by Shayalonnie linkao3(19188754) but I believe it's a WIP. There's more of it posted up on the author's ffn page but they're migrating everything over to ao3 so. Another fic by Shayalonnie also includes Remione though it's Sirimione endgame: linkffn(The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie).

Shaya is also incredible and keeps a well maintained fic-rec list, [[http://shayalonnie.weebly.com/remione.html][this is the link]] to her list of Remione fics! Enjoy! :)

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  MARAUDER MEDALS 2016 NOMINEE! She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. An accident throws Hermione back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now, with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over?
