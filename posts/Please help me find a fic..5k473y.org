It was TMR/HP. Tom got stuck in a mirror because he had tried to make the mirror his horcrux.

It starts with Harry talking to Neville at the beginning of the fic.

Harry found the mirror in his basement or attic in (I think) Grimmauld Place. He and Tom end up talking a lot and Harry takes Tom with him to Hogwarts.

Eventually Tom somehow manages to siphon life force or power or something like that from one of Harrys dorm-mates. Then Harry and Tom have a huge argument as Tom is starting to "become real" and come out of the portrait.

Thanks in advance!

P.S. A joyful Yuletide to all!


** linkffn(9169846) I'm not sure, because Tom is trapped in a portrait in this one, not a mirror, but everything else is what you've described.

  AU. In a world where Voldemort never existed, Harry Potter is just your average seventh year Gryffindor, who has a loving family and a happy life. One day, he finds a portrait of a boy who lived decades ago, and everything changes. Is it possible to love a portrait? Is it a portrait at all? HP&TMR slash. [COMPLETE]

*** Thank you so much! That's the one. I got it all mixed up with the portrait and mirror.
