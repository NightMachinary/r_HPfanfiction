What are your favourite rare pairings? Mine is Ron/Susan & Ron/Tracey


** Right now it's Regulus Black/Charlie Weasley. Didn't see that coming, but in this one story, they're really a perfect match, which is both great and terrible considering how /rare/ pairing it is.

**** Sure, it's /birds of a feather/ series.

It starts during Harry's third year, but Charlie shows up in the second part.

**** Agree. I had it in my bookmark for ages, but I started reading it only recently, and now, I'm so hooked.

** Harry and Gabrielle (both are adults) and Sirius / Lily.

I also like Harry/Regulus but I don't think it's a rare pairing. There are a lot of them but it's hard to find a good long one.

** Hrm. Interesting question. For romances, I guess:

Harry and Narcissa.

Harry and Andromeda.

Harry and one of the Gryffindor Chasers (almost all I can find are a few one shots).

Harry/Delphini (Presuming she was born older. I hate the Cursed Child, but like the idea of a daughter of Riddle being around. I do think it makes more sense if she was born before his first death though.)

Harry/Cho (Y'know, I can count on one hand the number of Cho stories which are not brief one shots or tragedies, and even including those there remarkably aren't so many.)
