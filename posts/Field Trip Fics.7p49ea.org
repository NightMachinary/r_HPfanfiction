Fics where classes go on a field trip, whether to places in the Muggle World or other magical schools etc.


** The only thing I could think of was this: What if Mrs. Frizzle was Arthur Weasley's sister? Enchanted car/magic school bus, overall enthusiasm, and bright, red hair.

Having to hide his secret along with protecting his new-found muggle friends from the return of You-Know-Who was proving to one of the most difficult tasks the Boy Who Lived would face. Will he be able to maintain his secret? Or is this the end of it all?
