You see I just read this tomb raider cross where hermione comes up with the wonderful idea that either only half bloods are mudbloods or everyone is a mudblood based on the rationale that a muggleborn may as well be a pure blood muggle where a half blood would be born from magic and mundane making them less pure. The other idea would be that the whole idea is based on the bible which describes man as being made from mud and woman from his ribs.

I find this most intriguing and would like to know your thoughts on either one.


** I could have sworn the idea of mudbloodedness came from equating muggle blood with mud, not from the miscegenating between wizards and muggles.

In this sense of the word, muggleborns would have the muddiest blood amongst magicals, and muggle pureblood would mean pure mud in your veins.

I could be wrong, but I don't think your version is canon, and quite frankly I wouldn't want it to be. Having the "bad guys" support blatantly retarded ideas that the "good guys" easily prove idiotic is extremely lazy writing imo.

So pureblood supremacy is bad writing? The Third Reich was bad writing?

Depends on how it's written. It's very easy to make up plausible reasons for the pureblood movement, and if you go and use "the muggleborns stole their magic from squibs" or similarly easily disproven concepts while having an MC dismantling the whole enemy ideology in spite of being a little kid, I'm sure going to call that bad writing.

I wasn't aware Hitler was fiction, and I damn well hope you don't believe that nazism can be summed up as "let's take over a country so we can kill the jews".

**** To play the devil's advocate here. Until the concentration camps started, the Third Reich's policies weren't "blatantly retarded" in the context of that period in history. Apartheid in South Africa, Jim Crow in the US, and the general dislike of the Jewish population by the world meant that Hitler was seen as radical, but not outrageous.

What I believe the first commenter was trying to say is this. Nuanced conflicts, make for better stories. One example is a Song of Ice and Fire. That nuance is there even in HP.

***** The problem is the blood supremacy belief wasn't a nuanced issue, one side was simply wrong and went to ridiculous lengths to ignore it ("oh we'll just remove you from the family tree, we're still pure!"). When the commenter called it blatantly retarded they mean just that: one side has a moronic view.

****** The conflict wasn't nuanced, but (outside of Voldemort and Bellatrix) the characters were. Otherwise so many people would have so many interpretations of Ron, Dumbeldore, Hermione, Malfoy, etc.

I think Rowling made the conflict more black and white, not only for the audience (teen/ya), but to make a statement about how stupid she found the ideology to be

******* The ideology was stupid. It's based on a ridiculous view about biology and, as I said before, the families in question just burned off an ignored the "impure" members of the family. I meam, it was based off of Nazi hysteria about "Jewish blood" so it's just art imitating reality.

***** The idea to blame an innocent group in the first place is blatantly stupid. And the Harry Potter conflict was just as simple, a fascist, racially motivated terrorist group taking over, led by a man only paying lip service to his own ideology.

That is a straight Third Reich ripoff, with the Death Eaters filling first the SA and then the SS/SD role.

As for the Third Reich, starting the War against the Soviet Union was stupid. The plans for Operation Sealion were utterly retarded. Hell, the Halt in front of Dunkirk basically lost us the war in 1940.

****** It feels stupid, but blaming an innocent group is a theme throughout history, and even today. It's a political strategy to gain a hardline constituency. Britain and eastern european immigrants, Trump and Mexicans, and of course Hitler and Jews. Humans are irrational, and finding an outlet for blame works well.

******** If done tastefully and correctly, yes. But most of the time, fanfiction authors dial the absurdity up to a million, just for wish fullfillment, with 2d characters. So it usually turns out to be lazy writing.

** The Bible would be irrelevant to most purebloods due to the century long persecution by religious authorities. Religion in the Harry Potter world would be a lot closer related to various pagan practices, not the organized ones hunting them. Using the Bible as sources would make purebloods laugh at you, dismissing any argument you may make by default.

As for "turning the insult around", that's not effective at all. Insults work because you allow them to affect you. You are one choosing to be offended instead of rolling your eyes and walking away (ignoring physical violence/bullying is a different can of worms). But if you insist on "returning fire", it would be a lot more effective to strike back where it hurts.

For example, let's say Malfoy shouts "You are a filthy, ignorant Mudblood Granger". She could argue

#+begin_quote
  Technically, everyone is a Mudblood because there are pureblooded Muggles and from their point of view, you are the Mudblood.
#+end_quote

Or she could go for the counter attack

#+begin_quote
  And yet it was your mother lusting after my muggleborn cunt last summer because she was desperate for a good shagging. A shagging I gave her with a fat Muggle strap-on. She is quite the pureblood whore, and your daddy's pathetic little cock is simply not doing it for her. And given how annoyed Parkinson looks all the time, you are unable to get her off either.

Ask yourself, which one would get the better reaction from the surrounding crowd?

** Nah. A better one would just be to do as Dumbledore did: point out there's no such thing as a pure-blood. All they do is disown the squibs and blood-traitors from their families. They're as "impure" as anyone.

Or, if they're even bothered by it, point out how sad it is that they'd rather screw their own mother than have a nice time with a Muggle woman. Sirius's parents were second-cousins and the Gaunts can barely remember who fathered and birthed who.
