:END:
This story is most likely several years old now. I think I read it on fanfiction.net. Basically, from what I remember, it was post-war and Harry was a teacher of a new special course at Hogwarts where he taught students advanced magic. The whole premise behind this class was that Harry was deemed to be so powerful (or had some sort of special ability) that he feared that if he ever went out of control, he could destroy the wizarding world. So he designed this class to teach students so that, if he ever did go out of control, they could stop him. Does anyone remember a story along these lines? Might be a bit of a long-shot.


** Sounds like it would be a crossover with /Assassination Classroom/?

*** Nope, it definitely was not a cross over.

***** Never heard of the show before so I just looked it up online. Plot from the fanfic seems quite different as, from what I remember, no one ever actually tried to kill Harry until towards the end. It was more a story about him training his students to be able to kill him if he was ever driven insane.

Also, I read this fanfic at least 6 years ago so it might have been released prior to the Assassination Classroom manga being published (or around the same time of publication. I imagine it was written without any knowledge of the manga/anime.

*** Sorry, had no luck finding it. I hunted through all of my old favourites and bookmarks but I couldn't find anything. It's quite possible that the story was deleted as it was written so long ago.
