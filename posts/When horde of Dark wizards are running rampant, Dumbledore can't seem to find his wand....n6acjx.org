Dumbledore: Gellert?

Grindelwald: What?

Dumbledore: Where's my Elder Wand?

Grindelwald: What?

Dumbledore: WHERE. IS. MY. ELDER WAND

Grindelwald: I - uh - put it away!

*a Blasting Curse hits a nearby house*

Dumbledore: Where?!

Grindelwald: Why do you need to know?!

Dumbledore: I need it!

Grindelwald: Uh-uh! Don't you think about running off doing no derring-do! We've been planning this dinner for two months!

Dumbledore: The public is in danger!

Gellert: My evening's in danger!

Dumbledore: YOU TELL ME WHERE MY WAND IS, DAMMIT! WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD

Grindelwald: 'Greater good?' I am your husband! I'm the greatest 'good' you are ever gonna get!


** An AU where Grindelwald is /also/ freaked out by Ariana's death and they live together doing what Dumbledore did in canon would be pretty great

*** I think it's meant to be a play on the Frozone scene in Incredibles but that's exactly where my mind jumped too... we all know what the Elder Wand is shaped like.

*** Wasn't that from Incredibles 1? With Frozone and his wife and the super suit? Or did I mix up the 2 movies..?
