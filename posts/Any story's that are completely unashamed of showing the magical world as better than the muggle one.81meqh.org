It seems like it hurts some peoples pride that the fictional Magical world might be better than the muggle one.

So are there any storie that don't shy away from showing the magical world as better than the muggle world?( apart from the Internet and mabye weapons(I don't really care about weapons but some people on this sub do)the wizarding world is equal or better than the muggle world)


** I don't think I have come across many fics that specifically focus on exploring how the wizarding world is as good as or better than the muggle world. What I've seen most is fics just mentioning little things, like abuse not really being a problem since magic equalizes things, or the comfort and ease of magic shops and stuff.

The story below is 'These Cuts I Have' by Melindaleo and it's sequel is now being written. It's one of those stories that starts right after the battle. Harry leaves his muggle past with the Dursleys behind. And as he now has to live on his own in the wizarding world and has always done stuff like cooking the muggle way, he learns some spells from Molly do to things the wizard way. Just little things like that. I don't think that's exactly what you're looking for, but it's what comes closest in what I've read.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** Hm. I can see how in certain issues, like gender equality, sexuality, acceptance of different races, and overall not giving AF about petty stuff, the magical world is totally superior. But then other stuff like ball point pens, mass produced clothes, cheap paper, mass produced books (because in the stories, the books are freaking expensive; an issue that would be quite neatly solved by offset printers), and vastly superior forms of entertainment (you don't hear of wizarding world having TV, Internet, movies ...) also electricity, I'd say the muggles are doing just fine.

There's this one crack~ish fic called Harry the Hufflepuff that sort of explores these things from a humourous angle, rather than super serious, and it's a fun read. I'm sure you've seen it, but wanted to throw it out there just in case:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

Harry's thoroughly impressed by the magical world's ability to be endlessly lazy, but also invents little ways to bring his muggle stuff with him to enhance the laziness further. It also plays with that trope of how the hardest workers are the lazy, because they'll find as many ways as possible to avoid doing work.

*** What you've said is pretty subjective. Why mass produce clothes when you can repair the ones you have forever? Why use a ball point pen when you have selfinking quills or ones that can write for you. Why have cheap paper when you can summon or duplicate it? Books are one of the few things you can't physically magic yourself, stories and knowledge are one of the true real luxuries. As to entertainment, why watch a film when you can literally fly, apparate or travel around the world or invest in potions that have such variety that they can literally make you lucky? I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong, just that there are different perspectives and so many open doors to explore. Not sure why you've got a downvote though

**** Meh, it's no big one way or another, but I'm very happy that you shared your perspective, because it's getting me to think of the world in a different way that I hadn't previously considered, so I think that's pretty awesome! Seriously, thanks for the insight into where you were going, because I wanted to get that kind of discussion rolling, you know? Like, it's literally why I wanted to bring up the points that I did--even if I don't necessarily 100% agree with everything you say, I wanted to know what it is you say, because I think it adds a lot to the fandom to think these things through.

Long story longer, thanks for making this thread, and thanks for thoughtfully responding. :)

** You know, there was a fic a number of years back (say, 2008?) that would have been perfect for you. I don't remember much about the fic itself, but I do remember that it opened with a long descriptive passage ruminating on differences between the Muggle and magical worlds, and in particular different sanitary habits. In this fic Muggles literally smell bad to wizards who are used to magically clean environments and personal hygiene.

*** I remember reading a similar fic where Wizarding world had things like bathing in a water tornado, Auto-cleaning your butt when you're done with the loo, and spells that clean your clothes for you.

I lost it, unfortuantely, but it has influenced the way that I write about the wizarding world ever since.

  Contrast that with food that can't go bad, wash basins where the water stays perfectly pure even if you wash shit off your hands in it, chamber pots that not only immediately destroy your waste but clean you completely as you stand up, and shower "pools" about a foot deep that surround you in a vortex of water, ripping any and all dirt off your body and make any massage setting on a shower head seem pointless.

** Umm the British magical world is pretty objectively shittier than the muggle one in Cannon.

Of course anything seriously AU can do whatever they want, but it is hard to see anything trying to stick to cannon showing its system as better.

There is certainly a range you can depict the magical world in (for example, depictions of the hospital range from NHS to Malfloys private hospital. Or the women's rights being downright repressive to full egalitarian).

However, it is hard to get away from an insular society that rejects learning from it's muggleborns. You have rampant government corruption, weak institutions, gullible public, weak news organizations. These are all plot points in cannon.

If you wanted a 'better' magical world, IMO your best bet is to leave Britain. Have magical America or France have a better system. This would likely involve magicals being a bit more tuned into what is happening in the muggle world, or subverting that and having magicals be behind most of the advancements in the muggle world. (To draw a contrast with Britain) Or you could have the 'Shining example of the magical world' be set somewhere that doesn't have good regular institutions. Magical Iraq or Zimbabwe?

It is kinda a neat idea to have the wizarding cultures in the 3rd world be highly advanced while the ones in the 1st world be recessed and behind.... And it fits cannon, cause magical Briton has some problems...

*** Of the problems you have listed how many of there are really a problem for the average member of the magical world?

And things like government corruption exist in the muggle world as well, in the magical world you have malfoy in the muggle world we have turned what malfoy does into a job we call them lobbyists.

And from what we see in the fantastic beasts movie I would definitely not consider Magical America better than magical England.

**** Not at the level that is in the books. Magical Briton is downright disfunctional. Healthy institutions, both governmental and press, are necessary for a functioning democracy. One that doesn't get taken over by terrorists. The country has one school, and it is rife with child endangerment and bullying. And several provably incompetent teachers. The governments stability is all shot to hell.

I've read books that promote systems I am not enamored with well (Webber's Harrington books and their love affair with constitutional monarchy comes to mind), the HP books don't try to do that. The magical society is basically a gimped version of the muggle one so Harry can come in and save it.

One idea I do like is that magical society had it easier than muggles with a higher quality of life due to magic for a long time, but it meant that the magical society didn't have to grow or change thus why they are behind now.

And yes, the rest of the magical world isn't that much better in cannon. But for fanfic, I would still call a fic using the books but discarding epilogue/later works as less AU than one that changes everything. And since you were looking for fics, I was giving my two cents on how this would work.

***** Wizard still have a higher quality of life then muggles although it may vary by how much better its is because a wizards quality of life is in a lot of way tied to the magical ability.

The the average wizard might enjoy a quality of like that we won't achieve for at least another hundred years but a wizard of Dumbeldores magical ability can have a quality of life that would won't be able to achieve in a thousand years if we ever can.

A wizards magic also allows them a greater independence than the muggle world will ever able to achieve.

****** I'm not sure where you are getting this from the books. Pretty much every example in the books of quality of life is the same or worse.

An uncertain government does horrors to a nations efficiency. As does a high risk of death (through accidents or social unrest). Or even just living in fear. There seems to be an entire lack of Monetary policy in the wizarding worlds, one of the main tools of running an economy.

Pretty much everything in the series suggests magic was more advanced than the muggle counterparts when it started, but has not advanced at all over time.

The only thing I can think off that suggests a higher quality of life is that Ron's family, who are depicted as poor, don't have food insecurity or the inability to send their children to school. And that is pretty weak given the complete mess of their governmental system and societal strife.
