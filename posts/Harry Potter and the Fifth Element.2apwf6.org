So i've just finished reading Bexis' HPATFE, and I must say it was quite a good read. Very long complete fiction, (long as in 3 times longer than Game of Thrones). It's a H/Hr story, and he's left it open for a follow up Year 7 fic. however it took 10 years to write this one, so don't expect that immediately!

Anyway people of the good ship harmony should give this one a read, especially if you like the longer stories.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/bexis/HPATFE.html]]

It should be noted that the fic is rated R, and I read it on recommendation of a fellow redditor who has posted something similar to this.

The author tends to give a hint as to what's happening at the top of his chapters, so avoid that if you want it kept to a surprise. He also tries to tie time/dates into Real World events so that the world seems to evolve and act outside of Wizard England. He ties that all in with a glossary of references at the end of chapter, those are very interesting to read.


** You could probably cut this fic in half and it would be so much better. I think I commented on it in another thread but I'll say it again. One of my favorite fics but it crumbles underneath its weight by the end of it.

*** I think the same of other fics like Prince of the Dark Kingdom and the Snape Chronicles. Good writing can't always make up for an extreme length.

**** True. So much of it is just world building for the sake of world building as well.

** I've tried to read this twice now. It has the worst case of diary-fic-itus I've ever encountered. I simply can't get past that.

The author doesn't seem to understand why we don't need or really want a panopticon view of every character's exact history and current internal state. They waste the reader's time with this over and over again, drawing out boring, uninteresting scenes to horriffic lengths. There is no real point of view character and everything seems oddly passive, like it is being described by an disinterested and unfocussed reporter who gets paid by the word.

This kills the story flow.

** This is probably my favorite fic of all time! It's always nice to see it recognized

** I am within two hours of finishing it. Very enjoyable, but a slightly condensed version would be perfect.

** Hmm. I read it -- up to a point -- on ff.net. It is well written (even though the author needs their /licence to whom/ revoked), but not well constructed. Talking at cross purposes, missed connections and miscommunication can all be interesting, but a lot less so when we get to see the perspectives and thoughts of all the parties involved.

Then, at least until the BA17 incident -- when everything starts to get weird, there are hardly any sympathetic characters to be found. I am kind of used to Harry being a twat, but I've hardly ever read a Hermione that was such an arsehole. It's a story that keeps telling me that they should be together, but I don't see why. Those two, as written, don't make me root for them and so I stopped reading.

It might be better if it was shorter. As it is I read hundreds of thousands of words, but I doubt I will ever make it to -- and past -- the million. “Because it's there!” is not a justification for much.
