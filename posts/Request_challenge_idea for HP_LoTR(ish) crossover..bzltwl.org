I've recently been looking for fanfics where Harry is inspired by the LoTR books/movies to create rings of power. I have been unable to find more than one (Harry potter and the rings of power, by ericwinter ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12718125/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rings-of-Power]] )) fic that I really liked. A fic w/ no slash (m/m or harry/legolas is really... disturbing for me) would be greatly appreciated. The avenue through which Harry would learn about artificing is something I believe to be better left to any writer interested in taking this idea up. Thank you for your time, and I hope to read some fics about this in the (hopefully) near future.
