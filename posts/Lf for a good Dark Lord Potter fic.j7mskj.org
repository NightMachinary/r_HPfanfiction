LF for a Good Dark Lord Potter fic, but I don't want a second riddle harry like the usual ones are. I want something more like how Grindelwald was and how tommy boy was at Hogwarts. Charismatic, handsome, powerful, manipulative(doesn't have to be full blown mind rape though). I would also like it to where he still has some morals like no rape and such and he still loves his family. It never made sense to me how he can be just like the man who killed his parents. Hook me up reddit.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** While I overall enjoyed this the repetitive "If you know Harry Potter then you knew this was inevitable" and "I'm doing this for my godson so he can live in a world without persecution" character circlejerking got old after a bit, and (spoiler warning) the ending wasn't really satisfying. Aside from a couple characters the majority of the supporting cast seems perfectly fine with Dark Lord Potter and all that entails, which is definitely not realistic for how fickle canon treats Harry's reputation when it comes to him *potentially* practicing Dark Arts.

**** First two points I agree with, in fact I think most people do. Its very enjoyable and the ending is definitely a let down. But I'm curious why canon is always brought up. We're reading a Dark Lord Potter that uses fiendyre.

True that, but on the other side, war changes people - mostly for the worse... canon doesn't touch post-War with the exception of the epilogue, so that hasn't actually been explored.

***** I was going to say, too, that the fic argues that Harry's classmates---who fought with him---were less likely to go back to the status quo versus the older adults which I thought was an interesting and more realistic angle. Basically, they fought with him in the final battle when as kids they really shouldn't have been fighting...so to see older adults, some who weren't there, condemn him it set them off.

I did think the ending was a bit weak, but otherwise it was a good story.

Also while a few characters may seem OOC note the changes in circumstances play a role.
