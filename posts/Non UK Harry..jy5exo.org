Harry's family (Potter'sor Evans) isn't from the UK at all. Let's say The Potter's are Desi and Harry grew up with The Patil's and became close to his adopted sisters The Twins. Or anything like this


** Not related to your question but as a South Asian person, I have thought about this scenario a lot. But there is a big problem. If Potters were desis, the entire story would be affected. For example- (I'll take my own country) arranged marriages are a big thing in India. In 1970s marrying someone of your choice usually leads to family drama. Or even with secret keeper thing, Indians gossip a lot. To a point that they give their own secrets. So imagine that kind of story!
