Fics that have Harry living/learning/fighting/fucking (for the wincest) with at least a partially alive family: sibling and Harry or Harry and parent(s), or both. Not looking for WBWL or similar tropes.


** I mean there are some along those lines I know which are just pure smut.

Do you want actual plot or just wank material?

By this I meant OR. The wincest is very much optional and not at all required.

After having read or skimmed numerous WBWL stories with a depressing family dynamic, I'm in the mood for a good (ideally long) story with a united Potter family.

****** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1041][Inheritance]] in particular, but most things by megamatt09 have Lily in some form.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5914576/Zarkho][Zarkho]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4499780/James-Davey-Smith][James Davey Smith]]

If it wasn't obvious, NSFW all links.

**** There's a couple of live (as opposed to animated, which exist also) HP themed pornos. Pretty funny stuff.

** There's some cool family dynamic in linkffn(7118223)

His relation with his family is also important in linkffn(3150414)

Neither is smut, however.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex
