** Island of fire by esama is really good. All Hogwarts students and Durmstrang,Beauxbatons delegation transported to a remote island with just their wands in a alternate dimension. And have to survive and build their own city they later find called Atlantis.([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]])

** Depends on degree of scattering and the size of the island, as well as the timeframe.

Post-GoF, the Golden Trio would be mostly self-sufficient, with Ron providing the correct mentality and identifying the necessities, Hermione being a book-smart generalist with a large repetitoire of spells and general knowledge, and Harry providing magical power, drive and pulling miracles out of his ass whenever needed.

Several others, like Weasley twins, would also be fine. That said, many would know very little in the way of utility spells. They could probably use Aguamenti for clean water, some transfiguration for shelter... but they would have food shortages, and a lot of prank/combat capable spells, so infighting would happen...

This is where scattering is a big factor - if they got dropped in in large groups, not only conflict would ensue sooner, Harry/Hermione might have an upswing of martyr complex, sending it all straight to hell. Same if the island is small enough. And that is if there isn't an instant Gryff/Snake firefight with no one around to fix the curse injuries. Even normally peaceful people would be subject to splash damage.

I honestly prefer the Australia scenario, with low population density, with land holding potential and danger alike. I love the notion that a competent wizard can just plop down a house and a farm in a few hours work in the middle of nowhere, and that some pampered princes would fail to do so, with no one around to rob/extort for resources.
