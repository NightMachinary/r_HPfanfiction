Began as an extremely helpful answer to [[/u/AutumnSouls][u/AutumnSouls]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8aumf2/vampireharry_fics_that_dont_follow_the/][request]] for "Vampire!Harry fics that don't follow the traditional vampire rules?" ("Like the Witcher's take on vampires, for example.") and turned into this.

--------------

Depictions of vampires in fiction have evolved over the years. For instance, in European folklore, "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vampire_traits_in_folklore_and_fiction][bloated corpses were mistaken for vampires]]", whereas in contemporary depictions, vampires are typically very attractive. Meyer (2005), for instance, describes her "inhumanly beautiful". In Whedon (1997), male vampire leads have a [[/r/ladyboners][r/ladyboners]] score average of 1241, whereas male nonvampire leads have a [[/r/ladyboners][r/ladyboners]] score average of 435 (Appendix A).

For their length, however, the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire][Harry Potter novels develop vampires very little]]. Are Rowling's vampires supernaturally beautiful? What color are their eyes? How can they be killed? Can they enter one's house without permission and, if so, what defines a house? /Does the sun cause them to conflagrate or merely sparkle?/ Rowling leaves these questions unanswered or, perhaps, up to the fans to decide. It is this task that XXXbloodyrists666XXX took on and is the subject of our analysis today.

XXXbloodyrists666XXX begins her exploration of vampires at the very beginning of her work:

#+begin_quote
  AN: Special fangz (get it, coz Im goffik)
#+end_quote

A naive reading of this passage might suggest that XXXbloodyrists666XXX's vampires have fangs. However, notice that the "fangz" are special. perhaps XXXbloodyrists666XXX is ironically mocking preps who believe vampires have fangs. This is supported by her characterization of Ebony's teeth:

#+begin_quote
  I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white.
#+end_quote

Fangs are pointed, but Ebony's teeth are straight, as is typical of incisors, the most visibly prominent human teeth. It appears that XXXbloodyrists666XXX's "special fangz" are ironic. Indeed, this is obvious in retrospect: XXXbloodyrists666XXX is (presumably) not a vampire, so the only way that one could "get it [special fangz], coz I'm goffik" is because of a mainstream ("prep") misconception that vampires have fangs.

XXXbloodyrists666XXX immediately begins exploring the physical characteristics of her vampires in the first paragraph of the story proper:

#+begin_quote
  I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  I have pale white skin
#+end_quote

From this, we can infer that XXXbloodyrists666XXX holds to the tradition of pale vampires, contrary to Whedon (1997) but in line with Meyer (2005). At the same time, Ebony has blue eyes, breaking from tradition of vampires having uncommon eye colors, thus putting her in line with Whedon (1997) but contrary to Meyer (2005), which is further backed up by her subsequent description of Draco having "gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts)". In breaking with two popular contemporary depictions of vampires, XXXbloodyrists666XXX bravely defies convention, daring to illustrate her own vision of vampirism.

Having already concretely begun setting her vision of vampires, XXXbloodyrists666XXX then builds suspense:

#+begin_quote
  It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about.
#+end_quote

Why was Ebony "very happy" about it "snowing and raining"? Is it because of an adverse reaction vampires have to sun? Or is merely because "I'm [Ebony] a goth (in case you couldn't tell)." The fact that Ebony wears foundation doesn't give support one way or another, since this could be explained either by protecting her skin from the sun's rays or merely by her gothic chic. A later passage clarifies:

#+begin_quote
  On the night of the concert I put on my black lace-up boots with high heels... I didn't put on foundation because I was pale anyway.
#+end_quote

When attending a concert at night, Ebony has no need to put on foundation because she's already pale. From this, we can conclude that her previous application of foundation was likely to protect her from the sun. But what detriment would she suffer were she exposed to the sun? Again, XXXbloodyrists666XXX excellent worldbuilding comes through for us:

#+begin_quote
  he wouldn't die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there's no way I'm writing that) or a steak
#+end_quote

The sun, being neither a cross nor a steak, poses no lethal threat to Ebony. However, she is still clearly afraid of it. It seems likely that, in the tradition of great artists stealing, XXXbloodyrists666XXX took a page from Stephenie Meyer's book: vampires in /My Immortal/ sparkle in the sunlight, something that a "goff" like Ebony would apply otherwise-superfluous foundation to avoid.

This, however, does not stop "a lot of preps" from staring at Ebony, even though this causes her to "put up my middle finger at them." Clearly, Ebony has supernatural good looks. However, these are unlikely to be solely be from her vampirism; while the other vampires are often described as beautiful (e.g. "Harry had beautiful red gothic eyes so much like Dracos."), none elicit such strong reactions. If not her vampirism, though, where does Ebony's supernatural good looks come from. XXXbloodyrists666XXX's worldbuilding is again exemplary:

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah but everyone is in love with me! Like Snape and Loopin took a video of me naked. Hargrid says he's in love with me. Vampire likes me and now even Snaketail is in love with me! I just wanna be with you ok Draco! Why couldn't Satan have made me less beautiful?” I shouted angrily. (an” don't wory enoby isn't a snob or anyfing but a lot of ppl hav told her shes pretty) “Im good at too many things! WHY CAN'T I JUST BE NORMAL? IT'S A FUCKING CURSE!"
#+end_quote

Not only do we find the source of Ebony's beauty ("Satan"), but we also find out it's a curse. An author's note gives a likely reason:

#+begin_quote
  Evony [sic] isn't a Marie Sue ok she isn't perfect SHES A SATANITS!
#+end_quote

Ebony is a SATANITS, a name easily confused with Satanism. From this, we can infer that Satan cursed her in revenge for something vaguely like trademark infringement.

Some may argue that XXXbloodyrists666XXX's "SATANITS" is a misspelling and that Ebony is a Satanist. The chief reason this is absurd: if we open the Pandora's box of misspelling, there's nothing stopping us from concluding, for instance, that Ebony is a /statist/ and XXXbloodyrists666XXX has demonstrated that she is perfectly capable spelling "Satanism" elsewhere---the two reasons this is absurd... /amongst the reasons this is absurd are such elements as/:

1. If we open the Pandora's box of misspelling, there's nothing stopping us from concluding, for instance, that Ebony is a /statist/
2. XXXbloodyrists666XXX has demonstrated that she is perfectly capable spelling "Satanism" elsewhere
3. Ebony's lack of other supernatural powers

"What lack of other supernatural powers?" you ask? I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition, but XXXbloodyrists666XXX clearly shows that Ebony (and Draco) are affected by drugs:

#+begin_quote
  We both smoked cigarettes and drugs. When we got there, we both hopped out of the car. We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to Good Charlotte.

  “You come in cold, you're covered in blood They're all so happy you've arrived The doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your mom She sets you free into this life.” sang Joel (I don't own da lyrics 2 dat song).

  “Joel is so fucking hot.” I said to Draco, pointing to him as he sung, filling the club with his amazing voice.

  Suddenly Draco looked sad.

  “What's wrong?” I asked as we moshed to the music. Then I caught on.

  “Hey, it's ok I don't like him better than YOU!” I said.

  “Really?” asked Draco sensitively and he put his arm around me all protective.

  “Really.” I said. “Besides I don't even know Joel and he's going out with Hilary fucking Duff. I fucking hate that little bitch.” I said disgustedly, thinking of her ugly blonde face.

  The night went on really well, and I had a great time. So did Draco. After the concert, we drank some beer and asked Benji and Joel for their autographs and photos with them. We got GC concert tees. Draco and I crawled back into the Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didn't go back into Hogwarts, instead he drove the car into........................... the Forbidden Forest!
#+end_quote

Much of Ebony's and Draco's behavior is only explicable by being under the influence of drugs (presumably hallucinogens), cigarettes (nicotine is a stimulant), and beer (alcohol is a depressant); none of these are things someone in their right mind would do:

1. Attend a GC concert
2. Enter a mosh pit
3. Believe Joel is hot
4. /Admit/ you believe Joel is hot
5. Having a "great time" at a GC concert
6. Paying money for GC merchandise
7. The real clincher: driving to the Forbidden Forest. The Forbidden Forest is /forbidden/. If it were for sexing up your SO, it would be called the Sexing Up Your SO Forest

The fact that she and Draco, both vampires, fall under the influence of drugs indicate that, not only did Satan /not/ give her resistance to psychoactive substances, thereby proving that Ebony is not a Satanist, but that vampires /in general/ do not have such resistance, which shows that vampires do not have supernatural healing.

Vampires having mundane healing, however, does not imply that they do not have modified physiology. Indeed, when Dumbledore catches Ebony and Draco having sex in the Forbidden Forest, Ebony cries "tears of blood"; we can conclude that all of a vampire's bodily fluids are blood. Should vampires need to regulate their body temperature, for instance, this would imply that they would sweat blood, which is super gross. Happily, this seems unlikely to be the case, since XXXbloodyrists666XXX moved the location of Hogwarts south, from its canonical location in Scotland to England, which would cause it to be warmer, and therefore less hospitable to the hypothetical vampire that sweated blood.

On the topic of bodily fluids, it seems unlikely that Ebony has the ability to get pregnant, and therefore that she does not menstruate, since she has unprotected sex with Draco:

#+begin_quote
  We started frenching passively and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. He felt me up before I took of my top. Then I took off my black leather bra and he took off his pants. We went on the bed and started making out naked and then he put his boy's thingy in mine and we HAD SEX. (c is dat stupid?)
#+end_quote

However, Loopin later asks Ebony for condoms:

#+begin_quote
  “No, actshelly (geddit, hell) kan I plz burrow sum condemns.” he growld angrily.
#+end_quote

We infer that vampires might reasonably be expected to have condoms. We conclude that vampires are susceptible to STDs, which further reinforces that vampires do not have supernatural healing. Presumably, Ebony and Draco got tested for STDs in a deleted scene, which would explain why Ebony was so upset when she believed Draco cheated on her in chapter 7; notice, her concern wasn't that Draco loved Vampire more than her, but that Draco might have AIDS:

#+begin_quote
  “You bastard!” I shouted angrily, jumping out of the bed.

  “No! No! But you don't understand!” Draco pleaded. But I knew too much.

  “No, you fucking idiot!” I shouted. “You probably have AIDs anyway!”

  I put on my clothes all huffily and then stomped out. Draco ran out even though he was naked. He had a really big you-know-what but I was too mad to care. I stomped out and did so until I was in Vampire's classroom where he was having a lesson with Professor Snape and some other people.

  “VAMPIRE POTTER, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!” I yelled.
#+end_quote

We can now infer that Ebony doesn't menstruate because vampires reproduce by other means. However, B'loody Mary Smith is described as having "real parents" who were "vampires", one of whom was a witch. Not only does this confirm that some, but not all, vampires are magic users, but suggests that vampires reproduce sexually, perhaps by two (or more?) vampires biting the same human. The fact that B'loody Mary Smith "still has nightmares" about her real parents indicates that she was "born" (turned) subsequent to infantile amnesia. Further, Ebony describes B'loody Mary Smith as being "kidnapped." It seems likely that, when two vampires bit a human to reproduce, the underlying human is destroyed, replaced by the progeny of the two parents, but still in the shell of the original human. This is reinforced by all or almost all the vampires being described as bisexual ("I'm bi and so is Ebony"); having done away with the sperm-fertilizes-egg model, there need be no restriction on the sexes of vampiric parents, although it remains understandable that humans might object to their children being replaced by hellspawn parasites, which explains why B'loody Mary Smith was kidnapped by parents who couldn't accept their child was gone.

Would such parents be able to care for a vampire child? In chapter 6, Ebony eats breakfast:

#+begin_quote
  Count Chocula cereal with blood instead of milk, and a glass of red blood
#+end_quote

While the Count Chocula cereal---cereals are by definition grain-based---proves that vampires can eat human food, the prominence of blood suggests that vampires need blood to thrive, or at least strongly prefer it. One is strongly reminded of the "vegetarian" vampires from Meyer (2005), who ate animals. It seems likely that XXXbloodyrists666XXX decided that vegetarians who ate animals was stupid and created vegetarian vampires who ate what Vernon Dursley might describe as "rabbit food." (If you're going to have a rabbit as a pet, please research what rabbits actually eat.) However, the joke's on XXXbloodyrists666XXX: one of the most prominent vegetarian advocacy groups in the US is People Eating Tasty Animals.

*Conclusion*

XXXbloodyrists666XXX provides a rich portrait of vampirism, adding a welcome expansion to the vampiric canon. We summarize in the following table:

  Although I contend your conclusion that vampires sparkle-perhaps they simply get sunburnt.
#+end_quote

Perhaps. However, direct your attention to this passage from chapter 11:

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, I started crying tears of blood and then I slit both of my wrists. They got all over my clothes so I took them off and jumped into the bath angrily while I put on a Linkin Park song at full volume. I grabbed a steak and almost stuck it into my heart to commit suicide. I was so fucking depressed! I got out of the bathtub and put on a black low-cut dress with lace all over it sandly. I put on black high heels with pink metal stuff on the ends and six pairs of skull earrings. I couldn't fucking believe it. Then I looked out the window and screamed... Snap was spying on me and he was taking a video tape of me! And Loopin was masticating to it! They were sitting on their broomsticks.

  “EW, YOU FUCKING PERVS, STOP LOOKING AT ME NAKED! ARE YOU PEDOS OR WHAT!” I screamed putting on a black towel with a picture of Marilyn Mason on it. Suddenly Vampire ran in.
#+end_quote

Notice how Ebony requests Snap and Loopin to stop looking at her "NAKED" even though she had put on a "black low-cut dress with lace all over it." The most parsimonious explanation is that Ebony washed off her foundation in the bath, making her feel naked despite wearing a dress, high heels, and six pairs of earrings.

See no plot holes, hear of no plot holes, there are no plot holes.

** This analysis the most I have ever read of "My Immortal". I don't know if I should be upset about that ... :D Also, according to Charlaine Harris in the Southern Vampire series, vampires are pretty good-looking in general, though not sparkly and sunlight burns them to ash.
