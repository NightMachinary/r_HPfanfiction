Looking for any fics where Seamus is a main character in the story (w/o bashings). I feel like the small number of fics I have read portray him in a negative way. I also feel like he had one of the best arcs since (from what I remember in the books) he first was very skeptical of Harry's claims but (as a teenager mind you) went against his own mother and continued to fight for the side of the Light, even when it resulted in severe punishment in his 7th year. So I am asking for any fics that show him in a good light or any fics where he heavily supports Harry.

Thanks!
