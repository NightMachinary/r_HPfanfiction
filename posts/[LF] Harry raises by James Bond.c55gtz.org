Basically, any fics where Harry ends up raised by James Bond or as an agent of MI6 or its magical equivalent. Bonus points if Sirius also is recruited.

I've already read linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8465414/1/Agent-Potter]]) and I'm looking for something similar.


** In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]], James Potter was 007 - and Harry and co. attend Harworts, a school for secret agents.

  HP / James Bond x-over - Harry uses the first chance he gets to escape his horrible life at Privet Drive when he is offered a very special job by a man that is thought to be imprisoned in the infamous prison of Azkaban. Learning more about the magical and the muggle world Harry Potter starts his way in the service of her Majesty. Look out 007, now comes Harry Potter. Later lemons

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle) has Harry and Ron as agents, it just got started two weeks ago and updates weekly. 95% sure it'll get finished, the author has a dozen great finished stories.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
