The ones that you can write page after page about. Rant for hours about. It doesn't have to be just about canon either. It can be fanon too. It doesn't have to be positive or negative. It can be anything ships characters very specific popular fics you dislike etc Just literally anything hp related that you can rant about .


** There are very few characters in HP who I can honestly, without any reservations, call good. Not good as in "good character", but as in "good person".

It is usually said that Rowling's characters are "complex", "gray", "lifelike", and so on.. except if it was real life, we'd call them "failing at basic morality". You know, things like "don't abandon your friends", "don't physically attack your friends", "don't torture enemy combatants", "don't try to abandon your pregnant wife", "don't test your inventions on 11-year-olds"... Basically, the only reason most of the "good guys" can be considered such is that the other guys are even worse.

That's not to say that I hate all the characters, or that I'm trying to say that everyone was equally bad. But I've seen way too many arguments where someone was trying to judge a character they dislike by our world's standards, while ignoring the fact that the characters they are trying to defend have absolutely no moral high ground themselves.

**** Ron abandoned and betrayed Harry in book 4 out of jealousy, when Harry needed him the most.The twins weren't at war when they tested most of their inventions on unwilling participants at Hogwarts. Remus didn't run from Tonks because they were at war, he ran from Tonks because he was scared he might have given their unborn child lycanthropy. These characters did questionable things that, excepting Ron perhaps, were not someone's usual thought process, I guess? While I can safely say that I will never be a werewolf, I can assume that I would never leave my wife with our unborn child, lycanthropy or no. One of my personal values is loyalty, like when Ron stood on a broken leg in front of an assumed mass murderer and said go fuck yourself. Ron then did a 180 when Harry clearly didn't like the attention of the tournament and called him a liar??? I get that he's jealous of Harry's wealth and fame, but they are best friends. Wouldn't they know each other better than that? A lot of the time the twins performed 'pranks' that could have had really bad outcomes, but it's ok because it's just a joke. Practical jokes are only ok if its harmless and fun. A cream pie to the face? No harm, it'll wash off, laughs all round. Transforming someone by slipping unknown potions in their food? Real dangerous territory here, boys. I agree with OP here, just because they are the good guys doesn't excuse all their behaviour, which we are lead to believe in the books.

***** I can agree with Andromeda, but Regulus was not a truly good Slytherin. He collected pictures of Murder while he was a teen and wanted to be a Death Eater. He only realised what it meant when he already was one. He did the right thing in the end, sure, but before that he was all about blood purity.

Slughorn may be not the baddest bad but he was the one who helped Tom Riddle with his Horcruxes and kept it secret for over 50 years! If he had told Dumbledore what he knew, Dumbledore could have acted decades earlier. Dumbledore only figured out that Riddle had Horcruxes in 1993 - it took him 5 years to take Voldemort down after that. I don't fault him for falling into Riddles charm, but I fault Slughorn for keeping it secret.

Both Slughorn and Regulus (together with Snape, Narzissa and Draco) fall in the category of "bad Slytherins who did good later on". Not truly good.

******* I like the fan theory people were discussing here a few days (weeks? IDK 2020 timescale is all warped for me), where Slughorn is SO terrified of Riddle / Voldemort for a few reasons:

1. Slughorn knows of his horcruxes. He's a bit of an ass, yes, for keeping that a secret, but there's honestly like a handful of people he could even discuss the subject with who would even know what was going on. Then you have a psychotic powerful wizard who knows that you know his secret, and well, you'd want to maybe keep that information to yourself lest the immortal psychopath finds out you snitched.

2. Slughorn is the reason Tom Riddle never made anything of himself professionally after Hogwarts. You have the Head Boy, top of his class, prodigy student and basically second-coming of Dumbledore in Tom Riddle. The kid is obviously a genius and ambitious ... so he works at some second-hand dark artifacts shop in Nocturne Alley? Well, it's because Slughorn uses his extensive network of acquaintances to blacklist the kid. Tom Riddle has no future, not in the English speaking world, so he adopts a persona, /Voldemort/, to circumvent this, and Slughorn is equally terrified.

I mean, the guy was hiding out and posed as furniture to avoid dealing with Voldemort. Dumbledore bringing Harry in was a way to convince Slughorn that "hey, we have a solution."

Regulus got cold feet and probably realized that suicide was preferable to a life of being a deranged murderer.

Like I said - Slughorn is not the baddest of the bad. In terms of white to black he is more like a light grey. But my point was that every house got a true hero; one who was good all the time even if they had flaws. Hufflepuff has Cedric, Sprout and Tonks, Ravenclaw has Luna and Flitwick, Gryffindor has to much to count. Slytherin has no one who is like that.

** Dumbledore fucked up during his very first meeting with Tom Riddle. It makes some amount of sense given Grindelwald and views on mental illness at the time, however Dumbledore never once seems to regret or consider that he messed up with his initial treatment of Riddle. An isolated child who grew up in a Muggle orphanage during Depression Era, then WWII, Britain was not going to be a well adjusted individual by any stretch of the imagination, let alone one who could do incredible feats of wandless magic before the age of 11.

There are numerous accounts in real life of conditions that orphans went through during those decades in Britain, and the majority of the children came out with severe, lifelong trauma.

In his assessment of Wool's orphanage, Harry thinks that the orphans 'looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place.' Mrs. Cole and her assistant were clearly overrun and overworked when Dumbledore visited. But despite being described as 'inconveniently sharp' and 'more anxious than unkind', Mrs Cole was also said to be 'no novice when it came to drinking gin'. That feels problematic to me.

After speaking to Mrs Cole, Dumbledore speaks with Riddle. Riddle is angry and scared because he believes he's being sent to an asylum and screams that he's not mad. He's desperate to prove his sanity and is excited beyond belief to put a name to his abilities. He immediately tells Dumbledore everything he can do and is relieved to know there are other people like him.

He is also a petty thief and in response, Dumbledore pretends to blow up his wardrobe and threatens him with expulsion and ministry punishment if he does anything like it ever again.

After Riddle questioned him about Hogwarts and school supplies, Dumbledore says he'll take Riddle to Diagon Alley and is declined. Instead of pulling the adult card here and going anyways to be a stabilizing, interested adult presence for the 11-year-old orphan's intro to this new world, he effectively shrugs and says he'll see him at Hogwarts.

The conversation is less than five minutes, and he asks two questions: 'How are you doing' and 'You dislike the name Tom?' That's it. That's all he asks this orphan terrified of asylums and desperate to meet/know about others like him.

While Dumbledore spoke to Mrs. cole about Riddle's history and behavior, he never actually asks Tom about any of it. Not what the orphanage is like, not what he thinks of the other children, not what he does with his time, not what happened with the rabbit. This kid is clearly messed up, due to some combination of genetics and environment, but Dumbledore walks out without hesitation.

Why is he okay with hearing about Riddle's childhood crimes second hand instead of talking to the kid? Where was any speck of sympathy or warmth for a life-long orphan, from the wizard who later touts love as the greatest power? Dumbledore claims that Tom Riddle could never and would never know love, but he certainly never offered it to Riddle.

Frequently I've seen arguments that there were plenty of other children who go through similar events and don't end up being genocidal psychopaths, which is true. However, there are also plenty who end up perpetuating the abuse, in jail for various crimes, or dead. Riddle could have easily been one of those, except he was able to muster massive amounts of power as an unloved, strange child. Even adults don't deal well with having unchecked power over others.

None of this excuses Tom Riddle's later actions by any means, however I think it is an incredibly important lens to view the character of Voldemort through. One that readers, and even Dumbledore himself, dismiss.

*** I think much of this can be answered by comparing to what should be done and what we actually do. You could help the poor fellow who lives on the streets or engage yourself in politics for the betterment of your society, but most people don't. We don't think that it is our business, that we are busy and that we already care for the people close to us.

It also has to be said that in earlier centuries and even today the degree of responsibility we feel to orphans and other people in general is not up to the level people imagine it to be.

Just ask yourself how attentive you are to other people's blights and how you think there might be something and you just walk on, because you tell yourself it is not your business and somebody else will care or that you made a misjudgment.

**** 100% agree, I do think Dumbledore had a lot of other more pressing concerns (Grindelwald) and is still only human. I don't blame him for how he acted, it feels very appropriate for the time period.

I'm more annoyed that despite the number of times Dumbledore has picked through his memories of Tom Riddle, he doesn't ever acknowledge the possibility that he could have done anything wrong.

And Harry doesn't have any second thoughts Dumbledore's interpretation either when viewing the memory over fifty-years later. Granted, Harry was dealing with the mad man destroying the world and trying to kill him in particular, so I really don't hold that against him.

I guess because so few people knew anything about Voldemort's past, I wish someone was written to feel a closer personal connection to it (an original death eater, harry, Dumbledore)? Slughorn got pretty close, which was nice.

But a lot of this rant is probably because I think 'modern' Voldemort is pretty flat as a villain and want him rounded out somehow. His interesting backstory felt wasted to me because it was so disconnected from 90s Voldemort and how others acted around him (aside from Dumbledore and Harry calling him Tom)

2. The Founders probably weren't as immensely powerful as they're often portrayed. They probably were for their time, but they would get stomped by Dumbledore and Voldemort. Most spells hadn't even been invented yet during their time.
3. Most of the "ancient pure-blood" families wouldn't be as invested in politics/ the ministry as people think. They would certainly be rich and have loads of connections, but to flaunt their wealth and power is something that would be considered nouveau riche. Old families know their worth, they would only brag behind the scenes.
4. "The Marauders" were basically mostly James and Sirius, no matter how much people want to portray them as extremely tight knit. All canon evidence points towards Remus and Peter being good friends but not equals. Remus thinking his friends would reject him if he stood up to them when they bullied Snape is very telling of their dynamic. Also notice how it was /James and Sirius/ who were "the height of cool" not all four of them.

*** When it comes to canon I am hard pressed to disagree with you. There isn't much to go on and Remus and Peter changed the most since childhood (matured from loneliness and the about face of betrayal) so they could have been anything. They were definitely in on secrets and participated in most of them, Animagi and Map. James and Sirius were the extroverts and had the closest friendship. There was probably a lot of social pressure to fit in with them, and neither Remus nor Peter had much self confidence to start with. I actually think it works with when they joined the Order. James and Sirius were dedicated to each other and felt that their skill meant they had to be the brave Gryfs. Remus didn't have many options but agreed with the cause and had unique skills, however he never expected to stay close friends after high school. Peter was the opposite as he was desperate to stay friends with James and Sirius but he couldn't offer anything back. He was too scared for the war and angry that his friends left him behind. I think you are correct for how that all impacts canon, but...

When they were "Maraudering" I think they would have appeared on the outside to be all equals. When they were teens this could have been the case before they matured. So the friendship dynamic was complex but I think they all had their part in the friendship.

Wolfstar is definitely not canon but I like to read it because both characters have very gay themes. 1. a boy who disagrees with his families traditional beliefs and runs away, 2. a boy who holds a deep secret and is trying to learn that he isn't a monster and deserves love. Those are some really strong themes that work well with romance stories, just need some extra time to marinate out the internalised homophobia. The grey cloud of the ship is that you have to ignore almost everything after their Hogwarts graduation, but since I don't like canon all that much I like when it changes in Wolfstars favour.

**** You have some good points. I agree that they were most likely a lot closer in terms of friendship during school, but during the war they grew further apart. I don't think this is how most people saw it though. I generally think most people saw James and Sirius as the cool kids while Remus and Peter were seen as just normal kids who happened to be friends with them. The point I was trying to get across was that most of the actual pranking, bullying and exploring was done by James and Sirius (although the Map was definitely a group project). They were all very good friends but they weren't like a public group phenomenon where everyone admired their friendship.

I don't have a problem with people enjoying Wolfstar, but everyone is /always/ so out of character. The main reason Wolfstar doesn't work is because it ruins what is interesting about the characters to me. If Remus and Sirius are deeply in love, they will not consider the other as a potential spy for the order. Remus wouldn't have the trust issues and lack of confidence in their friendship if he was receiving constant love from Sirius. James would be a kind of a third wheel in their friendship. To me, the most important person in Sirius' life was James, which would not be true if he was with Remus. If the Snape-werewolf incident never happened and James was never born, then I could maybe see them being together.

​

And anyway, I never saw Sirius as being interested in any type of romance. If he was, it's kind of obvious who he would be in love with...

Also ill drop some quotes supporting the fact that James and Sirius were what mostly made up the "Marauders".

​

#+begin_quote
  “Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course --- exceptionally bright, in fact --- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers

  “You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
#+end_quote

No mention of the rest except for "their little gang",

​

#+begin_quote
  “It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...”
#+end_quote

(Sirius doesn't seem very sorry for his actions does he?)

​

#+begin_quote
  “If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.
#+end_quote

James apparently will only listen to Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, /occasionally/ accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.

He only had a problem with it when he found out that one of the toddlers in question belonged to Lily Potter.

*** I don't somehow think this is the case. I highly doubt that the thought of Voldemort immediately marching up to the child's house and murdering it and its parents before it's even two years old actually even crossed his mind at all before Voldemort announced that "the boy is Harry Potter and I must kill him and his family immediately".

He probably had some vague notion of Voldemort being more wary of certain potential adversaries & being more on his guard as they grew up, but I don't think he specifically thought "this guy's gonna kill a toddler" at any point, nor do I think he would have been okay with that.

If Harry Potter was born six months later Voldemort would have attempted to kill Neville. Yes. That is true.

Somehow I don't think Snape would have followed him (willingly) for much longer once he realised what he was planning to do.

What Snape thought of todddler murder is never actually breached because his thoughts are consumed by /oh god oh god oh god please let me save Lily/

** Snape is not a Slytherin "Prince", he is not a hero, however I do not consider him a villain. He was a bitter man who refused to sympathise with anyone but himself. Furthermore, regardless of what he went through with James Potter, he should not have treated his son the way he did. He only switched sides because he didn't get what he wanted - Lily Evans. Only once he found out she was in danger (only because he told Voldemort about the prophecy in the first place) did he beg for Dumbledore's forgiveness. Additionally, when he asked Dumbledore to save Lily, he didn't care about the life of her son or husband. He was willing to sacrifice everything in the world but himself for Lily, while she was willing to sacrifice herself for her son.

Also, I don't believe he really loved Lily. He was obsessed with her. She was his only friend (because she was the only one to put up with his attitude for so long) and he didn't know how to compare the feelings he had for Lily with anything else. A point many bring up is the patronus, but a patronus can change to fit with someone else's by strong emotion. I don't think the books actually specify that the strong emotion has to specifically be genuine love for someone, correct me if I'm wrong. He could love having her around, or perhaps love how she constantly made excuses for him - or maybe it was just that he had such a strong feeling of attachment to her. His patronus did not fit with hers, it matched it completely, unlike James whose patronus was a stag. This could symbolise how James and Lily fit together perfectly, while Severus only cared that it was Lily, and not how he acted.

I don't know if any of that made sense, or if my grammar was 100% on point, but that's that.

Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  Tonks's Patronus changed into a wolf after she fell in love with Lupin, a sure sign of true love if ever there was one.

  Harry's Patronus took the same shape as his father's.
#+end_quote

A Patronus is a representation of your very nature. People who have a certain Patronus simply because it is the Patronus of someone else, care so deeply about that person that it has become an essential part of their nature- or, in Harry's case, shared some of the more essential traits of James Potter and, quite obviously, was his son. He had the unconditional love that comes with a parent who you know loved you, cared for you, kept you safe.

So you can say whatever you like about Severus Snape, but he loved Lily Evans. He never stopped loving her either.

*** I agree that Divination is a legitimate and functional branch of magic, but I disagree that it's related to mind magic and that Ron, Harry, and Hermione didn't try hard enough. Which, /fair/, but I simply believe that you have to have an innate skill in Divination and that it shouldn't be offered as an elective unless students show any ability in it. I also think that Divination runs in family lines kinda like Metamorphmagi's in the Blacks and Parseltongue in the Gaunts.

Ron, for example, could be seen as one of these students with an innate skill in it. He literally predicted half the shit that happens in the books and he wasn't even trying. Imagine if he actually put the work into Divination? He may not make predictions like Telewany, who I feel has a sort of "watered-down" version of her ancestor's Divination skill, but he sure as hell shows some aptitude toward it.

Luna is another person who is often portrayed as a character skilled in Divination, but personally, I think that the Lovegoods and the Ollivanders come from the same family line and that they can actually /see/ magic, and that's what Luna sees with wrackspurts and the like.

I agree that Sybil's prophetic abilities are inherited but that they relate to divination the way a metamorphs do to transfiguration.

I think all magicals have some degree of inate skill possibly related to their ability to see things muggles can't.

Either way Ron's predictions are slot like trelawneys in that he doesn't realize he's made them or use any of the assorted paraphernalia.

It's a pity JKR didn't go in that direction as it would have done Ron some good to be naturally talented at something the others weren't.

Also, probably due to certain very well known fanfics (i.e. Wood for the Trees and James and Me), James Sirius Potter is the romantic lead his father and namesakes are not. However (and this is where the influence of Wood for the Trees really shines through imo) both James Sirius and Harry are deeply fascinated by and sentimental about family.

The reason she brings it up is because Fleur has just said that she doesn't care if Bill's disfigured or not, and that she loves him either way. Tonks is using that to show that they can have a relationship, and to prove to him that his condition isn't an issue.

This also leads to the idea that one of the reasons that the Weasleys are so poor is because they're spending so much money on tuition so that their children can get the best education possible.

*** Slytherin were badly represented imo and bullied themselves by other houses, hear me out. The first thing Harry (and I presume other students) get told about Slytherin is it's the ‘bad' house for ‘bad' people. Slytherin's constantly get told they're evil and Slytherin students get excluded by other houses BEFORE they get the chance to know them as people. It's no surprise that most Slytherins just go ‘screw it, I might as well just become what everyone says I am'.

There is good and bad in every house, but people just talk about the bad in Slytherin. You also have to remember that most Slytherin students in Harry's era are raised by or have close ties with death eaters and their ideals, which is something out of the students control. Being treated poorly by other houses mixed with their upbringing is a recipe for disaster. But if the other houses gave the individuals a chance I believe that the way a lot of Slytherins thought and acted would change massively.

The ideals Slytherins were raised on could've been disputed while they were away from home and their opinions could've changed if other houses gave them a chance and didn't judge them based off a stupid house system. Instead Slytherins largely only interacted with other Slytherins who had the same mindset, making what they believed feel right. Then the process continues when they have children, and their children have children.

This is just my opinion and outlook on it though.

He was seen being spoon-fed potions by Madam Pomfrey weeks after the vanishing cabinet incident. None of the Gryffindors take issue with this - in fact, when Hermione suggests telling Madam Pomfrey what happened to him in case it might help her treat him, they dismiss it out of hand.

Gryffindors and Slytherins are cruel and vicious to each other as a rule of thumb. I would consider most of your points to fall under the lines of "house rivalry" moreso than "bullying," and assume the Gryffindors in the background were giving as good as they got for the most part.

The twins were clearly not trying to kill Montague. His injuries were an accident, and they came from his choice to try to apparate out of the cabinet anyway.

And to answer the question in your other comment, Montague is also a great example of a Slytherin trying to casually murder or greviously harm a Gryffindor.

** 1. This is mostly just cause harem fics are my thing, but there is /no way/ Hermione would /ever/ just go “yes I'm fine with being one of Harry's many wives” or some shit like that. She's a feminist, independent, and stubborn, and I just couldn't realistically see her doing that shit. Yet, with the exception of 1 possible fic, her doing the exact opposite is normal in any harem fics featuring her (ugh).

2. Ron bashing is just incredibly annoying, as it seems like people just purposely refuse to understand the complexity of his character in particular. Yes, Ron is a hothead at times, yes he is stubborn, and yes he may have the emotional range of a teaspoon. But most of the time when I see this stuff oriented at him, it's in reaction to something he did to Hermione, and people also conveniently ignore that Hermione also gave as good as she got. (Incidentally, this is also why I'm not the biggest fan of Romione, although I do think it works well enough in the canon setting.)

3. There should have been more “I went through similar shit” moments between Harry and Ginny in canon. I love their relationship, but I think if JKR had actually done proper set-up about them recovering from their shared trauma it would've worked /loads/ better. It also could've set up Harry's feelings better for her too, since while him going (from what I remember) “wow she just told me off that's hot” in OotP is hilarious, it's also a little stupid that that was what made him realize he liked her in that way.

4. Charlus and Dorea should have been James's parents. I know this is a relatively popular opinion, given that 1/2 of the fandom still operates under this fanon theory, but seriously. /Fleamont/? What the hell kind of Pureblood name -- no, scratch that, /early 1900's name/ is that? I know, JKR has other horrible names not befitting of certain time periods (/cough cough/ Jimbo fucking Blishwick /cough cough/), but Fleamont in particular just irks me to no end. Also, since the Blacks are probably related to virtually every other Pureblood, it only makes sense for them to be related to the Potters too somehow.

5. Upon reread, it's kind of obvious that there was gay subtext with Dumbledore in DH /at the very least/ and I'm tired of people saying there was not. “Closer than brothers”, hmm?? Dumbledore and Grindelwald planning to travel the world and (do world domination at the same time lol), that's not a little...on the nose? C'mon, if even Skeeter can pull enough shit about it to make it seem half-believable considering it happened /a century ago/, there's definitely something going on there.

** - The Epilogue is a travesty that could have been (and kind of /was/) by any decent fanfic writer, and was a heartbreaking end to the series.
- The decision not to give Draco a redemption archive went against the general message of hope and overcoming youthful mistakes that is present throughout.
- Harry marrying into the Weasley family was too perfect and too contrived. I like Ginny, but I don't like her with Harry at all. She went from "best friend's sister who has an awkward crush on me" to "love interest" with literally no development. She also went from Annoying sister to pretty badass without any development. I feel like Ginny pre HPB and after HPB could be different characters.
- The Cursed Child is merely officially endorsed fanfic. Only fanfic would have had the balls to make Albus and Scorpius a couple.
- "Harry is canonically straight" is always a terrible argument and completely dismisses viable alternative interpretations of canon. On Drarry specifically, there is mounds of subtext between him and Draco that could make them a viable couple. There's a reason it's the single most popular pairing in the fandom. Just because it's not to your taste or you don't like slash doesn't mean that it isn't objectively as valid a ship as /Haphne/.

*** My biggest complaint with the epilogue is it had so little to do with the series in its tone?

The series was about friendship and their interests and overcoming a dark lord.

And yet the epilogue us just about confirming ships? Why is Draco ending up with some lady no one knows ( as Astoria only is confirmed post DH and even then no one knew her from the books) a thing worthy of being included?

You find out nothing about what jobs main characters are doing or any changes that took place post war but hey Draco procreated. I harp on Draco to make a point but this is literally all the characters. Harry's romantic subplot isn't even that big. But you know what was big ? Him fighting dark wizards since he was 11 and wanting to be a auror. But you get no exploration of his job and see that he has kids.

I agree that either Draco should have gotten a redemption or Harry should have befriended a Slytherin and been very close to them. Also befriended a Hufflepuff to be very close to. He has Luna in Ravenclaw so at least 1 person from a different house.

Part of why protagonists and antagonists are popular pairings is because those relationships are often some of the best-developed relationships in the property. There is no single character in the series that Harry fixates on more than Draco and vice versa. Even if you hate it, that's a pretty objective truth. And that kind of fixation is a gold mine if you happen to like slash. If you don't like Draco objectively, I get that. He was a character that had potential to go in a different direction that canon ultimately took him (would have been really nice to see one serious Slytherin character actually go against the grain and grow beyond their own indoctrination, but we didn't get that. And Snape does not count given his very personal and specific motivations). But acting like it's just a "bad" ship on its face usually just reads as homophobic to me.

**************** So TL;DR: I think that Harry and Draco are great foils for one another and are an OTP of mine, but I totally understand why you can't get past canon Draco being a snot, so if it's not your jam, that's okay too.

Haha, were you expecting a novel? Drarry is kind of an OTP of mine. I think he's a far more interesting foil for Harry than pretty much anyone else, and his character was primed for a redemption arc that ultimately wasn't given to him. That generally means I tend to prefer either canon divergent fics (if set during school) or them running into each other as adults with some space between their school days (as far as I'm concerned the Epilogue is usually firmly "not my cannon" territory). Canon Draco is absolutely a snotty, spoiled little brat with few, if any, redeeming qualities beyond loving his family. That said, there were opportunities for him to grow and change and see beyond his prejudices, he just never does in canon (which is a damn shame b/c there's such a point made of "Slytherin doesn't equal evil" and "Gryffindor doesn't equal good," and while you have Pettigrew as the example in Gryffindor, you really don't any character from Slytherin who does the same (and no, I definitely do not count Snape)). Fandom makes up for that in /abundance/.

I think my favorite fic that does this slowly is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417][survival is a talent]] Linkao3(12006417)

Don't be too overwhelmed by the wordcount. It starts in second year, so you can dip your toes in and check out the 2nd and 3rd year and see if it's an interesting take or not. It's a soulmate AU with surprisingly little focus on the soulmate aspect, and a slowly developing relationship (since they're, you know, /twelve/ at the beginning). The author really doesn't do smut, so you don't have to worry about running into any of it later either.

There is probably an argument to be made that fanon Draco (at least in slash) and canon Draco aren't really the same character, but generally speaking, good fics will show him changing, show him learning and growing in ways that, to me, generally work and make sense and tend to be much more satisfying for me as a reader. Fandom, for me, gives me the growth and development that I didn't get in canon, and I think with some growth, he and Harry actually complement one another really well. I deeply believe there are 2 main drivers of massive fandom engagement: 1) really fantastic world that is not fully explored (LOTR is king here, but HP falls into it a lot too, as does Star Wars); 2) phenomenal idea, less than phenomenal execution (Naruto, Supernatural, Harry Potter again). HP and Star Wars, two of arguably the biggest fandoms ever, hit both of these. Not all parts of them are unsuccessful, it can just take a few. But I find that where canon fails, if the idea was good enough, fandom will provide. Harry was not given a good romantic arc or (in my opinion) a partner who was a good match for him. There's obviously a massive contingent of the fandom that feels Draco fits better, and, as such, has filled that void.

That said, I do understand not being able to see past a character in canon being terrible. Tom/Harry has picked up recently as a pairing, and I just... I can't do that in any context that isn't blatantly terribly unhealthy. Tom Riddle was pretty much shown to be a sociopath from childhood canonically. I don't think there's any fixing that. I just can't get on that ship. That said, /that's my hangup/. It doesn't work /for me/, and I can explain why, but I'm not going to go trolling Tomarry fics and tell the authors they're wrong or troll readers who like the pairing. I just move on when I see it, which I think is something fandom, as a whole, needs to get better about, but this subred is particularly not great about.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

How many mundane parents at that time would actually consent to their children going to a magic school and learning magic? How many parents had probably condemned their own children at the stake for being "unnatural"? I personally believe that Slytherin kept the basilisk for the safety of the children in their care, only to be used if Muggles decided to storm the castle and try to kill everyone.

Another headcanon of mine is that he seemed against Muggleborns because he wanted to educate them separately because compared to children who grew up in the magical world, they lacked severely in any magical knowledge or holidays or whatever.

*** My personal headcanon on Slytherin is that he distrusted the Muggleborn students. Witches and wizards are being persecuted, /aggressively/, and any connection to Muggles is a threat. The Muggle parents could use their children as unwitting inside informitants or the children could agree to be spies for their parents. The safety of the schoolchildren is the most important thing, and if Hogwarts is compromised, there's nowhere for the children to go except back to their families, who are already on the run from the Muggles & trying to keep a low profile, which is going to be that much harder when trying to hide accidental magic from the neighbours.

An over-the-top kill-with-its-eyes serpent to rat out any threat to the castle, whoever it may be, is the kind of jumping-without-looking reckless thing I would guess Godric needled him mercilessly about, except their friendship fell apart so spectacularly over it that Salazar just left. (That's also something I would've expected. One or the other.) But anyway, what Salazar probably meant by "his Heir" was like his grandson or something. Not someone born so far into the future that the entire wizarding world have managed to convince Muggles as a whole that they don't exist, and therefore in a time when the schoolchildren were under no threat of persecution by Muggles.

Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, Salazar probably didn't want to kill all the Muggleborn students, but rather incapacitate the suspicious ones for a time, and for that reason, made sure the basalisk knew not to look anyone /directly/ in the eye. Indirectly was fine as far as he was concerned. I mean, the coincidences are slightly ridiculous when you think about it. Justin Finch-Fletchley, Colin Creevey, Penelope Clearwater, Hermione Granger, and who knows who else from 1942, were /only/ petrified. Myrtle only just happened to open her stall door as the snake poked its head out, looking her dead in the eyes /by accident/. There is absolutely no way Riddle or the basalisk predicted she would poke her head out at that precise moment, meaning she died /completely by accident/. Well, not completely, as Riddle was likely /trying/ to get the Basalisk to kill the students, and getting increasingly frustrated when it refused to do more than petrify them. (This would be so funny, I wish I could hear one of their arguments.) Anyway, when someone has the gall to /break into the Chamber/, the basalisk probably thought that was a good reason to follow the order to "kill".

And the reason that the other Founders didn't like the Basalisk? Simple. /IT COULD KILL SOMEONE BY ACCIDENT/. Seriously Slytherin, how thick could you get? So anyway, that was my opinion of the basalisk. Thoughts?

** I think Hermione is worshipped more than she deserves. Sure, she is knowledgable, she is a problem-solver and she is helpful, as in most of her criticisms come from a good place, but she is still criticising other people. From the get-go she is bossy and nagging, at times also controlling. She is dismissive of her friends, and Ron in particular, hence why I don't get how they're supposed to fit together. Like how she ignored his concern for his pets, she waves off his suggestions and ideas almost before he finishes speaking. She is even dismissive of the joke products that Fred and George make, and I can't see her being too happy about Ron working in the joke shop as an adult. She is constantly telling others what to do, even what to say, as she does to Ron /very/ frequently - even when it's not her place to do so. Ron doesn't need a mother - he already has one. She jumps down Ron's throat for being blunt, but has no trouble being rude to others, as we see throughout the series, and very notably in Philosopher's Stone, where she is just as blunt as Ron - at least. And don't get me started on the dozens of examples of her condescending attitude, and the impatience she shows to those who don't pick up on things as quickly as her, whether it is logical deductions outside of school or academic knowledge.

That's not even starting on her physically assaulting Ron, kidnapping a person and keeping it hostage, permanently disfiguring a teenager's face, and sending a person to manslaugher or rape by centaurs. Some of these might have deserved it, but Ron certainly did not deserve her attacking him because she couldn't control her own jealousy!

And Ron gets more hate than he deserves. He has bad sides, true; he is jealous and insecure, and he is blunt - at times rude. But people tend to view his bluntness as him being downright evil. For instance, the moment before Hermione hides in the toilets in Philosopher's Stone: He is venting his frustrations to his friend after being criticised and humiliated in class, but lots of fans forget this, and accuse him of being downright mean to Hermione for saying something he never intended her to hear. But because she cries easily, she gets the sympathy. And because Ron doesn't cry, people assume her scornful comments don't hurt him.

I'm also very sad that his strategic and planning skills, which we see on the chess table in Philosopher's Stone, is not taken advantage of more. It has so much potential.

  Like how she ignored his concern for his pets, she waves off his suggestions and ideas almost before he finishes speaking.
#+end_quote

Is that why she was described as tearfully saying she was sorry when Crookshanks attacked Scabbers and Ron was screaming at her. Also, after Crookshanks attacked Scabbers in the boys' dormitory, she decided to shut him in the girls' dorm, so she obviously did listen to Ron.

#+begin_quote
  She is even dismissive of the joke products that Fred and George make
#+end_quote

When? All I can remember is her being mad that they were testing potentially lethal products on eleven year olds. I don't know about you, but I consider that a good thing.

#+begin_quote
  That's not even starting on her physically assaulting Ron
#+end_quote

Didn't Ron physically assault Ginny and Demelza?

#+begin_quote
  kidnapping a person and keeping it hostage, permanently disfiguring a teenager's face

#+begin_quote
  He is venting his frustrations to his friend after being criticised and humiliated in class
#+end_quote

Then why is he shown to talk about Luna and Neville behind their backs? They've never done anything to him, but he calls Luna "Loony" multiple times, says Neville is pathetic more than once, and even laughs at Neville when he was jinxed by Malfoy (to be fair, every Gryffindor besides Hermione, who undid the jinx, was laughing at him, but it was still horrible to do). Honestly, Ron seems to enjoy insulting people when they can't hear.

#+begin_quote
  But because she cries easily, she gets the sympathy. And because Ron doesn't cry, people assume her scornful comments don't hurt him.
#+end_quote

Or maybe because her "insults" were unintended and she was just trying to help, while his insults were intended to put her down?

#+begin_quote
  I'm also very sad that his strategic and planning skills, which we see on the chess table in Philosopher's Stone, is not taken advantage of more. It has so much potential.

Chess isn't indicative of strategic ability. There's a reason chess grandmasters aren't war generals.

#+end_quote

This happens /after/ Scabbers is believed to have been eaten. Early on, Hermione waves off Ron's concerns because Crookshanks will be sleeping in her dormitory and Scabbers will be sleeping in Ron's.

This takes place several months before the final row--after several heated arguments.

#+begin_quote

In the fifth book, Hermione says that all that Fred and George know is "flashy stuff," not "proper magic."

It's not until Hermione sees the creation of daydream charms that she begins to actively praise their talents.

#+begin_quote
  Didn't Ron physically assault Ginny and Demelza?
#+end_quote

Demelza's fat lip was legitimately an accident. Ron was overzealous in his Keeping and hit her when his aim was off.

Ron doesn't hit people when he's upset. He yells. He does make Demelza cry, but he never hits her. He doesn't even hit Ginny, though in their fiercest argument they are nearly ready to start hexing one another.

#+begin_quote
  Weren't Harry and Ron both gleeful in those two situations?
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "gleeful" at all. Vindictive yes, but not gleeful.

And bear in mind, Marietta in particular had sold them all out to Umbridge.

Ron would have had the exact same justification--his father works at the Ministry just like Marietta's mother--but he did not betray the DA.

#+begin_quote
  Then why is he shown to talk about Luna and Neville behind their backs?

  They've never done anything to him, but he calls Luna "Loony" multiple times,
#+end_quote

I only remember Ron calling Luna "Loony" once, in /Half-Blood Prince./

Everyone is mean to Luna in /Order of the Phoenix,/ but Ron's nowhere near as bad as Hermione, who actively argues with her.

And Ron's the only one, other than Harry, who actively compliments Luna. He sincerely enjoyed her Quidditch commentary--however funny it was.

#+begin_quote
  says Neville is pathetic more than once
#+end_quote

In the most notable context that he can't believe Neville got a date to the Yule Ball before he did.

#+begin_quote
  even laughs at Neville when he was jinxed by Malfoy (to be fair, every Gryffindor besides Hermione, who undid the jinx, was laughing at him, but it was still horrible to do).

Hermione may have been "trying to help," but she's also showing off.

Ron was struggling--with a mismatched, damaged wand no less--and he feels, not unreasonably, that Hermione is showing him up.

No, it wasn't. I looked through PoA, and it was after Crookshanks jumped out of her arms and started attacking Scabbers.

#+begin_quote
  But she also brings Crookshanks up at Christmastime in the first place, even after Ron asked her not to.
#+end_quote

Because it was around the start of the year when she promised to lock him in the girls' dormitory. She was sure he had learned his lesson by then. Also, why can't Ron not bring his pet? He expected Hermione to do it, so it's only fair if he keeps Scabbers in his dorm the first time Hermione brings Crookshanks out.

Isn't she right though? It was in response to Harry asking why they only got 3 O.W.L.s, so saying that they only know flashy magic that has no real use isn't wrong.

I think how much Hermione and Luna actually argue is overplayed in the fandom way too much.

After that, Hermione avoids the topic and they seem to become friends, with Luna comforting Hermione in HBP and Hermione being distraught at the possibility of Luna being dead. When the portrait of Phineas Nigellus calls Luna an oddity, she even defends Luna.

Ron, on the other hand, frequently implies that Luna is insane, and even snaps at her a few times in OotP. He never defends Luna, and Luna even admits that he's quite rude.

#+begin_quote
  And Ron's the only one, other than Harry, who actively compliments Luna. He sincerely enjoyed her Quidditch commentary--however funny it was.

Fred and George don't get good marks because they're not focused on schooling. But this isn't an indication that they /can't/ do more complex magic. It's entirely possible their poor marks are from the written exam, rather than the practical exam.

Besides which, their own joke shop aside, there's plenty of jobs that don't require specialized training.

This is a legitimate point. I had forgotten that Ron actually did throw a spell at Ginny.

She sent birds at Ron and then later physically punches him several times in /Deathly Hallows./

While the fandom probably does overplay it, Hermione and Luna argue more than once.

The first time they meet, Hermione says /The Quibbler/ is a load of rubbish and when Luna says that her father's the editor, Hermione gives the lamest, most unbelievable apology imaginable.

Outside the Herbology greenhouses, Hermione butts into Luna's conversation to say that the people who don't think Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are correct. This undermines Luna's argument that she believes Harry about Voldemort returning, and when Harry confronts Hermione on this, Hermione says that they can do /better/ than Luna.

Luna has never wronged Hermione but Hermione thinks that her value as a person is lesser.

In the Hog's Head, Hermione interrupts Luna about heliopaths, when it is completely unnecessary to do so.

Even after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Hermione has to actively stop herself from saying Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are not real when Luna mentions she and her father are going on holiday to hunt for them.

Luna had to *risk her life* before Hermione would agree to disagree.

Right after Ron tells Neville to stand up for himself, Neville takes on Crabbe and Goyle while Ron fights Malfoy. Neville saved Ron's neck.

It's war. Hermione can't afford to be choosy about allies. Especially when the government has aligned itself with the most prominent piece of media.

And she said, and I quote, "Harry, you can do /better/ than her. Ginny's told me all about her. Apparently, the only way she'll believe in something if there's no evidence whatsoever."

How do you know that? All we know is that Ron was doing it all wrong, and she told him the correct wand movement and pronunciation. She only "showed off" and cast the spell when Ron challenged her to do it.

An integral part of Hermione's character is her need to help people, even if she goes about it the wrong way. For example, while everyone else laughed at Neville because he was jinxed, she rushed to perform the counter-jinx on him. There are multiple other scenarios where this behavior of hers becomes clearer (while everyone else avoided Neville in PoA, she helped him out, while nobody else cared about House Elves, she campaigned for them to be free, etc.)

I think you're using Ron's interpretation of her as fact, while it really isn't. He felt embarrassed because nobody wants to be told they're doing something wrong (especially eleven year olds), and he reacted aggressively in response.

Even if people weren't aware that Voldemort hadn't returned, that's not necessarily the same thing as there not being sides.

Arthur Weasley's Muggle Protection Act was vehemently opposed by Lucius Malfoy, who had Fudge in his pocket and the school governors wrapped around his finger.

So if Dumbledore says Voldemort is back--and he led the fight against Voldemort last time and was the only one Voldemort ever feared--and Lucius Malfoy's stooge Fudge says no...well, I'm willing to side with Dumbledore even if I'm stuck with the conspiracy theorist.

****** Her apology happens very late in the book.:

“Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers...” she sobbed. -- POA chapter 15.

There is no indication of any apology from her before then.

She brings Crookshanks into their dormitory on Christmas morning. That's the end of first term, not at the beginning of the school year. That was in the boys' dormitory. Do you mean that Ron is supposed to /not/ have Scabbers in his own dormitory?:

Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck. -- POA chapter 11

How is inventing spells and potions not doing "proper" magic? What is proper magic anyway? Only magic that comes from a book? Useful or not, not everything has to be useful. And who says humour isn't useful? Like Harry says when he gives Fred and George the money from the Tournament, "I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs." Against someone like Umbridge I daresay puking pastilles are very useful.

The fact that Harry and Ron side with Hermione against Marietta doesn't excuse Hermione's decision to put that curse on the contract. She could have chosen to find something that simply prevents them from telling, like a secrecy charm, but she chose a vindictive route.

Ron calls Luna "Loony" /twice/ on OOTP (and the latter was after he was attacked by brains and was in a weird mental state), and we also hear Harry call her that in his internal dialogue and once verbally, and Ginny and Neville also use it once.

As for Rons' attitude on Luna, pointing out that someone provides entertainment is not cruel. He's not mocking her.

The deal with Hermione correcting Ron, while good intentions and all, is unsolicited advice, and she makes herself come off as superior as a classmate who is supposed to be equal to him in status. It is not her place or responsibility to correct him, especially when he did not ask for it.

"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill."You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long." -- PS chapter 10

She is picking on him for being wroing; she is criticising him. As the OED defines criticism as "the passing unfavourable judgement; faultfinding, censure", it is not mere correction or feedback that she's giving him. Her snapping tone just further emphasises that effect. I don't blame Ron for getting defensive.

*** I agree. Don't get me wrong I like Hermione, as she is in canon, but the worship she gets irritates me no end. I've been listening to the series again recently, and some more things that she does stand out to me as either being a bad friend to Harry or having ‘The road to hell paved with good intentions'. For example, the whole Firebolt issue in POA, she betrayed Harry's trust by going behind his back, well intentioned or no, that's still a betrayal of trust, and Harry is rightfully pissed off.

She actively puts the fear of god into the Hogwarts House Elves, by trying to make them accept clothes. Hermione is, to my mind woefully wrong about house elves, but she refuses to admit that she is wrong. I think that the House Elf situation is far more complex than simple slavery but it doesn't get discussed beyond ‘they like working'. I believe that Rowling made a misstep by both, basing the House Elves so closely on the Brownies (or Gruagaichean) of Scots Folklore, and having Hermione believe that it was almost a direct parallel to slavery. The Folklore Brownies aren't slaves and are in fact quite powerful and malevolent if they want to be, so it kind of obfuscates the point a bit.

Hermione is also really dispassionate towards Harry when he shouts down Lupin when he appears in Deathly Hallows. She whines about what he's saying, and the fact that he chased Lupin off without due consideration of why a Parent abandoning his young family, might be offensive to the Orphan whose parents sacrificed themselves for him. Harry was entirely in the right in that confrontation and hit the nail on the head, and Hermione acted like he wasn't. I do also think that Harry backs down from that position far more easily than it should be for him.

The attitude towards literal slavery in this sub is a bit horrifying. How is the House Elf situation any more complex than regular slavery?

-The magical economy has a serious problem with intellectual property. Unlike with physical objects, magic doesn't really help a lot with writing things, and the much smaller population means both less people producing intellectual property and less people consuming so less copies sold. This means that books are crazy expensive, authors still don't make a lot of money (even star author Lockhart was now near JK Rowling rich), there's a very small number of new important works produced.

He makes little real effort to take control of his own fate (there are good reasons for that, but it's still true). Things happen /to/ Harry. He's a pretty good example of a character who was just living his life until the plot hits him, but it takes him a really long time to accept that the plot is happening to him and to /do/ something about it (I think this is why Order of Phoenix was such a divisive book, where Harry is trying so hard not to be involved with all of this mess until it's utterly clear he can't just sit on his ass anymore.) Even in HBP, he's still trying to be as normal as possible. There's a reason so many fics have Harry deciding to take the reins in his own life much earlier than we see in canon.

On the same token, a bland protagonist can be a great vehicle in YA fiction to allow young readers to imagine themselves in the protagonist's place. More mature audiences just want more.

The most cunning thing he ever did was lie to Snape about the book (/Roonil Wazlib),/ his greatest ambition was to be a normal boy, and he has absolutely no sense of self-preservation at all.

Book 3 it was about his struggles to find his place next to Thalia when the prophecy is in the horizon. As well as realizing his feelings for Annabeth. Annabeth held the weight of.the world longer than him and his big moment was just held the sky for a bit so Artemis could do everything.

Book 4 seems you have no trouble with.

Book 5 the focus is on Luke decision. There is a variety of heroes there. Clarisse gets the spotlight at a moment, then Nico. Then Thalia appears. The one who recognizes how to solve the prophecy is Annabeth. Percy is strong because of the curse he overtook, buy his part in the end is just listenening to Annabeth.

His fatal flaw was unexploited, I'll give you that's expected a conflict with Frank throughout all the second series, a decision it never came to be.

****** Book 1 - Percy did everything besides Annabeth recognizing Medusa, calculating their fall, and distracting Cerberus with a ball. Grover and Annabeth could honestly be replaced by two random people and the book would still be the same.

Book 2 - Although Clarisse was technically the hero, Percy did almost all of the work. Clarisse was just given the Golden Fleece and told to go back to camp. Even she thought Percy should have been the one to be recognized as the hero since she did nothing.

Book 3 - I honestly forgot everything about it.

Book 5 - There are a variety of heroes, but Percy is much more important than the rest, because of the Curse of Achilles, the fact that he's the best swordfighter in 300 years, and that he's the son of one of the Big Three.

I think that Percy was just so effortlessly perfect, especially compared to his love interest Annabeth. She was constantly rude in every book, she had a crush on the guy who resurrected the major antagonist, didn't tell Percy that she thought either Luke or him would die, refused to kill Luke when he offered her a chance, and had so much more that was wrong with her. Grover, his other sidekick, also had a multitude of flaws that he had. Percy, unlike his friends, was just so perfect and all of his "character development" felt so contrived in my opinion.

******* Dude. As daughter of Athena, Annabeth contribution was supposed to be not only in doing things but in sharing the right info. And you are forgetting a bunch of stuff.

In the bus is Annabeth's Cap what makes Percy go beyond the furies. In medusa Grover distracts Medusa and afterwards gets them the money for the train. St Louis is no victory for Percy as he doesn't defeat the bad guy but escapes falling from the arc. In Denver, Grover saves Percy and Annabeth both from a massive crash. And of course Percy was to have the bigger physical role, as stated he was the son of big three and the quest was his.

Percy didn't take Clarisse to Polyphemus island. She got there by herself and actually was her boat what saved Percy and Annabeth from drowning early on. Clarisse wasn't there for Luke, that was a side quest as Clarisse had already fulfilled her mission.

Percy might be the strongest in book 5 but strength was irrelevant at the end. At the end was Annabeth solving the puzzle what saved the day

** I absolutely love Slytherin Politics in fanfiction. I love the idea of all of these (mostly) pureblood children fighting amongst themselves to be the top of the food chain. Well, not exactly fighting, but either first using politics and then moving toward duelling if it comes to that. I love the idea that in most fics, that third year is generally understood as the year when the students make their first political moves and whatever things they did the first two years are generally ignored unless it was huge. I love the idea of the Slytherin Court, and that each Hogwarts generation has a King or Queen that more or less controls the whole House. I don't care if this will never work in canon, but I am sticking by my belief that this is the most wicked thing someone's ever created.

***** There is a part of me that was just always rather uncomfortable with the previous hero worship, especially because it goes from hero worship to girlfriend material with no discernible growth or change (that may just be because she's not a main character so that's all off-screen). Especially given that Harry literally saved her life in the Chamber of Secrets, that seems the kind of thing that would make it worse not better. It just nags at me like a splinter under the skin. I was just never wholly convinced that wasn't an element of her attraction to him, which kind of makes the whole foundation of the relationship suspect in my mind. And if that sounds like I'm attributing maliciousness to Ginny's motivations, I don't think that at all. I just fundamentally question building a relationship together that young of such questionable foundations. I'd be a lot happier with it if they went their own ways for a few years then reconnected later, but that's pretty clearly not what happens.

That said, I'm aware it's a quibble. As I pointed out earlier, you can totally give it the benefit of the doubt and assume she had that growth off-screen, in which case Hinny is one of the only healthy romantic relationships depicted. It just felt like something Ginny and Harry /thought they should want/ rather than something they /actually wanted/, at least for me.

The author writing such a fic has to effectively construct a character that starts as a copy of them but has character development driven by the events in the world, character development which does not happen to the author writing it. Also the author needs to construct details about the world not known to the SI character in order to have a world with more going on in it than just what the character sees.

And first of all yes every character has flaws just like every human but as humans it's our job to work past and with those flaws to not be pieces of human garbage (like Ron).

He is shown as a lazy, irresponsible, jealous, and overall cruel person and far too many people ignore this because he's supposedly the most realistic character.

As far as I can tell he had less than ten redeeming moments in the story and that's off the top of my head.

Not only all of this but his most prominent characteristic is his jealousy something I understand he wants to outgrow his brothers shadows... But he never takes any steps to do so instead of at least try to be academically inclined or find something he's good at he fantasizes about quidditch and chess.

Now I read a story I don't remember the name sorry but it had harry going to durmstrang and it was amazing at the school he of course meets Victor crumb and we find that because Victor's real talent and real dream is to be a quidditch player professionally he is constantly working out and practicing over and over again.

And that's what ronald should be doing if he really wants to get out from his brothers not sit around doing nothing and being lazy or betraying harry because he got jealous of something harry never wanted.

** This is a rant-slash-list about all the things various fanfictions get wrong (Please note that if you make it clear that this is different from canon and is what you want to do anyway, this does not apply)

As far as we can infer from the books, Vernon Dursley never hit Harry. Never. Harry was abused, yes, physically and emotionally, but there were never any beatings. Never any belts. This does not change the fact that the Dursleys should be thrown in Azkaban until they're old and grey. Just. Explain that the abuse is worse if u want to do belt scars n shit.

Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard who cared, first and foremost, for the defeat of Voldemort, and second, if you can believe it, for Harry's safety. I do not believe that he even suspected Harry was a Horcrux when he laid him at Privet Drive. (Also, who does that?!? Leaving a baby on a doorstep? At night??! Also, McGonagall?? You LEFT?!) Anyway, through Harry's first and second year at Hogwarts he slowly picks up the clues to the fact that Harry is a Horcrux. He only figures this out, however, at the end of Harry's second year when he is given the mangled diary. He is very very worried at this point. He was originally trying not to get too close to Harry in case he lost him to Voldemort (given that Voldemort believes in the prophecy), but now he is even more frantically trying not to care- and failing- because Harry actually has to die for Voldemort to ever be truly defeated. He's been robbed of any real childhood he might have had because Dumbledore put his safety above his happiness on the Things That Are Important List, and now he has to die. Then, in GoF, he finds out that Voldemort used Harry's blood. Essentially meaning that if he gives himself up, lets himself be killed, he won't have to die. He'll have a choice. So now all Dumbledore has to do is make Harry believe he has to die. He did, in fact, care about Harry's safety. He took away Harry's childhood because he figured it was better than being dead. This is why I hate fanfictions where Dumbledore Doesn't Care At All.

Amortentia, contrary to what seems to be the belief of at least half fanfiction writers, does not smell like what your crush's Amortentia smells like! I cannot tell you the amount of fanfics I've read where somebody who has a crush on Harry smells treacle tart and the woody smell of a broomstick handle in Amortentia. If you have a crush on someone, you are likely to smell their cologne/perfume/shampoo and/or another thing they smell of that attracts you. You only smell something in Amortentia if /you/ find that smell to be powerfully alluring. /You/. Not your crush. Also, Amortentia's effects are not negated by the presence of real feelings. Said feelings would probably result in less of a change in the victim's behaviour and/or mental state, but that's it. Judging by Ron's behaviour, what it does is infatuates you with the subject, which prompts you to think about the subject's positive attributes, /incessantly/. Your mind latches on to the seemingly logical conclusion that you are in love with this person, and you act - wait for it - /exactly/ as you would act if you had just figured out you were in love with this person for real. (Possibilities include (but are not limited to) pining, moping, telling friends, trying to ask them out.)

Pepper-Up Potion is used to cure colds and flu. That is all Pepper-Up Potion can be used for, unless of course somebody just wants to prank their coworker by making steam come out of their ears. Please stop using it as coffee. You have Invigoration Draught for that. Thank you.

Veritaserum can be countered with Occlumency. It also only forces the drinker to tell what they /think/ the truth is. This is why it is not used in court. Veritaserum is not infallible. Thank you.

Pensieve memories are also not infallible. There is very little reason for anyone to tamper with memories in canon, but it is possible and therefore Pensieves are not used in court.

Occlumency is the art of protecting your mind from potential invaders. Legilimency is the art of invading a mind. An Occlumens is someone who is accomplished in the art of Occlumency. A Legilimens is someone who is accomplished in the art of Legilimency. 'Legilimens' can be used as an incantation to accomplish Legilimency. There is no such incantation for Occlumency.

There are no compulsion spells whatsoever on the Gaunt Ring or the diary. There aren't. Ginny chose to write in the diary of her own accord. Also, the only reason Riddle was able to posess her was because she became emotionally invested in the diary. And yes, Dumbledore really was that stupid. He let his excitement at finding the Ressurection Stone rule his actions. There is also no reaction in Harry's scar from being close to Horcruxes. He can't tell when a Horcrux is close to him or when one has been destroyed unless he's using his eyes to determine such. There is no magic that can return a map of where fragments of a certain soul reside. If there was, Dumbledore would have used it. There is no way to remove a piece of foreign soul from a living being other than by killing it. If there was, Dumbledore would have used it.

The Dark Mark is red. The Dark Mark turns black only when someone touches it and it burns. End of story.

Voldemort does not 'hug' Draco Malfoy. That whole scene in the movie never happened. McGonagall was the one to scream "NO!". Voldemort makes a spectacle out of Neville. Harry pulls the Cloak over himself from where he is lying on the ground before the fight resumes. He does not immediately reveal that he is alive when he decides to take action again.

Severus Snape does not hug Lily Potter's body. There is no indication of any such frankly creepy behaviour in canon.

Harry survives because Voldemort used his blood to make his new body. No other reason. The whole 'it worked because of your sacrifice' thing merits Deep Thought, the result of which for me was the idea that there was some connection between Lily's sacrifice and Harry's, but essentially Voldemort turned himself into an anchor to the mortal world for Harry. The whole Master of Death thing is possible, but unlikely and (in canon) unnecessary to Harry's survival.

Regulus Black was born on June 25, 1961. Always assuming he started Hogwarts after his eleventh and before his twelfth birthday, he left Hogwarts in 1979. Judging from the comment on Regulus's death being recorded "some fifteen years ago" in 1995, Regulus died in 1980. Therefore, the latest it could have happened is December 31, 1980. Do with that what you will.

Time Turners create time loops. They allow people to go back in time to do things that /already happened/ the first time around, but that they *still need to do* because the /first/ time it happened, it was accomplished by their *future* selves coming back to when their *present* selves were, and the /second/ time it happened, it was accomplished by their *present* selves going back to when their *past* selves were. Your perception of what was happening the first time /will always/ add up with what your future self was doing in the background. ---------------------------------- It is possible that there are other types of Time Turners, or time magic in general, that can actually *change* the past rather than just /reinforcing/ the past that had already happened but that the user of the Time-Turner hadn't lived yet, but the author of any fanfiction depicting/utilising such objects should explain how they work and how they will be used, i.e. one of the following: travelling back in time & creating an alternate reality*,* travelling forward in time & going back with information that will create an alternate reality*,* travelling back in time & going back without creating an alternate reality*,* travelling forward in time & going back without creating an alternate reality with the information gathered (whether by lack of information or a simple refusal to mess with time)*,* any of the above by becoming your younger/older self*,* going forward/back in time & staying there without creating an alternate reality*,* /or/ (off topic but not really) going forward/backward in time while maintaining the circular logic of a Time Turner. There hasn't actually been a whole lot of fanfictions that got this wrong, I just wanted to point out that if anything is going to /change/ because of time travel, you need a different method than a Time-Turner.

The walls of the Triwizard maze do not, in fact, move.

There is at no point any indication in the books that the different Houses wear different coloured accents on their robes, or that they even have ties, much less different coloured ones for each House. This is undesstandable, given that shirts and ties would distinctly qualify as "Muggle clothing".

If your story takes place during Harry's Hogwarts years, you're in the '90s. Unless you want to make up imaginary developments in society, or make it clear that the Wizarding World is farther ahead than the Muggle one in terms of acceptance due to the lack of Christianity stigma, then so far only one anti-gay law has been reformed (1967) and the rest are being policed more aggressively. There is still a lot of homophobia in the '90s, so unless you want to make it very clear that it's different in the Wizarding World, or just different in your story's '90s in general, try to incorporate that lack of openly gay people into the story, with perhaps a few couples who are afraid to come out. If you want to skip ahead to when it's completely decriminalised, that would be sometime 2013. Also, any music you want to incorporate into the storyline as something the characters know should be already released at the time of the first mention in the story (unless it's an AU where one of the characters wrote it).

*** Cont.[max characters]

Severus Snape loved Lily Evans. He never stopped loving Lily Evans. You can bash him all you want, I don't care, he /was/ an evil bastard who just so happened to owe his loyalty to the side that's trying to take down the side that killed Lily Evans. He was a shit teacher who threatened to poison Neville's toad and insulted Hermione's teeth. But he loved Lily. There were plenty of Death Eaters who didn't /really/ believe in the "Cause", and he was one of them.

The Room of Requirement *cannot give its occupants food*.

Nobody calls Harry the "Chosen One" until /after/ the fight in the Department of Mysteries.

Wizards are, in fact, familiar with lifts /(honestly how you forget that there are lifts in the literal Ministry of Magic I have no idea)/ and cars /(again, the Ministry of Magic have cars)/.

/Silencio/ is a charm that silences an object, animal or person. It makes that object, animal or person incapable of making noise. It is not a warding spell that you can erect around you and your friends so that no-one can hear you. The only such spell that is ever mentioned in canon is /Muffliato/.

/Stupefy/, when cast correctly, instantly /knocks out/ the person or animal it hits. It does not freeze them in place, leave a bruise, or do anything else. It just /knocks them out/. It also does not "wear off", if somebody comes to after being hit with a Stupefy it is nothing more or less than having /come to/ after being /knocked out/. Lastly, the counter-spell for /Stupefy/ is /Rennervate/, not "Enervate".

/Petrificus Totalus/, when cast correctly and when physically possible, sticks the victim's arms to their sides and sticks their legs together. If such a task is not physically possible, it will simply freeze the victim in place. Also, it's /Petrificus Totalus/, not "Petrificus Totalis" or any other variation.

It's "Hogsmeade", not "Hogsmead".

Apparition, *no matter what species does it*, is /always/ accompanied by a loud /CRACK/. There is /no incantation/ for Apparition.

The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets opens *thus*: 1) You hiss /"open"/ in Parseltongue to the hot tap on the one sink in front of Myrtle's toilet. The sink sinks out of sight, revealing a pipe. /That is the only thing that happens to a sink in the opening of the Chamber./ 2) You slide down the pipe and get to a tunnel. You walk the length of the tunnel and come across the real door. This is a double door made of stone, decorated with two large snakes with rubies for eyes, one on each half of the door. This opens to the Parseltongue for /"open/", too. 3) Once inside the Chamber of Secrets, you see that it is decorated by pillars, and there is a giant statue of Salazar Slytherin at the back. The statue of Salazar Slytherin is dressed in long, flowing stone robes. You can barely see his head, all the way up near the ceiling, shrouded in dim light. When you say /"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four"/ in Parseltongue, his mouth opens and the basalisk comes out.

A Parselmouth is someone who can speak Parseltongue instinctively. Parseltongue is the language used to commune with snakes. Please, /please/ stop mixing them up. /Please./

Wizarding chess, contrary to what seems to be popular belief, does not have the pieces /break/ each other. They bang each other over the head, yes, they knock each other out, yes, but they do not actually reduce each other to rubble. If this was the case, it would be impossible to play more than one game with any single chess set. Once the chess piece is unconscious, the piece that knocked it out drags it off the edge of the board before returning to its square on the board. This is described at /least/ twice during the Philosopher's Stone.

To American fanfiction writers: I ask you to please try to get hold of the original versions of the books and base your language on the language used in them, or if not, to put an alert at the top of the story that it uses American English rather than British English.

Just look how modern societies "investigate" murders by Nazis and you got your answer. Politicians use every resource they can to prevent people from believing the far-right is active, organized and murdering, and that includes shutting down or impeding investigations. The worst example of this is the German NSU murder series which was treated by blaming the victims for allegedly being involved in gang activity, while far-right terrorism was fast shut down. It only came to light when the two dudes of the trio shot each other and set their van on fire.

*** 1. Harry Potter is more of a soft magic system I don't think it's bad. But considering there was alot more combat in the last few books I think more focus on combat focused magic could have been useful.

2. I do think if Harry's classmates had been more integrated with the plot things could have been better. The last book especially would be more intense since you'd be invested in so many more characters. You'd see more arcs pay off.

3. I'm not entirely sure what you mean here I usually see white washing in context of putting white actors in roles that would be better suited to someone not white.

4. Hated the ending because of Pettigrew getting away? Because of time travel? Because Lupin left?

5. No investigation was because of ministry corruption so if you hate that plot I can see why this frustrates you but I don't think it's inherently bad.

6. I actually also hate how the romance was handled

7. I mean its kind of true but they are 11. They may tire out quicker. But when you are 16 or 17...ya that's true.

And I dont see anything wrong with the time travel in the story I personally liked it. But alot of people get frustrated because its conviently not used again or they think time travel as a concept existing before the time turners get destroyed overcomplicates the world. Which I do sorta see where they are coming from. And some people just don't like time travel so maybe it's just that.

I'd have been happier if it was established that this was a common precedent since other students managed to take the same number if subjects as Hermione. I have trouble believing, in hindsight, that the time turner was even necessary for Hermione to take all the classes in the first place.

** Other comments from me:

Ron isn't a good strategist. He is good at /chess/ in particular, but we are never given any evidence in canon that this talent in strategy ever extended outside of a chess set. It is usually Hermione who does the long-term thinking and planning for them, and Harry and Hermione take turns in making on-the-spot escapes. In fact, we see him lose his head during moments where creating and implementing a good strategy would have helped them most (eg. Malfoy Manor). Ron's talent in strategy /outside/ of chess is pretty much fanon at this point.

Harry isn't a good leader. He was practically the figurehead of the DA. He is a great instructor and teacher, but he didn't envision the DA nor did he manage any of the other DA-related affairs (eg. recruitment, opsec, communication, logistics etc.) outside of the teaching aspect. And when actually given the chance to lead in the Battle of the DoM, he failed utterly.

His leadership in the Horcrux Hunt was abysmal as well. He lost control of his members, did not manage to keep up morale, lost track of his goals, and did not manage either the planning stage before the hunt or the logistics management during. He has no mind for contingencies nor did he set their SOP's.

Harry was the leader because both Dumbledore and Voldemort set him so, but he actually has no talent for it outside of brief and one-time skirmishes.

*** Gonna have to agree to disagree with this. Just because the behavior would not have been "severe enough" for him to have been taken away, it can actually be /surprisingly difficult/ to have a child removed from an abusive situation. Especially one that doesn't leave obvious marks. I think you're undermining the massive and longterm emotional damage the kind of neglect and abuse Harry underwent can have. If your bar is "he was fed, clothed, and had a roof over his head," you've literally set it at the lowest standard of "care" there is.

I'd like to think social service would have raised eyebrows at the "bedroom" being under the stairs. With locks on the outside of it. But I don't disagree he wouldn't have been removed because putting him in the system probably wouldn't have been much better than being in the Dursleys, but that doesn't mean that their abuse wasn't significant.
