Not sure how to word this, but like all the Tumblr posts where a muggle-born goes to Hogwarts and is like 'why are you using quills here's a pen,' or 'harry shows up to the Second Task with scuba gear.

Basically a Golden Trio era fic with a muggle-born character that uses rational thinking


** I don't mind that fanfic authors have muggleborns bring pens to Hogwarts so much that I mind the narcissistic in-character author-praising circlejerk that necessarily seems to follow, as if bringing pens to Hogwarts is a wholly original concept which no fanfic author has ever thought of, before.

Replace pens with nearly any other muggle invention, and the formula appears to hold true.

** This one is next generation, but it's pretty inventive and good.

  Muggle-born witch Phoebe McDevitt just wanted her tea to stay warm during class. She didn't expect to accidentally start a spell-making craze among her classmates.[Oneshot. Next generation. Based off a Tumblr post, which I will link to in the notes.]

** Well, there is that bit in Goblet of Fire where Harry considers Summoning a scuba-diving set from the nearest muggle village. Although I have to question how he'd manage to summon something from ultra-long range like that.

I also saw a fanfic once where Hermione was writing with a muggle pen on paper instead of quill and parchment; Ron had to snatch her homework and toss it in the fire right before it exploded, because apparently the act of writing magic words down is just as magical as saying them and using the quill/parchment animal products helps to 'soak up' the magic. I don't remember what it was, though, it was a one-shot but I dunno if it was in a collection or not.

*** I've been in this fandom a long time and this is the first I've ever heard of a reason to prefer parchment over paper besides tradition. Pretty nifty actually.

**** I've seen it posited a few times that quills and parchment can more readily hold magic, such as anti-cheating charms, hence their use.
