Voldemort needs to he someone the main character interacts with on an at least semi-regular basis. Stories where he starts insane and becomes more sane throughout the story are also fine.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] - Voldemort won the first war and eventually spread his dominion to encompass the entire world. Has some interesting worldbuilding.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/chapters/17052891][No Glory]] - Voldemort detects the horcrux in Harry during their confrontation in the woods. He takes him captive rather than kill him. Harry is eventually surprised when Voldemort's methods of dealing with resistance to his rule turn out to be relatively bloodless and sane.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** *Caution - Self-promotion*

In the HP/Superman crossover series [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Yr 2]]) ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][Yr 3]]) ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][Yr 4]]), Voldie actually becomes /more/ sane as the series progresses due to how his Horcri work. When he takes over a living host, his soul uses the shredded soul of the victim to at least partially repair itself, also allowing him to pick up skills from his new hosts (such as knowledge of how to dress /fabulously/...).

He becomes so sane and calculating that he actually liberates and teams up with Gellert Grindlewald in the third story and although both of them do also plot how to stop the other in the event of the expected betrayal, they still form a villainous friendship on their road-trip around America (it makes sense in context...).

** Meant to Say by Kirinin - Truth potion gone wrong. Humurous at first. Draco, unable to lie, is brought to Voldemort later. Voldemort ends up finding Draco valuable. Fyi, Voldemort is entirely OOC at the end. Still a great story.

Fire Born by wickedlfairy17 - Mildly disturbing. Fem!MasterOfDeath!Harry, except Harry is cursed and has been reincarnated a ton of times. Also probably depressed. Voldemort is...well, he's a sociopath and can't feel most emotions, but he's otherwise sane? Story might be a bit disturbing though.

Eden by Araceil - Fairly dark story. Harry goes back in time, when muggles destroyed the world and wants to prevent that from happening by teaming with Voldemort. It's a dead story now, but still definitely worth the read. Only 19k words. Iirc, there are some slash tones from Voldemort, but it's only mentioned a couple times (Voldemort wondering how Harry knew him, what connection they had, and pondering if he's assexual like he thought). Don't let it turn you off, it's basically a gen fic, and I would still rec it.

There was also another story, but I can't find it. It involved Voldemort stopping time throughout the world because the muggles were beginning to wage nuclear war. Harry and Voldemort had to work to disarm all bombs before resuming time.

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.
