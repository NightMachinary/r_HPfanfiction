I thought a fic with the Hulk bringing Harry his Hogwarts letter would be priceless.

"Puny Potter is weakling wizard." Hulk snorted, explaining what was going on to the boy who was size of bird.

"But, Hulk, I can't be a wizard. I'm just Harry."

"Hulk not lie to puny boy. Boy is wizard." Hulk glared at Harry, who immediatly began nodding in agreement.

"We will not pay for the boy to go to learn from some crackpot fool!" Vernon unwisely whined.

"Dursley no insult Dumbles Man! Hulk smash Dursleys!" The Hulk roared in a rage, throwing his arms up and breaking apart the roof as he prepared to do exactly as he said he would.

****** In the comics Hulk doesn't have a standard size. His size is proportional to his anger. Therefore the angrier he gets, the larger he becomes. At his angriest Hulk weighs in at about 1,400 lbs, way larger than Hagrid, even though Hagrid is taller.

********* The Harry Potter wiki has his height listed as 11'6", though I think the source on it is a movie prop of Hagrid's Muggleborn Registration file... so it's slightly less canon than the movies themselves or the books ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_file][link]]).

** Could the Killing Curse kill Hulk? Or would it turn him back into Banner as some kind of survival instinct? Also would the Killing Curse kill Banner or turn him into the Hulk? (Similar to the situation he described in Avengers where he said he put a gun in his mouth but the “other guy” spit it out)

**** If we are talking comic Hulk then no, even if the Savage Hulk personality was killed off Banner has several others such as Joe Fix-It and Devil Hulk.

Interestingly there was a comic where everyone else on Earth was dead and eventually even Banner died so that the next time the Hulk transformed back he would die. The comic ended with him sitting and looking out at the ruins with the line: “Hulk lonely”

*** It depends on how the killing curses works. We think it works by ripping the soul from the body, then yes...probably.

There is something to consider, if the AK does not bypass magic resistance fully then it might not do anything or only hurt him in someway. There have been high god-tier level magic attacks and artifacts used on the Hulk that have just fulled his rage to smash the squishy magic user.

I am not sure about Banner because of how the two sides of the Hulk/Banner coin is mixed and variations of there overall power level. It could kill them or just be a delayed smashing.

**** That's an awesome answer. I would love to see this played out. At times hulk has been played as basically immortal depending on his power level so this would be an amazing thing to see. That being said; you mentioned god-tier attacks not hurting Hulk, but would the Killing Curse kill a god? Like Odin, Loki, or Thor? Or just hurt really bad? I think it could kill Superman as he has a weakness to magic, but who can say. Fun discussing this.

***** Thor and Odin, depends on what power level they are pushing as well. I am not as well read on them, but I think a AK might just force them to do one of their sleeping things. And by god-tier I was more so thinking “One Above All” level attacks. Thor and his bunch are more gods, not Gods.

********* The DE assaulting Asgard would be a slaughter on the DE side with out help. The Asgard's are just as good at magic as they are tech with the two pretty much being intertwined with each other and are thousand of years more experienced in using it and overall combat.

There is even a good possibility of Heimdall seeing them coming a world away and the Destroyer waiting to greet them when they get there.

I am not sure "mortal" HP magic could even get them there alone. There could be some way like a Artifact long lost, a enemy of the Asgardians aiding them, and such. Maybe parsel magic and something to do with Jormungand the world serpent.

**** I very much doubt the Killing Curse works by removing the target's soul, because we know something that does that in the Potterverse. Dementors. And their victims don't die.

We also know it leaves no visible physical injury (more subtle damage is possible- wizarding medicine might not be able to detect it).

My guess would be either some sort of "anti-life" effect where it shuts down or disrupts all energy and neurological activity in the body somehow (I think I've seen something like this in fanfic before), or just stopping the person's heart with magic (the former fits more with it being unsurvivable, though its possible that just very few wizards have ever learned CPR).

***** ...it is literally what the wiki speculates it does and has been the running thought for basically forever. There is enough supernatural/fantasy troops that could be added or twisted in if you really wanted to make anything a possibility past that.

As far as the Dementors and the AK both affecting the soul, a Dementor pulls the soul through the material plane into themselves while the AK push the soul into the Ethereal/void/in between. The AK could maybe be more powerful and magically advanced then then what a Dementor does. It's a flash of green light vs a much slower by comparison pulling of the soul through the mouth. A creators innate magic vs a spell created to do a certain task, it could make a world of difference.

The idea that there cannot be things that are similar in actions, but different in conclusion is very shortsighted, especially in a place where magic is a thing.

*** Well, the only precedent we have for the curse hitting two beings in one body is Harry/the Horcrux. So its likely that the curse would kill one, but not necessarily the other. Although Hulk and Banner might be more closely intertwined than Potter and the horcrux.
