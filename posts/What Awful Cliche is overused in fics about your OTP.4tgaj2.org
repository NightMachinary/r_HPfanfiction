I'll start. As a Harmony fan, I'm so sick of Weasley bashing. I don't think I've ever read a good H/Hr fic with Weasley bashing. It's just lazy and unimaginative, and also seems like a cheap way to add un-needed drama (especially when you have a ready made source of that in Ron's feeling of inadequacy when compared to Harry). What overused cliches plague your OTP?


** Ginny being mean to Harry for literally no reason, or worse, leaving her for a year to hunt horcruxes. It's childish to a ridiculous degree and it was made clear in canon that she understood. It serves only to give harry a pity party

*** Ginny had the trace, couldn't apparate, and would be a major liability on the Horcrux hunt.

At Hogwarts, she could drum up an army for Harry, and that was what she did.

Authors who wrote an angry Ginny after the war didn't really understand this character.

**** Being angry at Harry for having to go away for the year and leave her behind because of exactly what you said is a sign of an author who doesn't get the character.

Being angry at the world after the war because, well, war and dead brother? Makes sense, but is usually indicative of a crappy angstfest.

***** Speaking of losing Fred, it was bad. But how did the Weasleys fare vs other families, such as the Abotts, Blacks, Bones, Longbottoms, Potters, and all the Death Eater clans? I would say they survived the War in excellent condition. Furthermore, they brought war heroes #1,2 into the family. I expect them to actively and happily working for the future after a brief mourning, as opposed to those stupid angstfest in many fics.

****** Agree, I think they're a hardier bunch than people give them credit for, especially Molly, who people tend to make break down and never recover. In my fic, I had her grief being shown by dragging the rest of the family out on endless days out, meals together and so on, being over protective and over bearing but ultimately helping the family fake happiness and normality until it became natural.

In real life, people die, and people tend to surprise themselves with strength they didn't know they had. Yes, occasionally people never get over the loss of a loved one, but for the most part people do eventually move on. Just as she must have coped with the death of her brothers, so too would Molly cope with the death of her son.

*** I'm ok with the latter if it is done well and is plausible. Don't have Ginny be mad at Harry for leaving. But perhaps she can hold some resentment because of how bad she had it. Her brain knows why he left but her heart still has some anger at him over it all. That sort of thing.

Harry and Ginny acting hopelessly in love to the point they sound like different people when speaking to each other is my personal pet peeve. I want them together and I want there to be no doubt they are going to last, but a story needs to have some conflict and too often in these "after the battle" fics, there is just no conflict between the two.

**** Sorry, I appreciate what you mean, but I don't think it's plausible. Why would Ginny resent Harry for what she's been through? There's plenty of other people that would be far easier to blame. Sure they shouldn't plunge into sunshine and rainbows (they will both be grieving and recovering from trauma after all), but having believed Harry to be dead and then miraculously getting him back, I don't think Ginny would then start any conflict in their relationship. I think they would cling together in their time of grief, as per the HBP canon where she was his greatest source of comfort. I think this is why I'm not so keen on straight after the battle fics - there can rarely be conflict because the story is simply them grieving. Any problems in their relationship just seem trivial given the scale of what they have been through. If I thought my boyfriend had died, and then I had the chance to have him back, like a second chance, I think the most likely cause of conflict would be that I was too clingy and wouldn't let him out of my sight. I can't imagine blaming him for things that weren't his fault.

***** I don't really disagree with what you're saying in terms of what likely would have happened, what Rowling would write as canon if she decided to.

But I do think if she or any writer did have there be tension or resentment on the part of Ginny, I could see that as plausible, if unlikely. Like I said, it wouldn't be a logical reaction from Ginny, as Harry didn't torture her. He didn't actually abandon her as he had to leave. But remember, Ginny didn't know why Harry was leaving, what his his mission was. I would not be surprised if there were times when she was wondering why he couldn't come back to her. Or why she couldn't go with him. Surely she was safer with him than at Hogwarts, in her mind.

She wouldn't immediately resent him. But maybe several months later, when Harry tells her he's going to be an auror while she goes back to school, she could develop some resentment. Ginny spent a year away from him, not knowing if either of them would survive. And then they do, and have the chance to be together for an entire year, and Harry decides he'd rather train as an auror right away.

I'm certainly not saying Ginny actually would have felt this way, or that Harry should have gone back for his 7th year. But if someone wants to write the story that way, I wouldn't see it as totally unrealistic. I mean, I'm sure there is a writer out there somewhere that could tell that story and keep it realistic and incredibly engaging. Probably a writer that really captured Ginny in a previous story and is doing an awesome job showing Harry as an auror. That writer is out there somewhere.

****** I'm quite sure they had a long discussion about whether to go back to year 7. They pretty much staged a bloody revolution and overthrew the previous government. They must have reached a conclusion that Harry was absolutely needed in the new government to set the future straight, or else risked repeating past mistakes. On the other hand, Hogwarts was an important strategic asset too, and recruiting more graduates for their cause should be a key priority.

So, they agreed to split their forces.

******* So you're saying that after the war was won, they both decided that to ensure a promising future, Harry would join the Ministry and Ginny would go back to Hogwarts to recruit others to follow her and Harry's vision? I can see that as possible, although I think it's more likely that Ginny went back because she was simply not done with her schooling.

I think all these options are on the table and are plausible. It's just up to the author of the fic to decide how best to show an interesting relationship.

******** By the end of the war, it should be obvious that they had to assume those responsibilities whether they liked it or not. Shying away would give their enemies another chance and ruin everything they sacrificed so much for.

It's also quite obvious that although Harry was a very strong warrior, his magical education was quite unbalanced. Hermione and Ginny finishing their years at Hogwarts would serve the purpose of filling the gaps in Harry and Ron's skills later.

In the Cursed Child, Harry and Ginny seem to always do things together, and Harry never bothered to ask Ginny to stay behind. It leads me to believe that Ginny took part in many of Harry's auror missions.

Focusing on her Metamorph powers at all is completely ridiculous anyway. There's so many possibilities to change your looks with magic that it's hardly that important. I love Tonks for her fun loving, somewhat childish character and i hate it when people focus on her powers too much.

If you want to focus on Metamorphing write some PWP and be done with it.

The awful cliché is that Harry just needs to start applying himself and he'll shortly be up to Hermione's level, scholastically. As if a girlfriend and a couple months will undo five years of not paying attention. The author wants to show Harry increasing in magical ability and Hermione having a positive influence on him, I get it, but Hermione's been putting in a superhuman effort toward learning magic. And when it's done, Hermione becomes a useless character.

**** Like boomberrybella said, it's very unoriginal and just shows how the author tries to be so clever by including the actor names. The other consistent parent names I've seen are Helen and Richard. I like Helen because it's something I believe JKR would choose. (In the Greek myth Hermione is the daughter of Helen).

Actually I tend to be picky about any made up names in fanfic. Magical names used by JKR have a vibe and feeling to them, and I tend to see names that are very extreme (Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way) or too mundane. Names JKR chose seem to sound formal (Ronald, Theodore, Gregory, Vincent, Anthony, Zacharias, Millicent, Susan, Lavender) so anything that doesn't follow this pattern without reason seems jarring.

SS/HG - Much too relationship savvy Hermione. 18/19/20 year old Hermione can perfectly navigate around Snape's sour moods with the finesse of a woman who has ample experience in the relationship department.

DM/HG - Unreasonable Hermione. Hermione is often written as emotionally inflexible and highly argumentative and she often fights/argues with Draco through 80% of a fic.

**** But the hate happens without any of that canon stuff as baggage (written before the 6th book).

Also, a lot of the crux of Post Hogwarts/post DH fics is that Harry forgives (or at least doesn't completely blame) Draco for his role in the war as everything he did, he did under the threat of death for him and his family (extreme duress). He did lower his wand and might have accepted Dumbledore's help had Snape not arrived. He didn't identify the trio at Malfoy Manor when he obviously knew Ron and Hermione and likely Harry and he stopped Crabbe from outright killing Harry in the Room of Requirement. These actions, to me, doesn't line up with a nazi gung-ho about his cause. He would've killed Dumbledore on his own and definitely would've turned over the trio to Voldemort had that been the case.

Now if I was referring to Lucius Malfoy, on the other hand, I could definitely see problems all around with that relationship. But I'm referring to Draco, whom I like to call 'The Reluctant Death Eater' because he was.

Sure he talked the talk as a student but how many of us have parroted our parent's words and echoed their beliefs- right or wrong- because that's all we knew? Draco, like a lot of boys, looked up to his father and wanted to be like him. I've had a little kid tell me before they didn't like me because of the color of my skin and I know that was something they learned from their parents or heard their parents say because what would a 4.5 year old kid know about anything like that? Draco isn't different from that kid, really. So he may or may not have taken the mark willingly but once he did, I think he realized that wasn't the life for him and as shown by his actions/reactions in the rest of the series.

So there is some room for redemption for Draco written into canon and fic authors who pair him with Harry or Hermione, for example, explore that redemption.

So back to the comment, Ron doesn't have to ever like Draco, in fact, in a good number of fics he doesn't, but the Harry hate over a redeemed Draco is just often used as a reason to bash Ron.

I never liked the idea that metamorphs have a default. Sure, they have a prefered form, like others have their favorite hoodie, but they also have superhot lingerie, their workout outfit and their business suite - to stay with the analogy. And all of those forms would be them. If Tonks transforms into a beauty to rival any Veela, then that is still her. If she grows a belly so she can put a bowl of popcorn on it while watching the TV, its still her.

Accepting a metamorph, I would think, is accepting that your girl has an indefinite amount of different bodies at her disposal.

No, thank you. I need fics that provide actual character development, especially with Ginny, in order to make up for what may be lacking in the books.

Maybe it's because a lot of the fanfiction community has a severe allergic reaction to canon and fleshed out characters. Doesn't help that Romione and Harmony shippers despise each other and it most certainly shows in fics.

*** I've never really read a story where HG/RW are the focal point, but in terms of their relationship I've definitely seen them arguing being foreplay mentioned a bit too much.

*** The only cliche I really don't like is the deletion of Rons shortcoming the moment they get together.

Doesn't happen often, but sometimes you see it and I'm a bit sad that Ron's character is smothered out of the equation by Hermione.

** I don't like the concept of the deathly Hallows as in Canon\\
A wand that is supposed to be unbeatable if you're descended from the three brothers and have won it from the previous owner

A cloak that makes you invisible or supposed to (Moody's eye missus noris) The stone brings ghost /shades of your loved one's (given to harry so he can have a family moment before death

They were introduced waaaay to late in the series and have inconsistency and 2 of the 3 are not even relevant 2 99% of the series. idk I feel they are just cheap and were not needed at all in the book harry should have killed voldamort some other way

And that brings up another question was Dumbledore just powerful and experienced or was it the elder wand that made Dumbledore able to mach voldamort?

Because if it was just age and experience than the flemels should be the most powerful magic user's of the age thief 665 for merlins sake they created a form of immortality they should have been able to make voldamort piss himself in fear!
