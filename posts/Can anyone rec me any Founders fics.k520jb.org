Mainly looking for fics where Harry is transported back to the time of the Founders, he is a Founder's heir (Slytherin, in particular, though Gryffindor is fine), or where he is the reincarnation of a Founder (only Slytherin this time). I'd prefer that Harry being somehow involved with the Founders is a main plot point of the story.

Things that I *don't* want in the fic:

- Draco being a resurrected Founder, Gryffindor in particular (I've heard that's a thing)
- Harry/Hermione
- Salazar raising Harry

Things I'm cool with (though not a requirement):

- canon pairings
- Harry/Salazar
- cliche/overdone stuff
- alternate universe

My favourite fics in this category are:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896/chapters/5191223][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8317364/1/The-Founders-Four][The Founders Four]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697767/1/Founders-Heirs][Founders' Heirs]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255912/1/][Legacy]]

Please don't rec me the following fics (doesn't mean I don't like them, they've just been either recommended to me too much or they're not my favourite):

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20913215/chapters/49716056][Ouroboros]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of a Linear Circle - Part I]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22144981/chapters/52859977][The Same, But Different]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/2/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10756667/1/][Why to Sort a Student is a Horrible Job]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255912/1/][Legacy]]

Thank you for any recs you've got! I've been having trouble finding anything of this category. It feels like I've read it all.


** I think you're looking for linkffn *Strange Visitors From Another Century*\\
also by Izzyaro. It's great, reads fluent, keeps you in suspense, and includes the Golden Trio's wonderfully reproduced friendship.
