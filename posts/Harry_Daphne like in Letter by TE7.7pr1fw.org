*** If I'm understanding it correctly, they're talking about a fic called Letters, it's a Harry/Fleur pairing where they become pen pals before the Tri-Wizard tournament. There's minor amounts of Harry/Daphne in it where daphne is a confidently sexy character that is vying for Harry's affection over his infatuation with fleur. and I'm guessing OP wants more fics that explore those personality traits the characters have
