Hello

Again I`m searching for few fics

1) Harry is mage. Dumbledore and Ordel pushed him to fight alone in Hogsmeade. When Harry won he left WW, only returned when they took his daughter.

2) Harry open(?) another school under command command of Queen (?), Hogwart after few years stop getting muggleborns and most of half-bloods.

** 1)

There's a story that I can't remember the name of wherein: Auror Ron and Professor Hermione are assigned to "introduce" muggleborn to the Wizarding World. Harry's wife and daughter are home but he isn't. They refuse to attend Hogwarts and then the mother is obliviated. The daughter is kidnapped. The daughter has a magical protector of sorts and they're all trained shaman or something? Anyway, Harry comes home and goes to Hogwarts to get his daughter and winds up taking at least one other kidnapped muggleborn (maybe Dudley's daughter?).

*** I'm pretty sure I read this on fanficauthors.net but since that's the least searchable site ever I can't boil it down any further.
