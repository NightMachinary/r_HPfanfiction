Humans are the only magical creature with a non magical counterpart.

There are no non magical Giants or Merpeople

Only wizards and muggles have this distinction. Because humans are not magical naturally. Wizards are a product of cross breeding with magical creatures.

Upon this revelation Voldemort chooses to partner with those he believes to be truly superior. The non human magical creatures and those people call halfbreeds.


** A young boy, belittled, bullied and abused by the Muggles for his oddities as a child. Afraid of the supernatural and his blatant link to them. In time he comes to hate them for their small minds, hate their cruel taunts and the pain they bring. He hates Muggles. He's better than them, he was born with a gift, he would not let them dictate his life to him.

Then they came for him. HIS PEOPLE. People born with the same power within as he. Magic. Whisking him away to a world of flying broomsticks and magic wands, a place where he could finally fit in. The sights, the knowledge, everything he could have ever dreamed of but daren't. These wizards and witches, they and he were one in the same, they would understand, they would accept, he had finally found where he could be without judgement...

False.

No. No different.

These witches... these wizards... they were NO DIFFERENT.

Just as demeaning. Just as harsh. The same malice, the same cold disregard. The pain was the same, just inflicted differently. Their barbed words were new ones, but the intent and sting the same. Nothing had changed.

Well, something had changed. Perhaps. A realisation came to the boy as he looked upon the world he lived within, truly cementing as he was forced onto the scarlet train when the school closed its doors for the summer.

It wasn't a lack of magic that made the Muggles so despicable, it was the human condition. Predisposed to cruelty, to 'look the other way'. Wizards and witches were human also, fundamentally there was no difference between them. Take away the wands and robes and they were human. Human, cruel, ruthless, despicable, filthy, WEAK.

Thus he discovered the true target for his ire. Not the Muggles, the entire human race. And he discovered that he wanted nothing to do with them.

Thus was the day the Dark Lord was born. Not a conniving fool who cared for dominance of magic over those without it, nor the filth who tied their beings to such non-issues as 'blood purity'... but a shivering child, cowering in the damp who decreed,

"I don't want to be human."

*** Ive been thinking alot about this reply so I came up with 2 ideas

1. In order to become non human Voldemort chooses to be turned into something considered non humans by many wizards. So like a werewolf or a vampire. I lean more towards vampire than werewolf because greyback is already a werewolf who is pro werewolf and a death eater and Remus is a werewolf who is anti Death eater and I dont want to steal his thunder. And vampire fits Voldys asthetic more. Plus vampires arent expanded on in HP. Or at least not in the books so vampires and therefore voldy could be immortal or nortoriously hard to kill could be a plot point this would be alot more world building and the resulting story would be very different than canon. His rebellion would have many positives for the magical creature community and he would play politics not going too over the top his hatred of humans seemingly but still having it be there. And either eventually goes too over tne top and even the magical creatures realized that while they were appreciative if his initial efforts he was too far gone and needed to be stopped. Or...

He grows eventually to appreciate realizing that the policies in the society thst hurt non humans were were hurting many humans too and works with wizards and magical creatures to create a new reformed magical society.

1. If Voldemort chose to become non human by removing as much as he could of his soul till he no longer resembled a human while also assauging his fears of death. Other magical creatures have souls but not human ones. But picking apart his soul changed him warped him. The desire to do so was a sign of his instability to start with despite that some of his ideas of rights for magical creatures had been very good. Picking apart his soul hieghtened his fears and warped his logic till his motivations were much more driven by protecting his own life than his desire to abandon humanity and going to unethical lengths to do so. The overall story would resemble the canon books more but details would be different. The anti werewolf stuff would be less a thing when he took over for example. His life story would be a bit more tragic than canon and while Voldemort had become reprehensible Harry would have come to agree with many of young Tom Riddles issues involving the flaws of wizarding society and muggle society though his conclusion wouldnt be humanity sucks and hed spend the years after the death of Voldy trying to reform wizarding society.

**** My mind immediately leaped to the first one whilst writing. I imagined a Tom Riddle who (maybe not purposefully) is bitten by a werewolf and told he has lycanthropy and he celebrates.

And I like the idea of Voldie playing politics more, perhaps making it morally ambiguous to stand against him. Voldemort 'stood for a downtrodden underclass' and used methods extreme methods at times to have their voices heard. Or that would be the narrative, but he was infact unleashing giants, werewolves, Dementors etc. on the public to show their dominance and feed his hatred of humanity.

Imagine the Ministry AFTER his defeat. Anti-creature sentiment would be high, people like Umbridge would feel vindicated and having Hagrid, Flitwick and Firenze at Hogwarts would be massively controversial. Hermione's attempts with S.P.E.W. would be likened to Voldemort's own agenda back in the day and would lead to some very hard questions. Eventually leading to people having to admit that not everything Voldemort said (whether he believed it or was just using it to gain allies) was necessarily wrong. Non-humans do need representation, are deserving of rights etc.

And it would be VERY interesting to see how the Order of the Phoenix and Death Eaters shape up in this new world. Obviously Greyback would still be with Voldemort but how many of the original Death Eaters would actually throw their lot in behind a man fighting against humanity itself? How many Death Eaters would have actually ended up in the Order in this AU?

***** That is actually pretty interesting especially with the death eater part.

The thing with the death eaters is you get to explore very few of their actual views on things. Voldemort I think ran on more than I hate muggleborns as his ideaology but what specifically is vague. But im willing to bet pro dark magic was a thing. Especially since dark arts became a subject at hogwarts only after the take over and perhaps that could allign more closely to certain magical creatures like werewolves. So we can consider that maybe the death eaters were some combination of anti muggle and pro dark arts but you dont know which ones cared about what aspect.

Hypothetically all the ones who extremely vocal about specifically being anti muggleborn were so while the rest cared less about it. So Dolohov, Karkaroff Regulus Barty Crouch Jr and Snape for example could all continue to be death eaters.

While Yaxely Bellatrix and Umbridge likely would not.

Malfoys could be one of those few elite purebloods who support Voldemort likely out of interest in the dark arts.

So Bellatrix Black becomes less likely to be a supporter because of this. Partly because of anti muggleborn thing likely being a motivator for her. But also because because she is the sort of purist upper class pureblood wizard that would hate "half breeds". To be honest Voldy would likely have fewer rich elite pure blood wizards amongst their ranks. Sure there could be some but not most.

The marauders might end up being neutral or even siding with Voldemort as Lupin would be getting more help from him as a werewolf than the rest of wizarding society. And the marauders might follow suit.

In which case Harry could still be orphannned but not due to Voldemort but crossfire or his parents deaths were rumored to be caused by Voldemort which Harry later discovers wasnt the case. In the case of the former he grows up understanding the contreversies of wizarding society being raised by Sirius and Remus. In the case of the latter he is raised by the Durselys because Remus is made incapable to have primary custody due to his werewolf nature and Sirius is framed for his involvement in the potters murder. Pettigrew is discovered third year freeing Sirius giving him custody who takes care of him with Remus's help and thats when alot of things are revealed to Harry.

The Blacks could still be Anti muggleborn and that could be its own sort of movement headed by powerful and awful politicians like Umbridge. While Voldemort still sided with extrmeists and at times awful people but those like Greyback not Umbridge. Regulus could still join Voldemort due to his interest in the dark arts while Sirius could be neutral but side with the pro werewolf side. And this lets the brother bond over things after Sirius leaves and slowly Regulus becomes pro magical creature like his brother and Sirius becomes pro dark arts like Regulus.

Those who dont like Voldemort fall into three categories

Bigots who dont like magical creatures or are afraid of them.

People who think Voldemort may have good points but takes things way too far

People in power who dont want to loose it in political upheaval

Voldemort himself can be turned into some sort of immortal or close to immortal creature so hes really hibernating and is only presumed dead not actually dead or without a body. And without the Horcruxes resembles Tom Riddle or maybe a older Tom Riddle depending on how aging affects him which makes recruitment alot easier than for his canonoical counterpart.

****** I didn't really consider the Marauders stance on the war in this scenario. Though I do think there would be a lot more suspicion on Lupin because not only is he someone the Dark Lord would want to recruit but he's now one of Voldemort's 'preferred people'.

In regards to Death Eaters, I'm a little on the fence on the likes of Bellatrix but I like your perspective on her. Can you imagine Harry being in the Order with Bella AND Sirius? I absolutely believe Lucius would be on the Order's side. I can really imagine Lucius being in the Order AND Barty Crouch Jr in the Ministry.

I like the idea that the Marauders withdrew from the war for the most part near the end but at the start they sided with Voldemort because of his ideology, then joined the Order because of the violence and death he was causing. They could have been at odds with Moony about it and that could have contributed to the groups mistrust of him near the end. I think James and Lily would have thrown themselves into the war effort and Sirius not far behind because of James and Lily. Lupin would still be a spy and Peter would feel obliged to help them before (like canon) he cowardly betrays them to Voldemort and Harry is orphaned.

I can also see Harry becoming this anti-creature bastion, not intentionally of course, but he "killed" the Dark Lord. The public love him but creatures and "half-breeds" in general despise him as a symbol of oppression. I don't see someone like Hagrid hatimg him but maybe Fleur and Maxime are initially leery of him and maybe he's targeted in Diagon or Hogsmeade by non-humans.

I really like the idea of Bellatrix possibly gaining some kind of custody over Harry leading to him seeing pureblood supremacy through the Lestrange household (and possibly the Malfoy's) over Christmas/Summer and coming to realise why Voldemort seemed so appealing and understanding the true weight his "death" had on society.

******* Oh Harry beoming a anti creature bastion and hating it would be great tbh.

Though Bellatrix or Malfoys getting custody is unlikely him becoming Dracos friend and visiting the Malfoys is likely though if things go differently. Hell maybe even he sees it in Rons family casual bigotry against werewolves and half giants which stands out more after befriending Remus Ron can notice too and start to correct himself. Hell its canon that this happens and its called out by Hermione and Harry for a brief moment when Hagrid being half giant is exposed.

As for Barty Jr Im thinking he is either sent to Azkaban by his father either based on trumped up charges like Sirius or he was actually that violent. But hes like the rebel kid. Voldy frees him shortly after his revival from the imperius.

******** The thing is, I don't see the first year train ride and the Sorting wouldn't be that different so I can imagine Harry and Draco's first meeting at Hogwarts being exactly the same.

HOWEVER, at your point on the casual bigotry, I do wonder if Ron (or the other students) say anything in Flitwick or Binns lesson that may rub Harry the wrong way.

I can see Harry being just as anti-Slytherin during his Sorting because of biases he MAY pick up from Hagrid but I also think he may be really conflicted. With Hagrid I refuse to believe he'd ever side against Dumbledore but I believe Hagrid could sympathise with people who joined him, maybe clouding Harry's view of the conflict before he makes up his mind about Voldemort after the Quirrel confrontation.

********* Ok so Quirell confrontation.

Tbh it might not happen depending on what voldy is. For example maybe he needs to hibernate to recover.

Its entirely possible Quirell on his own may try to steal the stone to revive Voldy not realizing hes not dead. So perhaps instead of a Voldy confrontation Quirell is desperate to revive Voldemort because hes some sort of creature himself. Maybe a vampire he was supposedly"spooked" by one getting his stutter. Maybe he got turned started reading about them and how to manage things and got fixated on reviving Voldemort. Quirell manages to escape leaving Harry very conflicted given his breakdown and desperation and reasons for wanting Voldy back and that uneasyness remains even after his conversation with Dumbledore. I think maybe after this or maybe after 3rd year after the Lupin thing Harry starts to pick up the bigotry. Might not notice much in Bins class before

********** I suppose it does all hinge on what Voldie ends up being, though I can imagine him retaining his fear of death so if he wasn't already immortal he'd still make Horcruxes and the story could go as it would have.

I do like your idea about hibernation (sorry for not responding to it before) but I wonder what could he be? I had an idea once where a character used a similar magic to the one used on goblin metal (only taking in that which makes them stronger) and using that to incorporate certain characteristics and traits of magical creatures. So imagine Voldemort actually being this hulking, Eldritch abomination made up of different beasts with different abilities (instead of just being really good with a wand).

And onto your idea, perhaps Voldemort wasn't dead and he retreated to hibernate. He ends up in Albania and (like in canon) Quirrel stumbles across him, weak but conscious and powerful enough to still possess him. Maybe Quirrel reveres him like a god, sort of like how mad zealots do in Lovecraftian fiction, just going insane over him.

Then Voldemort speaks to Harry at the end of first year, Quirrel attempting to steal the stone to heal Voldemort's wounds and allow him to truly recover, and he lets slip that his parents sided with him once before Dumbledore's "lies" lead them astray, putting the blame for their death on his shoulders. Now Harry is left to seriously question everything he's learned, he doesn't know if he can trust Dumbledore and he needs answers.

*********** That could work but i suppose depends entirely on when you want that Voldy Harry first meeting to be.

As for Voldemort

Remember he was still born as something mostly human. So what he chose to be had to be something any wizard could become but would drastically change him. Like a werewolf for example. Not saying it would be a werewolf id rather do something else. But its far more likely then that Quirell reveres him for his ideas not what he is and its less likely to be something beyond someones imagination.

************ What you've also got to remember though is that Tom Riddle was a genius and a magical prodigy, a force who only feared Dumbledore. Additionally he seems to have a massive superiority complex and massively over the top (e.g. 7 Horcruxes when one would do). I think Voldemort would not only want the supremacy of non-humans but would also want to be supreme above all. To stand above even the monsters and demi-humans of the world. So I can imagine him doing some Perfect Cell shit throughout his life to become some kind of 'perfect being'.

In this AU he wants nothing to do with humanity and rejects it in its entirety. He doesn't want to become an apex human, he doesn't want to be human at all.

*************** That is a good idea but see my kinda big defining thing for Voldemort is he is a hypocrite. In the original he is a pureblood supremacist who is actually half blood with a muggle father he is named after.

As talented as he is as sucessful as he is he cant erase that fact best he can do is try to hide it and pretend it doesn't exist. So I figured for this one even tho he rejects humanity and tries to be something considers non human and pushes the boundaries of what that non human can do he is still mostly human initially.

The creature it self is still linked to humans because its still something humans can become even if its very difficult. And thats going to be true whether he accepts it or not.

I figured if his arc was eventually learning to accept that humans could be ok and working with them, he would also learn to accept his human aspects which he tried to shun.

And if his arc was him going too far and loosing it hed presist in trying to be non human pushing aside even the creature he turned into for a creature no human could become. He doesnt entirely succeed but the attempt mutates him into something unique and makes him too unhinged.

What do you think?

**************** I absoloutely agree on the hypocrite point, it's one of the things I believe defines Voldemort in the series.

I like both ideas for arc's but I lean much more towards the second over the first. I believe he's not capable of the self-reflection and realisation required to let go of his hate and accept humanity. I'd imagine him (like in the series proper) dying without shirking away from his warped ideals and principles. I very much like the idea of Voldemort perhaps starting out as a werewolf/vampire, something with a distinctly human element to it, then evolving and enhancing his form to make it better and pushing away that previous state as "weak" or "too human".

He'd still hold the same hypocrisy that he did in the main series (instead of claiming to be pureblood he'd alternatively claim he was never human), and the idea that he tries his best and mutates and morphs into something horrendous as a result is very much an awesome sounding idea.

***************** I mean theoretically you could make a in character self reflective Voldy.

But the resulting story...i mean both are good and both are stories id love to read. But Voldy mutating himself that story the interesring thing about it is the kinda nuance that having a person who is bad rise on a movement thats progressive in its ideals and many of the rebels fighting against him arent those who want to stop a tyrant but ones who want to hurt magical creatures. Youd have people in the order like Sirius and like Bellatrix. Naturally some might over time change with exposure to different views. But not always for the better. Maybe Draco comes to the side of believing that magical creatures deserve rights but Voldy is too excessive in his tactics and has lost his mind. But Ernie Macmillan over time thinks all magical creatures are dangerous due to the enemy at the time being mostly magical creatures and their supporters.

If instead Voldy becomes someone who has an arc and becomes good in the end everything might get more black and white.

So ya i am leaning slightly more towards derranged voldy as well.

You also get to continue this story after his death.

In the Voldy is good version he already has power and can influence policy so wizards and magical creatures can both work together and get to the good ending.

In Voldy was mutated version

Magical creatures suffered heavily after Voldys first fall. Harry works to make sure that doesnt happen again after his actual death. The good end is like another whole arc independent of Voldy.

Also another interesting thing. Maybe when Voldy dies his body becomes human again. Illustrating his failiure to reject his own humanity and proving the true evil they were fighting this whole time was not a lovecraftian horror but a human.

***************** Ok so another thought occured.

Im thinking both the Malfoys and the Weaselys were in the Order during the first war. And so make more efforts to play nice together due to shared goals and Dumbledore thinking hes not truly gone. So they encourage their kids to be less hostile with each other. So Harry and Dracos meeting on the train goes very differently.

Voldemort now doesnt have a history as a Slytherin. Humsns go to Hogwarts non humans do not. So Riddle has a history as a slytherin Voldy doesnt so it doesnt have an identity as the house that created the dark lord or has many of its human followers. So Hagrid is less anti slytherin as is Ron there is a Griffindor Slytherin rivalry but it isnt exactly the same. Harry might say not slytherin to be closer to Ron but higher chance at being in Slytherin due to him having less issues with it. Draco does make a mean remark about Hagrid in the robe shop but Harry doesnt register it till after he realizes the anti creature bias in the society. So it actually flies over his head when stated. But he picks up that both Ron and Draco can be casual bigots especially after meeting Sirius and Remus.

****************** Though I like this I don't wholly agree. I can see the Slytherin hate and the rivalry being a bit muted in comparison to the canon (particularly because I don't see Voldemort laying claim to his Slytherin heritage, and in fact he may rebel against it as his anti-muggle hatred would be another example of the bigotry Voldemort hates in humans).

However I think Draco and Ron's relationship (as well as their parents) would remain mostly the same, at least at first.

Lucius comes across as a conniving worm who latches on to people of power to gain some of that power himself. He's an opportunist, e.g. he bribed his way out of prison to get into Fudge's good graces. He would absolutely "play nice" with the likes of Dumbledore, Fudge or other high ranking ministry officials, but he gains absolutely nothing from playing nice with the Weasley's. In terms of prestige and power, they are beneath him, so I don't see Lucius telling his son to treat them any better than he did in canon. The Weasley's are poor, the Malfoy's are rich, the Malfoy's are also snobs who enjoy their wealth and the power that comes with it, they'd treat the Weasley's the same regardless of what side of the conflict they are on.

Though, I can see Draco being told to remain in Dumbledore's good graces (he is the most powerful wizard after all) so maybe he'd eventually encourage Draco to be less... forthcoming about the families opinions on muggleborns and muggles. I can see Draco not saying Mudblood or openly antagonising Hermione for her blood status but I cannot see a world where Draco doesn't see himself as better than Ron and decides not to let him know.

Additionally I don't really know what House Harry would end up in, my mind still says Gryffindor as I think Malfoy would leave a bad enough impression to turn him off. Though I wonder if Hagrid would attribute pureblood supremacy to Slytherin instead and perhaps let that slip to Harry whilst they're in Diagon Alley.

I can imagine a different scene in the Leaky Cauldron where they all pile around Harry but are disgusted that he is being escorted around by a "half-breed". Tom would probably break it up but Harry would likely hear all sorts of comments like "untrustworthy" and "dangerous" and maybe even some choice words about Dumbledore's obsession with 'creatures' that could lead into the conversation about Voldemort and tie in to a somewhat different mental image of his headmaster? Though I agree he is more likely to go for Slytherin in this timeline, maybe some bigotry directed at Hagrid by perceived Slytherin's may turn him off. And maybe Harry attributes all anti-creature rhetoric to Slytherin before somewhere down the line (via the like of Ron/Weasley's) picks up on the nationwide, systemic oppression and discrimination against non-humans.

******************* My idea to him going from not really noticing to the revalation that its systemic opression I think would be Lupin in third year.

My thought is that Pettigrew getting exposed 3rd year. Quirell gets away first year and therefore becomes the new Pettigrew for Voldy.

This means Sirius gets custody but fresh out of Azkaban he not in the condition to take care of Harry on is own and probably needs alot of help himself. So Remus steps up to help him. Sirius would have been ok giving Remus custody but he wasnt allowed to due to werewolves being considered too dangerous to have custody of children in this world. Which is another way Harry can be made aware of the opression

This could be a wake up call for other students too. Lupin was a popular teacher and not just for Harry. Once the rumors spread Harry wouldnt be the only one salty about Snape outing him and really looking into the consequences of that.

** To follow on from that, I'd like Sirius to get custody of Harry and attempt to sign Remus up for custody on the sly, THEN Snape exposes Remus and he has to quit. Now Harry is already upset.

THEN either in the coming Christmas or the next summer, Bellatrix claims that Sirius isn't a capable guardian because he attempted to give Remus custody and she wins. Thus Harry spends either a brief bit of Christmas (before the Yule Ball) or his summer after fourth year with the Lestrange family. The character assassination of Lupin by the public and how people treated Sirius for siding with a "non-human" ON TOP of being exposed to pure, unfettered pureblood elitism via the Lestrange and Malfoy families will really open Harry's eyes to the actual issues that plague his world and then he truly understands why so many people sided with Voldemort.

Maybe have Harry fall out with Lupin (at some point during or after this) when he admits that he was once on the Dark Lords side and spent much of the war wondering if he was right for standing against him. Harry, emotional, would obviously turn against him and cuts ties for a while. Only after a conversation with Sirius about how all of the Marauder's initially sided with Voldemort and even he and his parents wondered if they were in the right side of history (followed by a subsuquent apology to Remus) and maybe Harry could actually adopt Voldemort's cause.

*** I do like this however i will say I dont see how Bellatrix would get custody of Harry.

Sirius has custody being Harrys god father not being an actual relation. And so Bellatrix cant get custody by being related to Sirius. Instead hed probably go back to the Durseleys.

But someone like Bellatrix is very openly bigoted so much so that shes almost cartoonish. I think it would be easy to be with Bellatrix and see her as a extreme. Instead I think the bigotry would be more revealing if Harry was taken in by a wizarding family he trusted to be non bigoted (like the Weaselys) and now picked up on the insensitive comments because he could now relate it to the people he cared about ( Sirius and Remus).

It effected him so much that while he storms out when Lupin admits that he once sided with Voldy he cant come to hate him from wanting to side with Voldy after getting an understanding of what its like for people like Lupin. When Sirius comes to talk to him he accepts Sirius's explanation readily because hes starting to second guess what hes fighting against. And talking to both Sirius and Remus makes him realize why fighting against Voldy is so important and why he isnt a rational or good option for people who are pro creature whether they realize it or not.

What you think?

**** I like it, it fits really well with what I thought and how I think they would react.

And my thing is, Harry's only blood family is the Dursley's and I can see there being enough pureblood fanaticism in the Wizagmot that the idea of Harry Potter being raised in a muggle household would be tantamount to blasphemy and the ideanof him returning out of the question (add in that the last time he was there he blew up Aunt Marge and it works out perfectly imo).

Thus I can see Bellatrix getting custody in two scenarios:

1. She is related to Sirius and agrees to some joint deal where instead of having proper custody, she is more like a chaperone. She makes sure Harry is "safe" (not around Remus and other "half-breeds") in some Ministry/court ordered function. She could then abuse that power to snatch him away at some point or find some other excuse to be around a lot/have him removed.
2. Sirius's custody (maybe only for a bit) is completely revoked. He could possibly have it returned to him if he goes through some Ministry rehabilitation (read: re-eductation/indoctrination) course. In the meantime the Wizagmot decides to place Harry into a foster home with an upstanding wizarding family. Enter: the Lestrange's.

On another note, the rehab that Sirius has to go through could highlight that there are quite strict rules on non-humans being around children. Maybe they need permits or permission from the Ministry and Remus (keeping his lycanthropy a secret) didn't get them. We can reveal here that Dumbledore knowingly hiring Lupin without letting people know he was a werewolf actually put him in some hot water and got him in massive trouble, highlighting where Dumbledore may stand on the issue of non-human rights and freedoms. Though on that, in canon a few anti-werewolf laws came into play as a reaction to Lupin being outed by Snape, so maybe Dumbledore and Remus's image were damaged because they inadvertently harmed the non-human community even further.

***** Oh I mean technically you could find a way for extenuating circumstamces that would let Bellatrix be in custody but idk if it would contribute much since hed be bitter and antagonistic the whole time as she was someone whose view point would be blatantly bigoted and likely had issues with Sirius to begin with and hed be more primed to dislike her since Sirius did.

Idk how the Weaselys would get custody but since he liked them this would be far more uncomfortable for him if they were. You could also do more interesting things with them.

Harry can for example start to subtley bring up how the comments are offensive with the help of Hermione.

And some Weaselys can take great efforts to correct themselves like Ron and Arthur. While others like Percy can be dismissive its a big deal leaning further in to the bigotry.

This can come to a head with Arthur being the one who dies in book 5 instead of Sirius. You have the loss of another anti Voldemort person who was pro creature and made a effort to curb his own bigotry showing how Voldys actions hurt overall. It also was a death of a father figure for Harry who hed accepted as one long before Sirius and Remus, and came with alot less baggage.

For the rest of the Weaselys some embraced their fathers ideas on magical creatures like Ron. While others like Percy his death became the breaking point for them to become more anti creature to an excessive degree. So rather than thinking Dumbledore is wrong to fight against the Ministry in book 5 Percy instead goes to help Umbridge with anti werewolf and other creature policies in book 6.

So you can see how much of an issue it is by seeing this ideal family in Harrys eyes be broken due to it.

****** I think both this idea and the Bellatrix one could work together in the same story.

My idea with the Bellatrix thing is I want Harry to get a view of high society and a solid view on the root of the issue. Maybe have him go to some high society gala or sit in on a Wizagmot session where a particular anti-creature law is being passed. I want this version of Harry to have his eyes opened to the ideology that bred Voldemort and created the climate that facilitated his rise to power and I like the idea of Lucius and Bellatrix being the spearheads of the movement Harry is trying to bring down.

Additionally, since his family wouldn't have sided with Voldemort I don't think Sirius and Bella would be anywhere close to as antagonistic as they were in canon. Maybe Bellatrix convinces Harry (at first) that her only reason for her somewhat frigid treatment of Sirius is concern for his health and getting used to him not being a criminal. She has plenty to justify herself with and Harry may reluctantly and partially come around to her a little before she and her husband reveal their true colours. I very much just want Bellatrix as the face of the counter-ideology to Harry.

I kinda envision this story diverging a bit from canon in the sense that Harry is less focussed on defeating Voldemort and more on undoing the damage he has done to the cause and campaigning for pro-creature rights. In a sense, Harry ends up fighting the same people as he did in canon (the Death Eaters now with the Ministry and actually being 'upstanding members of society'), but they don't present a united front but two separate factions he has to deal with in two different ways. Voldemort and his forces require brute force, they are an immediate threat on his life. Here is where Harry needs to learn spells and protect his loved ones. But with the Ministry and the purebloods, Harry is forced to play politics. He has to worry about his image, his friends images. He's worried as he and his loved ones are being attacked indirectly etc.

I think your idea with the Weasley's slots in perfectly here. Maybe have them turn towards the idea of equality and then, after Arthur's death, Molly is desperate to remove her family from the concept altogether. She is not suddenly anti-creature again but she cannot bear to lost anyone else to it after the loss of her brothers AND husband, making it even harder for the Weasley's but presenting disobeying their mother's wishes as the final step to the family removing itself from bigotry (could make Fred's death and Bill's mauling that much more tragic/heroic).

******* Ah see im going to have to disagree with you for the Sirius Bellatrix relationship.

Siriuss relationship with his family i imagine is the same. But instead of the point of contention being muggleborns its magical creatures. So he still rund from his family in this and hates the ideas he represent to him and therefore hates the ones most vocal about it so Bellatrix. That being said he isnt fighting against her physically since they are on the same side. But i do like the idea of him seeing pureblood society and seeing the flaws.

Btw If Severus is still going to be a ex death eater chances are that Sirius will prefer him and Bellatrix's relationship to him will be like his to Snape in canon. In which case someone else will be outing Lupin.

Alternatively if Snape is someone who used to be very anti creature who became more neutral later a new spy will be needed. My suggestion it be someone who was a newly turned creature who would be the kind of person who youd expect to be swayed by Voldy like maybe Greyback turns Bill instead of scarring him and this happens earlier on story. Or perhaps Draco is turned and is approached by death eaters informs the order and they convince him to be a spy which Harry is aware of. He becomes more sympathetic to creatures as a result and starts wondering if hes backing the wrong side like Harry was before. So Harry assures him much like Sirius and Remus did with him.

This can start before too. Like maybe with Draco low key liking having a competent defense teacher in Remus and getting salty when hes forced to leave and reading up on werewolves and finding the same theories on wizards Voldy once did and adapting his view on them to be much more positive. His friendship with Harry is maybe a stressor for Ron which is hieghtened after Arthurs death when Ron is more frustrated with everything. This could happen regardless of if Draco is a spy or a turned werewolf. This also could be a source of tension for Draco and Lucius especially if Draco is a werewolf.

Which could be resolved by Lucius managing to save his son from Voldemort ( regardless of hes a werewolf or a spy) showing that deep down he did Love Draco and could have grown to accept those ideas ( or his werewolfism if thats what happensd) and leaving Draco feeling pretty miserable only to be helped out by Ron who understands what hes going through.

******** I may have been unclear, I still imagine Sirius running away and being disowned, but in that vein I imagine that his relationship with his extended family would not be as confrontational, particularly if Bella and he were in the Order together. I think they'd be somewhat amicable and less opposed to one another.

And I am actually completely against Snape being a creature. I want there to be humans who side with Voldemort because they think he is right, not just about equality but also creature superiority when he begins spouting that. I can imagine Snape, who grew up in similarly hateful conditions to Voldemort and Harry wholeheartedly accepting the idea that humans are terrible and non-humans are superior. Remember that Snape was also a half-blood Death Eater (campaigning for a world where he would be a second class citizen).

Voldemort may hate humans, but he isn't stupid. He would see their value as spies and slaves and would ultimately need humans to infiltrate the higher echelons of the Ministry. I really like the idea of human Death Eaters being branded as "traitors to mankind" for siding with a madman who wanted to destroy humanity. There is bound to be some twisted fanatics who side with the 'monsters'. Additionally, we would not only be able to keep the Dark Mark on a persons left arm, but it could change from a mark of loyalty to the Dark Lord to something akin to a cattle-brand/slave mark on the humans Voldemort now 'owns'.

Though I like the idea around Draco turning, I don't think it is entirely necessary, and Bill's mauling to me seems quite unimportant in the main series so I don't think it needs to be much bigger of a thing here. I think it is fine for it to happen where it does originally and it would motivate Harry to reform the magical world when someone he knows dearly is affected by the outcome of his revolution (alongside Remus and Teddy).

Though, saying that, I like the idea of Harry giving Draco the same talk he received from Sirius and Remus. Maybe it shows how Harry truly believes it now, as opposed to him still being unsure when he spoke to the two of them. I also like the idea of Ron and Draco FINALLY seeing eye to eye by their shared loss of their father which would motivate them to ensure they fought for creature rights in their memory.

And, back onto Bellatrix and Sirius, I imagine the two of them getting into heated debates on the subject as a sort of vocalisations of Harry's unspoken conflicting thoughts on the subject. Maybe Bella is fanatic but (unlike the likes of Lucius or Macnair) her points are all rooted in fact. Dark creatures technically are dangerous and over the centuries have targeted humanity for no actual reason but malice and instinct. Maybe the reason Harry isn't so quick to brush her off is that she, in a grim and uncomfortable way, makes some sense with the vitriol she spouts. Maybe there are certain things that Sirius or Remus don't have answers or retorts for and Harry is truly forced to find his own stances and answers.

She's not going to suddenly become some outspoken intellectual, she'll still (for the most part) be insane Bellatrix Lestrange, but with a lot more of a reasonable approach to her lifelong vendetta against magical creatures.

********* I mean very honestly I think Bella may be too extreme in her views for Sirius to get along. Sirius and Snape get along enough in canon because they work togethern but Sirius is very opinionated and has a low opinion of Snape and Snape feels similarly towards him. So despite being on the same side their relationship is very toxic and would take massive character growth for both to get along in a way that was less hostile. Personally i see that as more likely for Arthur and Lucius than Sirius and Snape in canon.

I see the same about Bella and Sirius. They are both too opinionated and too passionate about their beliefs which are very conflicting. In fact they likely resent not being able to attack each other much like canon Snape and Sirius. Harry on the other hand might take some of Beccas points into account not because she made a good point but rather Harry has seen the sentiment echoed in people far less bigotted and struggled for an answer.

In this version of Snape and Sirius's relationship they do get along better. Both Sirius and Remus see the same flaws in wizarding society that Snape doss but feel his original view points are far too excessive. If Snape has reformed like he did in canon hp they may actually get along rather well and share view points. Snape will unlikely have the same relation with the marauders that he had in canon

As for Remus and Teddy i was thinking perhaps Bills romance could be with Tonks as opposed to Fleur. This could be built up more over time and then they get killed while Molly and Andromeda struggle to raise the child ( Teddy who likely will be named something else) together. They bond in their shared tragedy and Molly who was desperate to pull away from the effort and might have had anti creature tendencies becomes more creature and finds more stability through the friendship with Andromeda.

I dont think Teddy being a child of a werewolf is necessary for him but if it is one of his parents could be turned before. Which would be a contrast to Lupin not wanting his own biological kids due to their connection to him.

What you think?

********** I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on the Bella and Sirius thing and just leave it as is.

Additionally, I refuse to believe Snape and Sirius can get on after Snape outs Lupin. Sirius would be very sensitive to creature rights even if he left Voldemort (especially if he runs away from his family because of their stance on the issue AND how it all effects his best friend). I can see the two working together but they would not like one another at all.

And I'm going to have to hard pass on the Bill and Tonks idea, mostly because I don't see any reason to change it. Lupin and Tonks are both individuals Harry cares about whereas Bill really isn't. It's not going to hit as hard if Bill and Tonks die as oppose to Lupin and Tonks. And I can see Molly helping out with Teddy anyway because she's just that nice. She could go into hiding with Andromeda and Teddy as her children are off fighting the war and bond with Teddy (the child of a werewolf) then. Or, if you really want Molly's change of heart to come from her own grandchild, let Bill and Fleur have a baby. Maybe they rushed into marriage to ensure Victoire wasn't born out of wedlock and BOOM you have a part Veela granddaughter. It's the same issue (non-creature etc.) but the same outcome, Molly can't stand living in a world where little Teddy and her precious granddaughter will live under discrimination and fear.

*********** Ok i can agree with that I like the idea of Molly's grand daughter causing her change and we could simply have Bill die instead of Fred to highlight her tragedy its more her idealogy changing which is the point of all this. While Lupin Harry cares about alot i think he has less of a connection to Tonks. Its not more significant than Fleur or Bill. They are just generally likable to him. And rather than dying to make Harry sad Bill and Fleurs deaths are the start of a character arc so I think it works better

With Bill and Fleur dying and leaving an orphan tho makes the same happening with Lupin and Tonks feels unnecessary so I say keep them alive. And actually we could contrast Fleurs desires to have a biological child despite the stigma contrast with Lupin's desires to not have a biological child because he feels guilty to bring a child into the world knowing the stigma theyd face due to their connection to him. Besides he already gets to experience being a parent and having a family/support structure with Harry and Sirius. Even if its not being married with a wife and biological kid. So I feel like his own biological kid seems kinda pointless. Always thought he and Tonks had a uncomfortable age gap anyway and felt like they were both made a couple then killed off to have the orphan symbolism. So id rather that be with someone more minor.

And it would add to the idea of broken families and makeshift families thats a running theme in this and not uncommon for people who have experienced war.

So ya essentially Bill and Fleur can replace Remus Tonks as the dead couple and their romance just isnt a thing.

As for Snape outing Lupin...would he? Like would he and the Marauders have the same history if he was a magical creature supporter while Lupin was a werewolf?

Would he have that same interest in exposing Lupins secret?

It can always be a different teacher who outs Lupin. Snape idk what his history would be in this
