Honestly I'd like to say it was googling "hermione genie bottle library dimensions harry potter" that let me find it, but I was already 99% sure it was a Mist of Shadows story from your description.

**** Well duh. It's a fun, silly, and in several places disgustingly smutty and gory. It's not going to win any awards but it'll entertain for a few hours if you're into that.

**** I'm not sure if I read this one, but IIRC Mist of Shadows has good writing but the stories are incredibly cracky and pretty OOC. Good if you like Hermione/Harry/harem centric, cracky, smutty stories though.

*** What ... is ... this? I'm dying of laughter, good job spitting this out universe (or author if this is intentional crack).

*** This story is crazy. And not really in a good way. The part where Harry randomly gets doused with Veritaserum at the end of the first chapter, and being mostly okay with it, sort of ruined any hope of me even reading this even as a crack fic. And, then there's the pedo stuff. Like, I think that Giant Squid/Hogwarts fic or Cho/Firenze foc is less crazy than this.

That doesn't sound anywhere near as bad as some pairings I've heard about (like Dobby/Sock), and Umbridge/Centaurs is heavily hinted at in canon. Is it just the writing that makes it so bad?
