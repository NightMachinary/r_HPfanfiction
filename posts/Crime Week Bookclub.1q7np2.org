This week is Crime Week, on the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1pps2p/crime_week/][crime week]] submission thread, the story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop, submitted by [[/u/wordhammer]] and upvoted by you, is this weeks story. I have to say I'm only a 1/4 of the way through and I'm really enjoying it.

As always the discussion thread will open next Friday. This week's thread Angst week can be found [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1popsj/bookclub_angst_week/][here]]

PS: How are people liking the bookclub so far? Any suggestions/improvements? Thanks everyone, see you next Friday :)
