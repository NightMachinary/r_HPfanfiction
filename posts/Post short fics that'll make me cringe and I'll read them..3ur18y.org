Whether it's a fic with Draco the really nice, supremely intelligent sex god or a fic with an unfathomably genius Luna, i thought it'd be fun to experience some really painful material all in one topic. Ideally short fics so I can get through as many as possible.

I'll throw my own cringefic for fun

** Oh goodness, OP that fic you linked...it could only have been redeemed if it ended with Draco realizing it was a dream followed by something terrible, like Hermione's face morphing into Filche's and then Draco waking up screaming.

*** A little static fling: If it's sole reason of existing is to deliberately make people cringe, then I'm not going to cringe. Takes away the fun of it and you don't automatically feel that the author is as stupid if it's deliberately the way it is.

Hermione has a period: My question for this fic is simply "What's the point?" I mean, if you're going to please the people who are turned on by this stuff, add detail of something. There's just absolutely reason for this fic to exist. Nothing really happens, it doesn't really have anyone who can get into it. It's just nothing. The author spelt you're wrong, though. Hopefully someone noticed that and shot them.

My immortal: Obviously, I've already this, everyone has. My opinion on it is the same as everyone else's. I do still question if it is purposely bad or not. When I saw the words 'Darth Valer' show up on screen, I started to gain a doubt or two.

** linkffn(Never Let Me Go by merrygolds)

The basics: just before and during the Hogwarts Battle, this fic shows the last hours of Neville's OC sweetheart. Plus Corpse!Cho. A/N says it was the writers first attempt at fanfiction so some slacl must be given, plus it was genuinely moving at points. I cringed because of this:

  Historical AU set in Ancient Rome. One Shot Dramione. A taste of lemony goodness. Draco is a Roman senator in need of a praeceptor, i.e. tutor, for his young son, Scorpius. Hermione is a clever Greek slave, well read and more qualified than any other mage in the empire to educate the boy (might be turned into a full length story at some point).
