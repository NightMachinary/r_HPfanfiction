:END:
He cracks a table I think when he appears and doesn't seem to remember anything. James, Lily, Sirius and Remus are there but no one else. Pretty sure it goes through all books, at least gets to third and I think it's on FanFiction.Net but I could be wrong. There's a shield I think that stops people from leaving until they've read the series. Thanks!

  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage.
