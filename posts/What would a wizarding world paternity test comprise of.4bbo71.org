This is not something I ever gave much thought to until in a thread in the Slytherin common room a theory about Squibs and their parentage cropped up. I don't have any particular story or anything in mind I just wondered what you imagine would be involved?


** Blood magic. I imagine it's one of the few uses that the Ministry approves blood magic for (under their supervision). There's probably a paternity potion out there too that can analyze the familial relationship between two people's hair/fingernails when they're dropped in a la Polyjuice Potion. Maybe the smoke turns different colors or the potion changes color to make it easy to read like a pregnancy test.

There's no way that a society so obsessed with pure blood heritage didn't expend effort to develop methods to determine the true parents of a kid.

*** This sounds like a good, specific method that would provide information without being absolute. This is the kind of Divination I can support.

Many fanfictions have abused the notion that magic 'knows' all these things and can trace a characters relationships to important (potentially rich) historical figures with a drop of blood.

There's a weird balancing act when it comes to 'magic'- one the one hand, it should be a bit more than just technology with a twist, but on the other hand anything that sets a condition of Must or Cannot or Always or Never tends to remove the ambiguity of important conflicts. JKR introduced Veritaserum, but she also proposed that the strongest minds might still be able to confound it if properly prepared. Well done, that.

I am a strong supporter of wondrous magic, but as a writer I have come to despise magic that solves the most fundamental questions of drama- 'who's right?' and 'who's lying?'.

**** I hadn't really thought of blood magic as Divination, but I guess I can see it as a very specific subtype. I would imagine paternity potions can be subverted by a skilled potions master anyway.

I don't think blood magic could be used to ID specific ancestors, (coughHeirofSlytherincough). Parseltongue is just an inherited trait, probably a recessive one if the Gaunts were inbred in an attempt to keep it. A DNA test can't tell the difference between a grandparent and a half-sibling, so I imagine blood magic would get more vague and useless the farther apart the blood relatives were. I don't think blood protection like Lily's would work on anyone except a very close relative, limiting its usefulness.

That being said, I would like to read more stories about a supposed Muggleborn who uses paternity potions to find out that they have a Wizarding parent who used a memory charm on their Muggle parent and left them. I imagine that could have happened during Voldemort's wars for various reasons.

***** It could also be an interesting storyline if you posit that the majority of 'muggleborns' are adopted/products of one night stands and the majority of the parents are purebloods who raped various muggles using imperius or other spells or potions. It could lead to some interesting political issues.

****** It would undermine the canon emphasis on strength of character, not heritage, though, if most Muggleborns were half bloods all along.

******* Why would the majority of muggleborns ever learn this? It could follow one person, say hermione, learning the truth of her parentage and her struggles with the knowledge her mother was raped, her colleague's dad did it, and whether she could bring him to justice only to find the ministry knows and doesn't care and has legislation in place to block people finding out because, "hey, they don't remember so it's not rape," as ceelo green once allegedly intimated. Even she wouldn't automatically assume all muggleborns are the product of rape unless she had a large dataset that indicated this.

Character is what you do, not who you are.

****** I'm pretty sure there's actually a story that does this. My google skills aren't good enough to find it again, but I remember starting to read a story with this premise and there was a whole Ministry department dedicated to tracking/hiding the Muggleborns born of purebloods rape. It didn't interest me so I quit before really getting into it.

** I wouldn't be surprised if there were radioshows for that. Like the magical version of the Maury show. I can already see Harry, handsome hero of the Wizarding World, be the victim of witches saying they're pregnant with his child, even though he's married to Ginny.

** I kept things simple--a potion, add a drop of blood from the child and a drop from the father, and the reaction tells you if they're related or not.

**** I hadn't given it much thought in my story because it wasn't relevant, but if I wanted the drama of "which brother is the father?!" then I'd make the potion have that level of inaccuracy, but if the story didn't call for it then I'd say that it only works with the actual father. I guess the basic premise of the potion is recognising the connection between the two sets of DNA, and it'd just be a matter of how much the potion is capable of distinguishing. I'm one of those people that's happy to treat magic as science, especially in cases like this.

While not related, this question made me wonder. So you know switching spells? Like switching between two peoples ears or whatever? Let's say you had two pregnant women. Could you use a switching spell to swap fetuses?

***** That's a really interesting idea. That'd be good for woman who can't conceive but are healthy enough to carry a foetus. It'd reduce the risk of a surrogate mother becoming attached to the child and wanting to keep it for herself. (I don't know how common such a thing is in reality, but it seems like something that must happen and that must be hugely disappointing for the parents that were going to take the child.)

** I wrote one in one of my stories. It involved taking blood from the person (the character used a knife to cut the palm of her hand), letting the blood fall onto the parchment and then saying an incantation. The blood seeped into the parchment and then appeared like red ink, writing out a short family tree (person, parents and both sets of grandparents). I imagine there's both a charm and a potion to determine the parents, and both involve blood.
