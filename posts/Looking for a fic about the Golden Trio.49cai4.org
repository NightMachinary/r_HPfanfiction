I remember reading a fic about what side characters thought of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. It was a long time ago and I might remember it faultily. I keep searching for "The Golden Trio" as a title but I can't find what I'm looking for. It's a fic where side characters like Seamus and Neville reacted to when HRH suddenly went serious and they knew something was gonna go down, or other characters reactions to the star children of the school.

Thanks.


** The golden trio is a common cliche, it's probably gonna be hard to find just from that. Can you remember other details?
