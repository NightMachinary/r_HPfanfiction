** The purpose of magic in the movies is to look cool. I'm pretty sure they don't care at all what spell is actually used.

*** I thought the Ollivanders scene where Harry bought his wand was fun. Right up to the point where the fanfic authors used the same "exploding wands" effect in their stories. That didn't work quite so well. Visual effects rarely work in text-based stories.

I blame the movies for a lot of fanfic nonsense. Exploding wands, "stupify", "alohamora", and the rage-inducing "Creature", at best spelled "Kreature".

They write, but they can't be bothered to read.

**** An overpowered Disarming Charm in the books can also do more than just disarm.

#+begin_quote
  Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: ‚ÄúExpelliarmus!‚Äù There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.

  Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, ‚ÄúExpelliarmus!‚Äù

  Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.

  Expelliarmus!‚Äù he yelled --- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair.

***** Not expelliarmus, but you missed the best example of this "spell does more than just its description" effect:

#+begin_quote
  Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes -

  ‚ÄúStupefy!‚Äù There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart --

  Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place where Moody's face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.

  At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon Dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.

  He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody's unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible.

I always think of this when people describe the Stunning Charm as a weak spell. Dumbledore used it to smash a door apart and stun someone /on the other side/. Not to mention that a few of them together can take down a dragon.

****** I always get annoyed when people write it as something a first year can do easily and everyone is expected to know. I always viewed it as a higher level spell.

******* Maybe its one of those spells that is easy at the fundamental level, but had layers of complexity you can build upon. Ballet, gymnastics, and parkour are all applications of "run and jump," which every able-bodies child can do but only masters have put in enough training to get the resulting grace of those disciplines. Perhaps "stun beam" is the basic spell, but "explosively stun people through the closed door" takes lots of practice and other related skills.
