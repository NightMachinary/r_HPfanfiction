:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As the title says i am looking for a specific harry potter fanfic. It was about how harry killed the dudleys in a fit of madness, and wasnt quite there afterwards, he got into slitherrin, and daphne tried to get close to him, to use him. Later, harry caused a magical apocalips and lost his arm.

I know its quite a strange summerey, and thats beacuse i cant remember quite af bit of it
