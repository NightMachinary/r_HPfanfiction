Their life expectancy is frozen at the point of departure - their "date of death" was set in the future, and so it remains where it is. Only instead of being killed in a matter of days or hours by the threat, they will live out tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. This doesn't mean that there's any guarantee their body will ever "remember" to start aging again once that time comes, but they won't just die of old age in 20.000 BCE.

And yes, I have already read A Long Way Home. (or whatever it's called)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/][Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild]] It's not ALL THE WAY BACK nor is it planned but Harry is sent back to even before the founders and he doesn't age while he's in the “past” It was just recently finished, with +600k words and has a bit of found family, blood adoption, and creature inheritance.

*** That does not look good. Right off the bat there are entire paragraphs in bold, underlining on top of italics, and a truly excessive amount of ellipses. Is the story itself good enough to detract from the glaring mechanical issues?

Edit: an hour later and I have tried to push forward, but if it gets better it's in the later chapters.

  Living with the basilisk is going to take some adjusting, like learning to navigate hidden tunnels, keep himself secret, and figure out how to use magic (easier said than done). The castle and forest are full of dangers, and as Harry tries to fit into a world of elves, ghosts, and talking portraits, he'll find out if he's up to the challenge.

** Linkffn(Voldemort's last spell) has the far time travel, but it's not due to the requested reasons. It jumps the shark super bad once they close the loop and move forward, but it's fun from 120,000 BCE through 1981.

*** I haven't read that before, so I did when I saw this recommendation.

I really enjoyed the beginning and I thought it was gonna be one of my faves, when the mutants appeared and Harry became wolverine, I was a bit hesitant but I thought the author would be able to pull it off considering the previous chapters.

But then chapter 11 happened. I have no idea what the hell just happened. I thought it was an April Fools chapter. It wasn't. I got whiplash from how fast the plot became a train wreck. I'm kinda wondering if the author was replaced by somebody else lol. It became so weird I couldn't read the next chapters anymore.

Thanks for the rec though, I liked two-thirds of it!

Like, it's not even told from a side perspective /as it happens/, it's being summarized by someone who reads about it. Really bad writing.
