So here's the thing, what if Rovena's diadem was a prototype for Sorting Hat. And then when Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw and in the second year is facing basilisk instead of the sword falling out of the Hat, Hat gives Harry all the academic knowlege that it collected over the years.

Now Helena Ravenclaw stole diadem thinking it was her mothers bigest marvel, when it was, still quite useful, mind clearing device. It didn't live up to the hype, but Hat is a knowlege repositoiry akin to pensieve, but sentient and has better ability to integrate that knowlege.


** I'm fairly sure all that knowledge would fry Harry's brain in an instant (come on, like 900 years worth of headmasters, history and then still whatever the hat learned from kids heads and probably more that I missed)

Ignoring that, this could be quite interesting
