I've been reading them a lot recently and it made me wonder, why there are so many, considering Daphne is virtually non-existnent in the books and films. And what people generally think about the pairing as i've had some ideas for it myself.


** Some people do the pairing really well, while others, its a copypasta of a cliche template. Daphne offers a view into the magic world as someone who has grown up with it and is probably deeply involved with, more so than what we see from the Weasleys at least. She doesn't carry the stigma of Malfoy and is easily more moldable than her other Slytherin counterparts. I enjoy well done, interesting, and unique takes on Daphne and her family. The really good ones always have something that sets them apart from others. That and Daphne is a pretty sounding name so that helps as well I guess

** She's basically a blank slate with a name, no established characterization that has to be worked with/around unlike many other girls in Harry's house (eg Hermione, Ginny, lavender, parvati, etc)

She's, per canon, a slytherin. Therefore she naturally brings a romeo and juliet-esque conflict with her involvement with Harry while also getting away from the over emphasis on gryffindor that Rowling has.

She was/is not already in a relationship that might cause hang ups

As a pureblood she can be an authors tool to explore and flesh out the wizarding world

She has a cool name, unlike tracy davis. which is unfortunately is something the fandom fixates on if you've noticed all the fics that begin by giving 'Harry' weird, ridiculous names

Not that it totally excuses why authors don't chose others, but its understandable why some might have picked her initially, before she acrewed a certain amount of fanon that could appeal to people on its own

** Well I think that people (myself included) didn't want to believe that everyone in Slytherin were "bad" people, so they took a blank character like Daphne Greengrass. It could have been Tracey Davis but from Canon we knew that the Greengrass were a "respectable family", so everything comes together, a nice pureblood girl that comes from a family that doesn't supports Voldemort but also doesn't follow Dumbledore blindly. Also in almost every fic Tracey is her bes friend dor the same reason, we know nothing about her, and that basically makes both of them into an OC but without the stigma that comes with it. And that's the same reason why there is more fics about her than for example Susan Bones, while Susan has a little bit more of background she isn't a rebellious in her house like fanon have make Daphne be. About the character in fanfiction, it's true that she already has a personality ( the ice queen) but I really like when the author writes her differently and she isn't a bitch with everyone except for Harry.

** Basically, Daphne (and to a lesser degree Tracey) is the Slytherin Swiss Knife of authors. If you need your character to interract with a Slytherin who is not a Junior Death Eater, and don't want to create an OC, you use Daphne. She can be anything from the purest angel to the worst blood purist.

As a love interest, Daphne also "unlock" a lot of interesting plots (cursed lover, familly pressure, a spy among the snakes . . .), making her ship one the ones with the best potential.

Sadly, in 95% of the fics, she is used to tell the 3 sames stories over and over and over (marriage contract, melt the Ice Queen heart, Lord Harry manipulated by the old goat), but some gems can still be found sometimes, like "Ice Cream".

**** She has no canon looks whatsoever. Completely fanon. She's nothing more than a name in book five. She could be a 'poorly academically performing' Slytherin, for all we know.

In fact, if you /do/ need to write about a Slytherin that's close to Hermione-level bookworm smart, you're better off using Rowling's cut character: Mafalda Prewett. Rowling initially planned on having Mafalda be a sort of 'match' or 'foil' for Hermione, which would both impress and frustrate her.

Shipping her with Harry's a bit tricky, though. You'd have to wait until Mafalda's at least in her fourth or fifth year to avoid flaming reviews shouting 'paedo!' in the comments (she's three years below Harry).

****** Yeah I've seen that as well throughout fics. However for canon it's shown that Daphne has blonde hair, I think in Order of the Phoenix? Astoria is shown to have brown hair at the end of deathly Hallows. Not sure why many fic writers mix up the colors. Maybe they didn't notice a specific hair color.

** Like PhantomKeeperQazs says, Daphne's from an established magical family.

As a writer, there's lots of potential for interactions that explore the differences between people raised in magical culture, and those like Harry, who grew up in the suburbs.

What makes people Slytherins anyway? And a relationship with Harry where maybe they don't think he's super-amazing, please, ignore my elbow in the butter dish.

As a reader, oh my god there are so many terrible Harry X Daphne fics.

Icy Princesses who melt before Harry Potter's mighty green eyes. (They're bottle green folks...not emerald, and they don't light up like a singing plastic Santa)

linkffn(a perfectly arranged betrothal) is a short that parodies the Ice princess.

I'd like to say that if Daphne Greengrass was anything that drew attention, we'd have seen her in the stories, but JKR not reality.

As the "Daphne Greengrass" fandom has picked out from the films was the unnamed pretty blonde Slytherin girl, we've got a Daphne in the fanfiction cast lists now.

Sarcastically Harry's only going to get Pretty girlfriends, because he's the hero. Ergo... Daphne is one choice.

Finally as a writer, I use Daphne Greengrass as a female lead because... not Ginny Weasley (and that sadly is because I saw the films first and Bonnie Wright made an impression) , and not Hermione (Miss Watson is, ah... pretty. And Movie Hermione is annoying. Book Hermione is... well, the Authors avatar and er... lets let Harry keep thinking of her as an adopted sister eh.) Cho Chang's got issues... Susan Bones is exploitative (just using you to get to your auntie)(and a real Susan would be one messed up girl after the war.)

So for me it's chance to have someone who won't take Harry's fame at face value.

And on the other hand, a character so typecast as an Ice Princess that a lot of enjoyable misery can be had making fun of that, and Marriage contracts and all that other fanon stuff.

** People wanted a "good" Slytherin and instead of an OC they used Daphne as OC stand-in. Others got inspired and the whole thing bootstrapped the Haphne ship, which is self-sustaining at this point with a large selection of fics of various kinds and authors taking their own spin on it, just like any other character with actual canon presence.

Though I do get the appeal of writing Slytherins as, you know, people, and not just The Evil House. And I'm well familiar with the concept of taking a character that's only mentioned and turning them into a Big Character, with a generally agreed-upon personality (Musichetta from Les Misérables, anyone?), so it's not like I'm judging people for that.

Beyond being a Slytherin and a pure blood Daphne in fanfiction is nothing like Draco. She isn't Harry's rival. She isn't in his orbit in any way.
