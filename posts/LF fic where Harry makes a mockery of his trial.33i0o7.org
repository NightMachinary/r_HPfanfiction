The title says it all. I hope that the trail is a major point of the fic. Sirus gets free, people get their do, he gets control of family rings, etc.


** wtf about family rings? Anyways, something to your request is this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot][A Bad Week at the Wizengamot]]

***** It just has become a rather common theme in certain fanfictions, where the head of a, if possible so, most ancient and most noble family wears a family ring granting him and him alone controll over family magicks, properties and members. Quite often in combination with one Mr. Potter becoming head of multiple families (and founding families of hogwarts) at the wee age of 11-15, and suddenly controlling the/a major voting block within the wizengamot.

This theme has, in fact, become so common that there must be a hundred and more fanfictions telling the same story, with variations of when he becomes head of family, how (e.g. bethrothal contract) and which (and how many) girls he beds afterwards - and who lives and who gets gutted during lunch in the great hall because s/he insulted the (head of) family (or bethrothed, or...) as if it where a daily occurence.

****** Thank you good sir. I know that's how many people incorporate the rings. Just making sure the concept of family rings is more popular fanon.

******* Fanon yes, popularity... depends on whom you speak with ;-)

Basically all this "most ancient and noble houses"/wizarding nobility idea stems from one line in book 5, where Sirius said something about the "ancient and noble House of Black" (or somethng to that regard) which probably was meant as an ironic depiction of how the Blacks (and friends, e.g. the Malfoys) thought of themselves.

If you take Malfoys (junior that is) rambling just for "My father is rich and bought the Minister" and not for "We are nobility", then there is no actual evidence (or really even hint) in the books for wizarding peerage (and with that no mention of family rings).

*TL;DR; Very very AU fanon.*

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]: Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

This is the first book of a series, covers pre Hogwarts. Currently book 3 is WIP, weekly updates.
