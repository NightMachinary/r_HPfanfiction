I've recently stumbled upon a crossover fanfic called "Oblivion" by ChaosEmperorNex in ff.net, in which some HP characters are reencarnations of some of the Et'ada (Aedras and Daedras) of the Elder Scrolls Series. This fic inspired me to think of a good plot to mix both universes, but I'm having trouble deciding some of the correlations between HP characters and the Et'ada of the Elder Scrolls series. Here's what I've decided so far, along with my reasoning.

Keep in mind that I plan on having a different approach regarding the capacity/influence of each Et'ada in its respective incarnation than ChaosEmperorNex. My incarnations would be far more human than Daedra/Aedra. Also, the HP universe would be mostly based on the fanon side of things, rather than canon (i.e. Charlus and Dorea are Harry's grandparents). It would be possible for the respective incarnation to be unaware of it's previous life as a prince/god.

Descriptions from each Aedra and Daedra are taken from the ES wiki. These are very vague resumes for each prince/god, since their actual lore is veeeery deep and very extensive.

Daedra

Azura -- A Prince who maintains/draws power from the balance of night and day, light and dark.

->Luna - Pretty difficult prince to classify, since her sphere is so vague, but her general history points to a link with prophecys, so fanon Luna seemed like a good fit.

Boethiah -- The Prince of deceit, secrecy, conspiracy, treason, and unlawful overthrow of authority.

->Narcissa Malfoy - Usualy portrayed as a puppetmaster and manipulative figure, and to some degree controling Lucius.

Clavicus Vile -- The Prince of deals, pacts, power, bargains, and serenity through wish fulfillment.

->Lucius Malfoy - Lucius is always portrayed as a shrewd politician, and seemed like a good fit for this prince.

Hermaeus Mora -- The formless Daedric Prince of knowledge and memory, seeks to possess all that is knowable.

->Saul Croaker - Head of the Unspeakables, seemed fitting. This prince is associated with knowledge hoarding for the sake of it, as opposed to a researcher, who seeks to create new knowledge for some benefit.

Hircine -- The Prince of the hunt, sport, the Great Game, and the Chase.

->? - Maybe Greyback or Lupin? This prince is very associated with werewolfes.

Jyggalag -- The Prince of logical order and deduction, upholds strict order above all else.

->Harry Potter - I love this prince, mainly because it's appearance in the games was in the most awesome DLC ever. As such, much like in "Oblivion" (the fanfic), my Harry would be his incarnation due to the way Harry is usualy portrayed in the HP fandom: kinda of OP and extremely diligent. A lot of other character in this list follow the same incarnations as in "Oblivion".

Malacath -- The Prince whose sphere is the patronage of the spurned and ostracized.

->? - Maybe a Goblin? Or a Weasley?

Mehrunes Dagon -- The Prince of destruction, violent upheaval, energy, and mortal ambition.

->Grindewald - This one in particular makes a lot of sense to me, since Dagon represents revolution and the destruction of an order in favor of another, which fits Grindewald's movement a lot.

Mephala -- The Prince of unknown plots and obfuscation, a master manipulator, a sower of discord.

->Ms. Zabini - Blaise's mother is portrayed as a blackwidow in most fanfics out there, which fits Mephala a lot.

Meridia -- The Prince of the energies of all living things, enemy of the undead and all who disrupt the flow of life.

->? - Neville?

Molag Bal -- The Prince of domination and spiritual enslavement, seeks to ensnare souls within his domain.

->Voldemort - This one is also a done deal. The enslavement theme bleeds from Voldemort.

Namira -- The Prince of the "ancient darkness," the patron of all things considered repulsive.

->?

Nocturnal -- The Prince of the night and darkness, the patron of all things secretive.

->Daphne Greengrass - Nocturnal is the quintessential Slytherin, and Daphne is usualy portrayed as such in most fanfics.

Peryite -- The Taskmaster, the Daedric Prince of Pestilence, desires order in his domain.

->? - Maybe Pettigrew? Or Snape?

Sanguine -- The Prince of hedonism, debauchery, and the further indulgences of one's darker nature.

->? - Mundungus? Sirius?

Sheogorath -- The infamous Prince of Madness, whose motives are unknowable.

->?

Vaermina -- The Prince of dreams and nightmares, a deliverer of evil omens and dark portents.

->?

Aedra

Akatosh -- The Dragon God of Time and chief god of the pantheon

->Nicolas Flamel - An immortal is the God of time...once again, fitting

Arkay -- God of the Cycle of Life, Death, and Mortals burials and funeral rites

->? - Dumbledore?

Dibella -- Goddess of Beauty

->Fleur or Appoline Delacour - This one is pretty obvious.

->Julianos -- God of Wisdom and Logic

->Filius Flitwick or Hemione Granger? - Julianos seems to encompass the same thirst for knowledge that Haermeaus has, but in a different light. Heavily divided on this one.

Kynareth -- Goddess of Air, wind, sky and the Elements

->Perenelle Flamel - There is practicaly no mention of Perenelle, so she gets Kynareth only because she's Nicola's wife.

Mara -- Goddess of Love and compassion, the Mother Goddess

->? - Lily Potter?

Stendarr -- God of Mercy, Justice, charity, luck, and righteous rule by might and merciful forbearance

->Amelia Bones or Susan Bones - Amelia seems like a good candidate for this sphere, as she is portrayed as a hard, but fair character. Susan would also work.

Talos -- Hero-god of Mankind, conqueror God, God of Might, Honor, State, Law, Man, War and Governance

->? - The inclusion of this one is reaaaaally hard for me, since Talos is a bit of an odd case, with the whole CHIM and Amaranth stuff making the inclusion of this particular god realy weird.

Zenithar -- God of Work and Commerce, Trader God

->Olivander or his son - Zenithar is associated with blacksmithing, which would fit the the whole wandlore this sorrounding this family.

Haven't thought about any pairings, but I tend to gravitate towards Harry with any of the main ladies.

Let's also keep in mind that the Aedra and Daedra are actualy genderless...even if their portrayal in the games leads us to think otherwise.

Lorkhan and Magnus are also possibilities, but I have no idea how to fit them into the plot, or if it would be possible at all.

Any suggestions for the correlations?
