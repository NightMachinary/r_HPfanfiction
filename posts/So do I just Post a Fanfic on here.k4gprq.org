Hi! Do I just put my fanfiction on here? Please help me with that.


** There are sites for that. One is [[http://www.fanfiction.net][FFN]] and the other [[http://www.archiveofourown.org][AO3]]. Feel free to create accounts there, upload your fic then share it here with a link. You could, of course, also just self-promote and post your fics directly here (it's allowed I think), but, IMO, you should consider the appropriate fanfiction sites -- in case you haven't done that already. Then you can just forget my comment, lol.

*** I'll note that an official fanfiction site will generally provide you with more features. It will be easier for readers to search for your story, easier for you to manage it in future, easier to track reviews (and they won't get locked after 3 months). People will be able to bookmark it, use the FFNBot to link to it, and give favorites/kudos as appropriate that will then feed into search filters.

But if it's really short and you don't want to sign up any accounts elsewhere, directly posting on Reddit is an option.
