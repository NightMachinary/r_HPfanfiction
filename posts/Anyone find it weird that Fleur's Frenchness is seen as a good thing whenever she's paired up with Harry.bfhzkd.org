I was just reading a fic where Harry introduces Fleur to his parents' portraits and James is impressed Harry could get a French girl. In my experience, there's not much love lost between the Brits and the cheese eating surrender monkeys. Does anyone have any ideas why this is so much reversed in fanfiction?

Just to be clear, I don't think being French should be regarded as a personal failing or negative trait but I'm curious as to why fanfiction paints it in the opposite light to what I would normally expect to see/hear.

EDIT: Thank you for all the replies. Turns out the French are widely considered to be charming, sophisticated, cultured and exotic. That's news to me but I'm glad they've finally got something good going for them.

******** This is /way/ late, but I stumbled across this and wanted to make a comment in case anyone does the same.

That is an interesting article - but as someone who read through the Harry Potter books in French to start off, and as a child (reading 1-4 at age 8-9 at the time when they were the only books out), I kinda have to disagree with the way the paper's author makes authoritative statements.

For example, I still had a strong sense of bullying/racism/elitism in the French version - Malfoy was still an elitist, noble-focused guy. I still disliked him, and understood why Harry/Hermione/Ron did as well.

Another one is that, frankly, the English boarding school system /is/ strange to the French. Incorporating it into the magical world was a very smart decision by the translator IMO - having a footnote at the bottom explaining the british school system would have been fairly dry, and there are a lot of details that might come up from it that a british audience would instinctively understand - eg, how much of leeway they have. I find that having it part of the wizarding culture fit in well for me.

Other aspects, such as formality, didn't really stick out at all when reading them. It's not something I could truly explain - but it still felt like it was kids like me talking and interacting, and not necessarily from the 'standpoint of an adult'. Perhaps it's because most of the books I was reading were written formally anyways? I don't know for sure, just that 'vous' vs 'tu' wasn't a /huge/ deal. I definitely got the impression that Harry & co were great friends with Hagrid, for example, and not the typical student-teacher formal relationship.

There is an interesting point made there about the 'otherness' of the world - and I can see how fitting it in a fairy tale/emphasizing the 'other' in the magical culture might impact the reception of it. Some specific aspects don't exactly follow - eg, the brand names don't really matter, my family is much more likely to just say 'chocolate bar' than 'mars bar' or the specific brand of it for sweets. France also doesn't have a good equivalent for the multi-flavored beans to copy - there's simply no way to make it /not/ seem exotic and strange, and part of the appeal of Harry IMO is too render him relate-able to the reader. I do know that I had a strong sense of the magical world being something magical and fascinatingly strange - and perhaps losing a /bit/ of the way it fit into the world. But at the same time it would have been impossible to keep that same sense without either extensive footnotes explaining what was a part of British culture and /not/ the wizarding world, or extensively changing the setting to have it be in France, with French cultural assumptions.

Sorry for the necro of this :P

** As I'm neither British or French I can't say it from a citizen's POV.

But historically the French-British animosity was largely reversed around the time of the Crimean war. and their bonds was strengthened throughout WW1&2. How else would there be an actual discussion about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-British_Union][political union between the two countries?]]

Further it seems to me, as if the two countries attitude towards one another has been on the level of the Scandinavians. Lots of shit talking. Little actual animosity.

**** Yeah it's largely political. But to me what you've said is not that different from Scandinavia. Both Norwegians and Danes find Swedens non-involvement in the war to be a bit of a disgrace. And there are Danes that want Scania back, Scanians that want to return to Denmark. Norwegians that want Bohuslen, Jamtland, and Herjedalen back. And at least some Jemtlanders and Herjedalingers that want back to Norway.

And there are Norwegians that complain about the loss of Iceland, Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to Denmark. Contradictory to common belief that loss was dictated by Denmark in their loss of Norway in the Kiel Treaty. Where Denmark noted it'd transfer the Kingdom of Norway, but not its dependencies. Instead of by simply the Kingdom of Denmark taking them over earlier.

So some resentment isn't unheard of, but by and large most people wouldn't care about it. Or at least most people that don't have the "lived trough it" resentment wouldn't. Though of course, with the exception of the WW2 resentment in Scandinavia it's centuries old. But so it is for the Brits and French.

More seriously, it depends of the people but a lot of French do joke about the British (to be fair, the French joke about the Belgium, the German, the Italian, the Swiss and the Spanish, the French is fair and mock everyone), I don't know if the feeling of playful joking is shared in UK but there is not "true" enmity with the British anymore (and last history placed them behind the German in who should be the enemy).

From what I understand, abroad the French can either be seen as dirty surrendering monkey or by desirable people with a sexy accent, I guess the opinion of people depends of what the author wants to say in his fic.

**** Well a lot could be said about it. France is the country that historically has been the most present in major conflict in Europe (and so in the World) and won the most battles. Surrendering to the Nazis was a political decision because the leader (Marechal PÃ©tain) hated the Jews but a lot of French formed a Resistance not to mentions all the one that went to UK or Africa to fight under De Gaulle.

The reason about all the "surrendering coward" was because the US tried to humiliate France on the Internet after we refused to follow their coalition in Irak (you know the "I have a test tube, it's the proof they use illegal chemical weapons).

Almost 20 years later some people still repeat these arguments, (but considering the history knowledge of some Americans I saw, I guess they don't really know what happened in the wars).

** So here's my two pence on the subject.

Most British people hold some distain (even just jokingly) towards the French and the French seem to have it back. Throw in some political issues and the refusal to speak English by a lot of French people (and refusal to speak French by a lot of Brits ) and you get the real feelings between the two. That is until they sit down at a pub and have a pint.

Now I have the actual relationship between the two down let's go to why I think fanfics tend to not go with the reality.

Most fanfic authors are American, so unlike the Europeans, they aren't aware of this relationship. The closest thing they've probably seen to this is [[/r/HistoryMemes][r/HistoryMemes]]. I think this is probably the most likely but I think there's also another reason. JK herself. She both writes and shows them in her movies as basically sex ideals in GOF. All the British guys are drilling over them, Ron even mindlessly threw himself at Fluer. I do realize it's because she's a veela but it doesn't help the stereotype JK was building upon. The only time anyone French (other than Gabrielle who is only a child and Madam M who's a half giant) is Fluer in the last movie when the trio show up at Bill's.

So to conclude I think it's two reasons, one, they don't know, and two, it's JK's fault.
