I think they would compliment each other, but the vast majority of the shit on fanfiction is SHIT. Going on and on and on about "Jack's rippling muscles" and "Will's gorgeous eyebrows" or whatever, with absolutely no original storyline.

Help, please?


** The only good one that I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4247866/1/Drink-Up-Me-Hearties][Drink Up, Me Hearties]] by Tinn Tam. Its pretty short (44,326 words) and abandoned but what's there is really well written and great.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry and Hermione's visit to Godric's Hollow goes terribly wrong, they escape into a parallel world where greed and rancor rekindle an old war for the mastery of the sea. And it so happens someone they thought dead crossed too, long before they did.

*** I forgot about this story. I remember reading it so long ago. Shame it's abandoned. I'd like to see it picked up

** I remember reading a story about Hermione going back in time to POTC land and being mistaken for Elizabeth Swann's sister, didn't read further than that. :P

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10004773/1/Bound-to-the-Dutchman][Bound to the Dutchman]] is reasonably good. Harry falls back in time somehow and ends up bound to the Dutchman, his magic acting weird in combination with the Dutchman's tendency to turn its crew sea-monster-y.
