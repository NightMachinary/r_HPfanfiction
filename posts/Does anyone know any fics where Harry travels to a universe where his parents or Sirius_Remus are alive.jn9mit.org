I'm looking for fics that take place after Voldemort's defeat (canonical or not) in Harry's original world and I don't want the Harry Potter in that universe to be alive.

That's pretty much it.

Thank you!

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

*** Thank you! I actually meant where Voldemort's defeated in Harry's original universe but he doesn't have to be defeated in the one he travels to. Thanks for the rec, though! I'll totally check it out.
