Hi there! Thanks for reading! Anyways like I said I have two seperate requests:

First is a Harry Potter/Skyrim crossover. So far I've read linkffn(Unrelenting Force: Haraldr of Winterhold) and linkffn(Rise of the Dragon Child) and enjoyed them both and wondering if there are any similar stories out there.

Second would be awkward teenager Fleur. I love Harry/Fluer stories but she's always portrayed as this confident, occasionally snobbish, uptight woman. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just reading the same characterization all the time is boring. So I'm looking for a Fleur who is still an alluring Veela but is shy and maybe stutters and blushes all the time.


** Its not Skyrim but Elder Scrolls but perhaps it would be interesting to you.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

*** You know I wasn't really sure how I'd feel about as I typically try to avoid Dark Harry stories, but I gotta say I really liked this one.

**** Yea its worth the read for sure, although not the type of story I would re-read. I like darker harry stories, but usually not in this style. This was an exception, even with my limited Elder Scrolls knowledge.

Also, if you do end up reading any great Fleur stories based upon your request, let me know. I had never considered that type of Fleur in a story... but it does sound intriguing.

  When Voldemort arrives to kill the Potters, he turns his wand on Harry, ignoring the boy's younger brother and parents. Voldemort's curse hits Harry, summoning a vortex of magic that destroys Voldemort's body and sends Harry to another realm so that he may learn to harness the Power He Knows. On Nirn, Lord Harkon is killed, leaving a scarred child in his place.

  When the True Dragonborn is killed by the Thalmor before uncovering his true nature, Sheogorath comes up with a crazy plan and Akatosh takes some drastic measures. Now, Harry is stuck in a world he knows nothing about, with nothing to his name but a pair of glasses and a black dragon that wants him very dead. What a start...

** I'm still formulating my fleur for darkness!harry and the meeting won't happen for a long time but I like the idea. I may use it. A seemingly cold witch who is actually just shy and wonders why she hates this boy she's just met so much.

**** This is a really cool idea. I was sick of the same Fleur over and over again too but i took it in a different direction.

It started with me reading about Harry saving Fleur at the Quidditch World Cup in literally every Harry/Fleur fic and i got sick of it so i wrote a short one-shot about Fleur starting an international incident by taking down a bunch of Death Eaters by herself.

It kind of escalated from that into a James Bond parody with Fleur as 007. I've never published it because, frankly, it's terrible but it was certainly fun to write...

Anyway, your idea sounds much funnier than mine and i'd be very grateful if you could maybe make a recommendation post if you ever find something that fits your requirements. :)

***** I'll try and keep you in mind if I ever find one. I know there was one Harry Potter/doctor who crossover that mentions her being super awkward and falling in love with Ron but I can't remember it. Plus it was just a mention.
