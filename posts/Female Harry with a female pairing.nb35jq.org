I'm looking for fics that have a female Harry aswell as a female pairing. If anyone knows of any good ones please let me know.

My preffered pairings would be: HP/DG or HP/FD. But others would be appreciated. My least preffered are: HP/LL and HP/HG

Thank you in advance.


** Most lesbian fem harry fics are paired with hermione, ginny or adults sadly. There is however this one with a Susan bones pairing

*** “To Reach Without” by inwardtransience linkffn(11862560) is Harry/SB as well, it has an excellent beginning (with rather realistic freak out when Harry turns into a girl), but then it turns into something weird and it has not been completed.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

**** What was weird about it, if you don't mind answering? I remember it being near completion and the author posted an outline for the ending and possible sequels.

***** I really don't like super!Harry and was that the story with that strange semi-mythological powers Melantha had (and then fighting completely unrealistic fights with Zabini who turned to be NO-SPOILERS!)? I don't like [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][those]].

** Mistakes and Second Chances is Fleur/fem Harry. Read the tags and the disclaimer first though.
