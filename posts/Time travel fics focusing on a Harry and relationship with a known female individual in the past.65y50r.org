Looking for suggestions for Time travel fics where Harry is sent into the past in some way (intentionally or not), and ends up stuck there, and eventually ends up in a relationship with someone in that past. Key being, someone known within Cannon or at least loosely connected (like the mother of a fellow student in modern time). Most common ones will probably end up being Harry/Black sisters and perhaps Harry/Lily or Harry/Alice, but are there others as well?

Story should have the relationship as an important part of the story, but does not have to be the sole focus. Harry can try and change the future or whatever. The more mature the better in my opinion. Harry/Multi is fine provided relationships are developed. Smut/Lemons and the like being included are fine. No main character male slash please.


** I beg somebody to find a fic fitting the criteria that doesn't include Delenda Est.

*** Right? Ive read Delenda Est but outside of that I was having trouble thinking of any... so I came here figuring... a few more will be recommended and well... nothing.

Kinda shocking to be honest as time travel relationships open up all sorts of interesting new story lines and paths.

Whiskey Time Travel has a Harry who (probably) would end up with Amelia Bones, if the story wouldn't be abandoned. I link it since its fun enough to read like this.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** I just read Delenda est. Harry is a prisoner along with fallen in disgrace bellatrix in voldemort's lair. Then after some weird incident he is transported back in time where a young bellatrix finds him and the butterflies appears. Its a long fanfic but IMHO an instant classic.

*** I dont know any. I was asking for suggestions for Time Travel relationships (Assuming Lily would be one such pairing). Sadly it would appear there are VERY few.

Considering how great Delenda Est was... and the upvoting... it kinda surprises me.

  Harry finds himself in 1957 with new powers. With a job at Hogwarts, he makes friends the with adults from his youth like Albus and Minerva, and deals with old enemies. This story has action, adventure, humor and romance! Slash scenes are well marked.

**** I feel like I read this and it was Harry/Fleur/Tonks. So yea.. not really what I was looking for and doesn't exactly qualify.

Still worth a read though, although that may be an edited version because it is lacking the M rating it should have and doesnt have Tonks on the tags so... Maybe just out of date?
