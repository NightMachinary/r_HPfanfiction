I loved the beginning of Rorschach's Blot's L, L, and LL.

However, as with a lot of his fics, it eventually went off the rails and became a "too many ingredients ruins the stew" situation, especially with a really bad caricature of Luna, Ron being a porn star, et cetera. smh

The earlier parts, however, were a-fucking-mazing because it's still refreshingly unusual to this day, all these years later: Harry and Hermione, even though they use the accidental marriage trope, just steal shit from the Death Eaters after going walkies.

I kinda want to see a storyline focused on this, even if it isn't Hermione in the role of being Harry's partner/love interest: Ginny, fed up with being treated like a baby due to being the youngest? Lavender, whose pretty face hides a cunning mind and aptitude for, ah, "liberating" items? Katie Bell? Perhaps Daphne Greengrass, (the type who's friendly with Pansy, a bit of a bigot, and a bit of a bitch initially), a thief rival-turned-frenemy-turned-partner as she "acquires" funds and hopefully a cure for her sister?

Padma or Parvati, whose family are actually exiles from India because, well, sticky fingers? Heck, Morag being the descendant of a famous Scottish outlaw, with her wanting to take up the "family business" again in some form would be neat.

One student knows the truth, but their "paranoid" or "delusional" rantings about Harry being the thief are ignored -- some even think they're just envious and want Harry's attention (Oh man, I could see Pansy or Cho being like this, and they just get looks of sympathy/disgust from Malfoy or Marietta).
