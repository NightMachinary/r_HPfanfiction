Looking for a Harry and Hermione centred fanfic, preferably after year 6 (not a must) it should be written well and be believable (no super extreme powers that come out of nowhere or the main characters acting totally different without reason)

Can you link me your best of and explain why you think they are great?


** You should try Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by Keiramarcos. Its available at keiramarcos.com.

I was a bit reluctant to dive into a Soulmate fic but I am really glad that I read it. Its the best written Soulmate fic available. It doesn't have all those talking in mind, power increasing as if he were Merlin tropes. This fic takes everything best that can be about a soulmate genre and lays it best across the story. It takes place during the NEWTS. Also it's Harmony.

** I've always enjoyed a story called Stupid by The Seamonkey on fanfiction.net. I'm usually more of a Dramione fan than a Harmony fan but this one got me. It just seemed so much more realistic than most stories I've read, being spread over the course of so much time.

** Linkffn(12296750) is a 5th year Winter Holiday AU Harmony fic. It has little plot besides the romance but it is quite good.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.

They stare at each other, blue eyes into brown, and a decision has to be made. Will they let their connection burn them up or will they use it to fuel their passion? Harry Potter DH P1 2

** I like Vox Corporis linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis]]), Harry is not overly powerful and his relationship with Hermione and her family is well developed. Try to give it a shot, I think you will like it.
