:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for any interesting fics where Dumbledore dies early on in the timeline or by some freak accident. And then more specifically one where he takes Harry's place at Privet Drive and gets beaten to death by the Dursleys. Thanks guys


** Dumbledore dies early: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle Mess by DisobedienceWriter).

The only story I've read that has Dumbledore taking Harry's place at the Dursley's doesn't have him die; he gives up after a couple of hours. I don't remember the name of that one, though.

By the way, you used the wrong flair; "What's That Fic?" is when you're looking for a specific story. The one you should have used is "Request."
