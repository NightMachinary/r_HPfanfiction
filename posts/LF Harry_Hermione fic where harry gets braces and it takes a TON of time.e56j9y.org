Hey guys, I'm trying to remember the name of a fic where hermione/parents rescue harry from the dursleys (he's abused) and it turns out he's never been to the dentist and has a ton of cavities? And needs to get them fixed? It seems absurd. I read this fic years ago and don't remember much besides that it was looooooong. If you have any ideas let me know!
