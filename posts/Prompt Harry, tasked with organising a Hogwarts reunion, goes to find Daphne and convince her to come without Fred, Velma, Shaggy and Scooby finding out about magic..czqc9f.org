Could even be why scooby can talk. Would be the opposite of almost all Daphne's I've read if you keep her Scooby Doo character traits and not just make them an act.

*** That seems sad. I hold no love for Snape(as my past comments, and even post I think, can tell you), but I feel that leaving a(i'm guessing here) bitter, sad, grumpy old man alone is the best thing to do. By that age you're pretty set in your ways, and apart from in the movies, it will only cause pain for everyone.

** Draco would have a massive amount of impotent rage upon seeing that Daphne replaced him with a blonde who's better in every possible way

Also I presume this is because of the 50th Sccoby anniversary ?

** Daphne and the rest of the gang joined the reunion and all was going well till they heard a scream coming from the corridor. They all head out to see what was happening only to find a sobbing Susan Bones hunched over the body of an ex-Hufflepluff student.

"I...I don't know what happened, he was already like this when I found him..." But Daphne knew what was happening ,all those years with the gang spent solving crimes, plus all the time she had spent next to Velma tought her quickly how to connect the dots. There was a reason she had been sorted as a Slytherin after all!

"He isn't dead, he is just paralyzed" came Velma's voice from somewhere near. Now a crowd of ex-students and teachers had formed around the seemingly lifeless body on the floor. "I think it's time we move this to the infirmary!" Headmistress McGonagall intervened and nobody dared contradict her as she lifted the poor man from the ground with a neat flick of her wand.

In the meantime Harry had reached Susan and was trying to comfort her "Just like second year..." she heard him whisper under his breath in a tone of disbelief, then he stood up and followed after the headmistress. Once in the infirmary the body was floated on top of one of the beds. Madam Pomfrey , the headmistress, Harry and Susan where on one side of the bed, Daphne Fred, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby ( thanks to their reputation as a mystery solving investigative group) stood on the other.

Harry still quite disbelieving and overwhelmed spoke "Impossible! The Basilisk hiding in the school has been killed years and years ago! What else could do something like this?!" now the incredulity was showing on his face.

"Are you sure Harry? From what I know it's quite impossible to kill a Basilisk. Was its body set to flames after it was incapacitated?" Velma, of course the little Ravenclaw always knew more than everybody else in the room.

Now Harry looked more than a little confused "Flames? What...? How? No... well, from what I know it wasn't set on fire but I'm pretty sure it was dead,no, I am certain it was dead. I saw its skeleton."

"Oh but Harry, Basilisks have a great regenerative power, like phoenix do, the only way to stop them from coming back to life is to burn their corpse! You really didn't know?!"

"Well sorry I was a bit more preoccupied with the fact that Voldemort's younger version was trying to kill me to make a quick trip to the library and find the best way to kill something I though was already dead!"

McGonagall interrupted them before they could argue any further "Boys now is not the time to discuss how things could have been done differently! What matters now is that a young man has been paralyzed and possibly by a basilisk still loose in this very school! Oh dear Velmina, are you sure the beast could have healed itself?"

Velma, now blushing after hearing her old nickname nodded with emphasis "If the body was not taken care of in the proper manner, it is very likely! Almost certain!"

"Well then what should we do to stop it?" Silence reigned in the room as everyone looked around as if waiting for a miraculous answer to their problem.

The silence was suddenly interrupted by a loud rumbling sound "The Beast?!" Harry asked "No just Scooby's stomach, it's been an hour since the last time we ate something" Shaggy, an ex-hufflepluff, just shrugged his shoulders. "Sorry" murmured a sheepish Scooby.

"Well I have a plan! I know how we can catch the famous Slytherin Monster!" Fred exclaimed proudly armed with his Gryffindor courage, then he promptly said "We just need a bait" as he finished everyone turned and looked at the permanently hungry duo . "Oh , man" came out of a frightened Scooby, "Can we at least have a sandwich before?" Asked a reassigned looking Shaggy.

And just like that the plan to catch Salazar's fabled Beast was set into motion.

Hope you enjoy!
