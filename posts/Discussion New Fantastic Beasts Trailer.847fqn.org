So the trailer for the next Fantastic Beast movie just dropped a few hours ago. What do you guys think. Obviously early to speculate on it, but I thought Dumbledore in the DADA room was odd as he was supposedly a transfiguration professor before becoming a headmaster.


** I'm sure Jude Law will be very good, but I'm a bit bothered by the grey suit, very "normal". I don't expect him to wear purple robes with little moons and stars this early in his career and at his age, but a bit more fantasy would have been a nice touch if it could have been made to work with his charisma. He doesn't feel like Dumbledore to me right now, but I'm sure the movie will change my opinion, or at least make me like this version of the character.

*** I'm pretty sure that the clothing is being done specifically to enhance the sense of the story taking place in a historical era. Viewers don't have any sense of any particular style of robe being "old fashioned" whereas wearing clothes from the 1920s/1930s immediately takes the viewer to that mindset.

*** Perhaps his robes are colorful but the suits he wears under them aren't, and he simply wasn't wearing his robes in the scene...or perhaps he developed his penchant for that type of wardrobe when he was older. He is quite young in this, comparatively.

**** Yeah I know, that's why I'm waiting for the movie to really judge his character. I hope they kept a few quirky wardrobe elements as a way to keep him in the role of the Dumbledore we know from HP. I've also read fics from this era and Dumbledore is always represented as a younger version of the one we know, twinkling eyes and fun robes, so it's sort of become head canon I guess, so it feels weird to see something different. I'm waiting for the movie to have a more definite opinion :)

** Assorted thoughts:

- French Ministry looks cool.

- Grindeldepp looks much better than he did in Fantastic Beasts 1 and this is encouraging.

- Jude Law is a great Dumbledore.

- It's difficult to see how they're going to integrate the established book-incompatible movie canon with the book-canon compliant Fantastic Beasts 1. Probably they'll just ignore these difficulties and we'll end up with various different canons instead of one single canon (which arguably already started with Cursed Child).

- Though I greatly dislike how the Fantastic Beasts movies depict Aurors, both in terms of number (far too many of them) and in terms of lack of badassery, it tickles me that so many of them were brought along for a polite chat with Dumbledore. Looks like someone felt insecure XD

Edit: every time I watch the scene with Dumbledore in Hogwarts, I love it more. You can read so much into it. He's surrounded by Aurors and he's just relaxing, cool as a cucumber, hands in pockets, with his wand lying on the desk, not even in a position that he could pick it up quickly. It's just such an understated expression of casual dominance. So Dumbledore.

Dumbledore around that age actually has a really fascinating dynamic. The fact that he's just a regular professor rather than Headmaster, yet unquestionably the most powerful person there. The fact that figures of political authority are visiting him, a teacher in a remote location, because from that position of apparent powerlessness he nonetheless has global influence. It's an unexplored position, probably because the fandom is too busy turning him into a mustache twirling cartoon villain to do anything interesting with him.

*** - Somebody on Youtube mentioned Beubaxton, but it being the French Ministry makes a load more sense.
- Didn't have anything to complain about on that, as he wasn't there for long enough to make a comment in either direction
- I won't touch these two.
- Well, Dumbledore was known to be close to Grindlewald so I assume that whoever went to talk with him had good reason to be weary. But one thing I noted was that they seemed to have spread around the room so as to be able to attack Dumbledore from any direction.
- The US likely have a higher magical population and thus need a larger amount of Aurors than the UK. And well, they could just as well primarily have been Magical Las Enforcement Officers. The Aurors younger, less badass cousins.

******** In the books, the British Ministry just got out of a war that nearly brought the Ministry to its knees, and the Auror requirements were nearly impossible to achieve because Defense couldn't get a teacher to last more than a year, and Snape was not good at teaching. And because of the war, far less witches and wizards were inclined to become Aurors.

********* While that's all true, the Aurors are supposed to be Dark Wizard catchers. Which suggests that they don't need that many of them either. They are meant to be the elite of the Magical Law Enforcement. Which would mean that there are those with less education working there as regular officers of sorts.

There's also the potential in difference of population levels to consider as well. Isn't the UK magical population estimated to be 20 000 or something? Either way a low population level which wouldn't require a lot of Aurors during peace time and when war breaks out or is on the horizon, you train up some of your better MLEO's at that point.

But it is known that there is a Hit Wizard squad, and that there is an Magical Law Enforcement Patrol. The Hit Wizards being focused on Combat and not so much on the investigation and disguises like the Aurors. And then the MLEP has similar requirements as the Hit Wizards but probably is trained more generally as their task is to catch petty criminals like Mundungus Fletcher.

What issues do you have in mind, exactly? I don't really see what the problems are. I... I genuinely don't see what issues there might be that might come up in the /Fantastic Beasts/ films. What, Beauxbâtons as a female school?

Also, on the subject of the Aurors: as someone else already said, I don't think it improbable that there'd be a lot more Aurors in the United States of America because the United States of America are simply a lot /bigger/ than Britain. These thirty Aurors might have come from several different states, too, but been summoned immediately (thanks to Portkeys or Apparation) when news of the Obscurus reached them.

**** I'm not so much thinking of factual contradictions as much as tonal inconsistency.

A good example of tonal inconsistency is how Cursed Child had events unfolding according to stage logic - the fights weren't fights, they were a pantomime, with each person waiting their turn to cast a spell so that the audience could appreciate the full effect of each spell in full. There's nothing factually inconsistent there, but nonetheless it sits badly with the books (and realistic behaviour). For this reason I consider Cursed Child to be a kind of divergent "stage only" canon.

The FB1 movie was factually consistent with both the HP books and movies. But in the sense that it brought alive the magic of the world much more than the HP movies did, I felt that it was much more in keeping with the spirit of the books. It had all the neat, clever touches that are characteristic of Rowling's writing and which were so often skipped over in the HP movies.

(Also, do admit your original post did not lend itself to the interpretation you give here. You were talking about "having to resort to multiple canons", which... is going a bit too far for just the way a fight is staged. Just accept the facts themselves and see the specifics of the image and pacing as "story embellishments" akin to narration, perhaps?)

** 'If you'd ever had the pleasure to teach him, you'd know Newt is not a great follower of orders.'

Is a very Dumbledore-esque line to me. I'm not entirely sold on Jude Law but he did have the right charm and 'twinkle' in his eyes when he said it. Shame they couldn't have dressed him in brighter colours but time does change people.

Someone postulated something very interesting that I had not thought of. Considering the film is Fantastic Beasts are we perhaps going to see the origin of Fawkes and Dumbledore's friendship?

Speculating but perhaps Newt rescues Fawkes and Fawkes takes a liking to Dumbledore?

Credence looks to be out for revenge I would say, he looks bitter, darker and angrier. I can't see him joining Grindelwald considering, so it'll be interesting to see what he's up to.

Credence is also possibly related to Leta Lestrange based on writing on the wall that others were able to interpret. I wonder where that will lead?

** I will say this. I was never much in favor of Disney-like super vibrant magenta wizard robes. I actually very much like costume design in the movies. Yes, even when kids at school are wearing muggle clothes (seriously, shirt and pants are only reserved for muggles?). Even Malfoy's suit (nothing wrong with it).

Dumbledore looks fantastic in the trailer, though the hair is on the level of Harry's blue eyes.

As to why the DADA classroom. My theory is that teachers and subject perhaps move around--Slughorn got Professor Merrythought's old office when he came back in HBP. There are also considerations of fanservice (DADA classroom is a very characteristic location from the HP movies, so callback points) and production costs (easier to reuse/recreate a set that was extensively used for 10 years than design a new one).

I see some strange comments here that the first FB movie was book compliant, but the muggle clothing, look and sound of apparition, lack of pronouncing spells, all spells looking the same, etc. all fit way more with the movies than the books.

I'm really hope they're going to stick to book Dumbledore, rather than Gambon Dumbledore, as they are two completely different people.

I am excited for the movie though. I like Newt and I'm interested in all the new fantastic beasts in the trailer.
