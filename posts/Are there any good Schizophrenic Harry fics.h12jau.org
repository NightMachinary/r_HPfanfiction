** Schizophrenia isn't as entertaining as people make it out to be. To make it compelling you have to do an unrealistic, romanticized portrayal of the debilitating disorder and that's enough to kick the suspension of disbelief for me. There's plenty of psychopath, depressed and even multiple personality fics out there though.

*** You have to suspend disbelief to find any of the mental health issues entertaining, imo - but there are still good fics that handle them well and/or are entertaining because people with mental health disorders are still people at the end of the day.

**** Affective disorders are more common than psychotic disorders, so they're more likely to be accurately represented in fiction. But psychosis is difficult to describe accurately from an MCs perspective. There's delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms, cognitive decline, social isolation, etc. Many schizophrenics end up with severely limited verbal capabilities and total loss of introspection.

A realistically portrayed descent into a deep depressive episode can be compelling without challenging my suspension of disbelief because everyone can at least empathize with it (like you said); but a psychotic break from the perspective of the main character would be difficult to even portray realistically. You'd have to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of the character's likeability.

***** I suppose it would depend on the severity of depression; there is a real lack of understanding about the depression and anxiety. Particularly when it gets to a stage when people are unable to maintain a job. Nevertheless, I agree it's easier to find people with the experience to write it or at the very least describe it in a way that people find easy to empathise with.

Given the estimated range of prevalence for DID, it works out as slightly more or less than schizophrenia. It's extremely rare to find a decent portrayal of it as it's also quite a complex disorder.

I am aware of the nature of schizophrenia (particularly where its got further into the course untreated), but I appreciate that most people don't.

** I know a schizophrenic + legimens Percy fic, if that's any good? He finds it hard to tell the voices from people's thoughts. It's very well written and has a great plot, but as Heisen says not all for shits and giggles.

  I am terrified by this dark thing

  That sleeps in me;

  All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity One morning, Kingsley visits Grimmauld Place and tells Harry a secret about Severus Snape. From that moment on, Harry uses every strength he has to keep Severus safe.
