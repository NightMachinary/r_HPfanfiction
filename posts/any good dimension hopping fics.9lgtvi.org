  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

** I quite like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/374837][The Mirror of Erised]] linkao3(374837), though note that it is a sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/288347][The Rewards of Perseverance]] linkao3(288347), which doesn't involve dimension hopping.

  The only way to be certain you can defeat ultimate evil is when you've already done it before.

  The war is over. The bad guys won. Ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts was lost, the last remains of the resistance get one last chance to set things right. AU.

** The series of stories starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]], followed by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11842318/1/Traveller][Traveller]] and then by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4263138/The-Wayland-Smith][The Wayland Smith]] becomes a dimension hopping series. The main characters are Harry and Voldemort (and Dumbledore in the third one). It might not quite be your thing. I don't think many people would say it's following the same cliches. The problem might be that it's a little too original (particularly in the second story).

The first one doesn't really hop dimensions, though it sets up the possibility. The primary conceit of the second one is that Voldemort and Harry find themselves in another dimension. The third one seems to be a follow up story of Voldemort returning to a dimension like his original one in the year 1996, he seems to have a plan in mind and at least nominally be on the good side against himself.
