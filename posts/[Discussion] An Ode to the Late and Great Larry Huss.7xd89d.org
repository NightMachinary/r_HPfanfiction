So, I just reread linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss), and oh my god am I still upset by the author's death. The story is SO GOOD, so well-written, with an amazing Hermione (I nearly always read Hermione-centric), a relatively novel use of the 'time travel' trope, and a great balance of wit and whimsy.

Anyway, it still breaks my heart that this story will never have its end. I'm just now starting the rest of his stories, and the writing is definitely in the upper echelons of the fic world.

So cheers to you, Larry Huss, may you rest in peace, and thanks for your stories. You did the genre proud.

(Sorry if this is weird, I just had to talk about this in the only forum I have where somebody might care!)


** I exchanged several messages with Larry Huss when he and I were actively writing and even after I largely stopped writing in the fandom. He was a stand-up guy who gave me some of the most careful, critical reviews I received.

His story, /Out of the West/, could well have been turned into an original fiction novel since the HP elements were very light and the original fiction elements were just that good. /Remus Lupin, PI/ is an enduring classic of the fandom. /Palimpsest/ was on its way there, a coda to a stellar fanfiction writing "career" (to the extent that any of us do this as a career).

I miss the guy.

*** I loved Remus Lupin, PI. The writing was great and kept you interested throughout. I kept thinking I would love a series of one shots of Remus on cases from that world. Larry Huss is on a list of well missed authors.

** Ouch, there are people who probably didn't read the son's chapter/note and review it as if Larry were still alive.

  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.
