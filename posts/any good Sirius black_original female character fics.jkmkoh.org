Have been looking for Sirius/OC, preferably long, i love a slow burn or enemies to lovers, but will take whatever i can get. I'd love if it was Sirius after askaban, or any time that isn't the hogwarts years - canon divergence is fine. I know there's not many Sirius fics so please let me know of anything sirius/oc you found to be good, I'll give it all a try. Thankyou ðŸ’“

** Define good, this fic is ok... Seems to rehash a lot of canon and I had to nope out after 150 chapters due to a repeated typo (heresy instead of hearsay) but some of the female OCs are pretty well done and the relationships are done well too.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
