so I'm looking for full trio time travel. Back to their first year. In there first year body's. I would prefer no Harmony, but I expect if Ron comes it would be Ronmoine anyway, I'm also find with Ron/Harry/Hermione. I don't really care about plot, but I would love if it is at least somewhat funny. Most time travel fics are anyway


** We are the Golden Trio.

Ron and Hermione are already married and have a baby which came along for the trip. Harry notices he has a scar Horcrux again and needs to get rid of it. They realize that Quirrel is Voldemort and decide to do a speedrun: Defeat Voldemort, free Sirius, capture Wormtail, destroy all Horcruxes, gather Deathly Hallows plus Philosopher's Stone.
