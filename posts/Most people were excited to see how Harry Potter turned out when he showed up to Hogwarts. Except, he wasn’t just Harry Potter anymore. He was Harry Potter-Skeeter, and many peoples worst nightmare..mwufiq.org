This came to be when Harry was six years old. For years, Rita Skeeter had tried to find Harry Potter for her latest scoop, analyzing any black haired and green eyed boy she could find.

Finally, after five years, she found him at Number Four Privet Drive in surrey. But, what she found shocked her.

After snooping around as a beetle, she discovered the boy hero lived in the cupboard. THE CUPBOARD!

Even she wasn't heartless, and considered calling child services. But, an idea struck her. What if she adopted the boy through muggle means? If his family kept him a cupboard, they clearly wouldn't mind handing him off, would they?

So, she did just that. The uncle signed the papers with no need of manipulation, and Rita went to court with her darling Harry, definitely not using any memory or persuasion charms. Definitely not.

So, Rita ended up with a six year old boy hero, who apparently didn't know a thing about the Wizarding world, the very hero who saved the Wizarding world!

That was a scandal of a lifetime, but she was now a poor single mother of a child, and she didn't want to get into any possible legal trouble.

To say Harry absolutely adored her would be an understatement. She followed her around, always asking questions. He cried when she told him he could call her mother.

The poor boy never had any suitable family, and was so attention and loved deprived, and it absolutely broke Rita's heart.

So she naturally made him her apprentice and spoiled him a little bit. She even got him matching glasses, and my, did they bring out how shining green eyes.

When it came time for Hogwarts, Harry was basically a mini-version of her.

Like his mother, Harry Potter-Skeeter carried around a note pad, and a peacock feather quill. He loved his quills. He had so many, they took almost took just as much space as his clothes. But they were absolutely necessary, as mother said, and he agreed.

When he went on the train, he met a red haired boy, won Wesley or something like that. Instead of listening to whatever he was saying, he was writing about his expectations or Hogwarts, so when he was disappointed later, or if things were better than expected, he could dramatically write about it to his mother.

There was girl he met on the train, and she was a bit of a know it all. Herminnie granger, was her name apparently, he wasn't sure if he spelled it right, and really didn't care. He wrote down what she said, perhaps getting possible information for an article on a muggle-born perspective of going to Hogwarts for the first time. He'd be sure to attach that to his letter to mother as well.

He met one person he absolutely had to get closer. Draco Malfoy. His father was quite well known, and his mother taught him it was always good to be close to famous people, such as himself.

So, he intently listened to everything he said, and wrote it down. The boy seemed to love that type of attention, and continued talking for the whole ride about himself. ‘Perfect' Harry thought.

After the train ride, and boats and such, Harry had met Professor McGonagall, who had looked at him in fear for some reason. He found himself offended. Did she not like his amazing glasses? Mother would definitely have to hear about the Hogwarts Professors dislike for amazing fashion.

When it came time for sorting, and his name, “Harry Potter-Skeeter” was called, there were many gasps of surprise, and looks of fear in the eyes of the Hogwarts staff.

When the hat was placed on his head, he tried to interview the hat, and what it was like to sit on 11 year old heads. The hat didn't like his questions.

The hat was considering him for both Ravenclaw and Slytherin, and Harry chimed in that Slytherins green colors would match his eyes, and fabulous fashion sense her inherited through his mother.

The hat told him he didn't sort people based on what color they liked, but was so desperate to get rid of the boy he just placed him there anyway.

Apparently that was scandalous, and it was a perfect opportunity for mother to write the story of how she adopted him for the papers. It would be the biggest hit she could ever have!

He immediately started drafting a letter to his mother, insisting this would be the best time to tell the story. It was going to be fabulous.

He was even so generous to tell the story to some of the first years who were asking him questions. It would come out in the daily Prophet in a couple of days, and he was feeling generous.

“I was a poor six year old when she found me, living with my Aunt and Uncle, who are muggles by the way,” he'd said. “They absolutely despised me because I was magical! They locked me in the cupboard, and it was my bedroom for five years.” There were gasps from the first years, and the other students who had begun to listen in.

“My darling adoptive mother, Rita Skeeter, found me, and she decided she couldn't let me, a poor little boy, suffer any longer.” He continued, making his emerald green eyes water with tears for dramatic effect. “I was already living in the cupboard, underfed, and verbally abused by my despicable relatives. What if it evolved to being physical? What if they had hurt me?” Harry let a few tears drop from his eyes, before wiping them away.

“But worry not, my new mother, my savior, Rita Skeeter saved me from that possible life.” He finished, putting his hand over his heart, and slightly bowing his head. By then, the whole Slytherin table was listening, and the other houses were leaning in attempt to listen.

His tragic story was a hit, and he quickly got quite a bit of attention. He couldn't wait until he could tell his mother. She'd be so proud.

Most of the staff and students displayed sympathy for Harry, and were all very kind to him. They all tried to be around him, allowing him the greatest gossip, and stories. Many students here had well known parents,and if one happens to tell too much, he could get dirt on their parents, to either use for a story or blackmail. Ah, the life of a journalist.

His potions Professor and Head of house clearly wasn't fooled, and was being quite an arse, which meant he received sass from Harry. He was pretty sure the man despised him more than any other thing to exist.

Frankly, Harry didn't care. He'd have to ask his mother if she could find some dirt on him, or to help him find some. That should put an end to his teachers harsh words.

After a few weeks, when the story had died down, Harry started trying to interview teachers. They didn't like that at all. They took points, which he was definitely going to include in his article, for asking questions!

He didn't even care about the point system as the prize wasn't even that good. It was really just a bragging right. His true prize was his drama, gossip, and writing.

This Harry Potter creates Chaos in Hogwarts, and causes tons of trouble. Please add on more if you'd like!


** In second year, Harry's disappointed after the first defence against the dark arts lesson. The hero from the books does not match the bumbling fool from class. He writes to his mum, asking her to do an expose on Dumbledore's latest dubious hire (His smear campaign against Snape last year lead to the hiring of a new teacher for 1st-4th years).

Rita writes back, telling him that tales of incompetence will not interest the public after last year's series on borderline verbal abuse, but she'll read the books and get back to him. Her keen investigative sense reveals that the timelines and the magic don't add up, so over Christmas break, Harry and Rita visit Wagga Wagga in Wales - the town where Lockhart allegedly got rid of a werewolf - and they find out the truth. It was a fourteen year old witch who'd saved Wagga Wagga and Lockhart had erased her entire memory, including the secret to cure werewolves. One last werewolf still hadn't been cured by the girl. That werewolf had kidnapped and infected almost every child in Wagga Wagga. Harry smells a story. Rita senses an explosive book.

Harry takes a term off from Hogwarts, and he and Rita go around the world, uncovering the truth about Lockhart's so called adventures, and hiring an elite team to fix each issue. In some countries, they face hostility - no one trusts outsiders after Lockhart - but they uncover the truth and write that expose.

*** She used them in court to get custody of Harry. That was basically it I think. But yeah, raising Harry made her go soft on children. Anyone that hurts her darling son and dear appreciate will fully face her wrath

** Harry began to interview ghost at the dead day party until the Bloody Baron threatens him with a axe. By fourth year, he managed to interview Lupin, and managed to formulate a article on the abysmal treatment of werewolves. Skeeter was so proud of his first article ever that she even convinced the Daily Prophet to publish it. Harry gets all excited until he /reads/ it and finds it transformed into the cute ramblings of a kid who has according to the article ‘all the makings of a social activist'. Lupin appreciates the effort, though. Crouch Jr tries to destroy him at the end of the year for fear he'll find out who he is. Umbridge loathes him with her entire being. In sixth year he and his mom begin to research the happenings in the world. After the publication of the book on Dumbledore, she's mysteriously killed, and it turns out she has investigated the ministry and was going to go public about the corruption and Voldemort's rise to power.
