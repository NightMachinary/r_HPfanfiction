** As in "Hammer Horror", as in "incredibly complex and technically-challenging", or what?

*** Mate... I made that post 10 months ago. I'm just checking if people have found more. It's not like I'm spamming Dark!Harry requests every week or something.

**** Sorry, I think I made it sound like I was giving you a harder time than I meant. It popped up as a result when I googled "tocatta and fugue vibe" cuz I didn't understand the request (though I am very passionate about that piece - music history buff). It's super controversial in terms of interpretation, so I'm mainly just curious about what you meant by it.

And my other questions were meant to be funny cuz those are questions about the piece itself.

Sorry, dude.

**** And to clarify what I mean by controversial interpretation, I'll copy this from the wiki entry:

#+begin_quote
  The composition has been deemed as both "particularly suited to the organ", and as "strikingly unorganistic". It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, but also as containing "passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea". It has been called "entirely a thing of virtuosity" yet also described as being "not so difficult as it sounds". It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, but also as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm. It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style.
