:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A while ago I read a fic where Sirius died (as described in canon) but Hermione starts to hear his voice. At first she ignores it and I think she believes she might be imagining it but then during the Horcrux hunt she figueres out that it's actually Sirius ( I think because they're soulmates). I also remember a scene where she's being tortured in Malfoy Manor and asks Sirius to help her and he talks to her and sooths her. I've been looking for a while now but I just can't find it. I'd be really grateful if somebody knows what that fic's called or where I could find it.


** Oh I wish I could find it sounds really interesting

*** It is XD I'm really going mental here 'cause I can't find it but I can't get it out of my head either.
