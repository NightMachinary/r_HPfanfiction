It was a story that had Alt- Universe Harry thinking about the genius plan that his dad thought of in their home dimension. A secret to gaining prestige and power among the wizard world. A scheme he shared with Ginny. So devious nobody had thought of it before. You see, the beginning of the year train ride has wizards and witches come from all corners, so it is the perfect opportunity to impress. Genius James Potter came up with the following plan:

Dress nicely and have your kids dress nicely.

I couldn't stop laughing out loud at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.

So tell me reddit, what is the dumbest plot point or section of fanfiction you have read this weak?

Edit) Just realized this might break rule 3, if so I will delete the post. Removed reference to the story.


** For me it's always the magical animagus. Whether it's a winged liger with basilisk fangs, or just having 53 forms, to me it is a sign of a lower quality of fic.

Not to say that it means those fics can't be enjoyed or I don't have a good time with them, but I can't think of a single one that has it as an element that I would put in the upper rankings of the fandom.

Honestly not sure why this is a major point people seem to go crazy about to include either. You'll be reading a pretty level-headed fic then wham, a wyvern / dragon hybrid animagus. Seems so forced yet is so so common.

What's wrong with just a cat? Or a whale? Or something that isn't magical? Unique clearly isn't what they're going for because I've seen far more Griffins / Basilisks / Phoenixs / etc. than a simple cat...

*** I think that having a magical animagus form could be made plausible, if someone really wanted to, ONLY if it doesn't mean you automatically got the form's special powers. So, a phoenix form would only be the look, and no healing tears or flame travel, as that's magic innate to a phoenix. That could be an interesting read, imo.

***** The story wasn't really edgy. In the story Harry uses a rarely used, likely deadly, ritual in the middle of a more dangerous Triwizard task. They don't realize it's a Shadow Panther until later. He can move through shadows with it, but apparently it kinda 'rejects' him some, he can go through but he gets tired because he is not 'animalistic' enough. At least that was my understanding of it.

He's a ninja, and I mean that he's sneaky, and ends up dating Ginny - who, you saw it coming, teaches him that there's more to life than fighting. There was this one scene (Spoiler? I don't know how that flair works...) where he was in the desert fighting a Nundu and turned into a dragon and lost himself because the creature was, you know, a giant magical creature that he had difficulty controlling.

It was a good piece.

  And before he could say a word she had cried, ‘Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!' and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.

I also dont exactly see it being weird to add on the Black name because it WOULD be what was expected going by the history of the Wizarding world. Then again, that history is so full of contradictions and confusion both because of JK's storytelling and the debate over what is and isnt cannon...

** So there was this one fic in which Harry had a daughter with Gabrielle, but never knew her because he fucked off to Chukotka, Russia. The author called it Siberia, completely ignoring that not every place in Russia that is cold is Siberia, but anyway. So far so good.

His daughter Veatra (or something) finds him because her mother has vanished. She comes to the bar Harry owns and confronts him. She doesn't like him because he never was there for her. Awesome, I can already see the tension.

But hey... this is fanfiction and we don't do tension here. Fuck that noise.

Harry immediately goes back to Britain and lo and behold, the DA has become "The Legionnaires", which is basically a military regime as on one word from Harry (who is the leader, but hasn't been in Britain to lead anything for 20 years because /of some goddamn reason/) the upper echelon of the Ministry drop what they do and salute in front of him.

Some cutout figures that would be better off in the background of one of Pewdiepies videos came into the scene and identified themselves as Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna. They obviously weren't, but fuck that.

In the following dialogue, Veatra is *informed and educated* about what a great fucking person Harry is and with inner dialogue we see that Veatra is now worshipping her father because the author can't be bothered to write compelling dialogue or think of /anything/ to let father and daughter bond. But thats nopt enough - oh no, sir.

We also find out that the only reason

the

only

fucking

reason

why Harry didn't know his daughter was alive, was that when Harry asked Fleur for Gabrielle, Fleur *wouldn't tell him*. Thats it. Fleur didn't tell him. Why? *WHY?!* We even got to know that it was *FLEUR* who brought them together in the fucking first place. Why for all that is holy wouldn't she tell *the father of her niece* where Gabrielle is?!

And in over 20 years nobody bothered to tell him. He obviously had enough contact with Britain to form a goddamn military junta, but nobody could remember to say "Hey, Harry, did you know you have a daughter?"

That fic made me angry. I've read plenty of fics that I was disappointed with, plenty of fics that I think are just stupid or badly written. But its really rare that a fic makes me angry.

The setup was mildly promising (basically the story up to their leaving the bar was acceptable), but then all the action hero bullshit happened and the stupid started. There was no saving it at that point.

** Eldritch artifact possesses people who wear it in order to fight what it considers evil. In extreme circumstances, a child dons the artifact. Their parent offers to wear the artifact forever more if the artifact gives up its current host, and the artifact agrees. It has the child remove it.

And then the parent puts it on.

Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The artifact had no host and no power to affect the world. It /lost/. At that point, there was no reason for anyone to wear it and be possessed. But the parent did anyway.

** Hehe I just finished Strange Reflections too, such a coincidence.

For me the dumbest plot point this week was the fake trial that declared guilty but actually innocent Harry gets when he is framed for murder or something and sentenced to Azkaban. Hermione and the Weasley family tAke his family photo album and burn it in front of him in a big display. I mean what!? If you think hes joined Voldemort, then he has already shat all over his parents deaths and their memories. What in the name of Merlin's wrinkled ballsack did your think burning the photo album accomplished?

** I'm not happy about latest plot development in "Lady Archimedes" at all. It seems White Squirrel is going all grim dark. But the problem is, this Hermione was a far greater target and also far more competent than in canon. Therefore, I would expect her and her parents to be significantly more paranoid.
