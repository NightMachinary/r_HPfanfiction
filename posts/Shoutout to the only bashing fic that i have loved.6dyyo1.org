linkffn(8914135; 10143770) Betrayal and it's sequel Revenge are the only Bashing fics that i have really liked. I've enjoyed others but to legitimately like one is something i thought would never happen. Its also MoD but that is not a major plot device. Its set after DH but no epilogue. MoD, bashing and post DH are usually huge no-no's for most people so i surprised myself. I think everyone should give it a read and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for similar fics.

  A Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Percy bashing story - just to see if I can. AU starting after Volde is knocked off. Harry has to protect himself and what friends he has left. Through it all he comes to find a niche for himself. Of course he includes those closest to him. A weird new creature and apologetic goblins, what more can be in store? Sequel name Revenge.

  The long awaited sequel to Betrayal. Phase two will now begin. Reading Betrayal first is a must or you will be totally lost. Mostly from George's point of view. Starts at the end of Eighth year partial overlap with Betrayal.

** Here is a bashing fix that I enjoyed. It is percy-centric.

I even hesitate to call it bashing, because it deals with very real hardships of growing up in a big poor family. The author tries very hard to not overdo it and mostly succeeds. Linkffn(11729812)

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
