I have updated The Girl Who Lived. There is 2 chapters up for it now. I am starting the third one tonight.

** First, wouldn't the correct word be uploaded? Updated is if there's being build on something else that already exist, and yours are an entirely new fanfic. Also your stories name is shared with many others, so while I'm happy that you have begun writing, it's still a letdown because I though you were talking about a different story entirely.

But all the luck to you and I hope your story will become what people think of when someone says The Girl Who Lived.
