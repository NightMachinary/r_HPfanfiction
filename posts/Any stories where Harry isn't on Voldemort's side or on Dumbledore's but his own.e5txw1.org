Rather it's because of the way he was raised by the Dursley's, the things that happened at Hogwarts, or what have you... any reason is fine.

People can also go to him and ask him to join his side, instead of Voldemort or Dumbledore's as well.

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Can be on fanfiction.net or another site.

No Hadrian Potter, or so many Vaults owned Potter, or so many last names Potter. .


** Did you mean:

Literally any indy!harry fic ever

** I can't remember what his relationship with Dumbledore was in this one, but it's a great fic.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.
