â€¢ My Previous Prompt

Caradoc Dearborn was sent to Deserted Island* due to a magical explosion, which was a result of death eaters' magical experiment, becoming a rathalos* animagus during the process. (This was why Caradoc was "gone missing") He settles in Moga Village, takes up the job of defending the village from various monsters and studying their ecology, making friends with local raths during the process. He also travels and visits other settlements nearby.

As the result of magical explosion of their own Harry and Daisy are sent to Flooded Forest/. They almost end up being eaten by a begrudged green nargacuga/, but was saved by an old rathian. Harry's parseltounge ability, which was altered during the explosion, allows him to communicate with the rathian. Seeing the kids are afraid of their own kind, but they also needs to be with their own, the rathian searches for her friend, Caradoc Dearborn the rathalos.

During the travel this odd group comes across a group of grimalkynes stranded from Continent Astera. thanks to Daisy's newly found linguistic ability they manage to communicate. they travel together, making more friends along the way. They eventually meet Caradoc. But the kids are still afraid and distrustful to any sort of human being or someone** similar. Problem and resulting adventure ensues.

Things eventually calm down and the kids settle down at Moga Village. But there are problems. Caradoc is the only avilable hunter in town, An abyssal lagiacrus has nested in underwater ruins, Frenzy Virus problem is far from gone, that begrudged green nargacuga is plotting to destroy the town, and Port Tanzia's Hunter's Guild is little more competent than Fudge.
