Simply because I have a feeling that such a Harry would grow up to be the politest yet badass person ever.

If anybody knows any such good fan fictions, please suggest them to me! Thank you :)

** It's a wip, but I'm writing a fic like this. It's called What's A Soldier, But A Lover, Whose Life Drew The Wrong Hand. Dunno how to do the linky thing but it's on ao3

** I feel that most of these “give Harry nice childhood” stories lead into pure disaster (Harry McGongall is just one of those). First of all, these are [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][exposition-based stories]], but for good story you need first of all good plot, exposition will just follow automatically.

Second, horrible Harry's childhood just made him the interesting person he is. If you make his childhood nice, it is a compassionate thing do, but it most likely kills your story. Remember, the good author is the most sadistic cruel enemy of his characters.
