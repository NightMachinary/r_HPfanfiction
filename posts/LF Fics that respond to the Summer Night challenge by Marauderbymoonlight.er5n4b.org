I've read a couple of fics that reference and respond to a specific challenge by a (former?) fanfictionwriter - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12624331/1/Summer-Nights]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12457527/1/Summer-Nights]]). I was wondering if there were any more of these and to hopefully inspire others to continue to write them.

​

The challenge, as it's been documented is as follows:

- Takes place during the summer after the fourth or fifth year
- Harry is at the Dursley's
- Neighbor is head of country club that Vernon and Petunia just joined
- Neighbor insists on bringing Harry to the gathering/dance/whatever that marks Vernon & family's first inclusion
- Neighbor is a close relative of Hermione and her family is coming as well.
- (Hermione at first does not want to attend, due to worry about Harry, but her mother convinces her to do so)
- Must end Harry/Hermione
- Optional:

  - during the gathering/dance Dudley gets a crush on Hermione, but is devastated that she gives all attention to Harry
  - Dudley acts highly improperly, embarrassing himself and Vernon, while Harry is perfectly behaved
  - If Harry and Hermione hookup during the dance, Vernon/Dudley accuse Harry of using magic/freakishness to 'seduce' Hermione

​

I'm tempted to give a stab at the challenge myself, but I don't have a ton of experience writing any fics. Any suggestions to liven it up or make it unique?


** I have only read those two for this challenge. You would probably have better luck asking in [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] about it.

Both of the took place after 5th year. It would be interesting to read one after 4th year.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1027850/]] I don't know if this link works properly and if it does not the author's name is "Prongs85" and the title is "Summer Nights". Sorry for my bad English, I'm Italian, but I hope I helped you! :)

*** This fits, but is honestly terrible. I did not like the writing on this.
