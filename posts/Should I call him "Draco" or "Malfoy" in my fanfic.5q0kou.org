If I write a fanfic told from like 3rd person limited POV about Draco, would it make more sense to call him as "Draco" within the story or just by his last name "Malfoy." I can't decide.


** 3rd person limited is where the narration is limited by the perspective of a certain character (like the HP novels) right? If so, it'll depend on the person the narrative is limited by. If the person would ordinarily refer to him by only last name, use that.

** Wait, the fic is /about/ Malfoy? If yes: definitely Draco.
