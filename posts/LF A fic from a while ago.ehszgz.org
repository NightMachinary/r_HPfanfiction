:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the story started with the trope of magical binding, but he (Harry) had seven of them, and he goes to get them removed one at a time at Gringotts. He gets six of them removed, but just before the seventh, there is some massive confrontation with the Order of the Phoenix at Privet Drive. Then some OC vampire meets him and offers to remove the seventh.

That's all I can accurately remember.

I think it was a pretty long fic, and the relationship was probably Harry/OC (The vampire mentioned above). I think Harry had two animagus forms, and one of them wad a horse with a tail made of the essence from which the Killing Curse came from.

Please let me know the name if you remember it, or better yet link it in the comments.

Edit: I think it was on AO3, but it might also be on FFN


** That sounds interesting! The only vampire fic I remember is Valeriana Natassa, but I don't think that's your one.

  There is only so much one person can take. For Harry, he's reached his breaking point. Who will survive the fallout?
