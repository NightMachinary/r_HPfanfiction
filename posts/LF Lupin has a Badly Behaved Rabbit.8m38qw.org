Reverse the thing. Everyone thinks he's a Werewolf when they talk about the Furry Little Problem, but he actually DOES just have a Badly Behaved Rabbit.


** I never knew how much I wanted this until right now.

This reminds me of Seventh Horcrux when everyone is convinced Ron is a werewolf.

*** That was one of the best running jokes in that story. Also in connection with how Harry would keep pointing out that Hermione let Ron get mauled to death to save her own skin for the first time around.

** This one isn't quite "Remus has a Badly Behaved Rabbit" as much as it's "Remus Has To Get A Rabbit Because Everyone Thinks He DOES Have A Rabbit"

  "He called it my 'furry little problem' in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit." This is the story of four boys, two girls, and a rabbit.

  We all know that the Marauders called Remus werewolf issue his 'little furry problem' and that Hogwarts thought he had a badly behaved rabbit, but what if Remus actually had just that? What would it be like if James and Sirius decided to give Remus a rabbit one year?

  Remus Lupin receives a gift from Lily Evans. Which results in an encounter with a furry little problem. Or rather, two furry little problems. And they're getting completely out of hand for Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. One Shot Marauder Era. R&R!

** I would love to read a story about how the Lupin family are the guardians of the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog. They alone keep him in check from terrorizing the world. I think it would be the most amazing FF ever! He would never speak its name, just refer to it as his Furry Little Problem.
