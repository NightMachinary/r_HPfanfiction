I read this fic a while ago where Harry finds Draco in the bathroom bit Draco recognises him as this old primordial god that grants favours or something. Only Harry has no idea what's going on and wings it. It was unfinished when I read it... Anyone recognise this? Or know of something similar?

  ...Don't necessarily make the master. If anything, it's the other way around. “The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one Master of Death.”Except, Beatle the Bard was not quite right---and neither was Xenophilius Lovegood. Now Harry must find his own path as the Master of Death, all the while dancing a one-man tap dance between Death above and Death below. What's worse, unmaking and remaking the Hallows is only the first step.

**** No, that's not it. It was a story about Harry, who was like compelled to grant any wish someone stated with "I wish" in his vicinity, sort of like a Jinn.

  She wished with all her heart that she could change that fateful day. The day two brothers' souls were irreversibly broken. She should be careful with what she wishes. She might just get the chance. Time travel fic. ItaSaku
