I don't think I've ever seen this here before, but I started wondering.

What would happen if muggle OFSTED decided to inspect Hogwarts after muggleborn complaints about safety? Ignore the fact that muggles aren't supposed to be able to find the school.

Let's just say I'd be very surprised if it received an 'Outstanding' rating from OFSTED (and yes for you non-UK people that's actually the highest rating, it's just a coincidence that it's the same for magical grades. The others are 'good', 'requires improvement', and 'inadequate')

Lets not. Wizards having to scramble to constantly sort out the muggle-repelling charms to keep from failing the inspection is just more fun - "What do you mean they can't find the prepared Chemistry Lab and are now failing the actual Potions Dungeon?"

*** This. This was amazing. I loved it so much! I never knew I needed this! Jesus christ, Snape not knowing how Muggles work, marvellous! Also that bit in the last chapter? Golden.

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

** I think it would definitely need a requires improvement or even inadequate. They have defense teachers that try to kill the same 3 kids every year (apart from in 3 and 7), also theres the forbidden forest in which it's not gated off from the rest of the school, corridors and plants that could kill you if you're not careful, and you wear no PPE in Potions.

** Yeah I just can't see it getting a good grade at all at ofsted, the curriculum is inconsistent in quality between subjects, there's seemingly no differentiation for high ability and low ability pupils to be pushed to their individual capabilities and not all teachers create environments conducive to learning (though for the most part they do seem to be knowledgable in their respective subjects). Behaviour management is inconsistent and learners attitudes to learning is shown to often be poor. Peer on peer abuse is rife and often unpunished or insufficiently punished and little is done to stop abuse of those with different heritage. The curriculum is not broad enough to offer personal development beyond the curriculum itself (or I don't remember it shown to be in canon) and does not prepare learners for life in modern Britain (they may live alongside modern Britain but I mean I'm hypothesising an ofsted report for a fictional school so let's suspend logic here a little)

the provider prepares learners for life in modern Britain by: − equipping them to be responsible, respectful, active citizens who contribute positively to society − developing their understanding of fundamental British values − developing their understanding and appreciation of diversity − celebrating what we have in common and promoting respect for the different protected characteristics as defined in law.

On the positive side learners are expected to complete their course and are seemingly not off rolled and leadership does protect its staff from bullying (pity its at the expense of the bullying of the children by snape but I guess we can't have it all). Safeguarding overall is non existent though so I would say that would have hogwarts shut down quicker than you could wave a wand to obliviate

I may have thought too much into this...

** Would it be under their purview to inspect a teacher's average grade rate and qualifications?

Because I see Snape getting thrown out on grades alone. Umbridge wouldn't have made it past the announcement in the newspaper.

*** I may be wrong, but I'm fairly sure that Ofsted do not have the power to remove teachers from schools. Ofsted also care more about the improvement achieved in school than the grades themselves, and since Hogwarts does not teach English, maths and science, there's very little they could do to actually monitor progress. The grades therefore probably wouldn't matter too much.

However, they definitely do inspect lessons, and if Snape's teaching was determined to be sub-par, the school would be advised of that and be expected to take action of some sort.

** There are apparently two fics with this exact premise, here's the one I thought of immediately

I messed up with the bot apparently.

The Muggle school inspectorate Ofsted descends on Hogwarts, a calamity not quite on the scale of the Battle of Hogwarts but not far off it.

** Well, theoretically, they would all fail. The curriculum is magical, not mundane, so classes lile mathematics or english don't exist. That may count as an instant fail, I think.

However, the magical classes could be approximated to mundane ones - herbology and Comc to biology, potions to chemistry and physics, arithmancy to mathematics, runes to ancient languages, flying to PE, things of that nature.

I'd like to see a crackfic that has a squad of inspectors circumventing the repelling charm in the most ludicrous of ways, and eventually arrive at the castle itself. They meet with the headmaster, and everyone scrambles to "mundanize" the classes.
