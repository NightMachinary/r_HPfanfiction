I have several ideas; to say they are ambitious would be an understatement. Overall, I am still in the development stage i.e. ironing out details, research etc. The fanfic universe, known as the 'Chosen One Universe' or COU, will primarily explore the stories of the three main characters: Daphne Greengrass, Padma Patil, and Blaise Zabini. However, it should be noted that these fics (and most that will be set in this 'universe') will be drastically AU; hence, why this is taking so long to plan and write.

The main point of this post was to ask the question: would three (mostly) self-contained stories, followed by the "crossover event" fanfic be the better and/or easier choice, a la the MCU? Or should the crossover act as the springboard to the fanfics of each character? I have a rough plan for each case, and I am not particularly leaning more towards one of the structure ideas. If I were to write three self-contained fanfics, here is how the order would go:

​

1. '*Rising Hero*' /(Working Title) --/ Genre: Science-Fantasy

Synopsis: As someone born of two worlds, Daphne Greengrass has always struggled with her hybrid heritage, as well as her place and role in humanity. She left Earth to find answers, only to return six years later with even more questions and troubling news. Now back on Earth, Daphne must deal with an estranged sister, obstructive bureaucrats, and threats from on- and off-world.

​

1. '*To Rebuild and Conquer*' /(Working Title) --/ Genre: Drama

Synopsis: The aftermath of the Second Wizarding War left many scarred -- physically and mentally. For Blaise Zabini, it was the final straw against the Wizarding World. Granted amazing telepathic abilities from his travels, his journey to re-discovery will shed light on his past grievances, his family history, and what it means to be something better.

​

1. '*Say the Magic Words*' /(Working Title) --/ Genre: Fantasy

Synopsis: After losing her sister in the Second Wizarding War, Padma Patil travelled far and wide, until she found herself on Death's door. Luckily, those who observed the young witch saw potential unlike most others, and accepted her into the ranks of an ancient mystical order. However, Padma soon learns that with other-worldly magic more powerful than she could ever dream comes danger of even greater magnitudes.

​

These three fanfics -- along with a few one-shots -- would culminate in a crossover event, where the three main characters will unite against an antagonist who they would not be able to face alone. If I were to write the crossover first, the main characters would start off more-or-less where they would be at the beginning of their journeys, rather than their characters already being fleshed out. This will be my first time writing a fanfic of this magnitude; I would have written it years ago, although I feel as if my writing skills weren't quite up to par in those days.

​

So what do you think? Which way would be easier and/or better, as a guy who can (admittedly) take his sweet time planning and writing? I will be quite busy with University life, so I can't invest too much time every day. Additionally, what do you think of my ideas, given what little of shown? If you have any questions, feel free to ask.


** MCU works best. That way you have 3 self contained stories to read, followed by a fun crossover. The other way, you have one story that somehow has 3 direct sequels, meaning you might have to wait for 2 stories to finish to get the continuation of your favorite storyline.

Either way you go, be sure to know where the stories are going so you don't end up writing yourself into a corner. With the MCU plan you can even put in easter eggs where the events of one story obliquely impact another in a way that's only obvious once you've read both.

** The mcu way in my opinion would be better and maybe easier as well, giving them all back story's would make there team up much more anticipated and easier for the reader to follow.

** Everybody wants to do an expanded universe now! Even fanfiction authors want to copy Marvel's successful formula!!!! Make sure you don't end up pulling a DCU and leaving it in tatters though! Yes please this is sarcasm and also /S for /SARCASM. :P :P :) :)

** Doing it the MCU way would make it much more enjoyable for your readers. I know that I would personally rather have a group of characters that I like meeting up and be excited for that whereas I would "miss" or atleast be weirded out about all three characters not being there for the spinoffs

** Having one story that splinters off makes it clearer to your readers that 'Ay read these' cause usually I would just read one of the stories which ever sticks out to me and then when it becomes time to Crossover and reference the others I'm loss

** From a writing perspective it's massively easier to splinter a singular fic than weaving multiple fics together. (Provided that each has their own main character)

This way you avoid: 1. Management of multiple strong characters that are used to be the main character in a singular story. 2. Weaving many storylines / plotlines / backgrounds together seamlessly
