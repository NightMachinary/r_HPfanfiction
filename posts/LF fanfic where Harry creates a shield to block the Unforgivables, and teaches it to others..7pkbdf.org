Please Help! Read a fic a few years back where Harry created a shield to block the Unforgivables during the summer holidays at Dursleys. I think it had a lot of philosophy/religion aspect to the creation of the shield. And then he is later attacked before the end of the summer by multiple Death Eaters, and is able to block the curses fired at him using the shield. Later in the fic, he also teaches the shield to professors, students and Aurors at Hogwarts.


** Think you want linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ring of Reduction) but avoid the sequel, it is dire.

** Sounds interesting, but why bother creating a shield? Wouldn't a conjured or transfigured shield/wall/obstacle be more than enough to stop an Unforgivable? I think they can't bypass physical obstacles.
