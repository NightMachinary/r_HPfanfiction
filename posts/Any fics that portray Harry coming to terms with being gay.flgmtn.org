I was wondering if there were any good fic's out there that are about Harry realizing he's actually gay, struggling to accept it within himself, and eventually him having a loving relationship with a guy.

Know that I'm not looking for explicitly sexual content, in fact while searching on my own that's all I could find, which became really annoying. I want the story to focus more on the romantic aspect, and falling for a guy/developing a crush

And I also really would prefer if his boyfriend/crush wasn't Draco. That was another thing I kept running into but it got really old after awhile. And even in fanfic I don't see that happening. With that being said, I don't really want to see him paired with Ron either. Out of the two I would prefer to see him with Draco then Ron, if there's nothing else. (If him being with Draco is the only thing out there, I would like the story to have a more realistic feel to it; when I was searching on my own everything I found with Draco felt too corny, or forced, I don't know, it just didn't seem to fit. Like what are the chances that Harry and Draco are both gay and are attracted to each other? It would be better if, Draco already knew he was gay, and Harry was just realizing he is; and at first they're still rivals but then gradually they find they're attracted to one one other. Do you know what I mean?)

Anyway thanks guys, I much appreciate it. :)


** I can't for the life of me remember the exact name, but it's something like 'Lessons from the Streets' or 'Learning on the run'. Essentially, Harry grows up on the street and Draco eventually joins him - the former running from the Dursleys and the latter running from the Death Eaters. It's a semi-decent growth into the relationship and there is a little bit of both Harry and Draco coming to terms with being gay, though it covers less than a chapter, IIRC. "Oh no, I'm gay. Well, at least he's hot." sort of rapid-turnover of panic.

It's not the best fit, but it's the closest I have, sorry.

*** Actually this sounds really interesting, and it sounds way better than some of the other ones I found, I can't wait to check it out; thank you for the suggestion.

**** Sure. If I find the link, I'll add it here. But it's definitely not Hermione's Hogwarts Crammer, btw. That's a whole bunch of people. This is just Harry and Draco.

I remember Draco selling jewellery to Remus on a street in the fic too, if that clarifies it at all.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently.
