I recently stumbled over a story where a reader self-inserts himself into the position of Gilderoy Lockhart, and it's nothing but amazing.

Now I'm wondering if there are more stories with interesting professors, preferably from the perspective of said professor.

E.g. Self-inserts, OC-inserts, complete OC, Timetraveler als teacher, character from different fandom, etc.

I'd really appreciate suggestions (bonus points for 100k+ words stories, double the bonus points for 250k+ or with sequels)

  Kakashi Hatake and his excerpts of the wizarding world. Hogwarts, ministry politics, Mangekyou Sharingan and...sparking school spirit? "Don't take me as alien! I know your politics." The wizards shared a look. "Alien as foreigner. Here. The-saurus says."

** [[/u/__Pers]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't Disrespect the Queen]] has Connor MacLeod from the first /Highlander/ film as Defense teacher.

** In [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-15603/WeyrWolfen+Learning+to+Deceive.htm][Learning To Deceive]] by WeyrWolfen, Willow Rosenberg from Buffy The Vampire Slayer comes to Hogwarts and co-teaches a class with Snape about 'applied defense'. Incomplete, but what's there is very good.

*** So good...and probably never to be finished. Was still a great read though.

** Not a professor, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8827254/1/Batman-Doesn-t-Do-Magic][Batman Doesn't 'Do' Magic]] is a good "character from different fandom" fic.

Also in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3758850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-White-Wizard][Harry Potter and the White Wizard]] Harry Dresden is the DADA professor. Be warned though, Harry (Potter) is a bit of an asshole in this fic.
