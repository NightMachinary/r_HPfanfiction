Be it because it's incomplete, took a route you don't like or was like heaven on Earth, why do you keep thinking about THAT fic at least a few times per year?

The fic I keep in my head was abandoned like 5 years ago and was posted in this Spanish fanfic platform called Amor Yaoi. It was about a really interesting redemption arc for Draco, around his six year; he realized he and his parents had 0% chance at surviving the war, be it because he would fail at killing Dumbledore or just making a mistake and Voldemort disposing of them. So, he got in contact with some people in the order and promptly lit up his manor, basically captured and obliviated his parents Hermione style and then made it look like they died in the fire, leaving "proof" of it behind.

The Order helped him hide his parents and directed him to one of the members that was a retired healer, exiled because of his papers about how muggle and wizarding healing could be used simultaneously. Draco had access to scholarly texts and books and people so he was slowly being des-radicalized. To earn his place he became the house-keeper of a number of safe houses that hid refugees or were temporary headquarters to the Order while also being trained by the healer to assist at giving medical care to the victims of the war.

Because everyone believed him dead, he used a veil and cloak at all times to keep his identity hidden from most. The fic stopped updating at the middle of the war and UGHHHH... IT WAS MY DREAM-FIC!! The writing, the characterization, the plot, the everything... I sometimes wonder at what could and won't ever be... It was also a slow burn Harco and as it is one of my favorite pairings the angst was subtle and exquisite...

I wish I could fall in love with a fic that way again...


** The Fires of Magic by Raolin is one I keep checking to see if the author has updated it (last update Dec 2018). Now the author has three other stories that he has updated in early 2020 (jan, feb, apr) so he is at least still writing. I just keep hoping that his muse for this story will return.

While not listed as a comedy there are a lot of funny scenes in the story. Basic premise is that Harry was running away from Vernon and ended up being cold and lost. He was close to dying when he somehow accessed his magic that he saw as flames behind some glass. At the same time a monk from a magical monastery was sent out to find his apprentice "which magic would take him to". Harry then goes to the monastery to learn how they do magic. (Mind, body, soul)

Several years go by and He eventually gets his letter for Hogwarts to learn how they do magic. On the train he makes friends with Daphne, Tracy, and fem!blaise.

Some of the scenes include

Ah, Mister Potter,” he drawled with the intimidating air of a predator that had just found its prey caught in a trap. “Our ... new ... celebrity.”

“Hi there. Always nice to meet a fan,” he happily responded with the good-humored air of a patient star dealing with an admirer who was too nervous to ask for an autograph.

“Yes,” Snape hissed, his eyes glittering darkly, “I am sure that it is.” His venomous glare was intense enough to make Tracey gulp just from her mere proximity to its target, him. “However, I wonder if you have the talent to match your fame. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”

“I don't know ... a new and improved formula for shampoo?” he blithely answered.

It's just a very fun read that I wish the author would continue and finish. How Harry interacts with his magic and what he can do with it is an interesting concept that I want to see where the author takes it. Right now it's a little over 150K words.

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant monsters, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more.

** “James and Me by Northumbrian” linkao3(8402590), which will probably remain unfinished, because Northumbrian apparently went off the face of the Earth (or fell into heavy depression after Brexit?). I have even tried to write my own finale of the story (linkao3(23267857)), but I know it is not as good as the original would be.

*** Writing your own finale is such a literary power move. I really, really think "fanfiction of fanfiction" should be more of a thing. I've always thought that way since I started writing fanfiction back in 2004 (hell, fanfiction is where I got my writing start and now I have a degree in creative writing), I'm glad to see attitudes changing.

**** I've heard of authors being upset that someone else continues their fic, and my thought is "ok then, you finish it yourself." As if for all the times they wrote that they dont own Harry Potter, they've forgotten that they dont own Harry Potter.

***** Good news! Now there's two fics and you can pick the ending you like.

As someone who holds a degree in creative writing, I can TOTALLY understand getting angry about it...but at the same time if you walked away, you walked away. Communicating with the audience is also important, especially since fanfic authors have greater engagement compared to traditional authors. If you ran out of steam and just can't go on, it's okay to admit it and let someone else take the torch up. That's how we got a lot of great literature in the first place.

** My favorite fic is /Resonance/, by GreenGecko. Though it's the first installment of triad of linked fics, it could also stand alone. She hatched a plot bunny after reading in GOF the likelihood of Snape adopting Harry, which actually occurs in this fic, but in an unforced, organic fashion. Voldemort is dealt with early in this fic, dispatched by a killing curse delivered by Harry that, needing a strong emotion to cast, was powered by his love for his friends. Making a positive adjustment to a postwar reality is difficult for Harry, and the fic explores the PTSD of a veteran who's been overtaken by a pessimistic mindset driven by the continual, unyielding tension of living on perpetual high alert, and almost no direct removal from this existential reality. Snape comes to accept Harry on his own terms, eyeing Harry finally as a kindred spirit. Without a touchy-freely emo vibe, Snape helps Harry to navigate through his PTSD and heal.

I know I'm veering into [[/r/iamverysmart]] territory here, but I really have a passion for this fic. It was written nearly 17 years ago, and is still a pretty compelling read today; I'd stack it up against any other fic favorably. I'd urge anyone who reads HP fanfic to check this out, immediately, if not sooner, and just get lost within the spot-on characterization (making a correction for Snape) and the action that unfolds through the rest of it, which I don't want to spoil, here.

** /Second Chance a life/ and then /Changes in a time of war/ by Miranda Flairgold are excellent fics, basically complete new stories using Harry Potter as a starting point filled with imagination and new magics. However, the third in the series is just two chapters into a worldwide demon invasion and stopped in 2009. It is especially frustrating as they favourited a story from 2014, so they didn't just disappear.
