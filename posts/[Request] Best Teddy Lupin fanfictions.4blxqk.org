Hi! I'm looking for fics about Teddy Lupin during his time at Hogwarts (apart from the obvious HHD, which I've already read). Can anyone help me out? xx

  Teddy Lupin - musician, ladies man, firm believer that as long as he's going to be famous, it's going to be on his own terms. Victoire Weasley - writer, shy, firm believer that if she's going to be famous, she would rather hide in a broom closet for all of Hogwarts. Yet somehow, they find themselves snogging on a platform. But James Potter was not the only thing to get in their way

** linkffn(11412918) The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet is my favourite one so far. It's the second in a series - the first is linkffn(10554013), but I think it's better than the first (although the first is great too- it's just slower). If you're looking for fics with really strong characterisation, I'd definitely check these out- the OCs are some of the best I've ever seen.

** linkao3(1038392)

I've re-read this series so many times and each time it's made me laugh, cry, and just be amazed at the work the author put into it , and how much it parallels the books. The series covers Teddy's 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th year. I've only linked the first year though. You can find the rest in her profile.

EDIT: WRONG link --- put ffn instead of ao3.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

  Written by Enigma. It's a beautifully normal for one of the inhabitants of Privet Drive.
