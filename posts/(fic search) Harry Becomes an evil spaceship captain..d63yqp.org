** A full version is available on the 'Webnovel' app. Beware though, it's a shitty platform prone to crashing and is literally owned by a ludicrously capitalist chinease company who keep all translated stories on a pay wall beyond the first half. I know what your thinking 'but if they translate them, isn't it OK to charge for it?' except the translates make a pittance, and most of the translations were stolen from fan translation site like wuxia World.

I guess what I'm saying is, delete the app after your done with it, it's trash.

** That's the Star Empire by RahXephon. It was removed from the net but a scrubbed version was available on fictionhunt a while back. I'll look to see if I kept an archive of it.

** The start sounds a little like linkffn(I Aim to Misbehave), but that one only has a few chapters, and they're not exactly pirates, just scavengers. And Harry doesn't stay with them.

  Harry Potter escapes from Earth-That-Was via magitech, but goes missing. When he is finally unfrozen in the 26th century, he faces a new oppressive regime in the form of the Alliance while he tries to find the lost magical community in the Verse. Epilogue-compliant, No Power in the 'Verse-compliant.
