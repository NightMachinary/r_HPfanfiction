what the title says. I think I would rather be a muggle because at least I won't know what magic is, and not have to deal with everyone looking down on me and the prejudice and everything. Also it would really suck to see everyone else having magic and waving their wands about when you don't have anything. On the other hand, in the future, a wizard could invent a cure for squibs.

a fanfic that really goes into depth about this is linkao3(15465966) It's called [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] by Eider_Down, and while it is not the main point of the story, there are certain bits that make you realise that most people are really prejudiced against squibs.


** A squib can still use some magic items, right? Why waste money on muggle medicine when the pepper-up cures the cold as a side effect? Whit-sharpening potion before important exams, gillyweed before going snorkelling, bags of holding, even a house elf... there are many ways to make life easier without having to interact with the wizarding world beyond going shopping

**** I feel bad for Petunia as well, although nothing she did was excusable. However, I was never in the territory of Petunia solely taking the blame for the failied relationship between her and Lily. Growing up she'd already be bitter; Lily was already prettier with super eyes (Petunia is 'horse-faced'), and vaguely implied to be smarter, add to that she was loved by all and you've got an overshadowed older sister. So Lily /also/ being magic would've been such a terrifically cruel blow to her self-esteem. Lily definitely won the genetic lottery. My headcanon is that Lily provoked and teased her sister at every given opportunity, sometimes with malice, sometimes without, and this just fuelled the envy and hatred. She is a younger sister after all, and doesn't fall into the meek category, but the /overshadowing/.

** Squib. Being a muggle wouldn't erase the existence of magic, I would just be ignorant about it. As a Squib on the other hand I would know more about whats going on, and even if I cant use magic, I can still interact with it. Nothing would stop me from doing things similar to Filch or Mrs Figgs and work in a magical location or do something similar to breeding Kneazles. And the best part would be having access to magical services like magical healing or the floo network. And being able to buy enchanted items and potions would make life much easier and entertaining. Not to mention that nothing stops you from interacting with the muggle world.

** It really, re-heee-heeaally depends on what kind of connections I start with in the magical world, I.E. what is my family like? If my family is willing to shell out for a decent education, allows me access to the magical resources I /can/ use and are willing to lend a spell every now and again (Big bro can you help me move?), life as a squib could be really interesting.

If I could manage to convince just /one/ wizard or witch that having a highly trained specialist in economics, law or administration on staff is actually useful, the wizarding world could be turned on its' head in a few generations. Hell, just imagine life as a guidance counselor at Hogwarts (which needs more menial staff, badly) or any paper-work heavy position at the ministry. You'd be kicking any wizards' arse in those areas with muggle techniques to back you up.

***** Okay but you're probably thinking of a physical disability. Yes, most paralyzed people I know irl would probably accept a chance to walk.

Without my disorder I would not be the same person. ADD brings me suffering. It hinders my ability to succeed. But it also brings me hyperfixations, one of the great joys in my life. It gives me the ability to procrastinate for months and then churn out a product of remarkable quality in one sleepless night, which has gotten me some passing grades. It inveterately shapes who I am. If I could chose to remove ADD from myself, I wouldn't. I mitigate the worst effects and live with the rest, because that's just living with me.

So I imagine being a squib, and I can't imagine that once I was able to step back and find peace with myself I'd want to change myself.

** Squib. I might not be able to use magic myself but I'd be in a better position than not knowing about magic in the first place.

In the magical world I'm at a severe disadvantage but in the nonmagical world I have an edge over 99.9% of the population, so the ideal strategy would probably make use of that.

Find a way to succeed in the nonmagical world using the knowledge of the magical world without attracting attention from the magical world. Then use money earned this way to hire wizards to do magic for me.

With knowledge of magic AND basic science I might even come up with things that scientifically illiterate wizards might not think of.

Like, buy a two-way mirror and test if it transmits information at light speed or faster than that.

If it's /c/ limited I might be able to get someone to make a simple magic device that sends a simultaneous signal through multiple mirrors to other locations around the country where simple off-the-shelf electronics would measure the exact timing and reverse calculate the position of the sender, effectively inventing a new tracking device that I might find a customer for.

If it's faster than light because magic, then I could maybe make a ton of money in ultra high frequency trading by being a few microseconds faster than the competitors. Either way, I make money.

Eventually, while I might never be able to cast spells myself, it would be possible for me to become the CEO of a research company employing dozens of spellcrafters, enchanters, potioneers and also all the engineers and scientists that already happen to know about magic for various reasons and really want a budget to run experiments on it. We'd invent cool things, sell them, hire more people, and I might become quite powerful indeed.

Definitely preferable to being a normal nobody.

** Muggle for certain - Squibs not only have the disadvantage of not being able to participate in their own world, but they're also at a significant delay (I'm not sure what I could do as a toddler, but these days kids are using iPads before they're 2). So not only have they been homeschooled, but they lack both the environmental experience, vocabulary and curriculum knowledge for the muggle world.

Some kids, would catch up but others could be at a significant delay throughout their education. Especially if we take JKR's indication that until kids are 8, the quill might not be able to tell for weak magic due to the parent's magic.

Worst case scenario, your family subtly arrange your death and/or keep you shut away in a dusty basement.

The theory goes that squibs are somewhere in between ... having not enough magic to use wands, but enough to (for example) see Dementors (assuming Mrs Figg was not just lying) or Hogwarts (otherwise, Filch could hardly work there), and possibly making potions.
