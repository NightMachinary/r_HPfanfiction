Quick preface: this is from a story I'm working on where Ginny and Harry have been together since third year.

I wrote this Skeeter article based on the premise that she would find out that Ginny opened the Chamber of Secrets. I hope I've captured the tone right and I'm open for criticism.

Also: I wasn't really sure what flair to put in this since it didn't fit neatly into any of them.

*Attacks at Hogwarts Finally Solved*

By Rita Skeeter

Anonymous sources have come forward to Daily Prophet reporters and revealed the true cause of the attacks that took place at Hogwarts two years ago. Before, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore had told everyone that the culprit had been caught, but had neglected to say who they were. Even most of the students were not aware. 

Now, we know. 

Anonymous sources have told this reporter that the true culprit was Ginny Weasley, a first year girl at the time, now a third year student and the maniacally obsessed girlfriend of Harry Potter. Weasley opened the previously thought to be mythical Chamber of Secrets and set a basilisk on four students, a cat, and a ghost; none of whom died because of a series of lucky accidents. 

This comes as a shock, compared to her father Arthur's misguided attempts to protect Muggles while his own daughter was attacking Muggle-born students for an entire year. 

The /Daily Prophet/ was denied comment when asking why Weasley is still allowed to be a student at Hogwarts when she nearly caused the school to be closed two years prior. The /Prophet/'s editorial staff believes Miss Weasley should have been expelled when she was caught. 

This is yet another example of the disturbing pattern of Professor Dumbledore putting trust in dangerous individuals; keeping known half-giant Rubeus Hagrid on staff and even teaching classes despite him having been expelled for a disturbingly similar incident to the attacks caused by Miss Weasley and who also kept a ruthless hippogriff that attacked Hogwarts student Draco Malfoy, and hiring Remus Lupin as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor last year, despite Dumbledore having known for decades that Lupin was a werewolf and a danger to everyone around him. Why Professor Dumbledore kept Miss Weasley's culpability a secret is unknown, but shows immense favouritism that anyone could perpetrate such attacks and not be expelled on the spot. 

“This place really has gone to the dogs, letting that Weasley girl stay around,” said fourth year student Draco Malfoy, “she's a danger to everyone around her. Potter's a fool for thinking anything other than that.”

Now, Hogwarts' underage champion Harry Potter allegedly saved Miss Weasley from this basilisk at the end of that year, but this reporter finds it more likely that she lured him to the mysterious chamber and put him under some sort of trance he has not broken out of since, as the two of them started dating only a few months later. This is the only explanation for why someone believed to be a hero could even be friends with a violent individual like Miss Weasley, let alone romantically involved with her. Anonymous sources say Weasley is obsessed with Harry Potter, and could never leave him alone. 

It is uncertain whether Hogwarts will follow the /Prophet/'s recommendation of expelling Miss Weasley at once, but I don't think any of you should hold your breaths. Only time will tell as to what dangerous person Professor Dumbledore puts his trust in next.


** I really like it! Just make sure when you post it in the story, it is obvious that it is an article and where it ends. So maybe a line break or having the article in italics so when it jumps back to whoever is thinking or speaking, the reader knows that it is no longer article. I love the writing though and it feels like you channeled Rita. Congrats!

** I completely and utterly hate it - which likely means that your writing was on point, as I hate Skeeter as much as any non-Umbridge or DE-character.

Seems pretty accurate with how she takes facts and then forms "theories" around those facts to make the worst or most scandalous narrative.

Only thing I might suggest altering is the line about "only likely explanation" near the end into something less absolute - such as "most likely" or "disturbing reasoning"; Skeeter seems like the type to always leave herself an out.

Last thing, this story publishing yet..? And if so, mind linking?

*** Parts of it are published. I'm releasing it as vignettes based on when I write stuff, and not chronologically, so it's definitely not anywhere near complete yet. I've had to delay working on it a lot because of school. This article is going to be from the vignette I release next. And thank you, by the way.

** I think it's very nice written, just could be condensed a little more. Unless the article is a stickler point in the chapter, I know I'd find myself skimming through it. The title and a summary would be better I think. Of course you are the writer, so it's really up to you

** It might depend who knows what. Given how terrifying and prone to collateral damage and animal that can kill on sight can be, I find it hard to believe Lucius knowingly released a Basilisk around his son unless Diary-mort was very persuasive. As even the good guys only worked it out at the last minute and never seemed to talk about it again, unless someone was evesdropping outside the Hospital wing when everybody was packing to go home, how did Skeeta know? Unless she was there personally maybe.

I feel it would be more likely to blame a 'dark artifact' and try to spin it as if she was personally attacking the victims. In addition it sounds less impressive than siccing a Basilisk on them despite no parslemouth connections.

*** My thinking was that either Skeeter or her “anonymous source” (which everyone can figure out is Malfoy) “conveniently forgot” the influence of a dark artifact, because that would remove Ginny's culpability and harm the narrative that Skeeter would be using against her.

** I didn't hate her enough.

It's a good start, but sticks too closely to facts. Rita's entire existence is about writing semi-baseless speculation as though it were fact. This reads just a little too much like an actual news article.

Rita should also use Ginny's friend's quotes entirely out of context. Say you've got Luna as Ginny's best friend in the story - Luna's talking to Harry about a Thestral or something and says "She's a been a little unhinged since term began." Rita would absolutely quote Luna saying that and use it against Ginny.

Juicy and sensational, without any thought to the truth. All Rita cares about is subscriptions and cash.

Just my .02G

** In general, it looks sound. I like it.

What /could/ be corrected (but does not have to):

Repetition of "Anonymous sources". It just sounds contradictory - they're annonymous, but they have attention repeatedly drawn to them?

In the second paragraph for example it could be "This reporter managed to find out..." instead. It conveys the same thing, and makes it seem like Rita put in effort. Very Rita.

​

Additionally, it feels a bit out of character for Rita to suggest a 'solution' directly. She thrives on sensationalizing the events and getting people to react, but I've not seen her to tell them what to do, only nudge and stand back. This way, she can get credit if successful, but say she was only reporting the truth as she knew it if the article is not receieved well or something happens down the line.

So, she'd point out that Ginny is not getting punished, and let the mob do the rest. Suggesting expulsion does not sound serious enough for the image painted, and suggesting Azkaban would be too drastic for Rita's articles. Her article about Hermione comes to mind - she hinted at potions, but didn't demand she be punished. The letters filled with sap still came.

Some sentences do not flow well:

#+begin_quote
  This comes as a shock, compared to her father Arthur's misguided\\
  attempts to protect Muggles while his own daughter was attacking\\
  Muggle-born students for an entire year. 
#+end_quote

This could be broken up into a few shorter ones, ie:

#+begin_quote
  This comes as a shock, especially given that her father, Arthur Weasley, is employed in our Ministry's Misuse of Muggle artifacts office.

  Mr. Weasley has always been quite complimentary about Muggles and their 'inventions' but how that will change in the light of recent events is unknown. The usually outspoken man has declined to comment.
#+end_quote

Rita Rules seem simple to me:

*Hint at things a lot.

*Avoid definitive statements.

*Use short, simple sentences - this allows for easier and quicker reading.

*If someone does not give a statement, make sure to point it out. Better they get the howlers than you!
