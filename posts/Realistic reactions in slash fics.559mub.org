I'm a sucker for slash fics. But one of the things that bugs me is the ridiculous reactions from the other characters when Harry (or whoever, but it's usually Harry) tells them that he's gay. I've seen everything from completely homophobic Rom and Hermione where they disown Harry and try to kill him, to no reaction whatsoever, to suddenly everybody's gay! I know that some of these reactions do happen. I had a high school friend get kicked out of her house when she told her parents she was gay, and to my knowledge they still don't speak. But I find it to be horribly out of character for most of the people in HP.

So, my question is this: if Harry told his friends/class mates that he was gay, how do you think they would have reacted?

I think Hermione would have run to the library for books of safe sex and done research on how marriage laws differ from those in the Muggle world.

Ron would have been a bit weirded out. It would have taken him some time to get used to the idea, and Harry probably would have needed to reassure him that just because he likes men doesn't mean he's been checking Ron out in the Quidditch locker room. Eventually, Ron would have been ok with it.

Neville wouldn't care at all. He'd probably bring up some relative or friend of the family who is gay.

Malfoy is probably a homophobe. He's been raised to believe in pure blood and carrying on the family name, and I don't think surrogates and adoptions would count in his family's mind, so I bet he's been told that such things are "unnatural". But he's actually probably in the closet so he harasses Harry because he's ashamed of himself.


** Hermione would definitely run to the library. Since HP is set in the 90s AND hasn't changed as much as muggle society from Victorian times (where homosexuality was illegal & folks were regularly jailed for it) Harry would probably become a punchline in the Daily Prophet and folks who don't know him would disapprove.

It's unlikely he could adopt a wizarding kid, since gay parents couldn't adopt back then (same sex marriage became legal in 2005 in the U.K. I think). Also I think Harry would find respite in the muggle gay scene since there are many more muggles than wizards and their LGBT underground is similarly larger.

I don't think Neville would care, but his grandmother would and would try to forbid Neville from seeing Harry so Harry's homosexuality and bad reputation wouldn't 'taint' Neville. Molly Weasley would cluck over what a shame it is that Harry won't have kids. Malfoy would be a bigot, but even if he were closeted, he would probably take an attitude of 'who cares what my private desires are, arranged marriages don't have to involve love or even sex past the heir's conception, shame on potter for being weaker than me and giving in to his desires, I am so much better blah blah blah' (and then he would pay for prostitutes on the side like tons of conservative hypocrites with 'unfortunate' desires).

The attitudes toward LGBT people have changed drastically in the last two decades in the muggle world, gotta remember that.

Edit: BUT! Hopefully Dumbledore would get off his closeted ass and actually do something about school wide bullying towards Harry, UNLIKE when the teachers did zilch for Harry when the Triwizard tournament happened. Hopefully.

Why do you think so? Sure, there's a metric ton of fanfics --- particularly Slytherin-centric --- with pureblood marriage contracts and chaperons and "reputations" (and a metric ton of fanfics where Slytherins have /all the sex/, compared to the prudish Gryffindors), but there's no canon evidence of the 90s wizardly sexual mores being particularly different from those of Muggles.

In fact, IIRC, there's a scene that has the Gryffindor Quiddich team --- both its male and female members --- talking about something while changing before or after the game, suggesting that their locker rooms are not split by sex. (I can try to find and quote it, if you want.) Now, this is probably a continuity error by JKR, rather than intentional setting element, but the point is that if anything, magical society is /more/ egalitarian, not less.

It also makes more sense for the wizarding society to be more generally egalitarian than the contemporaneous Muggle society, since the wand is the great equalizer, everybody has one on them at all times, and has had one for millennia.

**** Girls can go into boys' dormitories but boys are magically prevented from going into girls' rooms. That is not a sign of radical sexual equality at Hogwarts, it's a sign of old sexuality stereotypes like 'boys are more sexual and can't be trusted to behave around girls'. I don't see any evidence that Hogwarts is any more sexually liberal than the muggle world tbh.

It may have been more egalitarian in gender because magical strength was more important than physical strength in a lot of ways, but that doesn't necessarily extend to sexuality equality.

You can think girls are awesome while thinking that boys who sleep with other boys are perverts. They don't have anything to do with each other, really, despite the fact that misogyny and homophobia often play off each other in different ways.

{For examples of how gender equality =/= sexuality equality:

Person A is misogynistic and homophobic. Person A: Those gay guys are gross! One of them must take the woman's role in the bedroom. That guy is pathetic, because women are awful and doing anything that resembles womanhood is gross. Gay guys have cooties just like women!

Person B is homophobic but not misogynistic. Person B: Gay guys are gross! There must be something wrong with them because they are not attracted to the awesome women around them. They are deluded into thinking that other types of sex is just as good as PIV sex. Vaginas and the people with them are great.

Person C is misogynistic but not homophobic. Person C: Yeah, women suck, but if you want a son, you'll just have to grit your teeth and sleep with one. Just pretend that it's your amazing male lover, it'll be over soon and in nine months you can start beating her again.

Person D is not homophobic or misogynistic. Person D: Everyone should be like me.

The End +apologies for the cissexism+}

Good point on the dormitories, but that's pretty much the /only/ instance of asymmetry we see, and every other indication indicates equal or greater egalitarianism than that of the Muggle Britain of the time. And, that one instance happens to be one that's incorporated into Hogwarts infrastructure, so it's likely to be a holdover from when it was built.

Regarding the distinction between sexism and heterosexism, I was responding specifically to the line that I had quoted, which was about Victorian mores in particular. It is, of course, possible for a society with low sexism to have high heterosexism, but the case for a very heterosexist society that you had presented was relying on the premise that the wizarding society "hasn't changed as much as muggle society from Victorian times", which is what I was refuting by pointing out that the wizarding society was actually quite egalitarian (so what we can say about Victorian mores isn't applicable).

****** Second example: Skeeter's treatment of Hermione in the Daily Prophet drew on particularly sexist tropes (a 14 year old girl is a gold digger and taking advantage of Harry and of Krum, who is at least 17). And instead of refuting that attitude, adult witch Molly Weasley slighted Hermione until Harry told her that they weren't dating. and we see that Ron has internalized a bit of a slutshaming attitude towards Ginny's boyfriends, so again- regardless of hypothetical gender equality, sexual attitudes aren't demonstrated to be liberal compared to muggle society by the 'liberal' muggle loving blood traitor family.

I guess I can see your point about Victorian mores, but I do think it's likely that a society which went from being part of an enormous society of muggles to being a semi-closed, much smaller society is more likely to stagnate and remain more similar to the time period at which the statute of secrecy was enacted due to said closed, smaller population and therefore fewer innovations/innovative people pushing to advance this tiny culture in the centuries since. And we have a significant portion of the population who deliberately isolate themselves from muggles and their newfangled ideas of social progress, too.

Kreacher's treatment in Grimmauld Place and Dobby's arc throughout the series is deliberately meant to invoke the Victorian era, the role of household servants, and the stagnation of wizarding society, I believe, which is part of why modern muggleborn hermione finds it so offensive- it's abusive AND outdated- and it is telling that she has so much trouble finding support for the basic position of 'sentient beings should not be abused by their employers'. I don't think it can all be put down to student apathy and her winning personality. so yes, I think canon does deliberately refer to the Victorian era several times- grimmauld place is basically trapped in time, and house elf treatment is a call back to household servant abuse, and wizards write with freaking quills, which is an huge symbol of upperclass victorian society.

So heterosexist attitudes are not only a given in HP because they were a given in the muggle 90s (and still today), but I don't really see *why* we shouldn't presume a mixture of muggle Victorian and muggle present day heterosexist attitudes in HP given how many deliberate Victorian references there are throughout the series.

(However, I do think that if Dumbledore had come out, perhaps with a long term partner, and cannily planned his path towards acceptance, heterosexism in the wizarding world would have undergone a seismic shift. The population being small means it's easier to move the needle if an immensely powerful person upends a common attitude. Think of Winston Churchill coming out. It would change LGBT acceptance fast.)

To be fair, Rita is a horrible person to pretty much everyone she talks to. Even if Hermione wasn't female, she would find something else to use against her in order to shame and embarass her. If it were Ron being shamed instead of Hermione, then Rita would shame Ron for coming from a poor family, and perhaps she would try and perhaps portray Ron as being jealous of Krum as a bonus. To me, Rita isn't a sexist person, she's just a spiteful person who would belittle and put down anyone she wants no matter who they are. Even Dumbledore isn't immune from having his reputation be damaged by her, even though he is the most powerful wizard in the world and respected by many people.

If anything, Molly's reaction to Hermione being shamed is simply an example to show the reader just how influential Rita is (which is reinforced in OotP when Harry and Dumbledore's reputations come under fire), and by extension, how gullable the wizarding world are when it comes to fact-checking since they'd believe anything the Daily Prophet and/or the Ministry says. Which says less about sexism and more about the wizarding world's inability to notice that newspapers and/or their government can be biased and corrupt when they want to be.

But the first female Minister for Magic was in the 1700s... meanwhile the muggle took until 1979 to get a female prime minister, and if we included America, then it still doesn't have one. To add onto that, the wizarding world is confirmed to not have any examples of actual racism based on skin colour at all. Never is a black or asian character discriminated against for their race. Kingsley (a black character) even became Minister of Magic in 1998 and lasted for about 20 years, which means Kingsley became Minister 10 years before the USA got a non-white president and the UK doesn't have a non-white prime minister even to this day.

The one character that would be most likely to be racist (Voldemort) isn't racist against non-whites at all, even though he grew up in a muggle orphanage (thus could have been influenced by muggle racism at the time) and it was the 1930s (which wasn't exactly a progressive time for muggles). Yet despite both of those factors, Voldemort doesn't care about racism at all since skin colour is irrelevant to wizards. Voldemort believes he is better than everyone else no matter what gender or race they are. The only discrimination in the wizarding world is based on species (e.g. discrimination against anyone who isn't fully human) or blood purity (e.g. discrimination against muggles, squibs, and to a lesser extent, muggleborns).

So when it comes to sexism and racism, both are non-existent in the wizarding world and if it does exist, then the wizarding world is far less racist and far less sexist than the muggle world. The wizarding world only discriminates against non-humans, muggles, and squibs. To a lesser extent, muggleborns are also discriminated against but not as much.

Though Kreacher isn't a human being so its doesn't count. Notice that no human being is ever treated the way that Kreacher was. The closest thing to a human servant in all the books is Wormtail's role in the Death Eaters, and even then, he's not forced to serve Voldemort. He can leave if he wants and has the right to do so (unlike the non-human Kreacher), he just chose to stay by Voldemort's side. I know some people compare the treatment of House Elves to slavery in regards to how House Elves are used but really, its not the same. House Elves aren't human and thus don't have human rights. The entire reason that slavery was so terrible was because humans enslaved other humans and treated them as property, which completely ignores human rights.

Also, the people who mistreat House Elves were generally morally questionable (if not outright evil) people already. The Malfoys (evil) mistreated Dobby, Crouch Sr (morally questionable) mistreated Winky, and to a lesser extent, Sirius (good with some morally questionable moments) mistreated Kreacher. On that note, given Kreacher's obsession with pureblood supremacy and how pureblood supremacy is synonymous with evil in the HP series, Kreacher deserved what he got from Sirius since Kreacher wasn't good. The morally good characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, Arthur, etc) don't mistreat House Elves, and Sirius has never mistreated any House Elf aside from Kreacher.

While the wizarding world has several backwards things which are approved of in-universe, owning human servants isn't one of them. There is a perfectly good reason why Imperio is an Unforgivable Curse and why using it against a human being gets someone life in Azkaban, since clearly the wizarding world does not accept making another human into a slave/servant/puppet/etc.

In defense of the wizarding world's LGBT acceptance, not only did JKR confirm that the wizarding world isn't homophobic (unlike the muggle world), but *the reason Dumbledore didn't come out as gay was because Grindelwald (the man he was in love with) was pretty much wizard Hitler. If Dumbledore had fell in love with someone who wasn't a dark wizard (e.g. Elphias Doge, Horace Slughorn, etc), then nobody in the wizarding world would care if Dumbledore was gay. Dumbldore's relationship with Grindelwald would LITERALLY be like if Churchill was attracted to Hitler and if the two were formerly friends, so Dumbledore definitely does not reflect a normal relationship.*

Even Rita Skeeter didn't care that Dumbledore was gay, even though she heavily implied that she knew he was gay. The thing she emphasized was that Grindelwald was a dark wizard and that Dumbledore was once close with him, which isn't an attack on Dumbledore's sexuality but rather its an attack on Dumbledore in general. It might make others doubt Dumbledore or question him for having befriended (and loved) someone like Grindelwald.

The only reason I could ever see a wizard ever being against LGBT acceptance is if a wizard was a pureblood supremacist and wanted their son/daughter to have children and produce more heirs (which says more about their pureblood supremacy than their LGBT views). Naturally a witch/wizard being homosexual would go against the wish for having more heirs. Meaning that someone like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't care if he knew Dumbledore was gay since Lucius already hates Dumbledore. The worst Lucius would say about Dumbledore is try and blacken his reputation by mentioning Grindelwald's dark past, but then Lucius' attack wouldn't be about Dumbledore's sexuality but would be about the specific man that Dumbledore loved. However Lucius would obviously get angry if Draco happened to be since Draco is HIS son and part of the family, so Lucius would care more if it was Draco than if it were anyone else.

** As a gay person myself, as much as I do hate saying it, I can safely say that reactions tend to vary between what we're always shown as in fics. I can safely say that I have seen it from both sides of the fence and I have seen people shunned and forced to leave because of it, but I have seen some tear-filled hugs that have seen a lot of tension removed with two words.

I have told a few people of my sexual orientation (irl) and they have reacted differently. One just sighed and made a deal of getting out money, as if he had placed a bet. Another reacted poorly and we no longer speak, and one asked whether I thought he was hot. He was upset when I sad that I'd feel weird if I said he was attractive.

The reason why I dislike most slash is because gay people are portrayed wrong. Some gay males may cry the moment things go wrong, but most of us are 'straight acting' and don't use feminine hand gestures. I see this so frequently that it's jarring to read Harry bursting out in tears because he was denied a sexual interaction between Ron.

Everyone is different, and a lot of writers handle 'coming out' badly and stick to tropes to ease the process. Someone could just stare blankly then leave, not phased. Some could cheer and state that it was brave for them to do it. It can add so much depth if characters handle the situation differently.

Can we also address the fact that in the main pairing is gay that 90% of everyone else ends up gay as well?

Anyway, I believe that Ron, Neville, and Hermione would take it well. Ron'd be a bit 'sus' about it at first, but he'd pull through. Draco'd just use it against Harry no matter if he was also gay.

** It is my belief that Hermione would be totally accepting of it.

Ron would be "weirded out", but would eventually come to terms with it, He would totally be "that guy" who says "I'm not homophobic BUT..." and then say something totally homophobic, even if he doesn't mean to be cruel. Hermione has to remind him from time to time that certain words are not politically correct.

I agree that Neville would probably be totally cool with it, he'd come up with the argument that "Harry is still Harry so why should I care?".

Draco....hmmm, I mean canonically, I can envision him utilizing the fact that someone is gay simply as a means of being a jerk. Draco will pick on what people are most insecure about and if it is their sexuality then he will go for that. Wither or not I think he's actually homophobic? I don't think so (the fact that I ship Drarry may or may not make my opinion biased, haha)

So for the most part I totally agree with you.

** Hmm. Well, JKR has said homosexuality is not ment to be a big deal in the wizarding world. Now, unforunately, she chose not to acually showcase that fact, considering the only cannonically gay character she created seems to hide that fact. But let's just assume for a second it's true.

Ron would in that case, be the most accepting then, considering he was raised by a pure blood family, with pretty much no muggle influences. I'd assume te same applies t Malfoy and Neville, actually. Malfoy already makes jokes involving Harry's relations when you think about it- Calling Ginny his girlfriend back in CoS, or helping spread the rumour about Hermione in GoF. He would simply change target to boys instead of girls.

Honestly, I feel like Hermione would be more weirded out, due to some subconcious social stigma. Either that or she would already know before Harry even tells her. She tends to figure out things pretty fast.

*** Hrm that's interesting. I wonder why that is? You'd think that someone so obsessed with blood purity would be a bigot in other senses as well.

My husband suggested that the purebloods might treat it like the old British aristocracy. Where you marry an acceptable woman, do your duty to provide an heir, and have a "boy toy" on the side that is kind of an open secret. (I honestly don't know if this was actually a thing, but he's the history nut, and I didn't bother researching it.)
