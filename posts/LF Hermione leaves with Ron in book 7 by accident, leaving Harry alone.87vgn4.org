That is pretty much all I remember about it. Currently watching the movie and remembered the story. I think he comes back jaded, and the paring is probably Harry and daphne/tracy/something equally clich√©. I've seen it mentioned quite a bit, but I can't for the life of me find it again.


** When it comes to this scenario, I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), the best. It's almost my favorite H/Daphne fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8286141/1/Harry-Potter-Death-s-Ultimatum][Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum]], linkffn(8286141), is ok.

*** I can't tell if you were making a stab at conventional HP/DG stories or if you consider the story to actually be a HP/DG ship.

If you do consider it HP/DG, why? I'm not sarcastically asking, it's just not the vibe I got at all and I'm curious if you picked up on something more subtle that I missed?

** I know a few stories where Hermione and Ron leave or miss the Horcrux hunt. I'm pretty sure, however, it wasn't Daphne because I don't like her. If you're interested I could have a look in my archive.\\
On the other hand, it looks like you're happy with betrayal...
