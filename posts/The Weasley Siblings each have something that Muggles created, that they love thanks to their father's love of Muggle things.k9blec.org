** Ron has a toy airplane (a British Airways 747... I used to have one) that the Twins accidentally charmed to fly as an apology for the Teddy bear/Spider incident.

Ginny has a Barbie whose hair she likes to brush and share girl secrets with.

The Twins have a whoopee cushion and a pack of those shocking gum sticks. They didn't have to look far for inspiration for their more magical inventions (fake candy that does something to your body? That's half their product line!).

Percy has a mechanical calculator. He grew up playing with it, and then learning how to actually use it as he got older. Whenever the chaos of the Burrow got to be too much, he could take it out and fiddle with it.

Charlie has a hardbound copy of a collection of Muggle fairy tales, many of which end in the hero defeating the mean dragon or evil wizard and saving the girl. When Ginny was born, he used to take her for walks in her carriage and pretend to protect her, a fallen stick becoming a powerful wand or razor sharp sword to fight back the various ill-meaning monsters lurking about.

Bill has a toy pyramid that you can pull apart to see the pharaoh's chamber and the treasure room, complete with scale treasure chests and a detailed plastic sarcophagus. It came with a little picture book that, using colorful pictures and simple words, breaks down Egyptian history for kids. In third year, when he took runes class, he was VERY happy to find out that the mummy's curse was real and was actually based in magic he could learn about.

** I know this is supposed to be all sweet and heartwarming, but the first thing that I thought of was that Ginny just straight up has a gun for some reason, and none of the other Weasleys know what it is so they just let her keep it thinking its a toy.

*** Not what I had in mind, but, I mean, adult Ginny could totally become intrerested in the shooting range, lol. That'd be really neat to read. Bad ass Ginny using a gun.
