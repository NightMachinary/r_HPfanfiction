** If you want a long one my series about my oc has tons of battles in it where she both blocks, counters and sends out the first attack. Might not name the spells some of the time but it describes them for those who might not remember all of the spells names

** This focuses more on use of environmental stuff and some potions. Pardon the formatting errors, I haven't made it to this chapter in the rewrite yet.

** Depends how you define counter. There's a couple of different ways to avoid a spell, you can dodge, shield, move something in front of it (prefereably a bad guy). Do you mean that, while the spell is in the air, the character shoots out another spell that specifically nullifies the incoming spell? Do you mean something less general, like in my fic I have Harry and friends 'counter' a spell which is essentially a compressed fiendfyre bomb in the Hogwarts great hall.
