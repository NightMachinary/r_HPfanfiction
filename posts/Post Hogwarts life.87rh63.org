Title pretty much says it. Any fics which are post-Hogwarts. Preferably their would be a large number of sequels or continuation fics by the same author. Thanks


** Have you heard the legend of little0bird? It's not a story non Harry/Ginny shippers would tell you.

** linkffn(These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo)

Great fanfic that starts right after the last chapter (before the epilogue) ends. Mostly sticks to canon and what was said by Rowling in interviews, with a few other things added in. The author is weekly posting the sequel now.

Edit: I don't know why the fanfictionbot never works for me. Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have]]

*** I am liking the sequel but wish it was all posted at once as I believe it was already written prior to posting. I get why it isn't, but I have no impulse control and couldn't hold off on reading as the story updated, which I think ultimately hurts the overall reading experience. Again, totally on me. But still.
