My friends and I got to discussing HP fanfiction we would write if we could write and the most divisive fic was a Rita Skeeter fic based on either /The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore/ or /Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of the Demob/. And to me it seems like the perfect opportunity to do some serious character bashing. I mean for all the Dumbledore haters and people who like to point out the imperfections of characters - there are far to few Rita Skeeter fics. There is plenty of opportunity for the DA to be explored as OCs in Skeeter's rumors, lies, and half truths. And talk about the crap Skeeter could have come with on Dumbledore, some juicy partly true rumors about a man few truly knew.

Also we weren't sure if you can write a fanfic on them for legal reasons. And if you know of any worthy Skeeter fics please suggest, my google foo came up empty for the most part.

p.s is this a suggestion or discussion flair worthy?


** I haven't seen that much well written Ritas. She is a very complex character, I imagine. I personally would be interested in her origins. Why is she the ruthless mudracker that she is? Where does this almost sadistic love for hurtful gossip come from?

When did she come across her bug animagus? When did she start to write? Has she already been a gossip queen in Hogwarts or did she gradually become the writer that she is as she followed what the public wanted?

*** Yeah, and my impression was it was never meaningless muckraking. You have to give her an agenda that each article then furthers. It's not a one dimensional plot.

** Not quite Rita Skeeter, but linkffn(Etc Etc and Life Goes On) is a next-gen fic that follows her niece--an acerbic, anti-hero journalist. I really enjoyed it for having a main character who wasn't necessarily sympathetic, as well as for being a huge breath of fresh air.

Doesn't have the DA or clever character bashing, but lies, half-truths and manipulations abound.

I'm with you, though, in that actual Rita Skeeter fics would be cool. I think [[/u/TurtlePig]] has has the answer in that she's teeth-gnashingly difficult to write, without having the broad appeal of the other hard-to-write characters (e.g. Snape & Luna)

** I think it's partly why there aren't a ton of Umbridge fics either. The character is so repulsive that it's damn near impossible to get over the ick of it, and write the piece. Voldemort had sincerely held motivations. He's evil, but there's a point to it. The Malfoys are haughty and self-important, but again they have clear motivations.

Skeeter and Umbridge are just hateful.

** I think of Rita Skeeter as JKR's own particular brand of author tract. Jo has feuded with the British tabloid press on numerous occasions over several different issues. I remember an interview with her where she said she specifically made Vernon a /Daily Mail/ reader because he was odious and that how she saw their readership. So, in that regard I think that Rita is quite different than most of her other characters.

Rita is also rather limited by what she can do. If she says something, the reader isn't sure if it's true or not so she can't be used as an authority on any particular topic. She might be able to introduce sideplots, but can't really see them through to their conclusion given her unreliable nature.

linkffn(6479080) has a Rita Skeeter in a prominent role, but saying anything more than that would be a spoiler. Be warned: it has the Harry-leaves-the-magical-world trope.

** If you happen to understand German there is "Harry Potter: Auserw√§hlter oder Ausgenutzter?", which is the biography she wrote after Harry's defeat of Voldemort.
