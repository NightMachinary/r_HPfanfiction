** Tbf, I never have any idea what to get my friends for presents.

So whatever their one interest is, they're getting one of those things.

You like football? Congratulations, here is yet another pair of gloves that we both know you don't need.

You like reading? Here's a bookmark for every birthday you will ever have.

You talked vaguely about one Game of Thrones once? Here's all the GoT memorabilia for every present until one of us dies.

I have no idea what else to get you so you're getting generic hobby things.

** The reason is probably because most fanfic writers don't play sports. I certainly don't, and my understanding of sports as a phenomenon is pretty minimal

** The Weasleys are poor and their equipment is probably crappy plus they're all still growing, therefore needing bigger sizes?

** I used to play baseball, and I'll tell you right now that it's not a case of the gifts improving performance, as much as it's about the thought. Like if I got a new glove for my birthday, it was telling me that I could begin breaking it in earlier than if I waited.

**** I'm not the one you asked but I did play Little League when I was a kid and might be able to answer.

If you get a new glove as a gift it will usually be before you decide/need/ can afford to buy yourself a new glove. That way you can have a new glove broken in before or sooner than if you had bought your own.

As for the bats? I have not heard of seasoning a wooden bat and I don't think there's any way you can season an aluminum bat.

** sports gifts are fairly common in canon, Harry gets a broom care kit and a book about quidditch just off the top of my head. they're not great gifts, but as someone who's terrible at gift-giving I can understand going with an easy/generic option.

** Magic probably takes care of knocking in a bat for you. There's gotta be charms for that. Comfort charms for the shoes too, and if anything, new items are bought because the charms end up wearing out causing the items to become older and tatty, or because newer/better versions are made (like with Brooms). And getting the Weasleys Quidditch equipment is a change from "Buy the Weasley twins Joke bools or Muggle Prank items" sort of thing.

Magic takes care of most problems.
