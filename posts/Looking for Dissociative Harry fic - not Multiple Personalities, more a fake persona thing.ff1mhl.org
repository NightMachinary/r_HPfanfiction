Looking for a Dissociative Harry fanfic - not Multiple Personalities, but wearing a fake persona

Hi! i‘m looking for a story where Harry has a Dissociative Disorder - not multiple Personalities, but hiding behind a fake persona. His glasses have some kind of notice me not runes on them...

They figure it out after a couple years, and Harry sees a psychologist who makes him tell a secret to Sirius every day - and Sirius doesn‘t realise that those little tidbits are actually true. If I remember correctly, Tom Riddle takes over and pretends to be Harrys psychologist. And sends him courting gift, maybe?

It was an amazing fic and I would love to read it again, but can‘t find it...

Thank you for your help!

  When Harry Potter does things, it's never in halves. By the time he arrives at Hogwarts, our little champion has discovered a way to keep everyone at bay. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable? Shameless AU. Rated M for a lack of moral conscience, the occasional murder, and graphic dark themes (because why not?). Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.
