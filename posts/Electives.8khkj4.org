What kind of magical elective classes do you think would be interesting to have at a magical school? I mean, the Hogwarts list has only seven. (Two of which I don't really count since Alchemy relies on sufficient demand and apparition is kinda meh... the other classes are Muggle studies, Study of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, and Divination) What if there were more? What would they be?

***** Yeah, but I don't really consider the movies canon for that sort of thing. According to JKR, the only wizarding games were Exploding Snap, Wizard Chess and Gobstones. Kind of boring, especially when fan fiction writers seem to think that those could be the only things that exist. With so many Muggle-borns, I'm sure someone brought a few D&D books to school at some point.

Dumbledore's portrait was able to think creatively on his own, finishing up the original's plan with Snape and the memories.

They're not trying to "impersonate" a person like an actor would. They're acting how they are programmed to act, like a video game character.

****************** Your comparison of the portraits to actors really doesn't fit what Rowling says about them. Sure, the Headmasters spent a long time teaching their portraits how to act like them, but this is more akin to a programmer teaching an AI about what they're supposed to do and/or say. Like I said, actors are already people with their own thoughts, experiences, and (most importantly) lives. They can be taught to act like someone and then eventually stop their mimicking and go back to being themselves. The portraits cannot do that. All they do is act like the person they're depicting just as they have been programmed to do. The Headmasters teaching them to act more like them is pretty much their way of programming the portraits to being more sufficient and realistic AI. The magic behind the portraits is a similar yet more advanced version of the magic behind howlers and moving pictures. Howlers have the ability speech, not because they're alive (which they're not), but because they are letters programmed by magic to speak. They project a recording of the users voice to the recipient of the letter (kind of like a voicemail). The moving pictures are pictures of a subject that in movement, which repeats on a loop (like a gif). The moving portraits bring together both ideas into one thing. The similarities between all three is that they are all programmed to do this with the help of magic. In the Harry Potter universe, one cannot use magic to create life, but one can use it to mimic life. That is the nature of moving portraits. I'm saying your understanding is untrue because it implies that those steps result in a being that is completely alive, when that really isn't the case. It isn't alive. It's programmed to mimick life.

******************** I'm not confusing any lore. I don't even follow Tolkien's lore. Magic can't be used to create life in the Harry Potter universe and the Sorting Hat is no exception. The Sorting Hat is also a result of extremely complex spells, this time from four different people with different personalities, attitudes, and priorities. This makes it seem as though the Sorting Hat has life, when in all actuality, it does not. It's an enchanted hat. Dementors and Dragons weren't created by magic in the Harry Potter universe. They're magical, sentient creatures. You can't categorize them as the same thing as the Sorting Hat. Also, it's not the /way/ the portraits act that prove they are not living beings. It's the way they were made. I've already proved and explained this to you. The portraits are pretty much magical versions of Artificial Intelligence.

(And we don't /know/ where the magical creatures came from, but considering we know about things like the 'experimental breeding ban' and the origins of Quintapeds, it does seem likely at least some of the magical creatures were created by wizards long ago from non-magical ones.)

They're nothing more than magic powered AI. Also, the way you enterpret Rowling's mentions of the Sorting Hat doesn't mean the Sorting Hat is an actual person. She wrote about the making of the Sorting Hat and how he was just a hat owned by Gryffindor that was later bewitched by all the founders to be able to sort Hogwarts students into their appropriate Houses. In fact, she described the Hat as an "enchanted object" in her writing about the Sorting Hat, not a living, sentient being. In the case of magical creatures, you're also misinterpreting their origins. Wizards breeding animals to have traits they want is pretty much the same as humans breeding dogs or cats to have they traits they want. That doesn't mean that magical creatures were created by wizards. It just means that magic creatures were already existing animals before wizards commenced their selective breeding.

******** From the thread I read between you two, I think one important factor to note is that the magical world is aware of life after death and the existence of a soul.

It may very well be that "life" is defined by something having a soul, or similar spiritual presence in the mortal world. The magicals may just not have the same issue of defining "alive" as we do. Our understanding of life is very much based on sentience, physical life-signs, and even then the lines get blurry often enough. To argue with our own understanding of life may just not apply in the magical world.

But if there /isn't/ a benevolent god, then the way souls work is relegated to just a natural phenomenon that has no bearing on philosophy. If wizards have souls and the Sorting Hat none, it just means that wizards have a vastly extended "lifespan" compared to the Hat, and that's that.

That is blatantly ignoring the way philosophical assumptions work in the first place. All philosophy stems from observation and logical conclusion. I highly doubt all wizarding philosophy is diletantic bachelor degree level poststructuralism that ignores any sort of scientific methodical research. I'll gladly admit that there might be magical philosophy out there that denies the /importance/ of a soul, but in terms of determining wether something is alive or not, the soul is probably one of the biggest factors to recognize in whatever philosophical discourse is happening in the magical world.

It would be interesting to know what happens with kissed people/bodies to determine how magical /society/ (not individuals who may harbour emotional ties to an empty husk) deals with the soulless. Are they discarded? Are they preserved and cared for? If its the first we can conclude that the definition of life anchors itself on the soul. If its the second we can deduce there are other factors to it.

Calling that /defence/ is an interesting translation with those connections in mind.

******* The point I was (somewhat hamfistedly) driving at is that you really don't "get" a script that's more than a pure sound-value alphabet or syllabary unless you have more than a bull's notion of the language and culture it's designed to serve. Runes are more than mere sound-value letters in an alphabet. Sure, you can use them that way, but you're missing part of what makes that script uniquely itself.

I suspect part of what makes this tricky to explain is that as a modern english speaker you're used to standardised orthography in an alphabet that has no meaning beyond its sound-values: as a mode of written communication in a post-enlightenment culture with printing presses and message transmission more advanced than cleft-stick runners, it is without equal.

If your letters mean more than their sound-values, however, and you /don't/ have strong standards of orthography, and every text has to be hand-written on expensive materials, you get as much mileage as yo can out of your letters and alter the spelling of your words to use characters that gloss the meaning of the word, or use a synonym or even a kenning of your word to bring in the runes you want to use.

So if you want to talk about the sea, you could write 'harr', and the double-raido at the end doubles up on 'journey', and reinforces 'joy of the horseman, toil of the steed'. Or you could call it mastallr, 'stall of the seagull', which opens with the runes for 'man' and 'wealth'. One of those is how you'd say it if you booked passage on a ship. The other is if you're joining a viking crew, off a-raiding. (Especially since seagulls are coastal birds, and that's where your targets are...)

Don't take those examples as actual scholarship, btw. They're what I came up with without cracking a book. (I'm loads better with coptic and hieroglyphs, where the shading of meaning based on how you write the word is a /lot/ clearer.)

My apologies: I didn't see what you were driving at. The /obvious/ answer would be Old English, since that would have been the language of the majority of Hogwarts students at the time it was founded - runes themselves were made illegal in England shortly after the school was founded on account of the Roman church wanted everyone using their script.

However, Hogwarts was founded in the north of what is now Scotland, and there was a strong norse influence there, with heavy colonisation, with its high-water mark just before Hogwarts was founded and the strongest influence in the Highlands and Islands. If the Founders wanted to hire an instructor in Runes - or just consult someone - that would have been the nearest source, and one coming from a much longer and stronger tradition of using runes in divination and enchantment. The anglo-saxons might've inherited it, but they had centuries less experience with it and centuries /more/ of the church deprecating the practise of non-christian magic.

Old Frisian comes in a distant third, that had become Old English in the British Isles (and you can actually hear it in old-people Geordie, which isn't far from being mutually intelligible with Ostfriesland dialect to this day)

*********** Early mediaeval british hill-fort: ditch-and-bank with a palisade and buildings inside, some of which might have been influenced by the gaelic and pictish tradition of round tower construction, which in Scotland goes back to the Iron Age.

Motte-and-bailey castles were the coming thing in fortification at the end of the 10th century, but had barely made it to England, let alone Scotland.

It /might/ have had some Roman influence: Salazar, judging by his name, was a basque, and as such would have been familiar with the remains of Roman Hispania, and if Rowena Ravenclaw was, to her friends, Hrothwin of Ravenglass, she would have grown up in a town built on a long-disused roman naval base, part of the western end of the /Limes Britannicus/. (And she latinised her name, so probably a classicist to boot, fitting in with the enduring historical image of scholarship.)

The roman influence would have squared off the fortification as much as the terrain allowed (not much in the Highlands), added half-round towers to the outer walls, and imposed a grid on the internal buildings. The change from wooden palisade to brick or stone outer wall would have come a lot sooner under the roman way of doing things, too, and since they substituted magic for the labour-power of an entire legion (who were sappers when they weren't being heavy infantry) they would have been able to do that a lot earlier. The Great Hall would have started out, on this version of events, as Hogwarts /basilica/ and been used for lecturing and the public parts of administration of the school and community.
