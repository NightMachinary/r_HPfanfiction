Alright, this thing has been nagging at me for a couple of days... We know that dementors feed on positive emotions, leaving husks of angst behind perfect for Azkaban!Harry fics, then why do Patroni not only stop them, but even repel them when they should be the perfect treat?

I think there is a misunderstending either on my part or on the explanation of the creatures. Either they feed on despair so much that its the only thing in the forefront of the victims' mind or the patronus isn't the embodiment of positive feelings but just a magical construct which needs the subconscious to recognize the used memory or feeling as something in danger of being annihilated and thus the powering force is the need to protect oneself and others...

If I got it wrong please tell me, I'm going mad! Thanks guys


** I subscribe to the theory that the Wizarding world has it backwards. Dementors feed on negative emotions from negative memories and their special power is to suppress happy memories in order to feed. Thus the Patronus is a manifestation of stuff they can't eat.

*** This has been my thought, recently. If they fed on happy emotions the victim would be completely blissed out, not crushed by despair.

**** perhaps they don't feed on them but they require an atmosphere of depression to grow more dementors. i always wondered if them coming from mould growing in graveyards meant they grew out of the corpses, which would make the kiss a way to make corpse like people to grow dementors from.

*** I subscribe to the theory that Lupin has it wrong and Harry just does the charm right on instinct. I mean, why would anyone use a dementor boggart for the first lesson? I think this and the boggart class show that Lupin just sucks as a teacher.

** I figure it's the difference between drinking a cup of water at your leisure and having someone shove your head underwater and try to hold it there. Patronuses are magically weaponized positive emotions given a form and the incentive to attack their predators. (Dementors prey on positive emotions, ergo are their predators.)

** The patronus isn't the happy memory itself. It's a kind of spiritual guardian which is conjured via a happy memory but is not composed of the happy memory.

  Professor Lupin continued, â€˜The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the Dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the Charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.'

It might not be made of a memory, but it does seem to be made of Dementor food.

  And a Patronus isn't made to taste or smell like food to a Dementor (while being something else). It literally is (a projection of) what Dementors feed on.

**** And the memories it is made of cannot be turned into bad memories or bad emotions. As far as food for a dementor is concerned, the patronus is the kind of food that does not sate in the slightest, and as such even if the dementors can try to feed on it it won't give them anything.

****** They siphon the good ones until only the bad ones remain and the victim, crushed with those, remains powerless as they feed on them. The patronus either is a guardian spirit or is an amalgam of good and only good emotions that can neither be taken nor changed into different ones, and as such they cannot truly feed a dementor regardless of whether or not it is hypothetically possible for one to try to feed on a patronus.

Did I make it clearer now?

******** To be fair, the books do describe the patroni as both capable of attacking the dementors physically and willing to do it. Harry's first corporeal patronus, the one during the lake episode in Prisoner of Azkaban, was described as chasing the dementors and (more or less) trying to gore them. While I'm sure such a thing is not something that would kill them, it's probably unpleasant enough for them that they do not want to get close to patroni for what's really no gain.

******* That assumes that a Dementor achieves satiety by overwhelming the victim with bad memories/emotions, instead of just what it is - feeding on positive emotions.

Like, most traditional vampires weaken their victims by sucking their blood, but that doesn't mean they can't get sated by drinking blood from a cup.

******** So you still don't get what I meant, then.

Something that the stuff I wrote relies on is dementors needing to actually siphon good memories to be able to sate themselves with them. As such, just being in the presence of something made of good memories wouldn't help them get sated. A patronus is either something that is made using good memories but not made of them, in which case there would be no memories for the dementors to feed on, or it is something made of good memories in which case siphoning those would harm it and it is canon that dementors cannot harm a patronus; both possibilities have it impossible for the dementors to siphon good memories out of a patronus, which means that if any of those is true the dementors could try to feed on it but wouldn't be able to get anything out of doing that.

********* But Dementors don't feed on memories. They feed on hope, happiness and the will to survive. They hurt humans because with positive emotions gone we're left with negative ones. They can't hurt Patronuses because Patronuses cannot feel despair, not (to our knowledge) because they can't siphon positive emotions from them.

Like I said with vampires, vampires can hurt their victims because blood loss affects humans. Vampires cannot hurt a cup of blood because it's a cup, but that doesn't mean they can't drink out of the cup and be satisfied.

**** So a Dementor does amplify despair. A patronus doesn't have despair so it is something that Dementors cannot eat.

It is like Dementors are allergic to it.

**** I personally like to think that they passively suck the happy memories, feed on them, and cause everyone around them to relive their worst; but the Patronus has no... nutritional value? Basically, they can't eat it, so they flee from it.

Imagine if someone was about to force feed you with melted plastic or, let's say, coal. I'd nope out and run, wouldn't you?

** I honestly don't think Dementor actually need any kind of "food" , or any kind of susteinance.

They are magical creatures ,or better yet natural magical constructs since they are not actually alive.

Canonically their quantity is proportional to the ammount of despair in the general population, it stands to reason that they cause despair because they are basically the physical manifestation of a meme (in the scientific sense).

Patroni repel them because since their existence is dependent on despair and patroni are concentated anti-despair if dementors stay too close they may disappear.

These are my hypothesies.
