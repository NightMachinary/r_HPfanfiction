Severus Snape feels his dark mark flare up out of the blue on day, and goes to find Dumbledore who is having his own problems. Meanwhile, Ron, Hermione, and Harry look to file a complaint against someone for unlawful abuse to minors.

As Snape enters the entrance hall, he feels his mark flare even more, and starts hissing in pain, but soon the feeling is overcome by a deafening sound:

SEVERUS: Hmm... what's that mysterious ticking noise? Not over here, not over there... I-it's kind of... catchy.

/He looks around to make sure no one's spying on him, and then shrugs his shoulders./

SEVERUS: Snape... Snape, Severus Snape... Snape, Snape, Severus, Snape.

/\/MEANWHILE**

DUMBLEDORE: Merlin I hate that toad!

/The old man is piss drunk on top of his desk. Suddenly, wanting ice cream, he peels himself off of his desk and stumbles out of his office. Feeling slightly hot, he rips off his robes, leaving him in only his purple, stared, velvet, pointed hat./

/As he enters the entrance hall, he hears something. Could it possibly be? No... SEVERUS: Snape... Snape, Severus Snape... he runs quickly. The potions master never told the old man that he was going to start an A cappella group./

SEVERUS: Snape... Snape, Severus, Snape.

DUMBLEDORE: DUMBLEDORE!

/SEVERUS: .... What?/

SEVERUS: Snape, Snape, Severus, Snape.

/\/MAJOR TIME SKIP**

/So, anyway, Ron, Harry, and Hermione join as well, and Umbridge is slowly making her way down from her office with rollers in her hair to see what the commotion is about. Voldemort- who is working as crew- has roped in two first years to be on curtain call./

HERMIONE: Heeeermioooone!

DUMBLEDORE: DUMBLEDORE!

HARRY: I'm Harry Potter!

RON: Ron Weeeaasssly!

SEVERUS: Snape-

ALL: Singing our song, all night long, in HOOOOOGGGGWAAARTS!

/Ron disappears and then reappears./

RON: Hey everybody, are you ready to see m- I mean, I've found the source of the ticking noise! It's a 15-year-old youtube video- I mean, time bomb!

HERMIONE + HARRY: YAYYY!

/the first years close the curtain, and Umbridge gives a standing ovation while Voldemort flies away (think royal high roblox flying animation)/

*This prompt has also probably been one of my worst yet, and it's not even a prompt as I'm already writing it, but my sister thought this up for me, I just... I had enough of justice not being served and decided to share it with the world!*
