I've read what is probably 1.6k or so ffs and I've seen a common issue whenever daphne is involved. No one know her original character. The issue here is that she's in canon a token character with less of a role than her sister. Most of the time she defaults to token pure blood but sometimes i see something different. I haven't any clue what she's like in the original and I wanted to see how you guys felt about this character. Because personally Idk shit about her and I can't pick apart what's real and fake. To me it seems you can write her as anything and it doesn't matter which confuses me because then why is she a character. Idk


** The only thing canon about her from the books (not Cursed Child as I hate that piece of crap): she's in fifth year. The only thing canon about her from supplemental materials: she was in Slytherin and has a sister named Astoria.

Everything else depends on the author. :)

** In Canon, Daphne is litterally only a name. She is mentioned once in OotP where she is one of the 3 other student called to pass a practical OWL at the same time than Hermione. And that's the reason why she is popular.

She is an OC without being an OC. It is convenient because of lot of people don't really like OC and wouldn't try a fic where Harry is paired with one. But since she is a blank sheet, author can give her any personality they want without anyone being able to complain about her being OOC. A majority of the fics with her tend to use the "Ice Queen persona" (that I personally find a bit boring), but you can find anything from her being a Death Eater, to her just being a pretty stupid girl with a nice ass.

Also, "extended Canon" made her a Slytherin, which is once again convenient because she can be the token "nice Slytherin" that Harry can fall in love with without having to create an OC or whitewash one of the existing character like Pansy Parkinson.

*** The /name/ is quite important actually. /Daphne Greengrass/ is a one of the prettier names in Harry's year compared to say Morag McDougal or Lisa Turpin. Shallow, but when names are all you have it does make sense.

*** I like Daphne Greengrasses which are different (with or without the relationship with Harry): the one in “What's Her Name in Hufflepuff” by ashez2ashes linkffn(13041698) is just precious (but only a very minor character). Or the one in “Daphne Greengrass and the Year From Hell” by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot linkffn(3912184;4236594) (unfortunately, unfinished). Much more interesting than the Ice Queen Heiress Greengrass.

** I think that this is maybe a more a male oriented perspective and trending towards greater truth on ffn than ao3. I don't know a lot of women who care about or write Daphne or even Astoria as an important OC character or even one attached to Harry. But the point you're making about how authors use canon characters to write their own type of person while also sometimes following community "headcanons" is for sure annoying sometimes. But it's the nature of the beast, I think. Just gotta deal with it when you have large cast stories and a grab-bag of names in canon.

** Fanfics have just made her a popular character with her ‘ice queen' persona.

Personally I like her because she add more depth than Harry's other pairing(Ginny,Luna,etc....). The character development when breaking down her barriers by Harry is good when well written.

It doesn't really matter whats real/fake about her canon character, she is basically a blank canvas while still being a non OC which authors will utilize well.
