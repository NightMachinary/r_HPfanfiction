I could never take voldamort or the death eaters seriously until deathly Hallows when jk finally let the book get dark

We got glimpses of what a world under voldamorts rule would be like mud -I mean muggleborns were rounded up and thrown in Azkaban halfbloods and blood traitors were tortured at Hogwarts

I want to see the true dark side of the wizarding world and of voldamort


** Very little is written from their POVs of year 7, which, imho, is a huge gap in the fandom.

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), is the first fic I found that focused on an organized resistance by Muggleborns. However, the story is AU and begins after year 4. Also, Hermione was the leader of the resistance.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Hermione's the leader of the "Muggleborn Resistance", which sounds grand but is actually just a group of former 5-7th years. They're trying to recruit more, especially former Aurors or Hit-Wizards, but haven't been able to contact them so far. And it won't be easy to convince any adult that they should follow a kid.
