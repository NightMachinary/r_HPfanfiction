When looking for fanfics to read, what topic(s) do you usually look for? My guilty pleasure these days are reading Tom Riddle-redemption stories (I don't care if it's virtually impossible and how or who he's shipped with in the story) and Nineteen Years Later AU stories.


** - Any sort of AU where Harry is smarter and more independent, particularly if the author can justify this somewhat believably instead of the usual "Cedric/Sirius died because of me, I need to train up so no one else does".

- Fics that do good world-building. Expanding on Canon lore, pulling in real world mythology, etc. A lot of Powerful!Harry fics do this really badly, giving him a bunch of cliche powers (Phoenix Animagus, Heir of Gryffindor/Ravenclaw, Wandless Magic Prodigy, etc.), often in a single scene (Gringotts inheritance ritual, or a visit from a Mysterious Stranger OC)

- Auror!Harry. I've always been a big fan of the hardboiled PI genre, and this is a great way to do it in the HP world. Peggy Sues where an older Harry goes back can have some of the same appeal, but it always creeps me out a bit that he is an older guy going to school with a bunch of kids, especially if the story has any romance...

If you haven't checked out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]], you should.

Also, just in case... Methods of Rationality is amazing.

**** I enjoy Dark!Harry too, but there is one common theme in many of these that really annoys me.

Too often, the Dark Arts are treated as if it is simply a collection of powerful aggressive spells which Light!Harry is too wimpy to use.

I think canon makes it pretty clear that spells are called "Dark" because they require extremely powerful negative emotions of hatred and anger to work. Few of these fics really make Harry as evil/vindictive as he'd need to be in order to master the Dark Arts, since the authors still want him to be somewhat likable to the reader.

** Smart!Powerful!Harry

Harems: though sadly there aren't enough good ones that don't follow the marriage contract or veela formula (het only PLEASE!) These can be girl centric...but I haven't enjoyed maybe 1 of those. (Hermione/Many)

SMUT... I'm a master of Smut in my own writing, but when I read it I have HIGH standards because of this. I hate lemons written by people who have never had a threesome. (I'm an ex-swinger, so I write what I know) [edit: for those who always ask [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eginnymylove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~ginnymylove]] ]

To add to all of the above: unusual het pairings, although at this point there really aren't any "unusual" ones left beyond Milicent or unknown-insert-other-house-here like Romilda Vane or Su Li.

** I only ever read marauder themed stories. I think I was too old when I got into the books. I have no interest in the younger generations. GIve me a bit of remus lupin, and i'm all over it. Went through a severus period for a while too. But that's just cause there is more written about him.

The only reason I ever read anything with 'the golden trio' in it is if it ties in with the marauders era. But it bums me out that so many of the stories are time travel, creepy/pervy, unrealistic Characterisations or awful OC mary Sue BS.

I don't really mind Slash, I had to learn to love it at least a bit because there isn't a lot on offer RL wise that isn't some rehashed wornout time travel fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/Children-of-the-Shadows][Children of the Shadows]] writes some great ones if any one is interested. She was the the first slash auther I ever read, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390076/1/Dating-Remus-Lupin][Dating Remus Lupin]]. Drool.... I just love how well written is is, and how alive the characters are in it. despite the slash, I fell in love with them all, she also doesn't wormtail bash, but includes him in the stories in a manner that shows the friendships as they were.

BTW dating remus lupin, slash not included is still a bit AU.

I do know some good RL het stories, but they're few and far between. If any one could offer any, or would like to know what ones i've come across let me know!

there doesn't seem to be a lot of slash fans in here at all, Makes me feel like a perv....

Also, Severus/Hermione can be rather good as well.
