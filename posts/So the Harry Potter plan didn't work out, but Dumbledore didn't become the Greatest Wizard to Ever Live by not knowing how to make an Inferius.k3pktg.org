** And it promptly backfires because not only did Dumbledore not know how to make inferius, but he was also crap at glamours, so when he tried to hid Zombi!Harry's rotting flesh he somehow managed to make it look /even worse/ and when he decided to fix the inferius' incapacity of using magic by mixing up enchantments, alchemy, wandmaking and random bits of magical beasts like Basilisk's eyes and unicorn blood taken under extreme suffering what he got was an uncontrollable and deadly inferius that could turn others into undeads too.

On the bright side world-peace was achieved by the remains of humanity that was forced to band together in order to contain the zombie plague that decimated ninety percent of the sentient living beings worldwide. There was no more uses of outlawed magic (aka Dark Arts) because all the governments in the world unanimously decided that the risk of some wannabe dark wizard screwing around with magic they didn't know and destroying the remaining 10% of life in the world far outweighed the risk of people who /did/ know what they were doing abusing of their skills, and so not only was all the Dark Arts legalized, but also taught in-depth to anyone who showed even the slightest of interest in them at no-cost. And finally, the threat of Voldemort was no more since the former Dark Lord, upon seeing the mess the world was becoming opted for revolutionizing space-travel in order to move galaxies instead of risking being given control of the world and thus being forced to fix it, last anyone heard he had made a face transplant and scored a high-ranking spot on an intergalactic government, a surprising number of people on earth were actually rooting for him in his new career path, his new name was Palpatine now or something to this effect. Given all the good his actions brought Albus is still confused about why he was sentenced to the dementor's kiss.
