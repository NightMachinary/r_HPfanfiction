I vaguely remember the first fanfic I ever read, and I've been trying to find it again for nostalgia purposes but have really struggled.

All I remember of it is one scene in which Harry and the older Weasley children (I think Charlie and the twins, although I'm hazy since it's been over four years) torture imprisoned Death Eaters much to the disapproval of the other Weasleys and the Order (I think it sort of splits between Harry and others).

I'm sorry that this is so horrifically vague, this is quite literally a last resort to maybe find it.

Edit: On reflection, I also remember the torture being done by Muggle means.


** The Sum Of Their Parts, maybe? Harry and fred torture a death eater

**** I've re-read The Sum Of Their Parts and unfortunately it's not the one I was looking for, although it is a brilliant fanfic and a thorough favourite of mine.

Thanks for the enjoyment of a great fic I'd forgotten about though!
