So I'm the kind of guy who generally has a lots of idea (not necessarily good ones) but doesn't have the ability to do them justice, so I thought I'd put this one here.

Two years after the end of the war, Harry realise that he's not happy with his life, that something is missing, but he doesn't know what.

His relationship with Ginny got boring really quick, working as an auror got him only paperwork and boring arrests (criminals surrendered when they saw him coming) and apart from the time spent with Teddy, Andromeda and the former members of the DA, his life was as exciting as a flobberworm.

Until he was ambushed by a group of Blood purists that is. And that's when he realised what his life was missing. The thrill of being in a dangerous situation. Somehow, he had gotten addicted to it, he had become an adrenaline junkie.

With that revelation, Harry decided to chase that feeling, but he also realized that he wouldn't be able to do it if he remained in Britain.

So he broke up with Ginny, said his goodbye to his friends and family, put together his will and left.

From then on, he lived a happy life filled with fight with dark wizards and witches, wannabe dark Lords and Ladys and Magical creatures, and sex (similar to James Bond, defeating bad guys, and seducing women) all the while taking his legacy as an heir to the Marauders and spreading chaos wherever he went.

Until he was killed in a fight sometime in his forties. Except that when he died, he wasn't met by his parents, Sirius, Remus and Tonks, but by a pale woman claiming to be Death (either the Marvel or DC representation). She explained to him that since he gathered her Hallows, he was somehow immortal, but that humans weren't meant to be and she wanted her Hallows back. And Harry not wanting to live forever made a deal with her. He would relinquish his ownership of the Hallows and in exchange, he would go back, live his life and when his time came, he would be reunited with his family in the Afterlife.

So Harry came back to life, never changing his lifestyle, and died sometime in his 60s. But instead of seeing his parent, he was once again met by Death. An embarrassed looking Death at that, who explained to him that he had been bonded to the Hallows for so long that he had absorbed their essence and was in fact immortal and couldn't go to the Afterlife. But since they had made a deal and she always respected the deals she made, there was still something she could do to reunite him with his family.

And that's how Harry found himself being reborn July 31st 1955, not as Harry James Potter, but as Harry James Evans, first born of Mark and Rose (or whatever name they are given) and older brother to Petunia and Lily.

An so Harry decide that he will do everything in his power to keep his loved ones safe while maintaining his previous lifestyle of spreading chaos amongst his enemies, fighting and having fun.

So if any one is up for it, there are also a few things that I'd like to see (but obviously it's up to you) like :

- Pairing Harry/Amelia Bones. I've always been intrigued by this pairing, but there are not that many fics with it.

- Harry's presence in the past has some unforseen consequences. The main one? Petunia is a witch!

- Harry decide that Dumbledore is not fit (to soft) to lead the war effort and decide early on that he will put a group together to do it. (of course involving Petunia, Lily, the Marauders, Amelia and the parents of whoever he was friend with in his 1st life and who are at Hogwarts at the same time as he his).

- Harry is an absolute powerhouse (he was after all Voldemort's equal) and highly skilled due to having spent his previous life fighting, and decide to teach everything he knows to his group (after getting a loyalty oath of course).

- Wouldn't it be fun to seduce people to the light side? Harry certainly think so! But he certainly doesn't want Lucius, Rodolphus, etc. The Black children however... The Blacks are all insane but Andromeda and Narcissa manage to hide it better than everyone else. When Harry recruit the Black children (not just the sisters, but also Sirius and Regulus), he gains the loyalty of 5 absolutely powerful, intelligent but completely crazy and fanatical people.

- Dumbledore realize early what Harry is doing (recruiting people) , however he completely misinterpret Harry's intention and think Harry is a budding Dark Lord and tries everything he can in his role of headmaster to counter him without expelling him. As a result, he is alienating the rest of the teachers who start to think that maybe Dumbledore might in fact be a Blood purist and a bigot because of his obsession with a random muggleborn while all he want to do is in fact prevent the rise of a new Dark Lord.


** Why don't you write a superhero fanfiction in the Marvel universe, when you want a superhero?
