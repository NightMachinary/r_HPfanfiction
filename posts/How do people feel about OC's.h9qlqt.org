I've heard conflicting stuff about original characters. I know some people absolutely hate them, and others think they work fine to fill in blanks or serve a purpose that the existing characters don't or can't.

The reason I'm asking is because I'm working on something where one of the mains is a female OC - something that has always struck me about the canon works is that no one ever talks about Lily's friends. Where were they? Did Harry have a godmother? We get to meet these two awesome guys who were James's mates, but we never find out who Lily was close to, other than Snape. And I find it really weird - are we honestly meant to believe he was her only friend and after the M-word incident she just hung out with the Marauders? I can't believe she didn't have any girl-friends, so I've invented one for her.

Would appreciate thoughts on this, or thoughts on OCs in general.


** Not all OCs are created equal. I personally find it depends a lot on why there is an OC and (not shockingly) how well written they are. I personally don't love when people invent OCs just to fill a role that another character already has. Don't invent some kind of Mary Sue love interest when Hermione exists. (Or for that matter a fanon OC in Daphne). Acquila Black makes OOTP angsty Harry look like he has perfect control over his emotions and it's painful to read.

But there are fics with OCs I love too - linkffn(grow young with me) is probably my favorite in progress fic.

All that to say, if you're going to flesh them out, giving Lily a friend and giving them plenty of prominence sounds fine

**** My problem with it is that it's usually done as an extra way to bash. People write an OC mentor to bash Dumbledore, an OC smart girl to bash Hermione, an OC guy-friend to bash Ron, etc. This is largely true of background characters (i.e. Daphne) too, to the extent most of them are basically OCs too. And the best are often the ones most distanced from actual characters for the same reasons

And you're right, it can be totally fine. But in my experience, the best OCs tend to be ones that fill a role no one else really does.

***** That's what I'm aiming for, someone who fills a role that doesn't exist in canon - a mother figure for Harry who knew Lily and James and knew them well. A female counterpart for Sirius, I suppose.

The problem is of course that an OC can change everything - my plan/outline seems to have gone from "what if Lily had another friend" to "hmm, this person would also maybe have to be nice to Severus, hey what if Severus wasn't bitter and doesn't become a DE" to "if Severus isn't a DE, who is the spy" to "ok so what of Malfoy Snr was forced to take the mark by his dad and goes straight to Dumbledore" and I've now got a plan for a story I love but has twisted canon so much I think I'll get bashed if I post it!

Otherwise, what's the point in adding them?

Btw, this sub *values* original plot. The more you deviate from canon in a logical way, the more your fic will be appreciated.

Finally, DH plot is held in very low regard on this sub.

****** The main reason I hate bashing is because it's rarely done well. Weasley bashing especially, you get scenes like Ginny having a tantrum in Diagon Alley screaming "but I want to be Lady Potter and have all his moneyyyyyy and then kill him" and Molly giving Hermione love potions to keep her with Ron, then it turns out that she has been potioning Arthur for four decades etc etc. It's just totally unbelievable.

You don't want Ron to be Harry's friend in your story? Cool, make them less compatible - maybe your Harry is more into drawing than Quidditch and is quieter so ends up closer to Neville. Don't make it "looool Ron was being paid by Dumbledore and now he's been found out."

** How I feel about OCs depend on two things: the reason the OC exists, and the way the OC is fleshed out. First, I want to be clear on one thing, though: the existence of OCs in a fic does not affect my willingness to read a fic in any way whatsoever beyond whatever other things/flaws the fic has going for it. An OC can make a fic worse, but it can also make a fic better, just like any other character in a fic. E.g. an "OC in all but name" character like Daphne doesn't make me more willing to read a story than an OC would with the same characterization.

Let's say your OC is a major character. In that case, the way the OC is characterized is important. While a Mary Sue OC might not make me drop a fic if it has other things going for it, it is IMO always a character flaw, and in that case I'd probably prefer no OC at all instead. But if the OC is there to fill out a gap left by existing characters, I don't really mind at all, and might actually consider it an improvement to the story.

Take, for example, the various Marauder-era fics out there. Typically, since I like to read Snape-centric fics, Marauder-era ones is likely to feature Lily to at least some extent -- no matter the kind of relationship they have in the fic (friends, enemies, lovers, whatever), due to her prominence in his (early) life. As a result, we're probably going to see her dormmates. If her only dormmate is Mary (which we know she is close with from canon), it would feel... empty. Thus, I don't mind sticking a couple of OCs to fill out the blanks in her year at all, even if the OCs aren't well-defined beyond "minor character who is a dormmate of Lily".

Your case is somewhat similar, and I would rather find /not/ having female OCs as Lily's friends more weird than having them. So yes, go ahead and create your OC(s)!

** An OC is like a wooden figurine. The more time you spend developing them, adding detail, shaving excess, giving background, putting them in a good spot, the better the result.

A good OC also follows several unspoken rules, and tries to explore little-mentioned corners of the fandom.

Daphne usually fits this bill pretty well, though her mileage may vary depending on variations.

Lastly, names are important. If your names suck, it turns me away. Reason it, make it not silly. Would a parent have named their child (X), really ?

** The problem with OCs is twofold for me.

First, there's the problem that 99% of OC characters are there purely to replace a character that's vilified by the fanfic, and to be a "better" version of that character. A lot of them are mary-sues for this exact reason - fixing all of the perceived flaws of a canon character leaves very little in the way of actual /character/.

Second, there's a /bunch/ of characters that can probably fill the same niche as whichever OC you want. In the books, a bunch of names appear in the same manner one would mention the background furniture. A prime example is Daphne Greengrass - the name gets mentioned /once/ in the books, as Hermione is exiting her OWL exams. Going purely off the books, we don't even know which House she's in.

In the Marauders era, this gets even easier to do. A lot of characters are mentioned as either being dead, tortured into insanity, or otherwise mentioned as having fought in the first war against Voldemort - characters we never get to meet. Need a best-friend for Lily? Marlene McKinnon, there you go. Or Alice Not-Yet-A-Longbottom.

** The real sin to OCs are in how their written. To expand on that.

Self inserts are fairly obvious and can be very good. They are also very difficult since characters without flaws are boring and weak writing. Even when it's not a one to one exactly OCs have a hard time staying separate from their authors. This means you need to take a very serious look at yourself and acknowledge your flaws.

Also too many OCs are just hard to keep track of and don't get enough character development. This is key in OCs just because we have zero frame of reference to work off of.

Lastly OCs need to be believable in world. Like I get fantasy fulfillment fics but when it gets to the point of a half-veela half merfolk hogwarts student who was adopted by the goblins who James loves and drops lily like a stone after meeting once, well you have just written a new story.

Regardless write it anyway. If noone likes it oh well.

** The thing is, all the canon characters are Rowling's OCs, so what makes your OCs any different. The difference is that canon characters have baggage, they come with a pre-understanding of who they are, and what role they generally play in fanfiction. Umbridge, villainous bitch. Dumbledore, a very old and powerful wizard who is either a good, but flawed, mentor and leader of the good guys, or Albus the Senate Palpatine Sideous Dumbledore.

OCs on the otherhand are unknown entities, there's no canon/fanon characterization for them to fall back, so when you write, you're on your own.

And here's the thing in regards to all this, we are reading fanfiction, we are reading stories about the characters and worlds we know and like. If we want to read about new characters, we can just go to the library and find a book that's actually finished and had a publisher actually print it. This is not to say to not include OCs, but they have to be handled carefully, particularly in regards to the role they play in the story. Lupin or Bill equivalent, you're probably fine, even if the character is somewhat poorly written. Main character, love interest, or Ron and Hermione equivalent; and you better get it right and have a great character, and even then you will still have people who won't like him/her.

I think that when creating OCs you have to focus on making them feel like they would be able to fit in with canon. Could they have been a background character that Harry didn't pay attention to? Does their existence fundamentally alter what would have happened in canon?

** I never enjoyed main character OCs, I think because I have come to expect mary sues- but I dont think that's entirely fair, I'm sure there are good main characters OC fics out there, but I know for sure I'm probably not gonna them.

Background character OCs are a different story however. They're sort of necessary because it's not like every person in universe got an in universe name and personality.

I have a fic in my head set partly in the US, where they have to go for whatever reason, and meet someone who went missing during the war. Apart from those main characters, I'd have to add in OCs for the rest of the MACUSA workers. In my head that's fine because I like my OCs, but on paper, I feel like no one would want to read the fic if they feature too heavily because that would annoy myself as a reader. But I don't know how much to minimise them in the fic. Do I include names? Dialogue? Personality? Who knows.

** For reasons other commenters have explained, I think writing an OC into an established setting is much harder to do than writing one into a setting that we know very little about, or an all-OC fic. Calypso Rosier from Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived and Lorena from To Be a Slytherin are very good OCs in somewhat canon settings, and even then they're both somewhat controversial and the setting is AU enough that their character can find a niche.

As much as Alexandra Quick or a next-gen fic might have really good OCs, it's really not very hard to find space for distinctive characters when you're working outside of canon. Your situation is a bit more complicated. You probably want to expand, not contract, Lily and Snape's characters, and any OCs you introduce into the story can't trod on them.

I haven't actually read it yet, but I've seen people point to linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) as one of the very best examples of writing OCs in a canon setting. It's set during the Second War, not the first, but you might want to check it out to see how you can insert characters into a somewhat known plot.

** It depends.

OCs are generally great to put a new perspective into the plot, which is usually represented by the author's own thoughts. This prevents the protagonist from becoming OOC.

The same is true for an OC as the main protagonist. It provides a new outlook on canon or fanon. The author may feel a bit obstructed by canon characters but OCs give free rein to the author.

The problem occurs when the OC becomes a wish-fulfillment. There is no character development. The OC is a Gary Stu/Mary Sue cringe-fest, who shits rainbow, or is an overpowered asshole who gets all the girls.

It also gets worse when an OC is used to replace the main character, especially when the main character is present in the fic. This especially happens when a female character is a protagonist, who just steals the thunder from the canonical male protagonist.

** OCs are fine by me, as long as they fit the story well and aren't /too/ much. Often you can get by with pseudo-OCs - people are a lot more likely to accept an OC that takes the name of a background character than if it's an entirely new character.

An example of that approach might be to appropriate Mary MacDonald (a technical character from the period) and have her be Lily's friend - or shift the age of the Longbottoms down a bit so that Alice is a year up from Lily or in the same year and having them be friends. Both of those characters are blank slates - but by virtue of being named in the books, people tend to be more accepting.

The issue with OCs is that sometimes they can overshadow other characters - so you have to be careful to make them, well, a character. I personally don't mind them, but good writing is the key - like it is with everything!

** The only problem with OCs is that fanfiction is inherently lazy writing. Instead of doing all the work to make your own characters, settings, and even plots, fanfic authors mostly rely on someone else---the original author---to do the heavy lifting. So when we (the readers) read a new fic with, say, Hermione in it, we don't need to learn all about her from the beginning, we just import our existing knowledge of her. The fic author might make some tweaks to her characterisation, but that's still less work. And they'll be more focused on those tweaks than on her whole character, because they can rely on the readers to fill in any gaps.

An OC, on the other hand, requires the author to do all the work of characterisation from scratch. This is obviously a lot more difficult and results in more varied quality of writing.
