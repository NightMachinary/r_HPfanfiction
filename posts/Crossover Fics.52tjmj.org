I'm looking for some crossover Fics. The main two I'm looking for are: The Simpsons. All the Simpsons are magical and at Hogwarts... that kind of stuff. Next... Star Wars. Preferably Old Republic era where the HP characters are Jedi and stuff.

I've probably done a terrible job of explaining that.. but it's 1AM and I'm tired... so sue me...


** linkffn(The Unsuspecting side of the Force)

linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force)

linkffn(11417036)

linkffn(Discordant)

These are the best of Harry Potter x Star Wars.

  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** I haven't found many Kotor based fics, but linkffn(adas reborn;Harry Potter and the Dying Embers;The Lightsaber by tellemicus sundance) may interest you. The last one takes SW concepts and places it in the HP world.

#+begin_quote
  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
