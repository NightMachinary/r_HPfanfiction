  As a vampire he has great resistance to magic and is incredibly fast and strong *but can't walk in sunlight* and can't use active magic.
#+end_quote

It's worth pointing out that the idea of vampires being unable to walk in sunlight is something that only came about in the past 100 years (/Nosferatu/ is generally believed to be where it came from).

At the same time, even if the writer does decide to use it, they should remember that Harry lives in Britain.

**** That's how Stoker described Dracula, so I'd go with that.

Again, it shouldn't really be a problem, seeing as he spends 9 months of the year in Scotland.

***** Wasn't part of Stoker's reasoning that it was harder for Dracula to hide his nature in clear light of day, as opposed to candle or torch light? I'd probably go that route.

****** I've never heard about this before. I know Varney the Vampire (Victorian "penny dreadful" created around 50 years before Dracula) was able to move freely in daylight with much problems (even if I haven't read it yet), though.

** I love new spells and magic systems, or new fields of magic. Detailing healing or artificery or wardcraft, those are the common ones, but other fields get the spotlight sometimes.

*** I like this as well but not when the magic is just blatantly stolen from anime. A Second Chance at Life has a good expansion on magic.

*** One of my favourite examples of this was in a story I've been trying to find. Harry is adopted by the Cedric and his family Harry meets other kids and families as well

** I love 4th wall breaks, especially when they get really META. This is especially prominent in good SI fics and crossovers, because there's a bigger chance of characters realizing that just because they're fictional doesn't mean they're not real.

I'm also a big fan of bootstrap paradoxes. I'm pretty sure both of these loves grew from my love of Robert A Heinlein's stories, where I first encountered both of these tropes.

** This is not really /rare/ per se, but I can't for the life of me find a fic like it! Maybe I'm just really bad at finding things but...

Office Romance. Particularly Hhr, since I think Hermione would hold a higher position than Harry, which sould be funny, but I enjoy this in any fic!

*** Agreed. I think Hermione becoming Minister is pretty much the only good part of post-series â€˜canon'. She was certainly driven and even ambitious enough to get there.
