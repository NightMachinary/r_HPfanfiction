  In which Lucius Malfoy decides to off a political opponent with a little black book and Tom Riddle finds himself with a new body and a lot of catching up to do. Of course, the orphan beneath the stairs is just happy that a family member finally came to rescue him. A Tom adopts Harry, somewhat dark fic.

** linkffn(Angry Harry And The Seven by Sinyk)

It's a Harry betrothed to Daphne, and he lives at the Greengrass family mansion. The Greengrass family don't /raise/ him, per se, but it might be something that you might want to look into. ðŸ˜Š

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

**** Don't bother with this pile of shit that is called a story. I forced myself to read 5 or 6 chapters and that is time I can never get back. This thing is so vile and putrid that it hurts. Every time it is recommended on this subreddit, another part of me dies. Never fucking read it.

****** As the guy that recommended it, it's just horrible.

They aren't cliches I have seen yet, but they are the worst ones I have come across. There are bashing where there need not be; the main characters show wit and wisdom far beyond (even my) their ages; the characterisations are bad -- really bad; the plot points are more or less taken from canon; kids the age of 12 or 13 sit on the Wizengamot and are /fluent/ in politics.

What!? Just... The last point alone was enough for me to stop reading the book. It sits unread on my Google Play Books app and I might delete it soon...
