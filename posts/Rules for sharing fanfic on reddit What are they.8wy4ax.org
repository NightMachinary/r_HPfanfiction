** if youre talking about your own fics, youre allowed to make self-promotion posts here. theres even a flair set aside for it.

there are more general rules for self-promotion that apply across the whole platform, but i think most of them would get overlooked here since writing fanfiction isnt exactly a big money making endeavor

*** Right? ha. Fanfiction is always and forever a hobby. Thanks for the input. I feel like I need to edit my stuff first, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't disrespecting the community.

** Generally everything is fair game, as long as you follow the general rules in the sidebar.

If you mean promoting any fic, feel free. If you mean your own, thats also at your discretion, though I imagine its worth adding some disclaimers to your description.

*** By "disclaimers" do you mean legality wise? Like, the characters are the property of J.K. Rowling, etc?

**** Make sure people know your the author if its a self-promotion. Rights to JK Rowling is sort of assumed here, though you may want to note as such at one point in your fic.
