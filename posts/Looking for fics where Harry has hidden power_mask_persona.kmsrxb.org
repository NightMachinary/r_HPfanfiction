I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675879/1/The-Art-of-Hidden-Personas][The Art of Hidden Personas]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]] in which Harry is hiding his true personality/abilities. However, I don't want Harry to hide behind a mask for half of the story... I'd rather he be exposed early on. Any similar suggestions would be appreciated!

Edit: preferred pairing is Tom/Harry (:
