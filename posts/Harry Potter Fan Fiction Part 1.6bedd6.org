In the email he said I am gonna zap you so hard and get you so mad and you're not even going to be able to use your eye on me you asshole and I am going to use my el stupido spell on you and you'll die.

Finally frogs and horse were about to fight . Frogs Laffend said horse nordfick you are about to get killed with my spell so bad because you killed so many of my friends and wizard and you even killed my second best friend of all the wizard of Waverly place.

Well horse nordfick said you think you're so great and nice but you killed my fish who was so nice that was the only thing I had in my life and you took him away!! I will avenge him with every fiber of my being!! I will cast you into the fiery pits of hell where you will receive an eternity of torment and misery !! The likes of the suffering you will endure by my hand would cause even your god to avert his gaze from his deep felt sorrow seeded by the idea that this level of true torment could exist in a realm of his creation! I am coming for you! So pray to him, mortal!! Frogs Laffend said what fish

Nordfick lunged at Laffend and tried to slash him with his big fingers. Good thing frogs Laffend was able to have a bullet proof wizard coat. Then frogs Laffend smacked horse nordfick with his wand and smacked him right in the face . "Nice moves horse boy!" Laffend said. "But not nice enough try your best to beat my ELECTRIC BEAM SPELL! And then he shot the spell right at horse but horse got hit with it right in the face and say ow."

"You are just like all those other wizards I killed you are just as weak as that guy I killed Called voldemort WAS HE YOUR FRIEND" Now frogs Laffend was scared because he was like is this guy the real deal. Frogs no lie got a little scared but then he remembered how cool he was so he threw on his cool guy glasses and said "bye bye, nordFUCK!! " And did his best spell and horse nordfick exploded.
