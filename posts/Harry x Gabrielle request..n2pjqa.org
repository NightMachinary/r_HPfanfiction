:END:
I can't remember the title, it was on ff.net. It may have been part of a series. Following the third task of the triwizard, in which Harry is scarred, he breaks up with Gabrielle and moves to Polynesia.

He eventually gets training as an assassin and goes back to Hogwarts. Whilst he was in Polynesia, he got two new wands, one of which he called his â€˜love wand' because it had a core of Gabrielle's hair.

When he returns, he finds out that Gabrielle had the same training as him and they defeat Voldemort, trapping him in a bubble in the Hogwarts wards.

Also along the way the long bottoms are woken up and their may have been assistance from American and Irish wizards using guns from the 1860s.

Thank you for any help!

#+begin_quote
  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
