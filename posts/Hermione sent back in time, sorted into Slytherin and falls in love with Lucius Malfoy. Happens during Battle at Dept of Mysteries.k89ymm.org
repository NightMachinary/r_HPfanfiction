  When a rescue mission inside the Department of Mysteries goes terribly wrong, Hermione Granger finds herself twenty-five years in the past surrounded by those who would do her harm in the future. Despite her efforts to go unnoticed, she ends up in a most unlikely relationship. But how will her time in the past affect her life in the present? And how could someone so kind become so filled with hate? Slow Burn, Romance, HEA
