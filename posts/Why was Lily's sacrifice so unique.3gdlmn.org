Ok, so I know that the reason Harry survived the killing curse as a baby is because Voldemort gave Lily the choice to move aside, but didn't, therefore Harry was protected by her love. And I'm also aware that Voldemort never gave anyone else this choice, so that's why Harry's case is unique. However, Voldemort is not the only wizard in history to use Avada Kedvra. Are we really to assume that no other person in the history of the universe was given the choice to not die, but still sacrificed themselves? My question therefore, is: why was Harry the only person ever to survive the killing curse? Is there something I'm missing from the story?


** I've also wondered this - I don't think Harry's case is unique, other people must have survived in the past, but because Voldemort was an infamous Dark Lord who lost his powers, Harry's case is famous.

In Canon, the only reference to Harry's case possibly not being unique is in Deathly Hallows chapter "The Flaw in the Plan". Harry says to Voldemort. "You won't be killing anyone else tonight,"..."You won't be able to kill any of them, ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you hurting these people-"..."I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?"

Voldemort may well be known as the greatest Warlock of all; especially when taken by it's old meaning: oathbreaker.

**** Good point, that makes sense. Only problem I have (to your explanation above) is that Snape delivered the prophecy before he knew it referred to Lily's son. I don't think there is any reference to Voldemort making a vow or promise with Snape? Snape asked Voldemort but that was all. Hence, why Snape turned to Dumbledore to save Lily?

***** It was astounding to me that Snape would be brave enough to ask Voldemort to spare her- I assume he used the fact that he was the one to alert the Dark Lord of this danger is what gave him any ground to ask for leniency. It's not canon, of course. Just my interpretation.

What is canon is that Snape asked, and he doubted the Dark Lord's promise enough to try warning Lily through Dumbledore.

I'm with you on the 'it's famous doesn't mean it's the first' notion. I doubt her sacrifice - even as complicated as this one might be - was unique, but it was the answer to the prayers of many. That sort of relevance tends to be exaggerated by the attention.

EDIT: the relevant passage is from the Prince's Tale in book 7

‘If she means so much to you,' said Dumbledore, ‘surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?'

‘I have -- I have asked him --'

‘You disgust me,' said Dumbledore.

*** Shouldn't all of the spells V cast have rebounded on him like the AK that gave Harry the scar? Maybe only the killing curse results in a rebound, but Voldemort was assuredly tossing around AK's during the battle. So if all of the elements were the same (same curse, same protection) should the effect have been the same? I suppose the scale of the protection could have changed things...?

** Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily. You can see it as him bargaining with the Dark Lord in exchange for the prophecy or not, but Voldemort agreed.

Then Voldemort goes to the house, kills James and then tells Lily to step aside. She refuses and asks Voldemort to kill her but not Harry. Without thinking about it, Voldemort kills Lily and then tries to kill Harry- he had promised Snape not to kill Lily, then did so, seemingly in exchange for not killing Harry.

So really it was breaking vows that destroyed him- old magic, as he said.

*** My interpretation is slightly different. I always thought it was because Voldemort gave Lily the chance to give up Harry and survive. That wouldn't have been normal behavior for him; he'd just kill everyone who resisted him without compunction. By giving Lily the opportunity to step aside and her refusing (but not resisting/trying to duel him), he made himself vulnerable to the power of the sacrifice. Sure, other people had died protecting their loved ones from Voldemort, but they may not have had the same opportunity to /not die/ that Lily had, thanks to Snape. He probably also wouldn't have usually targeted infants personally in this manner, and the bond between a mother and her baby is particularly strong.

I think this is going too far If magic were like this, you could teach someone a completely made-up, alternative set of spells. I don't see that as sensible.

I do like the view that Voldermort just lost his nerve, though. It equally explains the failure of AK in Godric's Hollow, in the Forbidden Forest, and in the castle. It also explains why he kept on using the same curse rather than, you know, killing Harry with a cutting curse (or an axe) -- he became obsessed by his own failures to use AK, and felt he needed to kill Harry with that in order to redeem his own failures.

*** I think the prophecy has to be added to the equation as well. Voldemort himself gave meaning to the prophecy. This credence to Harry being a danger is what he chose to believe in and act on. Thus Voldemort chose a) that the prophecy was about himself, b) that the prophecy was about Harry Potter, c) that Harry Potter was a danger to him, then when he acted upon this choice he then chose to d) make Harry his equal (who could vanquish him). These in addition to other choices he made (as you pointed out), and the choices of others (Lily mainly/solely), all combined to ensure his demise.

So a family members love sacrifice (taking the 'bullet' whether a curse or a creature) doesn't have the confluence of events and sheer magic to do something similar. So the love (& 'blood') sacrifice /might/ provide protection of some sort (magic in HP is more than stick, word, result) but it would neither save the protected victim nor destroy the aggressor IMO.

** Maybe the key to the protection was Voldemort's cleavage...I mean how his soul has been fractured, cleaved, etc. Hear me out. The magic of the HP verse is greatly affected by intent and emotion. A person willingly dying takes a great deal of focused intent and emotion. The entirety of the dying person's magic would attempt to fulfill the intent. The magic released would be diffuse and would normally have no effect. But since Voldemort's soul was split, not just cracked, but actually broken in pieces, Lily's magic was able to access/penetrate his soul. This is the only place the intent of Lily's magic could be effective. Think along the lines of the movie /Inception/: Lily's intent wormed it's way into Voldemort's soul, infecting it. Voldemort isn't aware but now when he cast's a spell at Harry it is a mix of Voldemort's intent and Lily's intent which then negates, rebounds or weakens that spell. It rebounded from baby Harry because the protection was focused on one individual. During the last battle the protection was over hundreds of people, so V's spells did not rebound but were made harmless. This protection scenario does not work unless the killer is magical, has a horcrux (incredibly rare we are told), the sacrificer is magical and has enough time and willpower to verbally declare their intent with extreme force of will and emotion. Physical proximity is probably a factor as well. I doubt many situations in history would meet those requirements.

** I've always theorised that the story we get - that love was how Lily saved Harry, is a simplification. We know Lily was a talented witch. We know she was Muggleborn, so might not have the natural or indoctrinated revulsion towards 'dark' magics that some of the Light-aligned pureblood families like the Weasleys or Longbottoms might have.

Maybe it's because I've seen it done well in a lot of fanfics, but I've always believed Lily laid a trap and tricked Voldemort into a ritual, with herself as the sacrifice. Blood/life magic, involving sacrifices, so probably classed as 'dark', which is why Dumbledore would either not know about it, or send Harry off with a simplified version of events that removed any moral ambiguity in what Lily did. Similar to how Dumbledore tells Harry that James 'saved Snape's life', making it sound like a deliberate and completely 'heroic' act, rather than him getting cold feet about a potentially fatal prank they were going to pull on him.

**** Well, I can't remember. I know at first we get the story from Dumbledore and Snape who are both biased, Dumbledore excusing 'pranks' and Snape not believing James Potter had a good bone in his body. That wasn't really the key part of my comment, anyway. James was no angel, but Dumbledore made out to Harry that he was, to spare Harry's feelings. Is it such a stretch to think he'd do the same for Lily?

And how do you explain Harry's sacrifice working the same way in DH? The effect of Lily's sacrifice was 100% unintentional. That is something DH is clear on.

** People say it isn't a ritual that Lily performed because Harry did the same thing for all the people at Hogwarts.

But you seem to forget that it was Blood Protection. It is repeatedly stated that there are blood wards, that the protection lies within the shared blood of Lily and Harry which is why he has to go to Petunia to refresh that. Voldemort could finally touch and kill Harry once he was resurrected with Harry's blood. The entire thing stands on blood connections. But there is no shared blood between Harry and his friends at Hogwarts, so how in the world did they suddenly get the anti killing curse protection? Answer: they didn't.

Harry telling Voldemort that his spells aren't 'binding' anymore is simply Harry taunting Voldemort with his biggest fear: Not being feared anymore, not being able to confirm his superiority by killing those who oppose him.

It's Harry lying his ass off and taking advantage of the fact that Voldemort hadn't killed anyone yet when he started the duel. Psychological warfare at its finest.

So why is Lily's sacrifice unique? She used unknown magic that involved her sacrificing herself. Probably something with the Rune Sowillo, the lightning bolt on Harry's forehead.

-Sowillo: It is the rune of the sun. It is the counter-force to cosmic ice in the rune Isa. Sowilo represents the force of fire in the physical and mental world. It promotes invigoration, dedication, optimism and persistence in any endeavor. It will ward against the harmful opinions of others to keep the heart focused on its purpose.

Runic blood magic that wards against the cold grip of death and gives Harry his dedication.

Except in this case the prophecy /did/ cause the subsequent events. Voldemort had no expectation of losing until Snape told him about what he had heard. Once he had, the rest of the prophecy came about as consequence of his hearing the first part of it. This is classic prophecy hijinks: if a person hears a prediction about their life, it usually screws with them into fulfilling it.
