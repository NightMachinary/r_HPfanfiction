So recently I have been looking at some of my old favorites and I can't seem to find this one Basically Harry and Neville find a place called the garden(they named it) and they make a space program


** The one you're thinking of is linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) .

"The Garden" is their secret clubhouse where they hatch their Space Program idea, to take the world's magical population and colonize a planet of their own.

It's a five part series. I just read it recently and totally loved it, it's also an Avengers crossover (only slightly).

** The only fic I can remember with Harry going into space via his own space program is linkffn(Ah, Screw It), but Neville's role in the story is relatively minor, and there's no garden involved.

** The story 260 going on 16 by SciFiFantasyWriter1 has Harry time traveling to the past and also has him building a spaceship. It has Harry building a garden with magical, mundane and alien plants, I believe with Neville's help but I'm not sure if they call it "The Garden".
