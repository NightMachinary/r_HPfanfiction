I'm looking for any decent length (20k+) fics where the Dark Lord is teaching at Hogwarts. I don't care if it's because he got the position the first time around and is actually a good guy, or if he's using it as a cover to kill Dumbledore or whatever. Any pairing or no pairing is fine. Please not abandoned.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140][Phoenix Corrupted]]

Copy-pasting my review for those interested in quality of the fic.

The premise (the only other fic I know with the similar one is What We Leave Behind) and the update rate caught my attention during my last search for a new fics to read.

I hoped for the best, and feared the worst, but in the end the fic turned to be average.

I'm too lazy to write proper review so here comes bullet list.

Good:

- Story doesn't rehash canon, and so far it avoided "incompetent adults and kids that fix everything" problem of the original books, and I'm genuinely interested in where it is going now.

- AU elements that come from divergence(s?) in backstory. I really liked how the world changed due to the changes in events of the past. That was exemplified in the first chapter in the first year which swiftly introduced many changes and ended on a nice twist. I wonder if Riddle's past was changed due to the main divergence or if there a secondary one.

- Pacing is fast, and the fic doesn't linger on unnecessary things, though that also leads to some problems that will be mentioned in the complaining part of this "review".

- Snakes, there were really cool ideas related to snakes here. Also having snakes vs birds when both are special case of animals that are easier to conjure than other animals.

Bad:

- AU elements that come from changes to the setting. Aka generic bad fanon. Magic being some sort of limited energy that can be burnt out (and squibs that can be helped with giving them some of this energy). The duel at the end, while saved by its general creativity also had some of it, with tanking spells on body, and the shield spell that has to be lowered for casting other spells.

- Characters are really weak point of this fic, Harry is much blander than his canon self despite growing up in the same circumstances. The whole arc with Hermione initially being too annoying for Harry and Ron get thrown out and we got Instant Friendship (tm). And so were Ginny's initial awkward behaviour, despite Harry's hero status being essentially the same. The friends from other houses are basically extras, they are there, but they have no personality at all.

- Writing at the beginning was rather stale, it quickly improves though, so I think that you are aware of that. Same case with some obvious errors like your/you're that slipped in early chapters.

- You may yet turn it around, but having conflict among the Founders being fault of some spirit of discord instead of their differences is rather simplistic.

I would say, that so far the good balance out with the bad. If I were rate it at the moment I would give this fic 5/10.

  Albus and Gellert, two bright young wizards, would meet in the summer of 1899 and develop a strong friendship, but would part ways following the death of Albus' sister, Ariana. But what if Ariana survived this encounter? What would it mean for a boy named Harry Potter and the events that would unfold almost a century later?

** Okay so that's not what you asked for, since it's a non magic AU, but I loved, loved, LOVED that fic : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7499274/1/The-Scientist]]

Hermione/Tom, he's her teacher at college, absolutely no magic but familiar characters and personalities. I'm gonna go read it again now. I really want to find good HG/teacher TR fics, but this one is great at filling that little void.
