I like to think that my intelligence is above average, but I prefer not to read fics that require me to use too much of my brain power. So is methods of rationality readable with a person with average intelligence? Or would someone with average intelligence struggle to truly enjoy the fic? If methods of rationality are suitable for a reader of average intelligence, then I will give reading it a go. If it requires a certain level of intellect to be involved, I might skip the story, cos I prefer to read to enjoy, and not to problem solve.


** Actually the less you think when you read this fic, the higher your enjoyment will be. Despite what author and some fans claim it's not an intelligent fic by any stretch.

** You've already fallen for the hype if you believe it takes some kind of great intellect to enjoy a piece of fanfiction... HPMOR is based on the "rationalist" philosophy of its author, which involves giant expositions of scientific principles, lots of preaching and some interesting speculative concepts.

Personally, I'd say the fic starts off very good but gets more and more tedious as you go along, almost to the point where it feels like a different writer is doing the chapters. It's worth skimming through to get to the plot-relevant scenes, though. There have been great fics which take HPMOR as a point of departure, such as linkffn(Following the Phoenix), which I've enjoyed more as a story than the original. I think Yudkowsky is capable of writing good stuff, but he got bogged down in tiresome filler so much that the story got culled somewhere in the process.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.

**** No, I wouldn't do that. The early, pre-Hogwarts chapter are really the most entertaining --- they have a sort of /Seventh Horcrux/-ish feel.

***** Never read Methods of Rationality and considering that the early, pre-Hogwarts chapters have a Seventh Horcrux-ish feel, I will most certainly be skipping the story entirely.

******* My only problem with that scene was the reactions from the the shopkeeper and her assistants.

McGonagall hyped up the shopkeep as some stalwart force of professionalism and anti-humorism. Then the writer had them break down into fits of laughter like crazy people.

Sure, it gets across the sure ridiculousness of the situation, but it feels so much like a comedian stopping the show to laugh at his own jokes.

** There is little that is thought provoking in the fic, you're never asked to think. There is little to no ambiguity, rather than subtle this fic wields a sledgehammer with which it attempts to beat you round to its way of thinking. You don't think it shouts its thoughts at you.

** You confuse intelligence with education. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about rational thought processes and the scientific method, then you'll probably be able to follow everything in the fic. I also want to stress the /somewhat/ in that sentence. If you aren't educated in something, believe me, the author /will educate you if you want or not/, because otherwise how else would Harry be able to assert his rational thinker dominance over every other character?

** It is readable, of course. The concept inside the book is not that hard to digest. You can just refer to a textbook/internet if you need to know something. A basic knowledge in statistics would be nice to have for your reading enjoyment and your life. Some knowledge about philosophy is also beneficial.

What you need to have learned and have knowledge about before having enjoyment in reading a rational fiction is explained here: [[https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/]]

P.S.: I don't actually enjoy that fic outside the beginning 30ish chapter, even though I read it to the end (at least, until hermione resurrection, iirc). It is pretty much author SI, and not very good at that.
