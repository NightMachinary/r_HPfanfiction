** House all the baby first years together. Do sorting at the start of second year.

Have all the first years take both Muggle Studies and a new Wizard Studies class to give them a basic introduction to both worlds. It would be a great way to help the muggleborns and purebloods understand each other! Maybe they can test out of one class or the other depending on their background.

*** I always thought it would be best to rotate houses, so Hufflepuff for first and second years, Gryfindor for third and fourth, Ravenclaw for fifth and sixth, and then Slytherin for seventh. That way each student would be exposed to a wide variety of values and would just be separated by year, not dominant personality trait.

** First off, we only see Hogwarts from Harry's perspective, so for all we know much of what we'd add exists, but he's just too uninterested to look for it or attend.

I do think that Binns would be a good candidate to be replaced. His dedication in honor, but if your class is famous for being a naptime, the classes goals won't be accomplished. I am a fan of the idea to keep him around for in-depth studies, though. With his 400 years (I think) hes got to be a well of knowledge.

Filch is a sureshot as well. Threatening children with +violence+ outright torture isn't acceptable.

Then there is Snape. For all we know, he could be a decent teacher for everybody but Gryffindor. Yet, being a shit teacher for 1/4 of a school isn't speaking in his favor. We know why Dumbledore wouldn't allow for Snape to leave Hogwarts, but if at all possible, I think both Snape and Hogwarts would be better off if he could enter a career of commission brewing and Hogwarts gets a Potion Master with actual social skills.

The DADA position is clear. If a half-decent teacher survives more than a year, the quality will skyrocket.

Muggle Studies should be on modern standards. I'd think the goal should be for a pureblood to merge with muggle culture seamlessly. If they get a electrical device in hands they should know how to plug it in. They should be aware of the simple stuff - infrastructure, high- and pop-culture, some history and also the threats (speeding cars, electrocution, guns,...).

And in the same vein, there should be a Wizard Studies course for muggleborns and half-bloods raised in the muggle world. An early introduction to wizarding (and half/non-human) cultures with a focus on some important things (Wands, some do's and don'ts,Travelling (Floo, Portkey, Apparition), Medicare), as well as a advanced course later in their Hogwarts career for all students, dealing with being an adult in the wizarding world. Banking, the Ministry, other wizarding nations (and/or the legalities of travelling), the Wizengamot, Law and Justice System,... This could be combined with the Orientation meeting. How would a muggleborn choose their job if they don't even have an idea whats out there?

Additional courses should be gradually more advanced and detailed, I think. There is a lot out there to be studied and for all we know, there are no magical universities. From Potions we could derive courses like Healing (Course 1 being mandatory - cause everybody should know Episkey) and Alchemy. Charms could spread out into such detailed classes as Enchanting, Competitive Duels. Herbology and Care could have specialized courses for experimental and industrial breeding, and so on and so forth. I'd be a great fan of a "Magical Artificer" course where students craft and enchant magical artifacts (or in the case of my own little snippet, set on the challenge of building a spaceship).

In addition you could add some supervised study groups. The few teacher of Hogwarts would probably get a big load of their shoulders as well as faster progressing classes if older students would tutor younger students. What I'm saying is that the only revolutionary thing about Dumbledore's Army should've been the secrecy, not the existence of a group of students helping each other out.

I like the idea of Field Trips. Given that there are such things as portkeys, it wouldn't even be such a hassle. Visiting a Dragon Preserve, some different cultures like centaur herds (that maybe aren't as hostile the one in the Forbidden Forest), the mermen and others.

I'm also reasonably sure that some students would meet up with their parents, siblings and so on in Hogsmeade. This one I'm sure we only don't see because Harry never does. Given that Hogsmeade is also the biggest magical settlement of Britain, the chance is pretty high that a good bit of students have family living there. (I'm actually a bit taken aback that I never read some pureblood family having their house there. I mean, not as in "its rare to read it" but I have /never/ read that.)

I'd also add some more competition. Not everybody is a Quidditch player. I'd like a purely academic competition, for one. Right now, the academics can only win house points that are easily lost by people being little teenage pricks. A separate cup for outstanding academic achievements would do the whole some good. Then you could add a Duelling league. Maybe a league for wizarding chess. I'm sure broom /racing/ could be a thing. Magical Art galleries and prices. The possibilities are endless.

Thats it from me, for now. As I said, almost all of this could, in theory, exist without Harry caring for it and hence, us not knowing about it.

** Hmm...well, something I actually think about a lot for some reason are the house points.

To be precise, I keep thinking about a system where rather than being awarded for extraordinary accomplishments, they're handed out like candy for just getting things done, getting along with others, et-cetera. With more available for completing bonus assignments, or tutoring other students, or et-cetera.

The idea being, rather than rewarding glory-seeking, it'd reward co-operation, learning, and keeping things running smoothly and responsibly...you know, the sort of stuff life outside of Hogwarts actually demands.

**** I don't know, the current system seems to be more of an "Everyone gets a Trophy" system to me. In book one, the trio pretty much would have singlehandedly won the the cup if they hadn't already lost 150 points from the dragon. The cup is awarded to EVERYONE in the house based on the actions (Positive or negate- 3 people can lose 1/3 of a year's total points in one night) of very few people. With the system suggested above, the whole house is taken into account when giving out the house cup, and no matter how good they are, 3 people wouldn't be able to win a trophy for 250 people. Instead it would be giving 250 people a trophy based on what 250 people did through the year.

IIRC Ron didn't tell his parents about his broken wand because he thought he'd get another howler. I know he didn't get a brand new wand in first year, but it seems like that might not be that uncommon, what with Neville having his dad's wand. And it's quite possible that they could have managed to save enough money to get a wand, but since the old wand worked for him, they decided it wasn't necessary.

** We really need a few more details about the school. I'm sure I heard that there were a thousand students, was the school built to house that many or are there lots of background students who aren't mentioned. I can easily see hufflepuff and ravenclaw being the two biggest houses by number. This affects class size, number of teachers etc.

Another thing we lack is a syllabus and a lack of understand in how magic progresses. We can't recommend changes to the classes without understanding what they are meant to be teaching. Skills vs specific spells?

We know there are things like gob stones and charms clubs so we can't say much about extra curricular stuff without more details. Quidditch can be the top sport and the most hyped but we don't know fo'sho if it's the only one.

A common theme in the books that can be improved upon is a set of checks and balances, there is a lack of accountability in the school and we never seen a real inspection nor do the board of governers do anything meaningful. Umbridge might have been evil but a real inspector has a place. Hogwarts needs ofsted.

The other change I would implement was adding more things for the kids to do when they weren't in class. They have a lot of free time, and playing chess or exploding snap would probably get old quickly.

Also, it doesn't make sense to have some classes split into four sections per year:

If we go by canon, the Defense teacher would have to teach 22 different classes per week, whereas the Potions teacher would only need to teach 12. For two hours a week for each class, that'd be 44 and 24 hours respectively.

In an improved system, they'd either hire two defense teachers or have all classes together with at least another house. In some less popular classes, like Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, they'd probably just group entire years together.

** I wonder what would actually happen if you put Lockhart as history teaacher. Sure, he'd embellish, but he's not stupid enough to claim responsibility for stuff that happened before he was born or was clearly attributed. Gloryhogging, yes. Actually an idiot, no. And he must have done a good amount of research to pose as a faker and not get caught after the inevitable getting called out on BULLSHIT.

For something definitive, having a government affiliated think tank/university based off the Department of Mysteries might be interesting. The temptation to rip off Fate/Stay Night is out there, but building an original but similar institution would be possible. After all, who's researching all those spells?

Also: Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish stations at the very least with other trains, and possibly reducing the trip down to 10 minutes by way of rigging the trains to teleport a la Knight Bus. As well as a refitting for the inevitable Triwizard Tournaments happening in foreign institutions, complete with auto track layer and said "jump drive".

** Chess club

The castle is fucking huge (I mean there are 7+ floors and dungeons ffs) so it would be cool to have different rooms for different classes (ex. advanced potions have a different room than beginning potions with different materials and space for students). Definitely somehow using the many places in the castle.

The lack of English classes seems odd, so I would somehow add or fit in English classes (after all how do so many people end up writing books and articles in a world where Hogwarts has no English class?).

** We don't know since it's from Harry's POV but I think Hogwarts should have been more accommodating to religion. They mention Christmas and Easter holidays so we can assume some students are Christian, but what about having a church they can attend weekly? Or what about students from other faith backgrounds? Would they get time off for other holidays or have somewhere to worship?

*** Actually, given the whole "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" thing, the non-inclusion of religion makes a good deal of sense. I mean, maybe it would be nice for muggleborns, but there are a lot of changes that would be much more important for them than that.

**** The witch hunts were powered by religion, but it's also worth noting that we have at least one example of a religious magical character. The Fat Friar actually /was/ a friar of the Catholic Church.

...I'm not sure why, considering he was executed on suspicion of witchcraft. Either way, you could probably run with it. Not sure it warrants having a church on campus or even in Hogsmeade, but it's probably a bit more complicated than what it might seem on the surface.

** Binns is getting exorcised. Filch is getting fired and his head mounted on the wall a la the Black family's house elves. Snape gets a forced castration and is remanded to being the personal potioneer for the infirmary, no longer allowed to teach classes or be within 50 feet of any student. House points system is abolished. Take a good look at the wards and add wards to immediately kill anyone bringing dark artifacts into the school. Add anti-rape wards that would forcibly castrate any rapists. Hell why not have localized curfew wards that would be activated at curfew every day and you couldn't get out of the common rooms unless in the company of a prefect.
