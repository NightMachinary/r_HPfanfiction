:END:
Like I said, Harry time travels to his younger self, breaks Sirius out of prison and they end up befriending the Delacours and living next to Hermione. I think Dumbledore is convinced that Harry is possessed by Tom Riddle.

If anyone could tell me the name of the fic, it would be nice. Thank you!
