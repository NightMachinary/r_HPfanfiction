So hear me out:

I was watching the FB movies and would have loved for Jacob to be accepted into the Wizarding World because I could see him being useful, and I hated how he had to be Obliviated.

So this got me thinking "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to apply for citizenship even if you were a Muggle?" For the few highly Elite intelligent individuals in the world who both discovered the WW and could still be some use to the WW could apply to be accepted into it. Think of Einstein, Tesla, etc.

And yeah I know, Statute of Secrecy, blah blah blah

â€‹

Anyone able to imagine something from this? :)


** "You did WHAT"

"I used my inheritance money, created a company, applied for ICW permission to hire muggles who qualify under the exceptional talents program, got some of the world's best genetics scientists and human cloning experts as well as some potioneers, magical creature breeders and genealogy experts, and in just five years of working mostly in secret we managed to find the genes and magical traces required to make someone magical. Now we got a new IVF procedure that results in 100% guaranteed magical babies! We're going to offer it to muggles who know about magic and squibs. About twelve years from now the number of muggleborns at Hogwarts should start growing exponentially!"

** There's already lots of muggles and squibs who know about magic (think family members of wizards like Hermione's parents or the Dursleys) and top government officials who help keep secrecy (the PM and probably some people in major muggle news too) so adding a few top scientists would not be too big of an issue. I plan on including something like this in a fic I'm writing.

*** Well, excluding the family of Muggleborns and Squids because that's sort of a given
