It was a teenage Severus Snape. What was his day like when he took the Felix?


** I have an oneshot idea for this actually. In my headcanon, Felix is useless for strategic purposes, which is why it's never used during wars, because the potion works by plucking at your deepest desires and twists your actions to improve your chances at fulfilling them. So most combatants in a war that drunk it would just end up successfully escaping the fight to return to their family or similar. Hence why it's not really used for anything more than mundane things, and Slughorn figured people would use it to maybe secure a happy date or whatnot.

Anyway, with this in mind, Snape takes the potion in anticipating for showing off his skills for highlevel Death Eaters during Yule break, maybe even Voldemort. Only, what he /really/ desires is to reconcile with Lily, which is what the potion ends up homing in on. So the potion attempts to maximize the chances of him doing this -- by making him fail miserably at every turn while trying to show his skill as a future Death Eater because suddenly everything keeps reminding him of Lily and their friendship back when it was still healthy and he begins to see why it turned out the way it did. Outraged, he is quickly thrown out, with a taunt that he should go back to his precious Mudblood that he was unable to keep his thoughts away from (Felix causes the DEs to figure that Snape is better off as a liability for the other side rather than outright killed, allowing him to survive). Figuring the potion was tainted, Snape Apparates back to Cokeworth. While he walks back home, he sees a figure over at the park he and Lily used to frequent while they were still friends, ever since they met, but -- as the last drop of Felix runs out -- figures he's seeing things. The next day, this time without the potion, Snape is able to convince the Death Eaters that he was under the effect of a tainted Felix Felicis, and is able to show his skills again, this time with resounding success.

Only years later, on a hilltop with Dumbledore, does he realize that maybe the potion hadn't been tainted after all...

*** This is interesting, but in Book 6 Harry gave the remaining potion to his friends and they used it and said that spells seemed to just miss them because of it. So technically that's a battle situation right? I imagine Snape used it to get back at the marauders instead, either that or maybe he was forced to give it to a death eater.

**** That is a good point. While you can argue that "not dying" helps fulfilling your personal desires, it doesn't really work with my headcanon for why it's only used for mundane tasks since at that point, you could just make sure to only take the potion once you're in a dire battle situation. It'd still be useless strategically, but the question instead becomes "why isn't it used tactically in battle?" in that case.

EDIT: However, that being said, it doesn't preclude the oneshot idea I had from working at all. It merely just negates my headcanon on why it's not used in battle situations.

****** While Harry's deepest desire in first year was to have his parents with him (which, when taking what my headcanon about Felix is, makes the potion incredibly morbid for him at the time...), I imagine that in 6th year, his deepest desire was to see Voldemort gone due to how personal that fight was at this point with the Prophecy and all. Thus, with Felix, he got what he needed to know to be able to do it. Sure, a lot of people at the time obviously wanted Voldemort gone, but for Harry, it was on a far more personal level.

******* That makes sense to me, but then it could be used as a strategy in war of sorts. You just need to figure out who truly, deeply, wants to crush the opposition. The chances would probably be low to find someone like that, but not impossible. Alternatively you could be really cruel and manoeuvre the army so that the enemy is between them and their homes so more people would hopefully get the desire to eliminate the imposing threat quickly and get to their loved ones...

******** Whie the former is probably doable, the latter sounds like something that would usually end up harder than just defeating them the "normal" way. After all, you'd have to do the manouvering without relying on Felix. And the former would only give a small fraction of "elite soldiers". Possible in cases like the Grindelwald war (maybe that's how he was as successful as he was?), but not in a situation like the Voldemort wars.

EDIT: The latter could also backfire outright for people whose desire is to "survive the war" which might cause them to switch sides the moment it becomes more likely to let them survive.

***** It doesn't work to fulfill your deepest desires tho, just gives u a bit of luck for however long it lasts, it has a short duration.

Personally I think it's a fake. It's a stimulant, or u could say liquid courage rather than liquid luck. I think it's a drug, a stimulant that gives you confidence. I think it's more liquid courage than anything else. Which is why there are bad side affects for drinking too much, euphoria is the main symptom to Felix Felicis toxicity that I remember, so that tells you right there it's a stimulant.

** If we assume it was Snape, I could see a very interesting outcome for this in a fanfic. Especially if it does happen at a time after his falling out with Lily.

Severus Snape had spent his evening and the remainder of the night laying outside the Gryffindor common room, begging Lily to come out and listen to him. Her scorn turned him off, and as he came to his senses amongst his Slytherin friends, he decided to turn his back on his very first friend and instead put his whole trust in the movement of Death Eaters gathering steam in his own house.

When he brewed the Felix Felicis, Snape held it close for a moment, stoppering the bottle with barely a breath of movement, a subtle arch of his head so that the curtain of dark hair shifted enough to allow him a glance at Lily. She and many others had given him the look of envy at Slughorn's praise, and he wondered what she was thinking at that moment. Putting the vial away, he allowed himself the time to consider how he would use it.

By the end of the day, it seemed the buzz was that a certain Slytherin had his hands on a perfectly brewed Felix Felicis potion. Knowing his own House-mates and their proclivity to pickpocketing and liberating possessions from others, Snape wandered the castle at night, debating where to keep his prize, and it was in this way he too discovered that secret place that others in need at Hogwarts had also come to know: The Room of Requirement. Thus, Snape discovered something he and only he knew about amongst his classmates and possibly even amongst those disgusting Marauders, who liked to boast their knowledge of the entire castle loudly. Tucking his prize away and enchanting the hiding place using a charm of his own making so he might find it again easily, Snape left his luck behind.

And over the rest of the year, when someone asked him about it, he would raise an eyebrow and sneer, refusing to volunteer an answer. Truthfully, he wasn't sure when he would use it, but no one else need know that. And so by the end of the year, the buzz had died down significantly, and even Snape found himself thinking of it less often, tucking away the knowledge of it until he needed it again.

And then as it happens, time passed, and Snape determined to get through the rest of his miserable life on his own prowess, joining the Death Eaters with his classmates just after graduation and refusing to turn to liquid luck for help. Until one day when he overheard a certain prophecy and reported it to the Dark Lord, not realizing what his response would be. Severus grew frantic at the realization that his stupidity had put a target on the back of his childhood friend, and so he reached out to the only wizard who could possibly help: Dumbledore. Even as he crept into Hogwarts, something tugged at the back of his mind, begging for awareness. Severus pushed it down, determined to seek aid and perhaps to atone just a tiny, small bit.

Dead. Death. Destruction. The words echoed in his mind as the Death Eaters passed information back and forth. The Dark Lord was dead, defeated by a child, their cause was lost, and now they needed a story, a party line, if you will. The words rolled around his brain as Severus, too, began to find his own story, his own plan, and made his way to some very unusual places. Seeking out a Ministry contact, Severus obtained something he would not admit to anyone, even under pain of death, and then he made his way back to the school he thought he would never see again.

“You said you would protect her!” Severus screamed in pain and fury, directing his anguish not at the Dark Lord who failed to show mercy but at the Headmaster who failed in his promise. The conversation went as it did, but Snape barely paid attention, focused on his two goals: unleashing his fury, and gaining access to the one thing that might help him. He barely registered Dumbledore's words, even with the bite that came from the Headmaster's own venom, but his mind and heart cried out for an answer to the question going round and round.

On his way out, Severus took a detour and reacquired his old potion, the liquid luck he would need to fix this. And in another hour's time, he found himself on a deserted knoll, clutching the potion and a small object held on a chain that he looped round his neck. Breathing deeply, Severus Snape calculated the turns and twisted the dial on the Time Turner, holding it steady before the release that would take him back to October 31st, a mere hour prior to the event that broke him. Gathering what courage he could salvage from his fury, Snape simultaneously released the Time Turner and knocked back the Felix Felicis.

In a bang of smoke, Severus found himself looking into what seemed a fog, and instead of it being Halloween night, he instead was locked into place through the combined force of the liquid luck and the Time Turner.

In a series of seemingly disconnected scenes, all accompanied by the ticking of a clock, Severus was presented images of the future. He saw himself seated at the head of the Great Hall, next to other teachers he had just graduated from under. He saw himself at the head of a classroom, students attentively looking at him over steaming cauldrons. He saw a black-haired boy on a stool, the Sorting Hat plopped onto his head, and then he watched the boy walk to the Gryffindor table. He saw himself standing up to a fellow teacher, a turbaned man with indistinguishable features. He watched as the black-haired student followed him around the school. He saw himself searching the school after leaving the students sleeping in the Great Hall. He watched as he stood to speak with Dumbledore gravely before exiting the school and apparating to appear in the midst of Death Eaters. His heart leapt precipitously at that, drumming in his chest as he watched this future version of himself going through motions that didn't match his current self.

He saw a fully alive Voldemort speak to himself and other Death Eaters. He watched himself continue to teach, this time with the dark-haired boy staring at him suspiciously. He saw himself following a blonde boy and speaking with him angrily. He saw the same blonde boy in a pool of blood with a cut that seemed suspiciously familiar and his future self waving his wand in a complicated pattern he recognized.

For what felt like hours, Severus watched these images culminate in a showdown he could never have dreamed of. Snape watched in fascination as the Dark Lord and the black-haired boy dueled in the ruins of his beloved school, and Snape held his breath, finally realizing who the black-haired boy was, the words of a broken prophecy filtering through his brain.

He came to on that same knoll. The Time Turner smoked around his neck, and he ripped off the chain, blinking furiously. His hand landed on the grass, and he gasped, pulling it to his face in the dark and seeing a shard of glass embedded in it from the crushed vial, empty of any liquid luck. Snape breathed in deeply, trying to process the last image his mind retained. It was that moment when Voldemort, the most feared Dark Lord in a century, fell to his back, blasted by the same curse he'd uttered that in some inexplicable way rebounded on him by the boy, Lily Evans' son.

When Dumbledore called on Snape to inquire about the open potions master position, Severus accepted, his mind's eye carrying the image of a wand flying through the air and snatched up with the unerring accuracy of a Seeker by a black-haired boy with piercing green eyes.

** During the boring, monotone sixth year at Hogwarts, the young and clever Severus Snape couldn't think of a perfect day to take the potion.

He could have saved it for when he had a particularly tedious test, but that seemed silly as he had no point wasting such a resource for a simple test that he could have easily passed with just a bit of study. He could have saved it for his NEWTs next year, but just as the OWLs they had the previous June, the NEWTs would have been distributed in a period of almost one month, therefore he could have used it in just one exam, but what was the point? He was intelligent, good at school and he dared to say exceptional at potions and charms, so why risking being caught to get an O instead of an E at one single stupid NEWT when he was already planning to join the Death Eaters as soon as he stepped out of that stupid school?

No, Severus Snape would have never wasted a Felix Felicis just to cheat on tests or gain academical successes he didn't even care about, that was for sure. So what could he use it for?

He could maybe take it to try to get Lily to forgive him, but in the end did he really want to? He already tried to sneak up on her in the corridors, in the park, in the great hall, he even went to the Gryffindor common room late at night and found himself begging another stupid Gryffindor mud blood girl to tell Lily to come to the corridor to have a chance to tell her how sorry he was, but in the end he knew she was right. Cause even tho he did not really mean to say what he said, what /she/ said was completely right. He called names and was mean to every other muggle born along with his friends, so why would she be different? He wanted to join an army that swore to cancel the muggle borns from the magical world, he wanted to fight with them, kill with them, he wanted to fight and persecute people like her. And for how much he desired to reconcile with Lily he knew deep down that she would have never completely forgave him, no matter what he did. Also, maybe if he used the Felix he would have been able to convince her to give him another chance, but what would have happened when he ran out of the potion? No, that would have never worked, and he had no interest in shaming himself more than he already did.

After months of trying to figure out what the perfect moment to take the Felix was, Severus Snape came to the realization that there would have never been a perfect day to do it, and that no matter what he did with it he would have regretted not saving it for something more important at some point in the future, so why worrying so much about it?

Severus Snape ended up taking it on a random, normal day. For all day, he knew what the right thing to say was, where were the raised floor tiles that always made him trip or that missing step he always fell through. He made jokes that made half the Slitherin table laugh at lunch, he was witty, and funny as he never was. He had a great chat with Slughorn before leaving his class ("What happened to you today, Severus? I hadn't laughed this much in months!"), and he even scored a couple goals playing Quidditch with Avery, Mulciber and Regulus Black ("Snape you finally figured out how to get a broom up from the ground you genius, didn't you? Never too late, huh?").

It was undoubtedly the best day he had had in a long time, but the best part came at the end.

Without him even realizing, it turned out there was a full moon that day. As soon as he noticed, he grabbed his darkest black cloak and run outside of the Slitherin common room. He was careful to every noise that could have signaled him that someone was approaching, but thanks to the Felix the corridors were completely desert.

He finally got to the gigantic wooden door that led to the park, without even knowing why that was the right place to go to, or how he knew it. He spotted Madame Pomfrey waiting by the open door, a lantern in one hand and her wand in the other. Snape hid behind one of the many statues, where he had a nice view of the door while still being out of sight in the dark. He didn't need to wait long, after just a few minutes, he started hearing quick steps leading down the corridor in front of him, but no one was in sight.

/"Oi Moony, damn it you stepped on my foot!"/

/"Well sorry, I can't see your troll feet in pitch dark, Pads! It's not my fault you're so tall you take up all the fucking space under here!"/

/"Shush! Keep it down, someone will hear us!"/

Snape squeezed his eye as much as he could, but despite his sight already adjusted perfectly to the dark and despite distinctly hearing the voices of Lupin and Black somewhere in front of him, all he could see was a desert corridor.

/"Oh yeah, pretend to be the responsible one now, if you didn't wanna risk it you could have let me get down here alone, last time I checked I could walk by myself you know? And there's no one here, just Madame Pomfrey waiting for me, you know she won't say anything if she sees you, idiot."/

/"How are you certain that there's no one here if you forgot the fucking map on James' bed, huh?"/

/"Pads you'd forget your damn brain on James' bed if you weren't physically attached to it, I'm sorry ok? Besides I'm not hearing or smelling anything beside the rain, we're alone!"/

Suddenly, Lupin appeared out of nowhere, and just as him, he hid by a pillar down the corridor, out of Madame Pomfrey's sight.

"I'm gonna go now. Be careful coming down, you three, I don't want you idiots to get detention for me."

/"Oh shut it, it'd be a pleasure going to polish some trophies for you, Moons. Just don't hurt yourself before we get there, okay?"/

Snape could hear Lupin grinning, alone in the corridor. He walked the few meters to the pool of soft, warm light still coming from the dusk outside, saluted Madame Pomfrey with a light nod, and followed her outside, raising his hood against the pouring rain.

Suddenly, he looked back at the corridor, and right there, standing in that same pool of dying sunlight there was Black. A soft cloak that looked almost like it was made of pure water was hanging from his left arm as he tucked his hair behind his ears. He watched Lupin disappear in the rain, and then he turned his back to Snape and quietly started going back to wherever he came from.

"Black!" His name left his mouth long before he could stop it. Black turned around and looked at him, trying to process the information.

"What do you want, Snivellus?"

"I knew there was something up with you all. I knew it. You got caught this time, huh?"

"Oh yeah Snivellus, please don't report me, /I beg you/!" he teased. "Do you really think I'll be in trouble for literally just walking?"

"Not really, but Lupin maybe could."

Black flinched a little at his friend's name. "He was with a teacher and you want to report him? Are you really /this/ stupid?"

"Not with Dumbledore, I know he's allowed to go wherever he went. Personally tho, I know a couple of people that would be very intrigued to know he disappears out of the castle at every full moon, you know?"

Black forced himself to smile. "Then follow him and make sure, Snivellus. Go see it with your own eyes. You just have to push the big knot on the trunk to stop it and there you go." he said, grinning. "Maybe then I'll believe you have the balls to tell someone."

** I think he used it the day he heard the prophecy.

That day he heard a seer speak a prophecy and used it to become an inner circle death eater. It is just that the aftermath of his good luck turned to ash in his mouth.

I think felix felicis works in a similar way but at a much greater scale as Comed Tea from HPMOR. Comed Tea has a set outcome of a situation where a person will perform a spittake. It is able to detect a future event that will cause one and create a minor compulsion to have a drink. However this compulsion isn't caused by drinking and it is not a Magical potion, it is caused by possessing the can. As a result, it doesn't relate to specific desires of the person drinking it.

Felix Felicis on the other hand is a potion and when drunk its effect is based on the desire in the witch or wizard drinking it and their magic. When Harry drank it, he did it with the intention of retrieving Slughorn's memory, so he was guided to retrieving it.

Snape probably drank it with the intention and desire for power and standing and it led to overhear the prophecy and gain rank in the Death Eaters.

My personal theory of how both the Comed Tea and the Felix Felicis works has to do with Occamy Shells. Potions tends to be as much poetry as it is chemistry. Occamy derive their name from William Ockham and Occam's Razor which stated that the simplest explanation is often the most accurate and that it is beneficial to removing extraneous material from a theory or a process.

By that idea the brewing of Occamy Shells with the rest of the ingredients in the Felix Felicis potion cuts away extraneous material and provides a simple path or explanation to the desires of the person who drinks it.

I would bet the cans of Comed Tea contain some sort of treated and diluted Occamy shells which would not be noticed as the aluminum of the cans and the silver of the shells mix together in color very well. The shells would have been treated in a mixture that links them to a comedic event rather than the desires of the holder of the can. The dissolution of the shell and the low amount of shell to begin with would explain why only one comedic event happens for each can instead of it happening consistently or even more than one.
