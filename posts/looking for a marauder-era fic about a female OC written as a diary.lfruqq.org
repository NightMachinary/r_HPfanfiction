:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
it was kind of snarky and kind of sweet. very low-stakes, ordinary school story, not a dramatic battle thing. one detail i remember is that she would record her weight in stone in every diary entry, i think she had a bit of an eating disorder but it was never the main focus of the story. she also dated sirius i think

wait... actually it might have been next-gen, about rose weasley (with love interest scorpius). im not sure how i can possibly be unsure of this, but i am! i can't find this fic anywhere, please help...
