Preferably one without pairings, with Harry as the main character and everything changes because he went back in time. Nothing at the end should be the same as in the canon verse. At the start there can be some things that are the same as the canon but as the story progresses Harry should fuck up and change everything for worse and then find a way to save everyone.

** The first I thought of is linkffn(5511855). There is a pairing but the timeline is changed greatly. HP/BB

Another one you might want to look at is linkffn(4068153) again there is a pairing but the changes are vast. HP/FD

The last one is linkffn(4101650) here Harry, Ron and Ginny return back. It is my favourite timetravel fic because of the way Dumbledore and Snape. Again signifanct changes to the timeline but a HP/GW pairing. This one is heavy on the pairings.

I understand that these are pretty popular stories that don't exactly give OP what he asked for but they are my favorite fic in the genre and I felt I should rec them.

**** It's nominally Harry/Ginny, largely one-sided with Harry pining after Ginny, but with the slight complication of a soul bond with Molly (among other things).

It's actually quite horrible and you're probably better off not reading it.

*** You mean where Luna goes back in time to save her mother but accidentally causes a time wave that sees Harry dead, James Potter as a depressed, drunken Wizard Who Lived, Lily Potter going insane and becoming Voldemorte's right hand, Dumbledore captured and experimented on by the government, the English and French going to war over a broken marriage contract that basically destroys the muggle world... Hermione as an agent of the muggle government desperately trying to stop the wizarding war from destroying the world..

I am telling you HP Fanfiction "The Flash" has legs. Although I do not know who you would cast Professor Zoom as. Luna doesn't really have an arch enemy. Maybe a Snorkack?
