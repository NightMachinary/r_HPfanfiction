** I feel like you see this in the early chapters of a lot of manipulative/evil Dumbledore. Extreme cases, but still. My favorite of those being from a crack fic I can't seem to find at the moment where Harry, starting at like age 4, begins his quest to run away from the Dursleys. It's incredibly stupidly hilariously silly. title was something about free or escaping.

Okay, I found the crackfic extreme version of Harry escaping via underage magic and then being obliviated. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry][Escapologist Harry]]
