I have been searching for this fic for nearly a week now and finally gave up and come here. It was a Harry/Hermione story in wich Salazar Slytherin made Horcruxes and defeated the other founders. Hermione got kidnapped from her home when she displayed accidental magic.


** Is it "Reign of the Serpent"?

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
