It's been a while since I've read this particular fic hence why I've been having such a difficult time trying to actually find it. 

The fic was a crossover revolving around Fem!Harry, who had in some way or another (an accident?? I don't exactly remember) traveled to another dimension. She couldn't speak the language and had a hard time communicating with the locals. Don't quite remember, but somehow she got mistaken as a goddess and her magic was the main cause of that. I do remember she was living in the nearby forest and had by the use of magic got a "hut" like home and at some point help a wounded lion (or wolf?) who would later end up staying with her? There was one particular scene that I do remember and it involved some of the locals going to her hut with their baby and asked her to sort of bless the child. 

I not sure if this is enough information, but it has been a while since I last read it and I'd really appreciate any and all sorts of help trying to find the fic!
