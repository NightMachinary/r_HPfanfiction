Any stories where the Hallows are central to the plot? Like really central, not just ‘oh let's collect them and not use them at all'.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) deals a lot with the Hallows in its second half, giving them a sort of sentience and making them very different from other magical artifacts

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  ONE-SHOT! The story of the most famous wand of all times. A circle of life and death, of weakness and strength and the temptation of power. Told from the most unlikely witness ...

  When Hermione is sent back in time with a spell, she decides to use this to her advantage and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Lord Voldemort. What follows will challenge everything she knew about herself, and everything she thought she knew about him. Eventually dark. Postwar AU.
