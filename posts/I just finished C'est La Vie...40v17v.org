I have seen it recommended so many times, and I was itching to read an AU where Harry's parents are alive. I wish I knew that it wasn't completed when I started it and I have to say, /maybe this is an unpopular opinion?/, I really didn't care for it at all. I am not sure why it is recommended so often. This is the first rec from this sub that I have taken that didn't end well for me. Maybe it's because I felt the Super!Harry in this fic was just.../poorly done?/

I don't know I can't quite place my finger on my discontent. At least with HPMOR there are others out there who think like me but maybe I just expected something that it wasn't. Anyway I'll probably delete this because I think I am breaking like 50 school rules.

Has anyone else started a fic that didn't end up being what they thought it would be and then continued it with the hope it would change but were just left disappointed at the end?

*** I have to agree with TheBlueMenace. I get annoyed by changing his name to "Hadrian" for no reason that is necessary to the story. So many do it "just because."

But in this story, he really does need to be distinguished from the Harry Potter of his new universe. So he can't be either Harry or Potter.

Maybe "Hadrian" isn't the best choice, but it could be worse. And frankly "Hadrian" kinda fits in with a lot of other wizarding names, given how many have Latin origins/roots.

*** Well, with two Harry's hanging around, you /do/ need a way to distinguish them (and, you know, not cause people to question if protagonist is also Harry Potter). Hadrian Evens seems to be one of the less offensive names... after all it could be Lord Black-Potter-Slytherin or something along those lines.

** No need to delete something just because everyone might not agree with you. I think we've been relatively good with that, as a sub, so far, and I hope we can maintain that culture!

Anyways, to answer your question, yeah. A lot of stuff in fanfiction can turn out to be disappointing. Perhaps the most prominent example, for me, is linkffn(Delenda Est). It has a healthy start, and it had /so/ much potential. By the middle, though, I was just reading it out of hopes the author would dig himself out of the hole he made. It never did happen, and I could never bring myself to finish it.

**** 200k? Hah, The Legacy by storytellerSPw could stand to lose more than half of it, at least 350k. You probably could cut about half the chapters to ~3k, delete a quarter of the chapters entirely, and rewrite the rest to about 7k and have a somewhat decently paced fic. Currently the chapters are just under 10k each.

What constitutes good for a fanfic? Is it a different standard than for original stuff? I love Moby Dick but only Melville wrote it. There's 700k fanfics in the Potter section of ffn. I love to read, always have. Is Joyce better than Doyle or Kipling? I don't know, I just know I'll read a Sherlock before Ulysses.

** Pretty much anything by cywscross (author of /C'est la Vie/) qualifies. The author is constitutionally incapable of completing more than a one-shot and basically recycles the same character throughout all his/her stories, the over-powered emoStu.

Sometimes, you're just in the mood for such a story. Guilty pleasure territory. Other times, you go for something more interesting.

** I'm actually happy you posted this as I just finished reading this fic. I saw it recommended as a near-flawless piece so perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, but I really disliked it and wondered if I was alone. I'd be happy if anyone wants to discuss it with me. I'll add some stuff I did like at the end so I'm not just complaining! (Also I'm sorry this ended up a bit long!)

First of all, I think the author's biggest mistake was to rename Harry. He was already fairly out-of-character to begin with, so with the new name he pretty much became an OC. I honestly don't think it would have been all that confusing if only his last name had been changed, since other-Harry does not appear all that much in the fic.

As an OC, it becomes even more blatant how perfect Hadrian is. He gets a place in his original group of friends pretty much immediately, teachers and students alike instantly take a liking to him, he puts the bullies in their place, is good in all his classes and a god in Ancient Runes, rallies a huge group of friends around him with little effort... I swear, in the chapter where he gets his OWL and NEWT marks I thought to myself ‘I bet this dude will get the highest marks ever achieved in Ancient Runes history' and yup. That predictable. Due to this, absolutely nothing exciting happens. There is no suspense. Everything always goes Hadrian's way. Even the frostiest characters warm up to him quickly. That is, except his counterpart since naturally, the fic needs a bad guy! He just can't be smart or otherwise Hadrian wouldn't look better than he does.

Speaking of other-Harry, I feel like the author just glossed over an explanation of why he is the way he is. The explanation that he was spoiled just did not do it for me. If he had just been arrogant, sure, but he was just downright hateful. Why would other-Harry hate werewolves when his father's best friend is one and he pretty much grew up with another one? I think the author was trying to paint him like James and Sirius were in their schooldays, but missed the mark.

Some other miscellaneous stuff that bothered me: the characters the author clearly doesn't like are either completely left out of the story (Crabbe, Goyle, Ginny) or are portrayed as one-dimensional bullies (Cho). I get that it's a different ‘world' in that sense, but so much is the same that those changes felt off to me. Second, why bother sorting Harry into Hufflepuff when he was going to be ignoring most of that House and sitting with the Gryffindors anyway? Third, why would Cedric hang out with a bunch of fourth years? I thought it was realistic for him as a prefect to show an interest in Hadrian, but to hang out with him and his friends constantly? No.

Okay, points I liked: I thought Orion was a really interesting character and besides the fact that the person who made his life hell was other-Harry, I think it was a fairly realistic portrayal of how an ‘out' werewolf would have to cope at Hogwarts. I liked how Sirius and Remus behaved towards him. In fact, I liked the characterisations of most of the canon characters. I appreciated the lack of romance too. Overall, I liked that the story was mostly focused on characters and friendships instead of a plot we all basically know already, but I wish the author had let some other characters do some of the heavy lifting instead of Hadrian effortlessly organising everything left and right.

As for OP's last question, I have started reading a lot of recommended fics and dropped them just as quickly. I usually know within the first 10,000 words whether I like the fic or not. I only continued with C'est La Vie despite my gut feelings because it came highly recommended. I think the only fic so far that I continued and ended up liking was A Long Journey Home.

** I've read maybe four chapters of C'est La Vie before dropping it, so I can't really comment on its quality, or lack thereof.

As for starting a fic that disappointed, then continuing with it - I used to do this a lot a few years back. A huge list of poorly done Azkaban stories, Dark Lord stories and Rehashes I stuck with because I found those tropes interesting. Nowadays, I'm far more fickle, I suppose you could say. Even the smallest things are enough for me to drop something.

Regardless of whether this is true or not, it really doesn't add much to the discussion, and it comes off as caustic.

What would /facilitate/ discussion, however, is explaining what /you/ thought was off about the fic. It would help others see your viewpoint, at the very least.

Personally? "Hadrian" throws me off. I can't read a fic with "Hadrian" everywhere without getting a headache.

***** Well part of it is that for some reason (possibly Emperor Hadrian and his Wall) people think that Harry is too much a commoners name for the Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Black, and Hadrian is far more lordly.

For me, it's less about the specific name Harry chooses. If Harry starts referring to himself as Hadrian (or whatever) in his mind or the author uses it anywhere but in dialogue or other characters thoughts, then he basically becomes an OC in my opinion.

E: Oh, and Hadrian is used in tons of fics.

***** It's part of the Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor family of cliches. A cheap excuse to make him sound more regal or something like that, but ends up coming off as a complete character replacement. It can be used well, such as in one fic where his legal name was some form of not-Harry but everyone still called him Harry anyway, and the plot point was that he never even knew his real birth name.

In others, it's a sign that his middle name has also been changed, to Sue. He's suddenly lost all the characteristics that made him what we love (and love to abuse to be honest) and turned him into a god among men, untouchable by mortals, ruler of Hogwarts by some metaphysical hogwash, able to put the wizarding world on its head with a nod at the wizengamot.

It usually appears in stories that also tick the other vomit enducing cliches such as the chapter long shopping trip; the insanely helpful goblins; the blood test that shows infinite wealth, hidden magical powers, and curses place upon him; and light-side bashing that boils down to ridiculously stupid actions with a complete lack of reason, such as potions.

Thus, Hadrian is something that sticks out as a story destroyer, and is why we complain about it. Most of the stories that have it wind up with the exact same plot-bustingly powerful Harry with no enemies and no failures, meaning there's nothing left for the story to do, except maybe write some smut.

And so the story gets few to no reviews total, and the ones it gets are generally flamey, and the author either quits the story or tries to salvage it in another fic. The fabled Knights of /New get to see all the utter shite but most of it never comes up again. It won't seen when sorted by reviews, it won't be on fav lists, and they rarely pass the 40k word threshold.

***** Well, there are a whole bunch of other names you could use without sounding like an extra from Julius Caesar; Henry is a name that is very close to Harry (in fact, I think Harry can be considered a diminutive for Henry), and still sounds natural enough to be an actual person's name, not some adolescent edgelord's (which a Harry who calls himself Hadrian is almost invariably bound to be) idealised conception of himself. Changing his name to Hadrian comes off especially ridiculous since Harry is a name that /already/ has royal/noble connotations in England, so there's absolutely no reason to make his name sound more regal, even if you are part of "Lord Potter-Black-Something-or-Another" coterie.
