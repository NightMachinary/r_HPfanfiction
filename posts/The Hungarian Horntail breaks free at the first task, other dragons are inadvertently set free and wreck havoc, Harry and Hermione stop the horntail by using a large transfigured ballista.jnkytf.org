**** Well if you like the author's shorts collection try the story Harry Potter Junior Inquisitor. While it looks abandoned it still is over 218K words long and was a good read. It's a 5th year story.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

***** Thank you! I'm actually not a fan of longer fics haha even 100k fics scare me. I really like oneshot collections for that reason, actually.

****** Not a problem. I'm willing to read any length of fic. Though I often end up wishing that a oneshot I like was actually longer. The author has several oneshots/much smaller fics you should check out.

Yeah I get it. I've felt this way too, but I feel like a lot of oneshots are great precisely because of what they manage to accomplish in a limited word count. If extended, they might not be able to maintain their quality. And thanks, I'll check out their other fics! I have multiple tabs open on ffn.net writers with many oneshots that I'm planning to go through rn and it's almost overwhelming haha.
