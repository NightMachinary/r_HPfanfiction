It's the same script all the time.

Chapter one: author introduces new character and deviation from canon.

Chapter two: fight with Ron or Mrs Weasley; usually both. Hermione remains true.

I understand not wanting Ron/Mrs Weasley in the story that's fine. It's just exhausting to read the same fight every time. Usually this part of the story is not well done either.

One time I read one where all the Weasleys died in a portkey accident as an opening to introduce the new character. It was pretty good and not a chore to read.

If you don't want characters in your story don't put them in. But dedicating a whole chapter to Ron and Harry's breakup is exhausting to write and no fun to read.

What do you think?


** If the story is starting after the first year Hogwarts express then it's very hard for me to believe that Harry doesn't want to be friends with Ron and vice versa. Maybe it could work if you put extra stress at a pinch point, start of 5th year, after the Goblet of Fire. Anything else I would just recommend taking Ron out of the story for a bit, have Harry be a private detective, then just slowly develop Harry away from Ron.

But then often the the point of these fanfics is the “owning” of Ron and they don't have much planned story elsewise.

*** You also have to add the fact that Harry 'most likely' made other friends. Kid has had zero friends his whole life and you think that he just decides on that train those two would do and no more? No way kids at the school and making all kinds of friends. The movie and books overplay the dramatic super hard. Only showing a few points of tension and altercations. Even with people just wanting to say hi or play a game with the boy who lived is semi-strange but with that kind of lack of human interaction, even netural feelings kinda way let alone good. I wont ron bash but hes not exactly the high bar for friendship.

**** I would consider standing between your friend and a believed mass murderer trying to kill your friend, as a very high bar for friendship

** I always prefer stories where relationships fall apart organically. For me, that means it doesn't happen with one fight (unless it's something ridiculously extreme). I think Harry and Ron have a genuine bond, and I'm always sad when they're blown up in one fight. That being said, especially in stories where Weasleys are bashed, it does make sense to just cut the ties quickly.

** I completely agree. There is a reason why I love strong Harry-Ron bromances that flourish!

** Today in Subversion Corner: Harry and Ron stage a break-up to get closer to someone with possible ties with Voldemort or even just Umbridge, but they are horrible actors and it looks like in a bad fanfic.

For you, maybe. Some people actually like writing that sort of thing.

*** Yes, that is true. But I still think that cramming it into one piece never really feels right. Spreading the breakup out over a period of time and chapters usually feels better. Harry slowly coming to the realization that Ron isn't quite as important in his life as he thought is much more satisfying than suddenly evicting him from his life because of his eating habits.

** My thought process is that if a male character chooses a girl whom he doesn't want to bang (at least at first) over his male best friend then that author has never been a teenager or at least had no friends as a teenager or is a girl.

Edit: the most realistic break ups I've read involve Harry being so whipped by his girlfriend that he no longer hangs out with Ron because his girlfriend (be her whom she may) disagrees of their friendship.
