** I would do it during fourth year, visiting Cedric. The hufflepuffs would have to be way less bullyish though. Or maybe it's something Cedric does to try and convince them not to be arseholes

** "What if... Slytherin's Heir was a Hufflepuff?"

"Harry..."

"No, no. Hear me out. What's more cunning than hiding in another house?"

"True..."

"-And, and what do we all do to Hufflepuffs? We underestimate them. We ignore them. The perfect place for a snake to wait in the grass like... a snake, in the grass."

"But Riddle was an egomaniac. There's no way he'd stoop so low as to be in Hufflepuff."

"Hermione..."

"You know what I mean. I like Hufflepuffs."

/shrugs/

"Half his followers from the last war pretended they were tricked into following him and that they never knew him. He's probably a little tetchy about loyalty these days. Where better to grow a new crop of Death Eaters than the house of Loyalty?"

"...Fine. I'll brew more Polyjuice. I trust you and Ron can get the hairs we need?"

"Sure... we can get... whathisname's hair, and maybe some from the other one. You know, the farmer?"

"You really need to start learning people's names."

"You're probably right, Harmony."

"Harry!"

** Have Harry host the DA meeting in the Hufflepuff common room. Although they hated Harry half of the time, they probably hated Umbridge more.

** Maybe, using his invisibility cloak, he follows some Hufflepuffs who are gospping about him or discussing details of an urgent topic. (Then he gets stuck in there and maybe revealed.)

** Harry and Hermione develop an elaborate plan involving ventriloquism, an illicit charm, and three of Hagrid's largest pumpkins.

Meanwhile Ron just goes up to the entrance and flags down the next Hufflepuff to come through.

"Hey, I was wondering if we could take a look inside your common room real quick?"

"Sure, come right in. We were about to roast some chestnuts in the fireplace if you want any."

Harry and Hermione gape at him, while Ron just rolls his eyes. "That's Hufflepuffs for you."

** The Battle of the Astronomy Tower is much more violent as Voldemort himself enters Hogwarts through the vanishing cabinet. Students are asked to take shelter in their common rooms. Since Voldemort enters at the seventh floor, there is no way for Harry to return to the towers so he hides in the Hufflepuff common room since Slytherin is not an option.

** hufflepuff party. cause they have parties and Harry being the boy who lived gets invited. his inability to party will ruin his future access though.

or something involving the kitchens. maybe he visits Dobby or other house elf, or he gets food from there for some reason. he puts his invisibility cloak on and leaves, but some hufflepuffs are there acting ... suspicious. following them, he soon discovers why. it's a... secret hufflepuff party!

** Harry bursts in randomly looking for Helga Hufflepuff's cup and finds them in the middle of a group masterbation session.
