In this AU, Voldemort and his followers are still the same Pure-blood obsessed group, except that they hide their more extreme sides. They create their own political group and introduce laws that subtly discriminates against muggle-borns, half-bloods and all other 'impure' beings. While all this happens, coincidentally, wizards who happen to oppose Voldemort die from random accidents. Lily and James Potter crashed in an apparent accident involving a huge muggle contraption called a car. Thus, when Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts and realizes that Voldemort and his group had a hand in his parents' murder, He will have to find a way to expose Voldemort's group for their true colors or end up facing the same fate as his parents.


** It doesn't go to the degree of killing off his opponents secretly, but in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels, Voldemort went the political route rather than violent revolution. He heads up the Save Our World political party, which spends its time introducing legislation designed to disenfranchise Muggleborns and half-bloods.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** This is a pretty interesting idea. Voldemort could even have quietly decided to take the same approach as that which worked for Hitler in the early 30s, while of course hiding the fact that he took his inspiration from a mere muggle. Operating as a political party would make it a lot harder for them to become declared public enemies.

** Yeah I dont get why he didnt try that in canon, most of his followers were the 1 percenters of the wizarding world and it's clear huge swaths of the ministry sided with him as well, heck lucius owned the monster at some point lol

** Well, in linkffn(Benefits of Old Laws) he regains some of his sanity by reabsorbing horcruxes after his resurrection, and switches to less violent methods. Iirc they start abducting magical children born to muggles, so they can be raised around magic. Or perhaps it was mostly orphans. I know he did some genealogical research and concluded that most cases of muggle-born wizards are actually squib lines resurfacing, so his emphasis shifted from purging to reclaiming.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

**** I haven't actually finished it since it was completed; I was up to about chapter 80 or thereabouts when I dropped it from my Follow list. I'll probably go back and read the rest at some point. With Tom reformed, it sometimes felt a bit short on conflict; Dumbledore may have been more hostile to Tom than strictly necessary, but not enough to make him a proper villain, so there wasn't really a Big Bad any more. It's possible that that changed in the remaining chapters, I suppose.

It explored some interesting ideas, though.

***** Snape had the skills and enough of voldemorts favor to make people back off but the other death eaters like Malfoy and Bellatrix treat him with disdain, he just doesn't seem to care. Voldemorts lineage may have been uncovered but then again he's got the heir of Slytherin thing. Although it's more likely he would've dropped the riddle name and gone by gaunt.

***** Snape definitely did. Nobody recognizes the title of "Halfblood Prince" when Harry looks into it. It was a secret codename that Snape used as a kid, but he didn't go around proclaiming that he had a Muggle father in Slytherin, because it wasn't something to be proud of.
