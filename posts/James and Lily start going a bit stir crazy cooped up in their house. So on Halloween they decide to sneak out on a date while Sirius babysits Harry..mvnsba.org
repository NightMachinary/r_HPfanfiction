** Sirius panicked. He knew that when you met Voldemort there were little chances you'd live to tell the tale. He, even though pretty good at dueling, was always used to have his friends back him up. Harry was too young to understand the concept of 'running away for his life' while held off Voldemort. There was no chance of taking the boy and trying to escape because Voldemort could easily catch up with them. If only he'd brought his motorcycle with him. The situation seemed hopeless. Both him and Harry were going to die tonight. But then Sirius came up with an idea.

Voldemort entered the house in Godric's Hallow. He was surprised of how little resistance he encountered. The Potters were not at home but he had most certainly seen light in the baby's room from outside. What irresponsible parent leaves their one-year old by themselves? Anyways. It was not his problem. The fewer people, the cleaner the job Voldemort thought as he climbed up the stairs and entered the room. He could see the baby fast asleep in his crib, covered by sheets. He could cast a curse and be gone but he wanted to make sure that this boy, whom for some reason was prophesized to bring about his downfall, died. Generally he didn't put much weight on prophecies but it was better safe than sorry. As he approached the crib, he slowly removed the sheets and his eye went wide when he saw what was underneath them.

"What? You must be shitting me. The child of the prophecy is a dog?"

** "P'ddy!" gurgled young Harry as he reached out to boop his canine caretaker on the nose.

Outwardly, Sirius recoiled, shook, and went through a rather complicated rendition of "play dead".

Inwardly, he rejoiced. His ploy had worked! James and Lily had complained about young Prongslet being fussy and not wanting to stay in the crib... Of course he wouldn't want to stay in the crib! Sirius wouldn't either! Cribs were evil, everyone knew that. With thick, wooden bars and limited amount of space to have fun in. No, his godson would not be confined to a crib of all things.

A bit of wandwork set up a few harmless pranks so that the returning parents, when they did return, would not catch him playing loose with Da Rulez. A few cushioning charms, so that the little tyke wouldn't make a problem if he bumped into something... A few blankets piled on already soft carpet... And then, Sirius was a dog and having the time of his life.

James had said he wouldn't manage it! Him! Sirius Black! Who was laughing now? Who?

Actually, Sirius was pretty sure it was Harry laughing, since the boy managed to crawl closer and grab hold of his ear again. Yup, ear captured. It stung a bit, but Sirius didn't feel pain! He felt victory. He was Sirius Black, bachelor extraordinaire, and he was amazing with children! Well, one child, but who was counting? Not him, that's for sure.

Now, granted, feeding and diaper changing /had/ required some quick thinking and faster spellwork, but eh! He'd managed. He'd managed quite well, if he said so himself.

Sirius was about to once again move back a step to encourage little Harry's forays into independent movement when his alarm spell dinged. Sirius jumped up, transformed and summoned a mirror. Would not do t miss their faces...

...That's not James. Nor Lily. She might spit venom when provoked, but James wouldn't date someone who looked like a vertical snake. Oops. Uh-huh.

That was a Dark Lord in the garden. The Fidelius-covered garden. Which was supposed to be Dark-Lord-free. and was that an Anti-Apparition Jinx? Yeah, it was.

Double uh-huh.

Maybe if Sirius had not spent the last few hours playing Doggy, he would have done something different. He might have tried to duel Voldemort, or futilely try to call for help. As it was, he did what came the most naturally.

He turned into his dog form. Snuffles leapt towards the child, bit into the singlet and, with a baby hanging from his teeth, rushed away from the danger.

The window panes were not enhanced. They could not be, with Fidelius causing magical interference. Without a big, expensive, dedicated wardstone there was nothing that could be done.

It was no match for over a hundred pounds of dog at "escape" velocity.

As he landed, Sirius felt a sharp pain in his legs. Cracked, possibly broken. Doesn't matter. Run, run, run. The danger's still there. Don't stop running.

No more jinx? No more jinx! Quick, transform!

Where to apparate? Quick, quick, quick!

Hogwarts? No.

Mungo's? No.

Longbottom's? No, not with the place on lockdown.

Grimmauld? Yes, no chance of splinching. Hate the place, hate it, but remember it well. Should be empty still after the Auror raid. It is empty. Not for long. Long enough. Will do.

*ka-crack!*

The Potter couple would later return to find the house a pile of rubble and ashes, with the Dark Mark illuminating the scene witha sickly green glow. Corpse of Petter Pettigrew was lying on the grass barely recognizable after taking the brunt of the dark lord's fury. Deep gouges were carved into him, many organs simply missing, much of his skin covered in rat fur. He looked like a macable work of art. Voldemort himself, absent, having left when it bacame clear his quarry had eluded him.

****** Additionally, at that point the attrition was steadily climbing towards unsustainable numbers.

In a normal scenario, when Fidelius was effective and Order had some small victories, it was natural that some people would stay because their friends did, and they didn't want to abandon them.

However, here, Voldemort managed to break past the Fidelius (as far as people know, Wormtail is not a traitor. He kept his mouth shut, but Voldemort used some ritual to extract the Secret anyway.)

There haven't been any recent 'wins'.

And with this close shave, I'd see Sirius, James and Lily just writing Britain off and fleeing. Hopefully pulling some of their friends away from the sinking ship.

As a result of that, the resistance would falter, of course it would. More people dead, even more leaving. In the end, only the most stubborn would remain. Most people would leave, and take with them any valuables they could carry, including i.e. the Book of Births, so that future muggleborns would at least get a chance.

This would likely be followed by a flood of dark sympathisers and the like into the country, since it would be then 'theirs'. With his forces swelling, Voldemort would be in position to expand, and try to conquer more.

And lose, because at that point, the escapees would spread the word and the world would be preparing for him while he consolidated his position and summoned/accepted all the allied factions - essentially putting all Dark eggs in one British basket and challenging the world.

The world didn't appreciate the presumption.

It might have ended in one big ritual, sinking British Isles as once Atlantis was sunk. It might have been a long, bloody campaign with mountains of corpses stacked on either side. Either way, it would set back the Dark cause by decades if not centuries. With most of it's supporters dead, the ideology has trouble persisting.

******** If my comment gave you an impression of 'immediately' anything, I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication.

I am talking years in which Voldemort fully takes over (without any significant resistance still present), consolidates, and then, with a might of a country and all the summoned help tries to 'dispose of muggle vermin' or something like that.

ICW might not want to intervene when the situation can still resolve itself, but if it's unambigous and the New Britain moves to explicitly violate the Statute...

Besides, in Book 7, there was at least an illusion of legitimacy in the Ministry. Even among muggleborns, most stayed. But after all muggleborn, many half-bloods and a fair bit of purebloods move out, all spreading the tales of a new Big Bad... Europe remembers Grindewald.

I'm not even talking an immediate action here. Just shoring up defences, implementing a bit stricter security in givernment positions, increasing defense budget... Small steps taken "what if".

Of course, Voldemort would not be satisfied with just Britain and once he reached out again... the world would strike back.

This would be happening over a decade or two.

********* But it's also important to take into consideration Grindelwald's history. Until he personally got defeated by Dumbledore, his movement was still going strong, and that was with the ICW fully opposing him. Voldemort is certainly on par with the likes of Dumbledore and Grindelwald, so it isn't much of a stretch to imagine that his forces would fare well as long as he's there to lead them. He would probably be even more dangerous than Grindelwald, because he doesn't have to worry about being killed. He could also mostly ignore the Muggle world if he thought doing so would be beneficial for him, similar to what he did during 1997-1998.

********** Agreed, but one, after Grindewald people would be wary and quicker to jump into preparations and two, with most of the dark elements streaming to Britain, he'd have less saboteurs.

Additionally, he built his following on pureblood propaganda, so without the excuse of "we still have enemies to deal with here!" (because these enemies weither left or died already) he would need an enemy to direct his troops at...

Additionally, as far as I remember, Grindewald was much saner than Voldemort. still a violent megalomaniac, but somewhat less prone to rash action.

*********** Voldemort was only completely insane after he got killed in 1981. Or, at least, there's no evidence to suggest he was rash or insane before that.

It also really depends on who's streaming into Britain. Wealthy and influential pureblood bigots from other countries certainly wouldn't want to go to Britain if they already have power and influence in their own countries. He could also simply order them to stay in their own countries and attack on his command to build up even more support instead of allowing them all to trickle into Britain. His movement is also mainly based on pureblood propaganda, but he has no issue with recruiting halfbloods to his cause, and he had even allied with werewolves and dementors in the past, which can significantly increase his level of threat.
