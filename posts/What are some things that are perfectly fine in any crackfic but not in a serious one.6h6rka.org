*** Hagrid becoming a super badass in the war doesn't necessarily have to be crackfic... I could see an AU where the war has stretched on for years and in that time there was a breakthrough on forging magic with muggle weapons.

There's a pretty legit fic, linkffn(Divided and Entwined), where muggleborns extensively use guns and explosives in battles. Since Hagrid can't really fit on a broom, and he's so animal-friendly, I could see something like this being pretty badass if the right buildup was given to it.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

***** I know right? His physical strength, his resistance to certain spells, his somewhat unknown magical abilities, his ability to relate to magical creatures, all seems vastly underused in both canon and a lot of fanfiction. I think a lot of people shy away from him because he's a difficult character to write, his language/accent is often bungled and I don't blame them because it's rather unique. But I'm often disappointed with how little of focus he is given in stories.

Give me a well-written DH rewrite where the trio is somehow forced to use a cave Hagrid is hiding in to live in while on the horcrux search, or perhaps a side story that outlines how Hagrid was helping during the DH times. There's another good WIP fic right now, linkffn(Order of Mercy) that I wish he had become involved in, but doesn't quite look like it. Again, it may just be due to how difficult he is to write, or in that case, it may just be his lack of a connection to characters outside of the trio being established in canon. Although I'd like to think we just haven't seen those connections and he's been inviting students from all grades down to his hut for tea and catching up.

****** The problem with writing Hagrid is that even though he has such an interesting background and abilities, he comes off to the typical reader as stubborn or kinda dumb.

Most people write fics about characters that they can glamorize in some way. Also, HP fanfic is very ship-based, and due to his size, Hagrid is unlikely to be paired with anyone other than Maxime if it isn't a crack fic. So many fics will likely not even have him as a side character because they can't think of any purpose for Hagrid's inclusion.

The accent is difficult to write, but authors easily brush off Viktor and Fleur's accents.

Hagrid was well used in canon, but he could've had a bigger role in HBP and DH.

** The one where Harry and Sirius go to the Quidditch World Cup in a flying armored van painted as an 'Merican flag, expanded interior includes massive gun locker and ammo storage, they land on a spot marked by a giant American flag, pop out a massive grill, and then Arthur Weasley sets himself on fire trying to grill for the first time.

Then, for the 2nd task, he calls in Sirius to use the van to drop a heavily armed US Coast Guard Cutter in the lake.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
