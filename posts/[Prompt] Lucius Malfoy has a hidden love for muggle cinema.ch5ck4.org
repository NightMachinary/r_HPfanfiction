When Draco was younger the Malfoys decided to visit Muggle London for a laugh and see some muggle cinema. Lucius Malfoy had a great time and has often come back to see some more.

** "The Muggles are wonderful. Birth of a Nation, have you seen it? This art form they've invented - film - you should really take a look.

Even they recognize their inherent inferiority - perhaps a primitive form of race-memory found in lower life forms. Like a flobberworm that learns a maze and then retains the memory after being cut in half and growing into two.

What's so deliciously ironic about it is that they remember the inferiority, but have forgotten the reason. Since they're bereft of magic, they hilariously conclude that inferiority depends on things like skin color or whatever passes for 'intelligence' among such primitives.

So very risible! Can you imagine? I do highly recommend it."

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

******** I was born in the 90s too. Trans issues were definitely a thing. Even if they weren't talked about AS MUCH, they were still talked about... yeah, usually it was talked about with even less understanding and more bigotry than today, but people absolutely knew about it.

Non-binary... it was LESS known, true, but people still knew about it LONG before the 1990s. The word "two-spirit" was used a lot in the early 90s, and the word "neutrois" to describe non-binary gender was coined in 1995, which was also the year when the word "genderqueer" was first used.

I'll admit, I was raised in a liberal/leftist family, so I might have been introduced to those terms earlier, but still. And yeah, there was more intolerance going on, largely due to ignorance... but the story here in and of itself addresses the intolerance.

********** Well... If we're to accept that there's an entirely different magical society existing side by side with us, with seperate cultures, where several people don't even know what a movie is... then I don't think it's too much of a stretch that they might have slightly different norms as well. ;)

These things were there in the 90s as well. Just because they were LESS known/talked about doesn't mean NOBODY knew/talked about it. The wizarding world might simply have been a little ahead of the curve here. I mean, they got much further along with the entire "gender equality" thing a lot sooner, so why not this too?

But like I said its the authors story, I was merely giving my own views on things that took me out of it

it was that and the fact canon happened so strictly when Ron should be way more self assured and not as prone to his insecurities as he managed to compete against all of hogwarts and come out well

************ Yes, and you'd imagine that transgenderism would be more out in the open when magic can change someone's physical sex. (If nothing else, it's canon that Polyjuice potion can, so it's not a far stretch to imagine that there's other sex-change magics.)

I agree about Ron, though. The fic is largely about him getting out of Harry and Hermione's shadows, but I think that could have been better done. At least make his development a little more pronounced so that he didn't make all the same mistakes as he did in canon.

************* Its weird, I think this ron won the cooking competion out of all hogwarts students

so he should be far less insecure in his abilities and yet it still hit stations of canon honestly the polyjuice potion is rather horrific, Do you know about deep fakes and how in the future it will be hard to trust video evidence in the wizarding world, someone could drink a polyjuice potion murder someone while disgiused as someone else and then get away with it thats not including how horrific the sexual implications of it is,

The harry potter would is quite horrific if you think about the implications of the spells and account for humanities darker side

but if you read the lore, you realise the darkside is fucking cancer and so allowing yourself to emote strongly is a risk

I would have loved if harry potter got explored like starwars did under lucas, hundreds of books exploring various era's focusing on the good guys, and the bad guys.

I imagine young petunia read lillys schools books once and learnt about a few of the spells and suddenly became paranoid as fuck.

vernon has no reason to hate magic, untill petunia was like they can shapeshift and erase your memories
