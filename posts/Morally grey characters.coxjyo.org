Hi, it's been a long time since I've read Harry Potter FF and I want to start again with interesting and well-written.

Like many of you, I first read the books while I was still a kid, and though I love the books and how they were written, I'm an adult now, and I would love to read something more mature, something darker, something that maybe doesn't have a happy ending, and definitely something less black and white, good guys vs bad guys.

Do you guys know any stories that are focused on morally grey characters? It could be a complete AU with OCs or something more connected to cannon, but what I would love to see it's a compelling main character and a villain who's not evil for the sake of being evil, who isn't cartoonish, and doesn't get supporters by threats and fear but rather because he's charming and charismatic.

Does a story like that exist somewhere? Without harems, bashing, overpowered characters, complicated made-up magic and rituals, overused tropes, and a creepy relationship between Harry and Voldemort?

Thanks!


** There is [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][a list of most recommended fics]] on this sub. I would say protagonists in all top 20 fics on that list can be either considered morally grey or even dark.

This sub heavily favors such main characters who are competent, intelligent, ruthless, and willing to kill. Let's just consider these very popular fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106) is the most recommended fic here by a wide margin. The MC seems to be a merger of Voldemort's soul fragment and baby Harry, at least he thinks himself to be Voldemort and evil. He has killed tons of people throughout the story, but almost all in self defense. He has had a few evil intentions (making a new Horcrux out of a Weasley), but rarely followed through on any of those. He becomes progressively less evil, as he actually begins to care about his friends. Finally, he's totally happy teaching DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), takes place in an extreme AU, but still with Voldemort and the Halloween event. James and Lily survived it and get to raise Harry. However, he's hardly a nice guy and at least a lot more vicious than in canon. As time goes on and circumstances change, this Harry eventually carved out an empire and brought peace and prosperity for millions. But at same time, he will use assassinations, blackmail, kidnapping, sabotage, and torture as his policy tools. He loves his family dearly, but will not hesitate to manipulate them for his political goals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Theirs Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is interesting because it begins with a canon compliant postwar Harry, who is betrayed again by the establishment. He starts off dishing out vigilante justice, but gets progressively more brutal. Unlike in most other dark Harry fics, Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, Neville, and most of the DA are united behind his cause.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is a Harry time travel to 1975 where he teams up with Bellatrix. Harry is a hardened war veteran at this point, and Bellatrix is by no means a paragon of virtue. Even without Voldemort's extreme corruption, she's arrogant, cold, power hungry, and ruthless. But she's also very pragmatic, intelligent, and loyal. By following Harry, she can put her virtues to good use.

Honestly, I'm getting sick and tired of Hollywood fairytale heroes who must have a heart of gold; who will rush into any dangerous situations without second thought; who don't have political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical competence; and who absolutely need Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, Plot Armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope to beat the villain.

On my own favorite list, I have many more fics with this kind protagonists. Do you like some of these?

** You might like the Alexandra Quick series.

It's set in America with a cast of entirely OC's, and follows a delinquent muggle-born named Alexandra as she attends Charmbridge Academy.

Its overarching story focuses on the corrupt and authoritarian government, the American Wizarding Confederation, and the conflict between its supporters and the various groups trying to reform or overthrow it.

Like the Harry Potter series, it gets darker and more mature as it goes. It starts out with a tone not disimilar from the early Harry Potter books, but becomes significantly bleaker and more morally grey later on.

The series is very well written, especially the later books in the series, since the author writes and edits each book in its entirety before releasing it. The characters are complex and most don't fall neatly on a black/white spectrum.

It's also one of the few fanfictions to have its own subreddit, [[/r/alexandraquick]], where we discuss new chapters as they're released.

Currently there are five completed books out of seven planned:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], linkffn(3964606)

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], linkffn(4684861)

3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], linkffn(5784632)

4. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]], linkffn(7689884)

5. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13353323/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-World-Away][Alexandra Quick and the World Away]], linkffn(13353323)

Note: Book 5 is already finished, but the chapters are being released twice a week.
