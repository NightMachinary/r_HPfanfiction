Does Snape locate the locket in an attempt to destroy it? Is it before he goes to Dumbledore for help, afterwards? Does Snape die or live in an attempt to do the right thing? (If he decides to do the right thing)

What about Regulus? Since he wouldn't be the one to locate/find out about the Horcrux, he wouldn't die. Would he still be on Voldemort's side? Would he go to Dumbledore? Go on his own side? etc.

That possibilities are yours!


** I think Regulus still would have died. IMO, he never expected to survive the cave. Most fanfics play him as this adorable, soft-hearted kid fresh out of school, but I've never imagined him like that at all. I think he knew what he was doing, realized it was wrong, but was in so deep he thought there wasn't anything other to do than commit suicide. He would have found another way to die betraying Voldemort. Maybe unleashing fiendfyre or pulling a suicide bomber. Either that or give himself over to the madness and become another Bellatrix.

That being said, if he did decide to get help, I think he would have gone to Sirius. He would probably be desperate at this point and afraid he couldn't manage to keep out of Azkaban on his own. There isn't much known about his grandparents, but if they were anything like walburga or Bellatrix or even Narcissa, they wouldn't have been a lot of help after Voldemort's “death.” Yes, the Blacks are wealthy and influential, but he was still a teenager. Malfoy was in his thirties at this point, or close to it, so I'm sure he had all sorts of blackmail lined up along with his bribes. Regulus wouldn't have had that advantage.

As for Snape, I once read a fanfic where he goes with Dumbledore and extracts a sample of the potion to create an antidote. I don't think he would let himself die like that. And I think he would end up working with Dumbledore eventually. He would have told him before going to Azkaban in case there are more or maybe in an attempt to get out of Azkaban.

At which point, Snape and Regulus would have become tentative friends, it they weren't already. But being nerdy death eaters so similar in age and going to school together, I think they would have been acquaintances at the least.

(I once wrote a drabble where Regulus is very public with his status as a Death Eater. He tells everyone he joined Voldemort because the Ministry is a joke and then betrayed Voldemort because he was fucking crazy, and bankrolls a new political party. There are dozens of assassination attempts from Voldemort sympathizers, but they turn up dead in different ways, so by the time Sirius escapes from Azkaban, Regulus has built up a terrifying reputation for himself.

As you can guess, he's probably my favorite character.)

** I headcanon that Snape created the potion in the cave, so if he was the one to go there and attempt to destroy it (how does he find out about the horcrux? Does Voldemort use someone/thing other than Kreacher to test its defences?) then I reckon he'd have a much better chance at surviving than anyone else.

*** Hey that's a good point! Snape was probably the best potioneer Voldemort had. It makes sense that he would have created the cave potion.
