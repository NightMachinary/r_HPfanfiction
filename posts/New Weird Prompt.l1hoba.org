I've noticed that a big trope that people hate are the cheesy pet names for Harry from Sirius and Remus, this is understandable seeing as "Pup" and "Cub" are really cheesy. So what if we gave them an excuse to be embarrassing parental figures? What do I mean by that? James/Lily/Sirius/Remus of course! Why not make them a group marriage?

Yadda yadda fine print. Polygamy yadda yadda. Free love yadda yadda.


** I see your prompt and raise you my dirty mind.

“Harry, why does Sirius call you ‘pup'?” Ron asked one evening as the trio sat in front of the fire in the Gryffindor common room.

Harry, who had been idly dozing in a chair merely opened a single eye to view his friend thoughtfully.

“Well Ron, it's a common misconception that my mother gave birth to me.” The boy who lived said slowly, the reaction to those words being anything but as Ron choked on his saliva and Hermione dropped the book she had been looking through.

“I-what?” Ron managed to stammer.

Harry just nodded slowly, closing his eyes again.

“You see-my Dad was a massive and I mean /massive/ fan of beastiality-So he fucked Sirius in dog form, then a few months Sirius pooped me out, apparently it hurt like hell, he apologised to my mum for all the pregnancy jokes he made. Mmm anyway I'm off to bed. Night.” Harry finished with a yawn before slowly getting up and sauntering towards the staircase to the dorms, ignoring the fact the common room had been completely silent when he told his story and the twenty plus other Gryffindors present had all heard.

For a good half a minute no one spoke. Lavender brown, who had dropped her nail polish just stared at the pink liquid as it pooled on the rug.

The Weasley twins were staring at their latest inventions silently, wands hovering over the contraptions with no intent to finish the spell.

Dean and Seamus were paused in their game of wizard chess, Seamus' Knight not even complaining as it was held mid placement above the board.

Neville, who had been watering one of the plants he loved so dearly, failed to notice the water was overflowing from the pot and dripping down the shelf it was sat on while the boy himself stared at the nearest wall blankly.

Cormac mclaggen was hunched in on himself, a frown present on his handsome face.

Ron was still frozen on the sofa staring at the empty arch Harry had gone up.

Hermione, hands still gripping nothing but air, stared blankly at the space between her hands.

Nobody spoke.

“Gosh...” Collin Creevey finally started, an oddly devious smirk appearing on his face. “That sounds /hot/”
