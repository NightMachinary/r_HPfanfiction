:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read ages ago a fic where harry has a secret identity, his name is orion black or something like that. He is a rune/ward master and moves in with the malfoys at one point, he also introduces himself to lucius malfoys in flourish and blotts and talks about genetics and squibs with him I think. Been looking for ages but can't find it :(


** Is this the fic that ends up being Voldemort/Harry? And he adopts Tom riddle after travelling back in time and then he's killed which turns Voldemort into what he ends up? And did the wards on Malfoy manor? If so it was on ffn, his name wasn't Orion black but maybe Evan James? Or something similar?
