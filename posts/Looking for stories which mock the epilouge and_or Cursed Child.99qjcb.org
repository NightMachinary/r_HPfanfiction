Are there any stories where, instead of being the intrepid heroes, AS and Scorpius are constantly fucking things up, Ron actually faces consequences for assaulting his driving instructor's mind without good reason, Malfoy gets sentenced for his war crimes, Dumbledore and Snape aren't whitewashed, Kingsley fucked things up as Minister, the Trolley Witch is imprisoned for throwing grenade-like explosives at children... Anything really.

Preferably without a complete bash-fest (eg Ginny is still likeable if Ron or her children take FlaK in the fic) or slash.


** “Fluffy Aragog Potter, I named you after two things that tried to kill me, but were at least honest about their intentions.” That sort of thing?

*** For example. I'm open to everything, from Ron being arrested up to Harry and Hermione overthrowing Kingsley's government because he didn't manage to change things.

Of course, the ridicule of anyone named Malfoy is always welcome, but I wouldn't mind a story where Delphi is actually the sweetest child ever while everyone else sees her as +Hitler+ Voldemort reincarnated.

**** That sounds pretty funny. Tom was this perfect charming boy that was secretly a nascent monster. Delphi could be a perfect charming girl that everyone /knows/ is 100% absolutely fem-Voldemort reborn /-/ but no, she's genuinely just a wonderful kid.

** Well, this mocks CC, at least. It doesn't go beyond the first scene, but let's face it, do you really want to read CC in its entirety?

*** ....Honestly, if it keeps cutting to the original characters commenting on how much the play sucks, I might be interested in more.

  Examines the fallacies and lack of logic in the play. Warning: much sarcasm. Might be considered bashing. Not for fans of the Cursed Child.

** linkffn(3682339) is a good build up to the epilogue, mocking and subverting elements of it.
