Someone know of a Haphne fic, two or three chapters, where Harry and Daphne found each other at the age of 8 or 7, Daphne with a dormant power of Ice and Harry with a dormant power of Fire? Or at least, it was implied a power over the Fire


** That would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13039440/1/The-Dragon-and-the-sleeping-Beauty][this]] one.

** That was an interesting read, I myself thought you were talking about a different story that i can't seem to find anymore. In it Daphnes parents a sacrifice Astoria to give Daphne her power in which she kills her parents. Harry meets her after Vernon throws him off a cliff. It was very similar to this
