:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic where Harry was part of a spec ops type Deparment of Mysteries team, I believe he was the "big guns" used when a lot of magical power was required. I don't really remember much else that I'm sure was in this fic and not in another.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** This was actually the fic I thought it was, but I read it last week and it was not. That's what prompted the question. It's a very good fic nonetheless.

Most likely this one.

Edited. Sorry, violates Rule 8, so link removed.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.
