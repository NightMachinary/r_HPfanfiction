Pretty big scorbus shipper over here, and I'm looking for some scorbus fanfics. If prefer if they were ongoing or completed but I'll take abandoned ones.

Hopefully both fluff and angst.

I'm currently reading a bunch of time travel fics and more would be appreciated, though they don't have to be.

So yeah that's about it.

** Ah, Albus Severus/Scorpius sounds like it could be chock full of slashy goodness! Has anybody created a community called A Sting in the Tail for fics like that?

  Albus Potter gets through life by avoiding his family, working a desk job at St. Mungo's, holding onto grudges, and trying to convince everyone that being the son of the most famous man in the world isn't all it's cracked up to be. Meanwhile, he's determined to be silently in love with his best friend until death.But one day, he sees a pattern that no one else has--that no one wanted him to--and things change forever. A story about stubbornness, forgiveness, finding the person who makes you the best version of yourself, and learning to let go.

  "The stars incline us, they do not bind us." For Harry, it's something he learned long ago on the battlefield. But for his son, James, it will be a painful lesson in the form of a friendship with a boy named Scorpius Malfoy.
