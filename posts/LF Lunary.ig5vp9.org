*** I am a huge H/LL shipper, but I'm always bummed to see this story recommended. Don't authors realize that 90% of what makes a romance story interesting is the buildup to the MCs getting together? That fic has them married by like, chapter 2. Almost no drama, no real conflict. Just, introduction -> boom! Climax! -> then mechanically working out whatever plot points were unresolved in the wider story.

Such a disappointment.

**** That story is basically a mega!Karen SI masquerading as Luna's mum and directing the other characters like puppets. One of the few stories that made me legitimately angry.
