So I just found out wards don't canonically exist. So I have read fanfiction for years and I only ever saw the movie. I guess this is one of those things like how I thought Runes were a magical programming language thing but it turns out to be a study of an old magical language in canon. Given, I like both wards and the runes of fanon. I am actually ok with Harry being amazing at them or something. Just surprised me. Was there anything about the series that you thought was real but turned out to be false? Do you like the fandoms take on it? If not, why?


** I think folks get too hung up on the specific word.

So what are wards? Magic used to protect or prevent something.

What's a protective charm? Magic used to protect something.

What is an anti-apparation jinx? Magic that keeps someone from apparating.

What is an anti-apparation ward? Magic that keeps someone from apparating.

While JKR never used the word she certainly used the magic/concepts that did the same tasks.

Kind of like when you need to copy something by saying I need a xerox and you "use" a kyocera instead. Or taking a Kodak moment by using a canon camera.

To me wards are just versions of the protective charms, enchantments, and jinxes that are used to protect or prevent things from happening. They still need to be cast, they need to be maintained somehow or they will fade/fail, and if attacked with enough magic they can collapse.

So quite frankly in the universe I envision saying something is a ward is similar to saying xerox when you talk about copying. I.e., it's a generic term to refer to protective charms, enchantments, and jinxes used to protect/prevent something.

** Wards /are/ canon, but the term "ward" isn't. They're called "protective enchantments" instead.

Though the wards in most fanfics are a lot more powerful and creative than the ones we see in canon.

** From what I've seen in fanfic, wards apply often to situations like what Hermione casts in HBP... the protective enchantments around the tent were basically wards. The concept is canon I think.

** In Deathly Hallows, Voldemort is /right behind/ Harry when he reaches the Tonks' property line. And Voldemort is preparing a killing curse. The moment Harry makes it across, he's safe. Neither Voldemort nor his (normally unblockable) AK can follow. They don't use the /word/ "ward", but the idea is there, and they're clearly powerful.

** I have one. I originally thought that Arithmancy had something to do with spell creation using maths, e.g. to calculate out the most optimal wand movement or how you would go about making a spell to do something.

Nope. Turns out that Arithmancy is Divination. With Math.

*** Well, that's what it mostly seems - but it's also required to take it to be a curse-breaker, which implies there's a bit more to it than just that.

I think in canon it's just everything math related + the aspect of divination with math (not sure if it's magical divination, or probability, or both). But the limits of the predicting the future aspect are not particularly clear.

**** It started as divination - that's what Pythagoras invented the discipline to do, building on older traditions of numerology.

Thing is, if you've got arithmancy, you can work backward as it were from a numerically-quantified end result to determine what you need to /get/ to that result.

** In canon, we never learn what runes are for. Canon never says they runes aren't a magical programming language. We never see how magical devices like the pensieve and Marauder's Map are made, so if we want to believe that runes are involved in their creation, that's as good an explanation as any.

*** In canon, it's meant to be the equivalent of taking Latin or Ancient Greek or the like - Hermione talks about memorizing the runes, and I believe that the OWL for Ancient Runes is translating something into English.

It fits the 'boarding school' feel of Hogwarts, but much less so the magical aspect. Giving them a magical capability is a nice thing for fanon IMO, though I prefer the approach that doesn't go for 'magical programming' and that instead is for an older method of spellcasting (ie, having them be used to channel magic before wands replaced them).

Of course people memorize runes, just like coders memorize the syntax of programming languages. Coders translate English design specifications into code, and translate code into English to explain what it does. Nothing in canon is incompatible with runes being a programming language.

***** That's essentially what canon says they are - the runes in question seem to be elder futhark (based on Hermione saying she confused 'Ehwaz' and 'Eihwaz'. Those runes are essentially an ancient alphabet (used notably in old english), and that's reinforced by the mention of translating something from runes into english. Presumably, wizards used to write in runes like muggles did for old english.

As an example, take a look at DH ch 7. In it, Dumbledore's volume of 'The Tales of Beetle the Bard' that he leaves to Hermione is described as being written in runes, as a way to emphasize that it's old.

It is not treated as a magical field in canon - every reference to it that I can find are treated entirely as either an old language (like Latin/ancient greek, though perhaps still used to some degree in administrative use) or as symbols.

It's a big fanon leap to try to say that they're actually a programming language equivalent in magic. It's certainly not easily compatible with the history of runes being used as just letters/writing.

I don't have a problem with fics that change that - canon Runes and Arithmancy are quite boring. But it /is/ fanon.

It's dead alongside the historical use of runes to make magic - writing itself was widely regarded as a magical act - and perform divinations, though.

******* Don't get me wrong - I like runes as a way of doing magic (there was a discussion post I had on the subject [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gddaaq/runic_magic/][here]] a while back that includes my thoughts + some from other people.

However, that's different from thinking it's actually canon. That's not a bad thing - canon has many flaws.

The programming approach is one I'm not quite a fan of - it just doesn't feel right to me, especially for an older form of magic. I like interpretations of rune magic that are a little more loose than that, if it makes sense (eg, more like the alethiometer symbols in His Dark Materials vs programming in C++)

******** Yeah, the programming is more than slightly silly. Magical writing tended to look more like what's nowadays called concrete poetry, and the text itself was usually really allusive and full of symbolism.

Except on Roman curse-tablets, which tended to say things like "I curse Nautius Maximus, he is a massive shithead who lets his dog shit on my lawn, may his cock fall off and all his daughters all get the clap. So there."

******* Invocations in Harry Potter are not just spoken Latin - it's the correct word/incantation + the wand movements + the mental aspects behind it that makes the magic work.

Having runes be a form of magic - similar to incantations/wand magic - certainly would fit the world building, and it's why it's included/expanded in many fics. However, that is not how canon utilizes them - there it's just as a writing system, in everything we see of it.

********* They're referenced off and on throughout the books as Hermione does work - always in the form of 'runic dictionaries' and 'runic translations'. One that comes to mind is when she mixes up Ehwaz and Eiwaz, and talks about the symbolic meaning ('partnership' vs 'defense'). This is /always/ with translations, not programming or magic or anything else.

Outside of Hogwarts, runes are mentioned in the Beetle the Bard book given to Hermione (to show that it's old/original version, and which she translates to english). They're mentioned as symbols (eg, the symbol of the Deathly Hallows gets called a rune, and I think there's indications of individuals using a rune as a way to represent themselves), though Hermione notes that they're not actual runes (for the deathly hallow).

The closest you could point to that I know of is the description of the pensieve, which is lined with runes in most of the descriptions of it. However, according to JKR's website ([[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve][here]] the point of those runes are to show that it's a very old artifact, rather than something shared by all pensieves (if they were powering it, we'd expect to see that as a recurring design).

That's plenty of evidence in the books for it being a form of writing, and that the difficulty in doing so (requiring advanced classes) likely comes from the runes not being only an alphabet, but also having symbolic meanings (eg, 'protection' as Hermione mentions). There's no sign of it being magical.

  “Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman's Syllabary. “I wonder ... will we need to translate runes [on the horcrux hunt]? It's possible. ... I think we'd better take it, to be safe.”

If runes had any practical use, Hermione would have mentioned it and wouldn't have hesitated to bring the book.

*** Yes and this is why it's not just a terminological difference. In fanon, "wards" are area of effect spells but in canon they have varied mechanics depending on the spell.

In OotP we see Dumbledore cast anti-apparition jinxes on people. The Fidelius, we know, is cast on a secret, not on the location being protected.

Fanon tends to replace all of these different mechanics with a single mechanic of a magical dome or wall around a physical space - basically the mechanic of the Shield Charm.

Anti-DISapparation. Significant difference, as it does not prevent incoming apparations. Also, the effects of what happens when you try to disapparate are rarely remembered by fanfic writers. Not to forget, Dumbledore cast it at the ministry - not a location he had any significant control over - he cast it with a single spell, he did not lay any anchors nor were there any methods to "break" the jinx or power through it, as is regularly the case with fanon wards.
