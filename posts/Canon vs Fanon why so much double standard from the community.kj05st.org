Edit Title: I meant "so many double standards"

I know I will probably get downvoted to oblivion with this thread but there is something I fail to understand with many people here (or other HP fanfic related places).

Many things about fanon that people here love to bitch about every day could be said for Canon too.

People here complain about 11yo Slytherin politicians and whatnot in fanon. Yet the same people seem to don't mind at all that 11yo Slytherin in Canon are HitlerJugend. IIRC HitlerJugend was a little bit of political back in the days when you think about it. They say it's not realistic for 11yo to act that way but they kinda forgot about the 12yo who defeated a 1000yo magical beast without being really hurt.

People here complain about 2D characters and bashing in Fanon. Yet they don't seem to mind the utterly black-and-white world of JKR, where the only people who don't like the Golden Trio are either incompetent adults, misguided fools, bigots, or all of that. A world where conservatives wizards are obviously Nazis in the making (or full-on one) and where liberals wizards are obviously the Good Guys. Reminds me of something...

People here complain about Ubba Powa Harry who discovers something no one used before. Yet the same people don't mind the author's fiats and Deus ex machina all around the series. I mean Lily Potter is the first witch who sacrificed her life to save her child in human history. Nobody found that Slytherin Beast was a giant Snake for a millennia before a 12yo muggleborn put two and two together in one year. Same muggleborn who gets to use a Time Turner (pretty OP tool to study and being more knowledgable and powerful btw) to be able to study...muggle studies... Harry Potter the 17yo guy who achieved to beat the most powerful wizard of his time by being...just there. Molly Weasley, the housewife, was able to defeat Bellatrix Lestrange because...she is a mother.

People here complain about hidden rituals and whatnot of Fanon. The same people don't mind the fact JKR spent her time solving her plot issues with magics nobody seen or talked about before it appeared in her own mind.

JKR creates the Department of Mystery in OotP and forgets about it at the end of the same book after conveniently destroying every Time Turner in the world apparently. Nobody seems to mind. Yet people here complain when some fanfic authors do the same in other fashion.

Dark!Harry, Grey!Harry or Indy!Harry are the most hated archetype here. People find him caricatural and boring, fair enough. Yet once again the same people don't mind Canon!Harry who is a strawman whose greatest ambition in life is to be a good normal guy (something he already is, to begin with, so much for character development) and who got carry by Hermione in the last book. A passive character whose things happen to him.

So, why people bitch about Fanon and chose to get blind or "kinda forgot" about the same issues in Canon? I'm the only one finding this dishonest?

Whatever flaws you may find in canon---and I have never found this sub to be averse to criticizing canon--- this isn't true at all. Lily's sacrifice worked because she had a choice due to Voldemort's deal with Snape. Not because other parents didn't throw themselves in front of their children. (Hell, James did that with no effect.) I don't love it as a plot point, but it's not a plot hole.

#+end_quote

Regarding Voldemort, yes. She is the only person he killed that he offered to step aside. That is what you are forgetting or not seeing.

The only reason he even gave her the choice was that Snape begged him to let her live. If it wasn't for Snape, he would've killed Lily before moving onto Harry. With Harry having no protection Lily's sacrifice granted, Voldemort would easily kill him and continue the war.

Yes, any mother would beg for the murderer to spare her child. Yes, any father would lay down his life for his wife and child. But neither of them had the same /choice/ that said murderer offered them.

It's not any single factor that caused the protection but the combination of all of them that contributed to one event.

Factor 1: After hearing the prophecy, Voldemort chose to go for the Potters, not for the Longbottoms or any other family that /may/ have fulfilled the prophecy's requirements. Why? Dumbledore suspected that it's because Harry was a halfblood, much like himself.

Factor 2: Snape still loved Lily so he begged Voldemort to let her live.

Factor 3: Voldemort complied with Snape's plea and offered Lily the /choice/ to stand aside and let him kill her son.

Factor 4: Despite being offered the chance to continue living in exchange for her son's life, she chose to sacrifice herself and died for her son.

Yes, you can call it convenient that all of the requirements were met and all of these events happened but they are not a plot hole whatsoever.

That is the big thing that you are not seeing. You are confusing the choice offered by the murderer and the choice any parent would make for their child.

** Canon is always a lot more forgivable, for the simple fact that it is canon.

JK created the entire universe that all fanon is derived from, so all fanfics automatically owe her a debt.

Saying that though, I don't see how all canon characters are black and white. It has been explicitly stated that the "heroes"(Harry, Dumbledore etc) are not perfect, nor are they meant to be.

Harry is moody, childish at times, lazy if Hermione isn't nagging him, is of average intelligence and has a short temper. However, he's also brave, has a strong sense of right and wrong, is very loyal to his friends and a strong protective instinct.

Dumbledore is secretive, aloof, too forgiving and manipulative. He's also incredibly giving towards his students, has a great sense of fun even at over a century old, wise, patient and tolerant.

Snape is a vindictive bully to his students except his favourites, biased and incredibly petty. However, he's also courageous enough to operate as a spy while pretending to be Voldemort's right hand man, and loved Lily Potter enough to be killed to avenge her death.

Draco is also a vindictive bully who has aspirations of joining the death eaters. However, once he gets there he realises that he doesn't have it in him to kill, maim and torture, he's basically just a coward. When he realises this (from what we can gather) he matures and becomes a contributing member of society in future.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

Fanon has an unfortunate habit of oversimplifying characters so that:

Dumbledore: manipulative Harry: classic hero Ron: food obsessed Hermione: smart Draco: misunderstood

...and so on.

That went on a lot longer than I expected it to...

  And then the fanon rituals only get used by Harry and friends for the most part, and hardly ever by their antagonists. Now that's an even bigger Deus Ex Machina than wandlore, the blood protection, etc.
#+end_quote

For me, it's the same. The only difference is in one case you have a proactive character who actually tries something (Fanon) in the other the character just waltz in without actually doing anything consciously to save the day.

#+begin_quote
  And then the fanon 'solution' more often than not tends to involve making child Harry into some super-amazing grandstander. He can shut down the stupid Dumbles right then and there in the Great Hall whenever he feels like it.
#+end_quote

Once again it's pest vs cholera. I mean in one case Harry tries to have some spine in the other he just forgets to have one. But I agree I would also prefer like you that he shut up and wait for the plot to come to him.

And incompetent adults is one of the many flaws of HP. But once again it's a children's book so it must be expected.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Harry then changes his name to something 'better', such as Hadrian, and proceeds to trash talk and own the entire Wizengamot while also discovering how much ancient power the Potter family has. Wow, amazing! Hadrian finds these uber artefacts and grimoires in his vault -- wait, why didn't Lily and James use them, then?
#+end_quote

Why didn't Lily and James use them? Because they didn't need to use them since they weren't prophetized to vanquish the evilest wizard of all time. In JKR's world, Good Guys wants to be Good Guys and only bad people care about being Powerful. When you're busy being a loving father and a doting mother you apparently don't have time to check for uber artefacts and grimoires in your vault.

I play devil advocate here...

Not partially broken. It's just broken. HP is entertaining don't get me wrong when you keep your suspension of disbelief through the roof and don't look closely at things.

  The thing is, a lot of the time the reasoning behind the complaints is the ridiculousness and repetition of those fanon plot points. It's fine to be a bit flawed, but not when the story tries to 'one-up' canon (subtle bashing, in a sense) with its ridiculous pile of contrivances in favour of Harry. That's why people often complain in the first place.
#+end_quote

It's a fair enough complaint. Truth be told I also tend to skip training montage in fanfics too. The thing is I would always chose a proactive character who actually tries to do something than a passive character who is just there at the right time at the right place.

I think it's one of the reasons Indy/Dark/Grey Harry is so "successful". Many people tend to like when they feel the MC is actually trying to do something.

#+begin_quote
  The complaints often focus on the way fanon so blatantly force those ridiculous advantages out of nowhere for Harry.
#+end_quote

Once again, fair enough. Until people start considering anything Harry tries to do besides doing the same thing in canon is blatantly ridiculous. Remind me of the fic "On the way to greatness", many armchair readers/authors here and elsewhere praise a lot this story ("Best Slytherin!Harry" for many) when actually it's just Canon!Harry with a green tie...

Nothing ridiculous for sure just tasteless.

** People already addressed some of your issues in other comments, so I'll focus on a different aspect.

There are more complaints on this sub about fanon over canon because this is the HP /fanfiction/ sub. On the main HP sub, people complain about canon. I've seen most of your issues (2D characters, flat villains, evil Slytherins, Molly defeating Bellatrix, etc.) all addressed there. I recommend you search there and perhaps make your own posts on that sub because it could lead to some interesting discussions.

Because this sub covers the fanfiction based off the book series, most of the posts are geared towards the topic of fanfiction and fandom tropes. The kinds of canon critiques you are looking for can all be found on the main sub and are better suited for the main sub because discussing them in both places might get redundant. Most people here subscribe to both subs.

To give you an example, I might create a post on this sub criticizing the stereotype of Slytherins in fanfiction as being miniature politicians. On the main HP sub, I might create a post criticizing Slytherin students in canon largely being portrayed as ugly, dumb, stupid, and villainous. I wouldn't post the latter on this sub because it doesn't deal with fanfiction, so it's not a double standard. You don't talk about basketball on the baseball sub even though they're both sports.

I know someone else already explained this, so I don't know why you're acting ignorant. That situation was special because Voldemort was specifically trying to kill Harry and let Lily survive. If she had stepped aside, she would have loved, so she was actually able to sacrifice her life. When Voldemort attacked everyone else, he intended to kill everyone, so there was no sacrificing that could be done.

#+begin_quote
  Wasn't Hermione the one figuring it was a Basilisk?
#+end_quote

Yes, but you specifically complained about her being the first person in 1000 years to figure it out. And that's not unreasonable, since no one had heard anything about the basilisk or the chamber in that time (other than Myrtle's death, of course, but that appeared to have been wrapped up nicely at the time). You might be able to argue that the adults should have figured it out if Hermione did, but it's not that unusual for a kid with a different perspective to think of something that adults don't. (And I could be misremembering this, but I don't think Harry told the adults that he heard the basilisk, so Hermione had an extra clue too.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry defeating Riddle wasn't a Deus Ex Machina?
#+end_quote

The Elder wand shenanigans were, and people do complain about them, myself included. But that's not really when Harry defeated Voldemort. Voldemort was actually defeated when Harry went into the forest and let Voldemort kill him. That gave everyone fighting Voldemort the same protection that Lily gave Harry, and Harry even pointed it out later.

Harry came back to life because everyone loves a happy ending. But if Harry had stayed dead, Voldemort still would have lost the battle. He had no horcruxes left, he couldn't hurt anyone, and the defenders of Hogwarts were refusing to stand down. Voldemort didn't stand a chance.

#+begin_quote
  Molly (the housewife) didn't kill Bella (the SS)?
#+end_quote

Ahh, yes. The woman who lived through two wars can't possibly be able to defend herself because she's just a housewife. Even if you ignore the inherent discrimination (is that sexism, classism, a combination of both, or something else?) in that attitude, it's still not that unreasonable, and I could come up with plenty of reasonable explanations. But really, it doesn't matter much and ultimately comes down to symbolism and storytelling. Bellatrix is kind of an evil mirror of Molly in a lot of ways, so Molly beating her has meaning.

As many people here you think I consider this as a plot hole when it wasn't what I said to begin with. What I said is that it's a convenient plot point like so many others in canon that people chose to forget but complain about that kind of convenient plot point when it's done in fanon.

  Yes, but you specifically complained about her being the first person in 1000 years to figure it out. And that's not unreasonable, since no one had heard anything about the basilisk or the chamber in that time (other than Myrtle's death, of course, but that appeared to have been wrapped up nicely at the time). You might be able to argue that the adults should have figured it out if Hermione did, but it's not that unusual for a kid with a different perspective to think of something that adults don't. (And I could be misremembering this, but I don't think Harry told the adults that he heard the basilisk, so Hermione had an extra clue too.)

The Chamber was a myth well known. People didn't just know where it was and what was the beast inside. That's why they considered it was a myth after people failed to find it. The fact in 1000 years nobody never thought that the snake speaking founder and lover would use one the most terrible magical beast (who happen to be...a snake) to guard his secret chamber is quite far fetched. Like you have Snake emblem for the House of Snake speaking and lover wizard and you know that Basilisk exist and nobody thinks maybe there is something in 1000 years. Once again, when JKR does that nobody mind but when fanon pulls something like that it's outrageous.

  The Elder wand shenanigans were, and people do complain about them, myself included. But that's not really when Harry defeated Voldemort. Voldemort was actually defeated when Harry went into the forest and let Voldemort kill him. That gave everyone fighting Voldemort the same protection that Lily gave Harry, and Harry even pointed it out later.

So Harry defeated Voldemort by being just there and accepting to die as Dumbledore planned it. So no Deus ex machina I guess.

  Ahh, yes. The woman who lived through two wars can't possibly be able to defend herself because she's just a housewife. Even if you ignore the inherent discrimination (is that sexism, classism, a combination of both, or something else?) in that attitude, it's still not that unreasonable, and I could come up with plenty of reasonable explanations. But really, it doesn't matter much and ultimately comes down to symbolism and storytelling. Bellatrix is kind of an evil mirror of Molly in a lot of ways, so Molly beating her has meaning.
#+end_quote

Many civilians lived to two wars that don't make them able to defeat supposedly hardened and battle experienced warriors. The reason I pointed out that Molly is a housewife is precisely to show that she isn't a warrior technically, so no need to make it about politics. Now we have a woman who is apparently able to defeat Bellatrix when she didn't show any aptitude to fight. Bellatrix was hyped for nothing anyway. Molly beating Bellatrix is mostly because JKR is a mother and wanted to show "the power of a mother".

** Heh. If everyone here were entirely satisfied with the canon story, why would we need to be here?

A fanfiction should give the reader something that wasn't in the original, right? Just repeating canon is pointless. On the other hand, it doesn't necessarily have to improve /everything/ about canon. It's not reasonable to expect perfection from anyone, after all.

So, an author can get a pass on repeating a canon mistake instead of trying to fix it, so long as they're fixing, improving or adding /something else/ that makes their story worth reading. On the other hand, making a canon mistake /worse/ means that their time and effort has (in the opinion of the one criticising) been spent in the wrong direction.

If your car has worn-out seats, low tyre pressure, and leaks oil, it's okay to ignore the seats while you fix the other issues. It's less okay to pull out a pocketknife and start scratching up the seats even worse.

Because people still want to be in canon in a way since they liked it so much.

But I get what you're saying here and I kind of agree with you in a way.

***** The point isn't about what you find enjoyable or not but about double standards. Intellectual honesty. Complaining about something in one case and looking the other way in another similar case.

432 books that's all? You can do better I hope...
