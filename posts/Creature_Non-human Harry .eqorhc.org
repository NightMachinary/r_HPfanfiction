Hey guys.

The thing is, we don't have a lot of non human Harry AUs, at least not a lot of good ones.\\
Most of the are just those shitty fics where Harry is just a submissive mate of some death eater.\\
So what i want are the best well written non human Harry AUs (Werewolf, Vampire, demigod, fae, etc.)\\
Some expecifications.\\
-If there's pairings, i would like very much for Harry being with someone also non human. (Vampire, Werewolf, mermaid, demigoddess, etc.)\\
-No Slash (Sorry, just is't my thing)\\
-No FemHarry.\\
-No Dumbledore or Sirius Bashing (Im okay any other characters, but no with Dumbledore)\\
-Must be somewhat long so that i can distract myself for some time (I would like something completed but if it's not, okay)\\
-I would not like Hermione or Ginny as Harry's pairing, but if you think that the fic is worth of reading you can send me.

That's it !


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/][Cold Blood by DerLaCroix]] is probably my favorite creature Harry fic

** Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2996114/][Saphroneth]] is an alright story that lots of people love. There's no real conflict or mystery though, as Dragon Harry simply makes better choices than Canon Harry.

Edit: this is including the mystery of /why/ Harry is a dragon. Everyone accepts it and moves on. It's only really questioned, and briefly at that, during the train ride before first year.

*** There's also [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]], which is quite divergent from canon. Also quite funny. But sometimes very dark. But funny!

**** It's definitely fun, but I'm halfway through it, and, so far, it's not exciting, per se.

***** I really like it, but you are right that there isn't much in the way of dramatic tension. I find it very much captures the whimsy of the earlier books, and cranks it up to 11.

****** What I love about Rowling's books is that they are primarily mystery novels, set in a fantastic, magical world. They all have a mystery to be solved and they are all journeys of discovery, both in terms of plot and world building. I don't like history books, and I don't like memoirs because they're simply a recounting of events and I don't feel engaged.

I read an account of a British triple agent codenamed Zigzag, and despite it being an incredible story of adventure, danger and espionage, it was boring. "This happened, then this happened, then /this/ happened".

Harry is a Dragon is very much like this. There is so much potential there in discovering /why/ he's a dragon, seeing him solve problems /because/ he's a dragon, having him encounter legitimate difficulties that only a /dragon/ could overcome...

Nope. It's cool he can fly, but all they really do with it (so far) is let him travel to a nearby town to visit the library. And a piece of candy made him sneeze fire once. I'm on chapter 28 now, and things had better pick up!

******* I don't think the reasons I like it will outweigh the reasons you dislike it. And that's perfectly fine, not everyone has to like the same things. I enjoy it as a fluffy bit of near-crack that's relaxing after reading stories about PTSD and grief and other heart wrenching topics.

******** Gosh. I don't read the heavy stories. I got tricked into reading one where Harry had a pet magic snake, donated bone marrow to his aunt, she died, he lost his magic, then Snape adopted both Harry and Draco, then everybody ended up super gay. It was very well-written, so I stuck it out far longer than I should have. I'm fine with characters being gay, but they were all slowly revealed to be gay and the story went pretty deep into the relationship between Snape and Remus, sometimes full chapters of it. I'm not interested in that.

I trust you've read Seventh Horcrux? That one is quite funny.

******* That's a valid opinion, but personally, I like it /because/ it's a calm slice-of-life fic that doesn't really do much. It's a refreshing change from my usual fare. It helps that it's well-written, of course.
