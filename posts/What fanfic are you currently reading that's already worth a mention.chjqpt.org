#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** Well it isn't completed right now but the author has promised he is posting the final chapter today night.

​

The primes is unique and while i wouldn't say it's the best written.

It is still i a rally good fanatic that managed to draw me in quickly.

​

I don't think i have ever read another fanfic that takes the concept of the Fidelus to that extent.

So it is a breath of fresh air.

  With a gift bringing hope, comfort and relief, it was only fitting that Gaia bestow a curse of equal measure. A child to reap what it could not. A child born of death's greed and life's carelessness. Fate was rewritten then with the dignified scrawl of an unknown deity. Screaming and kicking at the divine injustice of it all, a new life was born into the world. Reincarnation DarkOC

** I'm currently rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/1/][this.]]

I love Bewitched crossovers, they make for great humor, sadly there aren't many..

P.S [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11329168/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eternal-Realm][An incomplete extra]], that fandom needs love.

  When Harry goes to the Zoo with the Dursleys on Dudley's 11th birthday, he meets Samantha Stephens, who learns that Harry is a distant cousin and that he's being mistreated at home. She rescues him and she and her mother Endora begin teaching Harry witchcraft. A Harry Potter / Bewitched crossover, for now the story will categorize as HP only.
