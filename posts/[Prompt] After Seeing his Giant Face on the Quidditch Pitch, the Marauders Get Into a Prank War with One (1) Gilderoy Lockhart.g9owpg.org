** That wouldn't really count as a war, that's just bullying a helpless person.

*** Is it? Lockhart clearly has above average magical talent and skill when he was still at Hogwarts. The only reason he was so bad in CoS was because his ability had atrophied after not being used for decades. His teachers said he could do anything he wanted, as long as he put his kind to it.

**** Where is this said? He's not particularly competent as an adult, so it's hard to imagine he was any better as a kid.

***** Its on [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart][his pottermore page]]. He did the bare minimum, but the Quidditch Pitch Incident proves he can do great things if he actually cares about it. This is also seen in his memory charms, and the only reason it backfired in the chamber was because Ron's wand was broken.

****** Cool, I hadn't read that before. So he wasn't totally inept, but still, him against the four Marauders would be too lopsided to call a war. Maybe if he teamed up with Snape he'd have a chance.
