So I've just read "A witch and an Amazon walk into a bar" by Philosophize. It was fem Harry getting married to Wonder woman.... And I want more fics like that with fem Harry being a lesbian... So please send any and all fanfics that you think fit the description


** The Yule Ball Panic series is a great femslash romance between Hermione and Fem!Harry. It's a great fic, beginning in the Yule Ball with lots of 'Female Revolution!' vibes to the plot afterward. Has homophobia and does deal with it more interestingly than Witch and Amazon. Fun though, not preachy. Also the tamest Veela-Orgy-Ritual fic ever written. Not porny, but does have fields of Veela fucking for actual plot reasons. It wouldn't be my thing, otherwise, ace as fuck here. :D

Mistakes and Second Chances is another fun fic where Fem!Harry gains special powers from being MoD, goes through some shit (trigger warning for mentions of sexual assault, it's posted in the ANs of the relevant chapters) and makes new friends (and a ladyfriend). Really interesting development of the relationship between her and Dumbledore, actually too - I remember being really interested in how that progressed.

  She had fallen through the veil of death, unaware of the path she was doomed to walk. It all seemed like fun and games at the start - another chance. She'd never been so wrong.

** Have you ever read A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess? It's unfinished and I'm fairly sure it's dead. Anyways, it's still fairly long (has covered up to halfway through 4th year) and features a female Harry shipped with Ginny.

I'm somewhat reluctant to recommend it, due to the age of the characters and it gets quite explicit, so is sometimes quite squicky, but regardless it fits your request and despite that, is pretty well written.

** linkffn(What Happens in Vegas by Silently Watches)

It's a response to Blood Brandy's Vegas Challenge with fem!Harry/Raven (Teen Titans crossover), with a ship that develops very gradually and believably.
