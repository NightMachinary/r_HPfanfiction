** Concerning the ice cream : it's specified that it's "because the lady asked what Harry wanted". The Dursleys are all about keeping up appearances, they might very well have bought the ice cream to avoid suspicion and could not make Harry throw it away later because they were in public.

** You missed the small amounts of food he gets in CoS (Can of soup, between 50 and 300 calories) and GoF (1/4 of a Grapefruit, 10.5 calories), which both were a full meal. Even if you are generous, that gives you a daily ration smaller than what the Allies considered absolutely necessary to survive in Germany immediately after its surrender in 1945. Even people in a ruined, completely bombed country had more than Harry does.

I'd left the grapefruit out due to the whole family eating the same (so it's not specific abuse against him) and Harry's sneaking other food during that period (albeit unhealthy food).

********* Ah yes, that's a distinct possibility. I rather think she did as well. My point was that by going with the info we have I wouldn't put the diet bit into the abuse column, so to speak.

It is horrible, sure, but I feel that usually people read too much into it and forget that most of the books are narrated from the point of view of a kid. I mean, when I was a kid I thought staying at my grandparents was the worst thing in the world only because there were very few toys there and I would be bored into oblivion and I would occasionally be asked to help out doing some very minor chores. So yes, if I had been narrating things from my point of view I'm sure it would have sounded horrible as well.

Granted, Harry's situation is still bad. And there's certainly a certain amount of mental abuse. Which is still bad. But I'm not convinced there was /that/ much physical abuse. While I get that some authors might want to 'crank it up' for various plot reasons, it got to the point that it's almost everywhere.

Another thing people seem to forget is that the first book is starting to get old. I know it's horrible because it means that those of us who grew up with it are getting old as well, but we must keep that in mind. When the book was written Rowling probably used her perspective on things, and what was acceptable parenting in her time isn't anymore. My mother used to go and tend to the cows alone when she was around 10. Noone batted an eye because it was the norm. Try doing it now and see how fast social services come banging at your door.

Keeping in mind the time difference plus the unreliableness of the narrator makes me think that the Dursleys should be regarded more as the cartoonish villains they were intended as instead of sort of demonizing JKR for writing abusive relatives.

********** Oh definitely. I have mentioned before that the ‘abused orphan' trope and the ‘abusive uncle/relative' trope has been popular and used in a lot of British works. (And I think it's overused and outdated, but not the point of this.)

Thing is, fan fiction authors don't need to ‘crank it up' since what is shown might very well be enough for any competent law enforcement to take action. BUT Rowling was writing HP with a fantasy setting in mind. We need to remember that when getting into the books.

And to top it off, I, as a personal issue, have difficulty reading about child abuse. (You can infer that fics that go into detail about said abuse are avoided like the plague.) this is not an attack on any fic or book or what have you, it is, as I said, personal bias.

Second, there are several remarks in green that lines by Vernon indicate he used physical violence, whenever Harry thinks that he should stay out of Vernon's reach.

**** Well, no. It's /terrible/, but not /horrific/, and I do draw a line between the two. A good turning point is certainly that kids who read/watch /Harry Potter/ aren't traumatized by the idea. Even without moving too far from the realm of children literature, compare that with the abuse in /Matilda/, for instance. The Choker is /horrific/, the cupboard is merely /terrible behavior/.

At the end of the day, I keep feeling that the Dursleys' treatment of Harry were more child neglect taken to the extreme than actual /abuse/. They seemed more concerned with keeping him "out of sight, out of mind" (which sadly included not accounting for him in their family budget) than with going out of their way to harm him.

That bit is clearly played in a humorous tone (though most Dursley scenes are), and it's a bit of "cartoony" violence. You're not supposed to think Petunia was genuinely trying to smash his skull. Considering Harry indeed doesn't make a big deal of it, I instead assumed it was more of a cruel, but exaggerated threat, akin to punching the air and stopping short of the target to "scare'em straight". Again, a pan to the head was potentially lethal, and mean though they may have been, I don't think Vernon and Petunia would have tried to murder Harry --- murder is too freakish for them anyway.

Oh yeah, I feel absolutely the same. The callous disregard for Harry's well being is an integral part to my dislike for certain characters (Dumbledore, Molly, Lupin). Some fanfics get around this by making Harry incredibly shy and him lying about his living situation (like a beaten puppy), but canon!Harry seems like a real trooper and doesn't seem to have much trouble openly (and sarcastically) talking about his life with the Dursleys. Molly in particular deigns herself to be some kind of mother figure, but in reality she doesn't give any shit and would rather yell at her children for springing Harry from literal prison with steel bars on the window. She does the same to the next person, Sirius, who seems to actually care about Harry.

Yeah canon definitely is not a good case study for the reality of abuse lol. This particular style of abuse would absolutely ruin a child with probably zero exceptions. He would have lifelong relationship issues and probably zero chance of forming a permanent serious relationship with a woman. He'd almost certainly have extremely severe abandonment issues but also self esteem and many others.

LIke maybe the actions individually aren't "horrific", but this would without a doubt absolutely set his entire life up for misery. That to me is beyond horrific.

I actually can't stand canon Molly - not a fan of overbearing dominant mothers in general, really. Her actions and her descriptions don't remotely match up in my mind lol.

If this was real life Harry would have not been able to handle that kind of attention for a good long while, if ever at all. How many deep conversations do you think Harry had with the Dursleys in his life? Yet apparently he's totally fine opening up and being mothered by an overbearing stranger out of nowhere right off the bat with Ron and some others.

****** Again, all that is /awful/ behavior, and criminal, and punishable; but I don't call it /horrific/. In truth, /yes/, I would reserve the term "horrific" for actual, traumatizing, injury-making violence --- either actual physical violence (beatings or otherwise) or mental violence deep enough to traumatize the kid for life. That doesn't in any way excuse "lesser" abuse like the Dursleys', but... ah, again, think of it from a child's point of view. When another child hears about a kid who never has any dessert, whose guardians are mean to him, and who never gets to go on vacation, he /feels bad/ for that kid. Very bad, perhaps, but it's very different from a kid's reaction if he's told about the other child being beaten/spanked/whatever daily.

I suppose all this is more or less a matter of semantics, though --- I'd reserve "horrific" for something that is genuinely horrifying on a gut-level, rather than merely obviously terrible behavior whose wrongness registers on a more intellectual level.
