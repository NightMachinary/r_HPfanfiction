it's about voldemort taking things to far and harry enlists hermione's help. I think there's a legion of super heroes that try to recruit harry with varying degrees of succes. There's also a legion of villians that get on voldemorts bad side and beat him down a number of times.


** I remember a story like this where from the Powerpuff girls were sent to recruit Harry and Bubbles had a crush on him, If that helps jogs someone's memory.

  Voldemort has finally pushed Harry too far. There is only one recourse open to the young hero. He must unleash the most horrifying, the most diabolical weapon in his arsenal. The mind of Hermione Granger.
