ID happens in 1996, the same year it was released. Let's say it happens the same year in the HP universe.


** It's July, so Harry is already with the Dursleys. Would any ship be near (or in)Surrey? How close would the Ship in London be to Diagon Alley? Would Hogwarts attract a ship? Do we ignore the 2nd movie and everything in it? Fun stuff to think about.

** A big problem with that is Independence Day as we know it is an American holiday. I don't think they really do the fireworks or anything in the UK.
