*** The trick is to travel as far back as possible:

"No you little miscreants, you will not hurt Arianna here. Go away or I shall call your parents!"

"Confundus. As you can see, Mr Director, this young Mr Hitler is quite talented and you should definitely admit him."

"Miss Gaunt, now that you are free, can I ask you to accompany me on a quest? It pays well too."

** For the first time in quite a while, Voldemort was rejoicing - although, of course, he did not show it. He might not have his body back, but that was about to change soon. And he might not have all of his followers back - the loyal ones were dead or imprisoned, while the cowards and the traitors did not dare to seek him - but he was about to be joined by one (not counting, of course, the stupid Wormtail).

Soon, Barty Crouch Jr. will be at his side once again. And after he gets his body back, the rest will follow, called to him by the power of the Dark Mark.

Just as he was thinking this, the door to his hideout opened, and Barty entered.

"My Lord", the man rasped, bending the knee to him.

"Barty, my loyal servant", the Dark Lord said. "It is good that you have joined me once again. Now-"

Suddenly, Barty sprung into action. His wand appeared in his hand, and he stunned Voldemort before the Dark wizard could even comprehend what happened.

Wormtail, who was at his side, tried to do something - either go for his wand or, more likely, turn into a rat and escape - but another stunner came from the doorway and stopped him in his tracks.

Voldemort was helpless to watch as Mad-Eye Moody, followed by two more Aurors, entered the hideout, cautiously holding the Dark wizards at wandpoint.

'What is the meaning of this, Barty?' the Dark Lord wanted to ask, if he could speak. 'How dare you betray me?!'

Then, as if hearing the unspoken question, Barty Crouch Jr. looked straight at him.

"You have failed, Dark Lord", he said to his former master. "I am a Light wizard... like my father before me."

** "Harry my boy even with all my experience with magic, you still managed to surprise me this time, please enlighten me on how you achieved this and how to revert what you have done."

"I do not understand Headmaster, you are the one who preaches that everyone deserves a second chance .. I am sure Snape will prove his worth this time."

"It's Professor Snape my boy .. I think you may have misunderstood what I mean .. whatever mistakes he has made, he deserves to be given a second chance to repent for his sins and redeem himself .. but not like this"

"Ahh .. sorry Headmaster, I am afraid the change is permanent .. I have not found a way to revert it, fret not Headmaster surely he will be very useful now as a Bat for the war effort than as a known spy before .. the ritual I accidentally invented to transfigure a person into a possible animagus form is permanent .. may be this is *the power he knows not* Headmaster!"

*** Redeem means buying a person from slavery. Harry going around selling these assholes as slaves and freeing them when they become better... Kinda weird image.
