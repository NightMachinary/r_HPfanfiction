Just finished Beautiful Things Can Come From The Dark, which was a D/Hr and was quite good... I loved Pansy's characterization!

Any fic recs for badass!pansy? Draco/Pansy would be nice, though I'll dip my toes into Harry/Pansy or Ron/Pansy if it's really good.

Preferably during Hogwarts, but I'll take whatever!

Thanks y'all! :)

It's more of a character study, speculation than anything else, but I love it. Pansy is drawn as someone to both love and hate. There's some Pansy/Theodore Nott, but it's more towards the end. Worth the read, in any case, because the writing's gorgeous.

*** Thanks! Does it pick up a bit? I'm finding it hard to believe that Harry would be immediately okay with being in pansy's house and calling her an angel....

**** Harry is pretty OoC in this fic to be honest. There is quite a bit of action, but not until they get closer to Hogwarts.

** I really liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1437976/1/The-Way][The Way]] Â» Draco Malfoy, the rich and arrogant fool. Pansy Parkinson, the wealthy and stubborn brat...Draco Malfoy, the abused and trialed hero. Pansy Parkinson, the brave and emotional heroine. Everything's more interesting on the dark side. Harry Potter, T, English, Romance & Drama, chapters: 29, words: 269k+, favs: 123, follows: 53, updated: Mar 27, 2008 published: Jul 21, 2003, Draco M., Pansy P.

I remember it being well written, but I haven't read it again in a while.
