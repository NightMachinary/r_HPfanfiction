  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The changes happened so fluidly and naturally that Astoria has not had the chance to stop and consider them, but now with the war and time virtually frozen in the anticipation of an outcome, perhaps she can indulge her desires regardless.

  Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this.

** Did anyone ever actually write that plot bunny where Montague was picked as school champion by the goblet of fire? I really wanted to read it.

Also, linkffn(Hogwarts houses divided) has one of my all time favorite slytherin characters, and then there's a flashback where she gets sorted into slytherin. Very possibly my favorite single scene in all of fanfiction. This fic spreads its attention around to all the houses, though, so I don't know if it's what you're looking for.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
