Harry/Draco is an interesting pairing when done well, but I'm straight so while I have read and enjoyed slash stories the gay pairing is a negative instead of a positive for them for me. Turning one or both of the characters into girls fixes that for me and I'd like to see if there are any good stories of that sort. Thank you for any recommendations you may have for me.


** Plenty of fem!harry fics have Draco as primary love interest, so check fem!harry rec threads for that I'd say.

As for fem!draco, the only one that comes to mind for me is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/791048/chapters/1494691][For the sake of a Name]], potions-accident-genderbender trope (fem!draco)
