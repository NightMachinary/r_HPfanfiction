*** Unfortunately, I've read both of these already, but they were classics and someone recc'ed them for merfolk (I had no recollection of there being a merfolk in the fic), so I'm going to reread them. Thanks for the rec!

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*** Yeah. Apparently the way I formatted my series of posts was technically spamming, since they could've all been done in one post.

And true, but so many of those have bugger all actual centaur culture/society in them. It's just the canon-esque "We look at the stars and they're some vague verb that sounds foreboding" approach and I'm looking for something with a little more than that.
