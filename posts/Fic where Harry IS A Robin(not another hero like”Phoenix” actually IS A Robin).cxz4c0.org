  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!

** Ooh, Fellow Batman fans!~

I can't really recall any, Amy Potter is Batgirl would be similar and I think there was a fem harry fic I read a while ago, that had her adopted, but I can't say I really enjoyed it that much and since it was S1 young justice fic, Dick was still robin.
