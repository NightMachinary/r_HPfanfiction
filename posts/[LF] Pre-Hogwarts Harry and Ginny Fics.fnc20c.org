I'm looking for stories where a young Harry and Ginny meet and become friends. Harry doesn't tell Ginny his last name, only his first name. Neither knows of the others magical status until the day Harry goes to Hogwarts, which is also the day Ginny learns her friend is also Harry Potter.

No soul bond Eventual HarryxGinny
