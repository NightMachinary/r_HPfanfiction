  1976 and nightmare visions of the future are plaguing Severus Snape. With Lily's help, he will need to figure out what these glimpses are trying to tell him, to change their future to a better one for all of the wizarding world. Although the future is not set in stone, not everything Severus sees can be changed, sometimes the inevitable will reach them sooner than they expected

** I'm also reading it and I love it. Just remember that people that don't hate snape are a little uncommon here, So don't mind if your excellent recommendation gets ignored.

*** I can see that. I'm a big fan of the character and I can really understand what it feels like to be bullied.

**** That part is relatable for many people. However, Snape is such a bully in turn that it kills a lot of the sympathy I have for the character. Regardless, I will check out the fic.
