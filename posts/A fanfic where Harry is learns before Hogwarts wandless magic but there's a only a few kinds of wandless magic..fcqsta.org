The kinds I remember are shadow (which he learns first), bonds (called soul magic), life magic and there were like three others. He also became less and less human throughout the book I know he was part basilisk, dementor, and I think werewolf.

It was one of the first fanfics I read I'm just curious to read it again.


** found one running alongside ur description but it starts from his fifth year and is not completed....he's no werewolf though...and the wandless magic is a bit vague...the basilisk venom and the encounter with the dementor is significant
