I've been idly thinking about writing a fic for quite some time now (and procrastinating endlessly, of course), but I keep running into stumbling blocks. The latest is that I'm having increasing trouble separating fanon from canon. A lot of things that, after reading Harry Potter fanfiction for years, I have taken as canon actually aren't -- like the notice-me-not charm. I'm actually glad that the charm's not canon, because it varies wildly between over- and under-powered.

Anyway, I found a link detailing some of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter][differences between fanon and canon]]. (Warning, it's on tvtropes! Prepare to possibly lose a few hours clicking links.) What are some of the differences between fanon and canon that you most frequently struggle with?


** The blurring of characterization. This isn't because the fanon is necessarily wrong or doing a bad job, just because once blanks have been filled in, it is hard to un-fill them when rereading the canon. A really good fanfic interpretation of a character and/or events sticks in my head and adds dimension or points of view that just aren't in canon. Then speculation and extrapolation creep in and suddenly you end up quite far from your starting point.

This can be a good or bad thing depending on the author.

*** That exactly. I keep on expecting Tom to behave like his “Seventh Horcrux” version whenever I get to read something new, and if I were to try writing something featuring him it would take real effort to keep that from affecting how I'd write him because it's definitely not his actual canon portrayal.

** This is not something I strugle with, this in fact, something I always had a seething dislike for: Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents.

This was something that was only ever in a background of a movie, and even then with no clear connection between this supposed "charlus potter" and harry. Yet of course, people imediately made the obvious solution into the only correct one- Charlus is james' dad.

The reason I always disliked this is because this would make James and Sirius cousins. Not only it makes no sense for it to be no reference to it through out the whole books, it kinda diminishes James and Sirius friendship. Especially the whole thing about sirius "abandoning" his family to go live with james and his parents. Turns out he just went to live with his close family when he did it? I dont like it.

Suffice to say, I was very happy when JKR published the pottermore text about the potter family. I was less happy when it became clear that the majority of the fandom was gonna ignore it but you can't win them all.

*** They wouldn't be first cousins, though. Dorea was Walburga's aunt, so their children would be first cousins once removed or, colloquially, second cousins. Most of the pureblood wizarding world seems to be interrelated anyway. For instance, both Molly and Arthur's mothers were Blacks, making them third cousins. Given that the wizarding world appears quite small and everyone is likely related somehow, the value of family relations might be lessened, especially considering potential ideological differences between the Potters and Blacks.

** I'm always disoriented when I see the movies or read the books and the twins are completely bonkers or Luna isn't off the wall crazy or Dumbledore isn't just past the line of evil and manipulative or Draco doesn't secretly have a soft side and Narcissa isn't a badass. In fanfiction, the characterisation in the books is magnified. Some people have headcanons about the characters and work them in but a lot of people just blow the characterisations of the book out of proportions.

In Harry Potter though, I can't think of anything so intense as Darcy Lewis in Marvel Cinematic Universe Fanfiction. Her entire characterisation is basically a fabrication because she only appears in two movies.

** It's mostly details, some more inconsequential than others.

I've had two today I had to check on - in Chamber of Secrets at duelling club is there a canon incantation for the spell Draco uses to make the snake appear? I knew there was in the film but could not remember if it actually appeared in the books. (For those interested, yes it does, and it matches the film "Serpensortia") and the second one was whether or not Veritaserum would work on an Occlumens.

Snape wearing dragon hide boots is so common in fics I had thought it must have been mentioned in canon at some point and carried over.

** I have, for example, very little idea of how Harry was actually mistreated in canon. Fanon is rife with fics full of the Dursleys abusing Harry in every way possible, but canon appears to be... more ambiguous. They make him sleep in a closet, but there is no mention of regular beatings or starvation or refusing to let him out of his cupboard/room (though there are mentions of infrequent manhandling and such). I guess I should really sit down and reread the books rather than just looking up snippets as needed, huh?

He wasn't literally locked in the cupboard for a month, because he's still attending school. It seems to be like being grounded for a month, and it just so happens that his bedroom is a cupboard.

It wasn't until CoS that Harry was literally locked in.

**** I think people are looking into this whole abuse thing too much. I'm going to use what Hellstrike has said, so apologies to said person. I'm also quoting him, so he should get an alert or something.

"He was locked in for about a month."

I believe he was just locked in there. I don't mean they closed it and locked the cupboard and never let him out, I mean that once he used the bathroom and ate, or whatever, he was shoved back in there.

I mean, the smell of urine is strong, as well as other such smells, and the cupboard would /stink/ and that's where people enter. I just cannot see Petunia allowing this.

"His parents are ok with Dudley beating Harry."

From what I have learned about parents with multiple sons, it's that they seem to just let them fight. I'm sure they didn't punish Dudley for anything but did they ever?

"That is probably close to waterboarding."

Dunking someone's head into a toilet is a common 'haze ritual'. It is also used by bullies, which we know that Dudley is one of those.

;

I mean, Harry was also fed three times per day. Sure, they may be measly meals, but he wasn't starved. The story is also through his perspective, which means we could be getting a biased view.

He was abused mentally and somewhat physically, but he wasn't starved and beaten as so many fics claim. He also wasn't abused sexually, either.

Because that's not incredibly abusive to lock a 10 year old child in a cupboard for anything except meals and toilet use?

If he weren't the protagonist of the story Harry would be completely messed up on a fundamental level. He'd need therapy for the rest of his life and probably would have difficulty ever getting close to anyone.

***** I never claimed sexual abuse and frankly speaking, using that as a plot device to make Harry more angsty (and I have only read three stories that go with sexual abuse) is simply poor form. How much Harry suffers is up to interpretation but you have to remember that the first three books were written for a younger target audience because it gets pretty dark from GoF onwards. And graphic depictions of child abuse are not well suited for a children's book.

*** I guess the biggest problem I have fully understanding the situation that it's not consistent. Sometimes they're absolutely terrified of him and so do nothing to him. Sometimes they care so little about him that they just neglect him. And other times they try to, as mentioned before, whack him upside the head with a frying pan or lock him in his bedroom for the entire summer. And secondly, it's never discussed in any specific detail. The most extreme cases mentioned above (swinging a frying pan at him, for example) give zero details about the event. It's mentioned in passing despite being a potentially life-threatening event. But Harry doesn't seem to show any of the signs of an abused child. The descriptions of the Dursleys are always whimsical and mocking, but never reflect that, if he's being regularly abused, he is in danger from them. Harry never seems to be particularly wary or afraid of them. Even his hatred of them is oddly distant, more like dislike. We're given abusive events, but then the characters don't act in any sort of way I could understand.

and the reason why he doesent show the signs of an abused child is because the first couple books are written like fairy tales.

But anyway, this still leaves the fanfiction writer in a bind: do we just keep on keeping on with the Dursleys' abuse and Harry's lack of response to it? Given how fanfiction storylines tend to focus on the relationships between the characters (and the adventure, of course), having a character behave so unrealistically is... painful for me.

****** The way i see it is this. Does it matter if its abuse as is contextualized by the connotation of the word? No. If social cerivices or the equivalent of such in The UK saw such a thing, that child would be taken, provided therapy, and placed in a foster family. Period. Who gives a damn if they hit him. His bed room for 10 years was a fucking boot cupboard. There was a second fucking bedroom being unused! When he finally got there, they put bars and a cat flap on the door. If i was anyone who could take care of a child, id beat the Dursleys senseless and then take Harry away. It doesnt matter if Harry was hit. It doesnt matter if he was starved. It doesnt matter if anything other than what we heard occurred. Harry Potter was by definition abused. Do you have to go into detail about it? No. But if it was your kid, and you did just what the Dursleys did, you would spend many many years in prison as your kid was fostered. You would never be able to see them again.
