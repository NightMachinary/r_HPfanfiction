If one ignores the rather tacky title, and the fact that it's a fem!Harry, I think /[[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights][The Fight for Rights]]/, posted on Quotev, is shaping up as quite a nice fic and deserving of attention. If nothing else, it's highly unusual.

A canon rehash is right out as, after the first chapter, the story jumps to an eighteen-year-old fem!Harry (here called Annabelle) traveling through the world. The subject (a subject after my own heart!) is that Annabelle (an Arachnmouth and not Parselmouth) has become a leading figure of a movement for giving more rights to nonhuman sapient species, and is touring the world to meet all sorts of such nonhuman, non-British people. This involves a lot of worldbuilding, both of the foreign wizarding governments and of the creatures themselves. For instance, we've so far seen a Saharian equivalent of Acromantulas, modelled after pit spiders, the leader of whom can wield sand magic.

The story, as I said, begins /in medias res/ and the plot is revealed piece by piece, which is at times a bit disorienting but, in its way, very engaging. For instance, there are two goblin assassins after Annabelle. We don't know /why/ yet, but we'll find out!

The author can write some /great/ fight sequences, by the way.

My point is: give it a try. Not for everyone, I'm sure, but it deserves to be read, and for now is quite a young fic, so it won't take long to catch up and see whether you'll continue or not.

The story contains mature themes. (Not lemons, to be clear. I mean mature drama-related themes.)


** Why would goblins send assassins at someone who will get them rights???

*** Because they have their own interests, their own ways of /wanting to get those rights/, and because some of them are misinterpreting Annabelle's actions as a kind of power move to build up an army of nonhuman slaves, which makes sense in a history where the nonhumans are all always and /currently/ being oppressed by human magicians. Some of them are suspicious and angry, and seeing what they want to see. And that is going to be an in-story plot point later, that it's a problem for a HUMAN to be the figurehead of a NONHUMAN rights movement. :) It would be like a straight person leading an LGBTQ movement, or a white person leading a black rights movement. Or a man leading a women's rights movement. They need to speak and fight for themselves, and they have the experience living the oppressions that the straight, white person or the man does not have at all.

*** We don't know yet. If I may venture a guess, canon Goblins seem pretty bigoted against wizards, and there's no telling whether they're all that on-board with giving rights to /other/ nonhumans, especially the weirder ones like Acromantulas.

**** Yes Achille! It is like how yes some LGBTQ people can still be racist and things. Just because goblins are oppressed and hate humans and want rights does not mean they cannot also be bigoted themselves against some other nonhuman races. :)

** Is it a solo tour for fem!Harry? I'd expect Hermione to be right next to her, seeing as she was the only one to give a damn about non-human rights in canon.

*** No! :) Not at all solo! In fact she will sort of be like Doctor Who and switch out different companions at different points in the story! :) And Hermione will be one of her companions early on! :) But I have not introduced Hermione yet in the plot.
