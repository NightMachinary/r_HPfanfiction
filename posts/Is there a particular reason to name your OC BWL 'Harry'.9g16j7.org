I was considering writing a 'Potter twins' story, but I wouldn't want it to be immediately obvious who the 'real' Chosen One is. And naming one of them 'Harry' is a dead giveaway, However, on the other hand, if they were named. . . John and Joseph or whatever, would anyone even read it?

I mean, given the changes to their upbringing, neither of them will be much like canon!Harry, but it seems like people will read anything that has the name slapped on it whether it remotely resembles Harry himself or not.


** How are you planning on arranging your POV? If it's going to be from the POV of only one of them, then readers are going to suspect that brother is the BWL anyway, most likely.

** A different solution to your dilemma would be to have one Twin be the Kid-Who-Lived and the other be the "Chosen One". The Princess of the Blacks series did/does this, with Daniel being the Boy-Who-Lived, and Jennifer and Daniel both being spoken of in the Prophecy.

** Firstly, you don't want it immediately obvious but I would never accuse the majority of wbwl stories of being subtle.

Secondly, to some people Harry simply is the boy-who-lived. You can change a bunch of things to create an AU but for some people Harry being the boy who lived is a fixed point. You don't have to agree but for some its a must.

** Is there a problem with simply calling them both Harry? Harold and Harrison or something as first names, for example - And both of them later using their second names instead.

** Name the one who isn't the boy who lived Harry? If you're considering trying to hide it. People are so used to the Harry in twins stories being the boy who lived they might not expect it.

*** Original Character Boy Who Lived, it refers to a Harry with different characterization to canon Harry (at least in this post).

**** Oh, if it's the same kid, just not named harry than wouldn't that just be a Harry!AU, or Harry! Divergent and not an Original Character? A kid born at the same time that is still the bwl and whatnot; may not be named harry but it's just a name. May not have the canon backstory but who references canon these days anyways. Headcanon and Fanon are far more important for the reception of a fic, in my opinion anyways.

If you can build a believable world that doesn't invent too many unheard of things, people can and will fallow along..

,,sorry for the needless conversation, but this ‘is' a discussion thread.

** People are used to the name Harry, so it would be sort of distracting at first, but if there personality is pretty different would be fine. For example Lily in Lily and The Art of Sisyphus works pretty well since she acts nothing at all like Harry.

** Aside from the names, you can play with the prophecy to make things more ambiguous. Have Dumbledore brooding in his office after the sorting, thinking back to the prophecy, and asking himself "which one?" might be interesting.

** The wizarding world usually calls them ‘harry' anyways, in my headcanon atleast, but no, no reason at all. It'll make it harder to have your fic accidentally found by people googling Harry this or Harry that. But if the character isn't actually harry!au, but an actual oc, you'll just have to explain what happened to ‘harry potter' unless you go down a rabbit hole of au. It can be done. It's just not done very often.
