:END:
Hi, wondering if anyone here can help me find a oneshot I vaguely remember. Might've been on DLP, but their search function is crap.

As I recall, it's an AU where Draco works with Hermione in the war after Harry's killed. He becomes suspicious of Hermione's willingness to take drastic action and changes in behavior, snooping around her room. She's hidden her notes in a polarized mirror, which reveal that she's planning a Dresden-style bloodline curse that'll wipe out all purebloods i.e. not her. Forgot how it ended, perhaps reading it again will jog my memory.

Thanks!


** I don't know the fic, but if it is on DLP, you can search just that site via Google by typing something like:

"Draco Hermione Bloodline Curse" site:forums.darklordpotter.net/

Put whatever words are related to the story you want to find in the speech marks, then whatever site URL you want to search after the 'site:'. Might be able to find what you want like that.
