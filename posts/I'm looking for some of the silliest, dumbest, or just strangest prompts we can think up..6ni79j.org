It can be something you'd play straight, something you'd play as crack or somewhere in between. In the spirit of this, I'm providing one of my own.

Just after Dumbledore and McGonagall leave Harry on the Dursley's doorstep, a Yautja (Predator) show up and kills Vernon. He had come to Earth seeking something new to hunt and mistaken Vernon for a dangerous alien creature before realizing that he was just an unbelievably fat human. As Petunia escapes upstairs to protect Dudley, the Yautja finds baby Harry on the doorstep and, having taken a worthy human as an apprentice before, is curious about what a human raised by Yautjas would be like. He takes Harry with him, and thus the boy-who-lived grows up an intergalactic hunter, his accidental magic kicking in to save his scrawny arse until he grows strong enough to take care of himself. He hunts Zenomorphs and all manner of other beasts before someday returning to Earth to hunt magical beasts and gets swept up in the standard Dark Lord related shenanigans which would have taken up much of his life in the standard timeline.

That's the most bizarre thing I can think up and I would love to see similarly ridiculous prompts.


** Here's a ridiculous idea. Starts during Easter holidays of second year.

Harry sees Hermione get petrified, researches all of the creatures that can petrify. Assumes it was a Gorgon, and immediately hares off to Magical Greece. (More on Greece later) Ron, when he gets back to school, starts looking for his friend, discovers he left for Greece, but never sees it written down.

Ron starts asking students about "Greece" but finds the one kid who likes musicals and musical theatre. He is told that Grease is on Broadway, so Ron leaves and tries to find Harry in New York City. Ron doesn't even think about the country because magical Greece has been under a travel blockade from the ICW for four hundred years.

Meanwhile, Harry finds out that Magical Greece is fully run by magical creatures rather than wizards, hence the wizard-centric travel ban. He then finds himself forcibly apprenticed to the Oracle of Delphi since he is the first person to come into Greece in centuries who has in any way studied Divination - since he chose it as an elective for the next year (edit). Harry will now have to spend the rest of his life making up his divination homework.

Hermione gets left in Hogwarts after the school is abandoned due to the monster attacks. Twenty five years later, Ron is fabulously wealthy, a leading star on Broadway, and meets up with Gilderoy Lockhart in a Famous Wizards convention, which prompts him to decide to return to Britain with him to try to finally figure out what happened to his sister.

I dunno, imagining Ron as a musical theatre kid who is as foppish as Lockhart would amuse me.

** During 5th year when fudge tries to arrest Dumbledore, Dumbledore after stunning everyone in his office sends Harry off with fawkes to be trained by some friends from wwII. Dumbledore then polyjuices himself to look like Harry and takes his place in school. They use Dobby and the penisieve so Harry can commute to his classes.

Dumbledore has no idea what he signed up for, it's been a long time since he was truly a student and now he has to socialize, run the DA (who's name he first thought was charming but in actuality it's a little overwhelming seeing all these children gearing up for a war that shouldn't be their problem) and deal with his long time friends as a position of an inferior instead of an equal for the first time. He would have to deal with Umbrige from Harry's position and we could see how the author thinks Dumbledore thinks Harry would act, versus how we know Harry would. It could be very telling about how Dumbledore sees Harry and his actions as Harry could change over time as he gets to know him more by walking in his shoes.

Meanwhile we can flash over to Harry learning gritty details that he thought he was ready for intellectually but finding the reality of things to be a bit difficult, and the old soldiers and warriors can help with his ptsd and anger issues, largely avoiding angst harry.

** Here's one: a day before the full moon, a muggle man on a backpacking trip stumbles upon a sickly, starving woman on the woods. Persuaded to help her by his fellow backpackers, the man is bitten by the woman who turns out to be a werewolf! Although aurors are quick to show up (previously trailing her), detain the woman, and obliviate the backpackers, the protagonist finds himself separated from everyone due to the chaos. In pain, lost, with no supplies, and having just witnessed the impossible, the protagonist attempts to seek some way out of the woods with a crazed determination, but the aurors want to stop him. The story then continues in a Rambo-like style, with hunters and hunted shifting at at a moments notice.

** A story that starts as a generic time-travel fic but when ________ goes back in time they overshoot by 600ish years, so their soul tries to latch on to the only person that could live long enough to kill Voldemort (or whatever) - Nicolas Flamel, but they get absorbed into the Philosopher's stone instead and spend 600 years trapped in a Gringotts vault as a rock.

Another idea is basically one of those self insert fics where someone from the real world whose read the books is sacked into the HP world, but with more than one person being sucked in. Bonus points if everyone has conflicting goals - for example one person who tries to stick to Canon, one person who tries to solve everything , one who tries to mess everything up as much as possible, one who tries to resurrect Voldemort to gain power etc. Essentially, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers]]) but with self inserts.

** Alright, I've got one; Harry goes back in time to the era of the Founders of Hogwarts, only to discover that they aren't all they're cracked up to be.

Decent folk yes, but their real accomplishments, all the school development and spell theory and whatnot, really came from muggleborn friends of theirs; because British purebloods in the future didn't want to credit muggleborns with the creation of Hogwarts, they claimed the Four Founders had done it all themselves.

Naturally, Harry decides to take this opportunity to right this pureblood mania before it starts and ensure credit goes where credit deserves. But, in a plot twist that's never been done before in Harry Potter fanfiction, this ends up changing the names of the houses at Hogwarts when he returns to his own time! Shock!

--------------

Or, in the same vein...some pureblooded nincompoop, tired of all the muggleborns and their culture and their innovativeness and equal rights and whatnot, goes back in time to help Salazar Slytherin ensure that muggleborns stay out of Hogwarts.

Have fun imagining how the wizarding world breaks itself when it only has pureblooded nincompoops in charge.

Doesn't hang out with Ron because he a bit pathetic, Hermione because she's an annoying know-it-all or Neville because he's shy and instead hangs out with Dean, Seamus, Lavender and Parvati who, as far as I can tell, are about the only people in his year that are never portrayed as his closest friends in fanfiction.

Merlin reincarnates as Harry Potter. There was a Prophecy before he was born that said the he will kill dark lord. It also said that he will be equal to Dark Lord. Someone hears this prophecy and assumes Harry Potter will become Dark Lord. So they orchestrate events which will result in Harry and Voldermort dying at each others hand.

Harry had no memory o his previous life. He is so powerful that he doesn't even need to learn any battle spells except expelliarmus. In the final battle Harry kills dark lord with disarming spell.
