*** In my experience, people did care about house points all the way to age 18.

It's not about the silverware/winning. In the years you won, you celebrated for about 5 minutes before you got on with the business of celebrating the end of term.

Rather, people valued house points/the house cup because they were proud of their achievements and the house cup is a way of recognising those achievements. If you won the inter-house rugby, you were proud of that. If you'd performed a piano recital, you were proud of that. And so on. The house cup is innately tied in with what you've done to earn it, and gains value because all those endeavours have value. Even when you did not win the cup, you still fondly remembered the points you had earned. Even now, almost 20 years later, I still get satisfaction out of the commendation I got from the Headmaster for a particularly good performance in a rugby game against another school.

** Saying No; linkffn(7274734) is half-crack, half-serious, and can be best described as the inmates have taken over the asylum. Of course, concern over house points goes down the drain.

  Dumbledore swallowed a mouthful of brownie and smiled at his teachers. "I would like to thank you all for your support these past few weeks. I know it's been a difficult time for all. Minerva, would you start off by reading off the current point assignments?"

  Minerva blinked in surprise, unaware that they'd actually be conducting school business at the meeting. She rummaged around her robe pockets for a few moments, before giving up and waving her wand in front of her. The scores appeared before them all, glowing brightly.

  She cleared her throat roughly. "As everyone can see, Slytherin House has six points, mostly awarded for being brave enough to leave their common room.

  "Hufflepuff house has a negative seventeen thousand, five hundred and seventy seven points."

  Ponoma moaned and lowered her head to the table. "I'm so ashamed," she said. "I can never show my face in the greenhouse again!"

  Minerva glanced at her sympathetically, then continued to read. "Ravenclaw House has a negative twelve thousand, eight hundred and ninety one points."

  Filius Flitwick growled in the back of his throat and his hands clenched reflexively.

  "Gryffindor House," Minerva said, her voice shaking, "has a negative two hundred and eighty seven thousand, five hundred and sixty one points." She whimpered, then buried her head in her hands...

  "We're winning," Snape said smugly. His eyes gazed lovingly at the numbers before him. "We're actually winning!"

  "It's just not fair!" wailed Sprout suddenly. "The students don't care about points and they refuse detentions..."

  “House pride means nothing!” explained Draco in very loud whispers while he repeatedly hit the Slytherin badge in his robes. “All I'm saying is that the house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights.”

  [...]

  “But that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!” Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! “The point system is a lie!”

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
