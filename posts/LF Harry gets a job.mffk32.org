Just looking for a fic where Harry gets a job that isn't in the ministry. No bashing please, and I'd prefer no slash, but I'll read it if it's good


** In the next chapter of my crack fic, Nyarlathotep (Harry) will start up his own country (Antarctic Principality) and rule it as Shahanshah. That's kind of a job.

*** Out of curiosity, is there any meaning to the names, or is it just for laughs?

**** Shahanshah was the title used by Persian emperors, basically meaning King of Kings. The story is based on the premise that Harry Potter is the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos. And as the name plainly says the Antarctic Principality is in Antarctica, for now, WW3, n' stuff.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
