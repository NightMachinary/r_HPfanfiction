** You can try *The Bespoke Witch* (DM/HG/LM but NO incest)

Also here is someone's [[http://ellesjourney.tumblr.com/post/157302651834/lumione-fic-recs][LM/HG's recs]] that I have as an open tab to further investigate later.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is offered a war-stake by Dumbledore. She ignorantly accepts the beautiful scroll only to find she has thereby agreed to become Wife to the House of Malfoy. An on-the-go education by Minerva, Molly, and Astoria ensues as Hermione enters formal courtship by Draco and Lucius. Utterly absurd and a tad naughty. AU, OOC. Utter tripe.
