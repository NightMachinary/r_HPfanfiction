** I'm trying to touch on this with some super power lotteries starting those in power and how Harry deals with being someone whose presence changes history.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** I have been trying to find Fanfictions that feature the general philosophical consens of either Nietzsche, Heine, Strau√ü, Derrida, Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Spinoza or even Singer.\\
There definitely were a few attempts. Sadly though most authors were defeated rather quick, simply because Philosophy does not work well with how canon delivers the world of HP.

Singers Utilitarism is often attempted in fanfictions to point out why the Greater Good could not possibly work out well enough to attempt it. All ends in failure though, simply because the author never makes the step forward to offer a "radical" stance. For plot convenience the topic is abandoned or ignored.

I read a fanfiction in which the author tries to hint towards philosophy however little - maybe I am simply reading too much into it because I like his style of writing (reminds me of a few Authors I adore!).

Quoting from PM (preview of his new chapter)

  /We are but what we can think of. Thus everything we are, has its origin in our mind. Guided by our will, our thoughts create and form the world we live in/, or so they say.\\
  He wasn't too sure if he would want to live in a world that was influenced by his sometimes quite bipolar ideas. But then again, if the combined minds of all people were creating the reality they lived in, maybe his own thoughts didn't matter all that much after all.

Also I have to note that I imagine it being hard to add philosophy into your story - if you are arguing a philosophical point, there will be tons of text that may be really hard to read through. People lose interest fast. *shrugs*

**** Its a author who originally started writing fanfictions in german and then, because apparently not everyone speaks german (:D) started to translate his fics.\\
linkffn(Don't speak ill of the dead by GideonGermanicus)\\
There is not much content as of yet, but he updated a few chapters on some of his fictions today, so it seems he is steadily working on it.

I'd imagine a muggleborn who grew up in a household that didnt accept things at face value - someone who grew up with parents who helped along building up a healthy Skepticism - would find himself with a severe case of Weltschmerz rather soon, after entering the Magical World of Harry Potter.

Kek. I would imagine a fiction that displays Nietzsche as a muggleborn who got so fed up with the magical and muggle world, that he retreated into his almost ascetic life in the mountains, would be quite the read.

When it comes to might makes right. Guess what. The same author I linked you the fanfic of has a 1 chapter-fic (so far) of Harry Potter starting with a different mindset. My german admittedly is not the best, but I think HP in that fic (Ein hehres Ziel) is going to be a british Hitler. I'll ask if there is more to come.

  Harry Potter doesn't know what to do anymore. Life is boring. What to do with all the time he got on his hands? Join him and find out what he's gonna do next. First english fanfiction. English is my third language. No Beta. Chapters are loosely connected to each other. Please leave a Review if you liked it. If you didn't like it send me criticism.

***** Did ask and apparently the author already had been working on translating that particular fanfiction.\\
Though it confused me alot, it was a good read.\\
What confused me were the multi-clause sentences.

But apparently they are necessary to show how colluded the thinking process of someone is, who thinks of his goal als a Greater Good.
