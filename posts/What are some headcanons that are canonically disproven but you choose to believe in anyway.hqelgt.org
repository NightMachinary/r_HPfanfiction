Have you ever come across some elements in fanfiction that you know are canonically wrong but are really good so you make it a headcanon even though you know it isn't canon.

Stuff like ancient runes being used for rituals and enchantments and runic magic in general go directly against what is canonically stated. Wards do not exist in canon yet it is extremely common in fanfictions and then of course there is cursed child which is almost unanimously ignored by the community.

I know headcanons are supposed to be extra aspects and events that are neither directly proven or disproven by canon but many times we come across stuff in fanfiction that just fits so well with your interpretation of Harry Potter but end up opposing canon. Given this community is about fanfiction, such headcanons are perfectly acceptable. So tell me, what are your headcanons that go against canon but you still believe in?

I'd also like to imagine that if it could be taught Newt Scamander would make/beg Harry to teach him. Hagrid would guiltily listen in while telling himself he shouldn't want learn Parseltongue because it's Dark.

*** I have Ginny be a parselmouth for the same reason. And then the kids get it by descent.

In theory I have a fic where the family has a collective identity crisis because now they have no idea if they speak English or parseltongue when anyone else is at home. I can't remember if I actually wrote this or just planned it out, though.

It just seems so wrong to me that pretty much the first bit of magic we see Harry do, he can't do any more "officially".

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can.

JK did say that if Merope had lived she would have loved Tom and raised him, and he would have turned out as a completely different person. That at least suggests that it wasn't the potion that caused him to be born that way. More just that he was neglected and unloved by everyone as a small child and formed an attachment disorder like many kids in those circumstances do, along with having some inherited narcissistic or sociopathic personality traits from the Gaunt side.

**** It makes sense. Hermione believes in rational logic above all else, and Arithmancy (from whatever we know) is about definitive numbers and calculating them to come up with a solution. This is far different from Divination which is guesswork and things are very vague.

It is possible that Arithmancy is more than just be predicting the future. It is a compulsary subject for Curse-Breakers so it could be predicting the results of a formula even before you've attempted it.

Also, Arithmancy is an art that can be learnt with hardwork, Divination, on the other hand, is an art that can only be used by Seers - an ability that you are either born or not born with. I wouldn't be surprised if the subject is meant to help Seers gain control over their powers (much like an underage wizard attends a magical school to gain control over their magic).

Numerology is the belief in the divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more coinciding events. It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names, and ideas. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts.

***** I've seen in a lot of fanfics, that Hogwarts is selective about who gets an invitation. Sometimes it's because they exclude those from the "darker" side of magic, like the children of Nocturne Alley. (These are often Dumbledore-bashing fics, where he's trying to remake the British Wizarding World into his concept of Utopia.)

More often it's by level of magical ability, where there's a spectrum between squib and Merlin rather than just "you have it or you don't," and children of lesser potential don't make the cut. This has become headcanon for me: just as people don't have the same levels of intelligence or athleticism, some people have better abilities at magic. You can somewhat make up for a lack of innate ability with hard work, but only to a certain point.

In any case, it seems likely to me that there are a number of pupils who didn't attend Hogwarts who would have been moved into Hogwarts that year. Hogwarts, however, has an element of prestige/social group formation so most people in core ministry jobs, etc will have attended and so Hogwarts alumni tend to forget that not everyone went.

My personal opinion is that she build the wizarding world with structures for the world she wanted and then messed up on the maths/fitting the maths into the plot.

I believe JKR wrote the series intending for the population to be larger - she said at one point that she intended there to be 40 core (named) characters for purposes of the story, but more pupils in each year.

It feels to me that she backtracked on this a bit over the years because we never seen any sign that there are more dormitories, or enough staff to teach the classes. Also, we mainly see that purebloods are slowing down population wise - it seems to me that half-bloods and muggleborn populations should be increasing.

Also, there's enough Weasley cousins that Harry's without raising suspicion yet we don't hear about a single cousin attending Hogwarts in Harry's year nor the six years before or after him. There's a chance Arthur's brothers had no children in the same 13 year age range of Harry, but it seems likely there would have been at least one around the school. Otherwise someone could easily have pointed out that all the cousins are much to old or young.

Basically only if you have nothing to lose by the opponent scoring, and something major to gain by having an extra goal scorer.

Also, the one-on-one rule applies to the Keeper or Chaser entering the scoring area. It's fair because the opponent Keeper can also then be targeted by Beaters.

So that means that a defensive Keeper will have to watch their one single opponent as well as keep an eye out for any Bludgers.

And I agree with the other poster he would not have mentioned Lily under any circumstance.

James probably didn't ask hundreds of times but it's made abundantly clear that he was quite persistent in his pursuit of Lily. And JKR straight up stated that the reason James hated Snape so much was because he was jealous of his relationship with Lily. So James attempted to chase off at least one potential suitor.

Personally I think Lily never hated James as much as she said and JKR finds the whole "relentless pursuit" thing romantic, but many people's mileage (mine included) may vary.

Cultural taboo to change godfathers perhaps (it does seem very rude), or maybe Lucius saw the way the wind was blowing with Snape getting /Dumbledore's/ favor now, while still being in the good graces of the Malfoy's social circle, and it remained politically OK if not great due to what you mentioned.

**** Honestly, I used to question this, until one fic opened my eyes to how they could have just been good friends in an indirect way.

The fic was a semi-WBWL(in that Danny actually was the boy who lived, just not the chosen one), with the Potters being something akin to light-side Malfoys, and it had a conversation between Draco and Ginny that went something like, "Danny's parents are fine with him being best friends with your brother despite your family's poverty, but do you honestly think he would marry you?"

In the same manner, I can honestly see Lucius and Severus being best friends if the fic in question actually has them in Hogwarts at the same time. They used to hold similar views, and it's not like Snape was a muggleborn. Even if his mother was disowned, he was still descended from a family that held views pretty darn similar to what Lucius held. So while Lucius may not view most half-bloods as equals, and definitely wouldn't ever consider making one part of his family, it's pretty possible that Snape is the only friend he has that would make Draco's godfather. Especially considering how downright insane the rest of the pureblood elite seems to be.

Right. Well. That one then. No-one could tell me that they don't exist: I like to think of them as large shimmering orbs (when spells hit them) that have anchor points all around Hogwarts grounds.

Teachers have their rounds, they also have ward rounds, where in the early morning they check up on the wards. My favourite idea is that the ward route is the most hated and Snape is the only one who will cave eventually and agree to take them (just to avoid the students), in a long-standing staff joke.

*** Okay here's the thing. Canon did not use the WORD wards except in one of the video games.

However, since a ward is a spell that keeps things away, typically by definining a class of things to be excluded, canon DID have wards. All of those protective spells the trio cast on their campsites were wards. Muggle-repelling charms are wards.

** Squibs can brew most potions. Although I think this is more disproven by author interview than canon. Snape's speech about no silly wand waving, Merope being described as a squib and not having gone to Hogwarts, and I don't remember Ron being mentioned as extra disastrous despite the broken wand. How many times was the wand shown as being used for the potions we had full descriptions of in the books?

Arithmancy and Ancient Runes being like most fan fics describe them. The canon descriptions basically leaves only one elective that actually seems productive to take.

More than 11 wizarding schools in the world. It's just the 11 are the Ivy League type schools. Hogwarts is near the back of the 11, and might very well be behind some of schools outside the ancient and august brigade.

*** For the potions thing, I always just saw it as that potions need a certain amount of either innate or ambient magic to work. Someone with magic can brew a potion in an otherwise completely magic-free area and have it work, because they subconsciously put magic into it.

Squibs can't make potions work in magic-free areas, but they can at, say, Hogwarts because there is so much ambient magic from everyone casting spell and such.

For Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, I don't know much about Arithmancy, but I do love how many portray Runes as being more than just a language. One of my favorite fics has the main character embroidering runes to protect against fire on a pair of leather gloves because said character can inexplicably(not even they know how) summon fire on their hands and didn't want to get burnt.

For the more than 11 schools, I like that. It's like having the Internationally known schools and then the community ones that don't get as much attention.

And yeah Charlus and Dorea are pretty cool. I like that one.

Wands are only 7 galleons when you first buy them at Ollivanders, and the cost is largely subsidized. Replacement wands can be dozens to hundreds of galleons, depending on the materials.

Ollivander uses more wand cores than Unicorn Hair, Phoenix Feather, and Dragon Heartstring. Those are just the most common.

Spell creation can be done systematically, and Arithmancy is a big part of that process - in fact, arithmancy in general is as shown in The Arithmancer.

Fidelius is a ward, cave inimicum is a ward, whatever Voldemort crashed into while chasing Harry and Hagrid in the battle of seven Potters is a ward, any reasonable interpretation of the force protecting 4 Privet Drive from death eaters is a ward, the enchantment preventing apparition in Hogwarts is a ward. They're everywhere.

I prefer Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents. This is half because I think Fleamont is a stupid name and it takes me out of a fic that's trying to be serious, and half because I like the idea of Harry being more closely related to Sirius/Andromeda/Tonks.

I also like to think that each Hollow grants a curse, with its blessing. In the case of the Cloak, once you pass it on, you die. You get to live a full life, and produce an heir to pass it on to; but once you do, Death catches up to you in no time flat.

The Stone lets you speak to the dead, and control things related to death, but drives you into suicidal nihilistic depression the more you use it. And the Wand makes you so strong that you get content and stupid, and that stupidity gets you killed.

Then he didn't die from a second killing curse, because otherwise the Cloak would be without a Master. Though he did get the choice to die, or come back, and maybe that's what Mastery of all three gives you. Just a choice.

Either way, once he passed the Cloak on to his son he was no longer the master of all three, which would mean that there is no permanent mastery of Death, but you can hold the position temporarily, if you're a Peverell by blood that's lucky and can defend it.

** Depends on what you mean by "canonically disproven". If its in the books, I accept it.

I play a bit more loosely with Rowlings' (sometimes contradictory) comments on Pottermore, the Fantastic Beasts films, etc. In that case, some of my favorites to disregard are:

-That there are only 11 notable wizarding schools/the existence of Ilvermorny (I have my own headcanon on magical America).

-On a related note, I pretty much ignore the depiction of MACUSA as an authoritarian, centralized regime. My Wizarding America is a parody of the Wild West and Articles of Confederation America, with a hillariously decentralized government, most of the country run by local tribes or gangs, and law enforcement mostly provided by private militias or "hired wands". If I want to reconcile my headcanon with the Fantastic Beasts films, I say that New York/New England is under MACUSA's control, but the rest of the country is just too big and too lightly populated for the central wizarding government to maintain much control.

-I am also willing to /heavily/ bend the "no magic can bring back the dead" rule, given that Rowling bends it a lot herself with the Horcruxes and Hallows.

-Oh, and I pretty much ignore everything in Fantastic Beasts II except Nagini's origin story (and even that I use or ignore as convenient).

*Dumbledore*\\
Had to have been bloodline cursed/has a malediction. For someone as wise, powerful, and all that stuff, he seems to really fumble on the small stuff.

*Epilogue*\\
Doesn't exist. They are going to be fixing stuff up for DECADES. Economy is shit, tons of people are dead, some death eaters got away, families that supported it are still there, etc. Then you have to play pureblood politics. Magical Britain is fucked.

*Horcruxes*\\
More people/places know about them. Gringotts would know for sure, they deal with tombs and whatnot in Egypt. It's cheaper to heal an employee that is possessed/etc than it is to pay benefits, hire, and train a new employee. While they certainly wouldn't go out of their way to do it for nothing, they would most likely have it as a paid service. Same for St. Mungos. If Harry actually went there, I bet they would have found it and got rid of it pretty quick. See the Dumbledore above. He most likely searched, didn't find anything and gave up on it. Hell, Sirius probably had Grimoires in Gringotts detailing on them, but Dumbledore wouldn't have thought about it.

*Sirius*\\
Seriously (ugh), how hard would it have been to go to a foreign magical government under the ICW and seek political sanctuary? Hell, he could probably get an ICW trial. Britain not giving him a trial, sending him to prison, and then the kiss on sight order? That's most likely against so many ICW laws and charters they could probably step in for.

And that's another thing, they oversee the Statute of Secrecy. Sirius didn't get a trial. He could be tried by the ICW because he did allegedly blow up a street and kill 12 muggles. And Magical Britain would most likely get censured because of it. This, would work.

** I'm unsure which of these fall under canon or headcanon but mine (in addition to many of the others already mentioned) are:

Any person capable of using a magical foci is also capable of 'wandless' magic. Magical foci simply make casting magic easier. Also (and this maybe obvious) that 'wandless' magic existed before any magical foci existed.

Wandless magic is difficult to do for multiple reasons: it takes more concentration; it takes more control; and it is less structured (in that foci based magics basically use incantations and foci movement as a form of mnemonic to produce the right intent).

On magical foci, wands are just the most popular and used type of foci in magical Europe (and it's colonies). Other foci like staffs, rings, and crystals are also popular among others. In addition, relating to wandless magic, all foci are functionally capable of the same magic as each other (though obviously they each tend to be more suited to different types and styles of magic).

*** I agree that wandless magic has to exist in some form. Accidental magic by children is wandless magic, so if it can happen in children, there has to be some way of harnessing and using it. Also, without wandless magic, how would the first magic users have been able to cast magic in the first place? They would have had to use wandless before discovering that a foci such as a wand, made casting spells easier.

That the Lupin marriage would survive his runner. Even if he returned, he would be unable to quell the "but what if he does it again" thoughts, which would poison that relationship permanently. And that's not even mentioning what such a stunt would do to the opinion of his in-laws, who would drive even more wedges into the marriage (intentional or not).

That most magical creatures are actual monsters who ought to be hunted "Van Helsing" style rather than a minority who needs legal recognition. IMO that kind of themes ruins a perfectly fine antagonist, most of which are manifestations of ancient or medieval fears.

Because cursed child is just a hyped fanfiction, even if JKR had a hand in it. Hell, it goes against canon. You can add the new movies to that, they go against what has already been established in the books.

On the topic of Ancient Runes, in the books there is no hard evidence against it afaik. The subject is implied to be about magical languages the few times it has been talked about (the original copy of beedle the bard in runes, Hermione messing up her Ancient Runes exam by mixing up ehwaz and eihwaz and her carrying a ancient runes dictionary along with her during DH). According to canon tho (dunno who said it, probably another one of JKR's infamous tweets) it is about studying languages which is a rather unpopular opinion in the fandom

On wards, again there is nothing specifically stating wards don't exist afaik, the existence of protective enchantments are canon such as the enchantments around hogwarts and the blood protection around Privet Drive. I should have been more clear in my post so sorry for that, what I meant to say was that concepts like wardstones and such do not exist in canon.
