Just went to read a fic and I'm getting a 404 error. :(


** It's hit or miss with which chapters have been archived, but at least a decent portion of the navigation pages and some chapters have been archived by archive.org

** The server has been infected with malicious Malware that is attacking the server. They don't know how to fix it but know of someone who may be able to help. This is according to someone who runs the site.

*** Phew! It looks like it's a pretty easy fix, just changing ownership and permissions.

** When I put sycophanthex into Google it says the site may be hacked, so with any luck it will be back up again at some point.

*** The site most certainly has been hacked to some degree. I've been receiving spam-emails to the throwaway Email address I used to register there since around November.

I hope the passwords were safe, but people who use the same passwords on multiple sites should probably change them.

Doesn't look like it, there's still plenty of stories showing on their author profile.

*** It went down a few years ago and was gone for almost 6 months (I believe? Someone correct me. It was a LONG time.) That said, she did eventually get it back up. Hopefully it will happen again.

If anyone here is a tech person, contact her via the link posted and offer your help. It sounds like (from her LJ entries) that she has no idea what to do and is struggling to find time to deal with it.

**** Was it really six months?! I recall when it happened, but thought it was back up within a month.

I wish I could help her, too. Me and others have tried to throw money at the problem for her, but it really is a tech issue like you said, and I'm personally clueless on that.

** Perhaps she could look into moving everything to Archive Of Our Own? They have an Open Doors policy or something. I don't know if she has access to the files, but it could provide a useful back-up?

*** That was brought up in the post I saw about it. I can't remember why they weren't going to go that way, just that it had been considered and discarded. Sounds like they are still trying to get back up and running. /fingers crossed/
