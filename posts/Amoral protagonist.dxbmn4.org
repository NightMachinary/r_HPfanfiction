I'm looking for well written fics where the protagonist views themselves as amoral. Any recommendations?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]]

The protagonist is literally a god, so they don't give a damn about morality. (this fic is obviously inspired by the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya where the protagonist is also a god so morals don't apply to them)

I don't think that's an accurate statement about that anime. Haruhi doesn't even realize that she is a god, and thus her behavior is roughly as moral as all of her human classmates.

Muffin's fics are [[https://theoriginalcarnivorousmuffin.tumblr.com/post/186685468102/what-are-you-inspired-by-your-fanfictions-are][more inspired by]] classic scifi, such as the /Dune/ series, Philip K. Dick's novellas, and Ray Bradbury's plethora of short stories. However, she did recently post a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20005402][oneshot crossover with /Melancholy/]] when a fan requested it.

Ehh, I don't know. I remember her doing all sort of weird stuff. Didn't she more all less sexually harass her red-head female friend at some point?

I think that it's undeniable that Lily and the Art of Being Sishiphus is inspired by Haruhi Suzumiya. There are a lot of similarities between the two protagonists.

***** Haruhi doesn't abide by social norms, but that's not really the same thing as being amoral the way Lily is. Haruhi is rude, pushy, random, etc, but she's never blas√© about death and human suffering the way Lily occasionally is.

I agree that there are similarities because they are both female characters with godlike capabilities stuck in mundane situations, but /Melancholy/ is not the only story with that sort of character dynamic. Overall I think the plot, personality and themes of "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" are driving in a much different direction such that those similarities aren't enough to claim direct inspiration. I suggest asking the author about any anime inspiration she might have had.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks]]

This is the first fic in the black queen series, but the main character Jen the twin of the boy who lived is definitely amoral ( though there is some guilt in a couple of the books, but it doesn't change her actions). This is definitely a dark series that deserves a trigger warning for pretty much everything though the only thing that's graphic is blood/ gore and violence. It's an amazing series though, definitely one of my most favorite.
