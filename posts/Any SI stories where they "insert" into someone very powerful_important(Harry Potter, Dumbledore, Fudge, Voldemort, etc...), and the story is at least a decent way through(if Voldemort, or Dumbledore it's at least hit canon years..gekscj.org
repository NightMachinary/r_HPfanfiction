*** Fudge gripped his bowler hat with something like determination. He looked up.

"I shan't apologise, you know. All the evidence lead us to believe you were some poor puppet of Dumbledore's. I won't be sorry for doing what I thought was right, even if I was wrong in the end."

Harry's laugh was bitter as it was broken: "You weren't all that wrong. In some ways I was a puppet - just one which was stuck in a tug of war between Voldemort and the old man."

Suddenly Fudge really saw Harry. Not The-Boy-Who-Lived, not the attention-seeking Fourth Champion, not the Chosen One... Just Harry. Just Harry with glistening eyes that were greener than any bowler hat that he had ever owned, with lips as plump and fresh as as a June strawberry...

"Harry..."

"Cornelius..."

He leaned in and -

  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history.

** Interesting... I have amused myself previously by writing a bit of a "to-do" list for if I dropped into Harry, Ron, or Draco in the summer before 1st year (currently sitting as a google doc, not currently shared or posted anywhere or anything; part of me almost wishes for the 3rd just for the simplicity of raising fewer alarm bells if I AK the troll while also having access to $, especially with what I'd presume to be risks of scarcrux complications if Harry used the AK while it was still in there).

Here's a thought: roll a d10 (or use [[https://random.org][random.org]] and add whatever to 1990) to determine which year of the 90's you land in (0/10 can result in either 2000 or 1990 if you're using a die, just choose in advance), and create a list of 100 characters who're all alive at the start of the decade and roll percentile (or range 1-100) to determine who you land in. If you get an invalid result (such as Sirius Black in 1998) then either reroll or figure out the AU.
