** Harry stares in horror as Wormtail raises the knife once more, this time to his own arm. Realizing what the traitor is about to do, Harry calls for his most loyal friends, "Dobby!!"

With a *pop* Dobby appears with widening eyes! "Harry Potter needs Dobby's help?"

"Yes Dobby, JUST like with the Chamber of Secrets, I need you. HELP Wormtail!"

Dobby turns towards Wormtail and with a snap of his fingers sends several bludgers towards the portly Death Eater. Another snap and a brick wall that has a certain resemblance to Platform 9 3/4 materializes above Wormtail and simply drops.

Harry grins, "Great work Dobby."

Dobby's eyes widen at the praise, "Just one mores sir!" With a final snap a conjured cake appears and splatters the unconscious Wormtail.

** Forgive me if it doesnt flow that well, this was written off the top of my head and I'm kinda half asleep.

That being said, enjoy!

--------------

Harry breathed heavily in pain and exhaustion, he'd been through the ringer once already, and seeing Cedric die had just been one step too far as far as he was concerned.

So when Pettigrew went to cut off his hand in aid of bringing back the man who had killed his parents, Harry did the one thing he could think of to stop it.

"Dobby!" He yelled hoarsely, the little elf popping in front of him with excited, then terrified eyes.

"Great Harry Potter sir is in danger!" Dobby squeaked out in anger, snapping his fingers and allowing Harry to slump bonelessly against the tombstone.

Harry nodded in thanks to his little friend, but Pettigrew it seemed, was still performing the ritual, so minus his wand, and the energy to do much of anything, Harry pointed at Wormtail and said one word.

"Attack."

Dobby's face went stony as he nodded at his friend, and with a snap of his fingers, the bubbling cauldron raised in the air and upended itself onto Wormtail. Boiling water, blood, his own hand, and Voldemort's screeching baby body landed on his head, drenching him and covering him in 3rd degree burns and a rather large bump on his head from his master's impact.

Peter looked around in a pained daze, his skin felt like it was on fire, and his master was screeching in anger, giving him an even worse pain, but that was nothing compared to the terror he felt when looking up at the cauldron still hovering over top of him, as though it knew what was about to happen.

"Mimblewimble," Peter muttered fearfully, and the last thing he heard before the cauldron met his face was a snap of the fingers.

Then all he knew was pain.

*** People really do under-utilize house elves! Especially Dobby. xD We need more awesome heroic Dobby in fics. Use him more, damnit! Even canon used him to get in and out of the anti-apparition charmed Malfoy Manor prison, in a pretty damn smart use of canon magic! Dobby in and out rescue.

**** Canon house elves are just way too OP to give to any intelligent character. Just casually ignore any wards you like, effortlessly track anyone etc.

** Harry knows he must do something. But desperation doesn't always yield answers and no matter how much he wishes so, he can't accidental magic his way out of his bounds.

He watches as Wormtail adds his blood into the cauldron, and watches as the rat-like man brings the knife down to his trembling arm. Just before the blade can make contact he yells out in desperation, "Dobby! Attack!"

There is no pop and no elf. Instead, Wormtail jumps in fright, and somehow, someway, stabs himself in the eye.

Harry watches wide-eyed as the body of his parents' betrayer spasms and tips towards the cauldron, falling in with a splash.

Black smokes rise from the shaking cauldron, and before long, a hand emerges. The hand grips the edge od the cauldron and tries to rise out, but the cauldron tips forward, spilling a... a... a thing. Because that can't be a man.

The thing stands up with great difficulty, its eyes misshapen, bead-like balls of red turns to Harry and Harry's scar burn. Oh, how it burns!

The thing opens something akin to a mouth and a scratchy voice comes out. "Harry Potter." The thing cuffs, and a kidney drops out of its mouth. "I'm back. Worm-demort is back! Muahhahaha."
