I'm sorry, but other than HPLV and HPSS then HPDM is one of the worst slash pairings. They are constantly at each others throats throughout the series and you can hardly say that it's because they're obsessed with each other in a romantic way. Draco is also largely a cocky little sh*t which is one of the things Harry hates most.... IT JUST DOESN'T WORK!


** I would say the unpopular opinion would be that Drarry is the best slash pairing. Personally, I would argue it might just be, simply because it's so popular there's more great Drarrys (conversely there is more terrible ones as well I suppose).

Whilst the basis is questionable, it can be written in a way that's quite interesting, as any of the other pairings. I really enjoy Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run for example.

I mean... *obviously* it doesn't work. Obviously drarry stories make him grow up significantly. Draco maintains his snide personality but then always does something surprisingly kind in drarry stories, and Draco never did a single kind thing in the entire series. But fanfiction writers alter characters' personalities *all the time*. Half the time there's an exclamation mark in front of a character's name it's to signal that a character turned out differently than JKR wrote them, either because of a significant event or just... because.

**** I think the thing that makes it worse than just a regular Haphne ship is because he's a character with a history. With Daphne, you can do almost anything you want, so you end up with Ice Queen Daphne, with not-racist Daphne, etc. With Draco, you can't just erase his history without going back to first-year or before and rewriting that. And most authors won't do it unless they're doing something with the House of Black or the story involves befriending Draco early on. So you have this character who is a massive dick and believes in some horrible things and you want to make him all lovable because he was played by Tom Felton, and since actually using a blank slate character would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater, you whitewash him. And so this is how you end up with 6 of the most common and most repugnant ships, Harry or Hermione with Snape/Voldemort/Draco because these actors are hot and you can't be bothered to properly redeem them.

***** Another thing to consider is that most readers of Death Eater pairings do NOT want to have their characters turned into thoroughly good people. They thrive for the tension which comes from the stained history of the pair, the fact that one person had the other tortured, killed someone who was dear to the other and so on.

The one exception are the stories where the Death Eater in question runs a BDSM dungeon, and let's just say that plot is secondary to those either way. I mean, I'd be interested in "Draco rethinks his values after PS" or "Bellatrix ditches Voldemort after suffering through a decade in Azkaban", but I've been repeatedly told that this would not be a story idea fans of those characters appreciate.

***** See but that history is usually what draws people in in the first place. They see a character that has been antagonistic with the other character for a significant amount of time, and want to see the story unfold of how they get redeemed or how they change for the better.

#+begin_example
   you can't just erase his history without going back to first-year or before and rewriting that. 
#+end_example

Except you actually can redeem a character without erasing their history. It's honestly not even all that difficult. And in the case of Draco (as opposed to Snape or Voldemort) you have a built in fall back since he was a minor and potentially only doing the things he was doing because he/his family were under threat of death or torture from Voldemort. And thats just the /fall back/ option if all else fails or you need an easy out. And like, a ton of Drarry fics take place well after Hogwarts/Voldemort, when Draco has had time to process and evaluate everything that happened. Has had a chance to be punished legally and be ostracised by people for being on the wrong side of the war and ya know his general dickishness.

No, no it isn't. Not even close. Haphne is about a blank slate character, used explicitly because there is little about her in the books.

Yes you can take any character in the series and treat them like a blank slate, but then you gotta explain it as people will come in with preconceived notions about the Canon character. The functional equivalent to Daphne is Theo or Blaize.

Why would I be reading fanfiction if I wanted to read about a character mentioned once in canon. If I want to read about a character I don't know yet, then I'll read something that isn't fanfiction.

I want to read a fic where Draco did get a redemption arc, because it left me entirely unsatisfied that he didn't get one. Was he a bully? Absolutely. He was an arrogant, bigoted, pathetic little snot rag.

But up until book six that was basically childish rich kid bullying that James Potter actually did to Severus Snape. You could also argue that he was mimicking behavior his own head of house displayed.

If a man who tormented and bullied children half his age deserved a redemption arc, then Draco Malfoy should have gotten one too. That's why I read fanfiction.

**** I'd actually prefer that posters who want to rile up slash fans by dropping into their communities refrain. HPSlashFic was partly created in response to the constant downvoting, NO SLASH announcements, sneering about slash pairings, and complaints about teenage girls making straight men gay that used to be a regular feature here. It was annoying, sometimes obnoxious, and it also discouraged conversation about slash fic, since it was clear the straight men here didn't like it. So the logical response was to separate out the discussion and take it to a new subreddit.

This sub is actually more tolerant than it was even two years ago, but it's still not very open to slash content. And the idea of pitting commenters against each other - het vs. slash - just reminds me of the hundreds of times I've been challenged to defend my fic preferences, my ships, and my personal orientation. It can be fun if it's just fans comparing their favorites and their tastes, but it's worthless if your discussion partner is contemptuous of your fannish pastimes.

In the rare instances where people are looking for good slash outside of Drarry, Snarry, and Tomarry on this sub I see it brought up, though I don't know which fics.

This sub certainly can get homophobic, or at the very least uncomfortable with slash. At the same time there are a lot of good points about how off-putting the way a lot of these ships are handled. It's unfortunately difficult to separate out those with legitimate concerns and those who are just parroting talk points to further their homophobia though.

****** Yeah, I've seen lip service given to "acceptable" slash pairings - Wolfstar, Harry/Cedric, sometimes Harry/Ron - but the nod in their direction is usually as far as it goes. Not very enticing to someone who wants to talk about actual fics or what draws them to that combination of characters.

There's also a conflation here of anti-slash sentiment with anti-villain-ship sentiment. This sub has trouble accepting that antagonist/protagonist pairings are popular across fandoms, and that there's nothing wrong with that. Good/bad ships allow for different dynamics than hero/traditional love interest combos, but the demands for canon conformity (Draco must remain a little shit and a racist) and judgment according to real-world morality rather than narrative context or fantasy (it's horrible that anyone would want to see these fictional characters redeemed because they're Nazi equivalents!) is unevenly applied to slash. Draco/Hermione and Snape/Hermione also get derided and downvoted, but lots of guys here identify heavily with Harry so the outrage is more personal.

There's also a fair amount of blaming slash on teenagers lusting after movie actors, but come on. Insofar as its true, it's true across the board. It also ignores the rather large queer presence in slash fandom, the book fans (I speak here on behalf of Snape, since I don't know where Draco fans fall on that line), and the fact that there are a lot of older fans critical of the movies and the casting.

Another distinction I've noticed is that both dark and light slash ships get attacked (in the case of the former) and approved (in the case of the latter) only in the broadest terms. This sub usually loves discussing, dissecting, arguing over, and reccing individual fics and authors - except for slash. Very few people here are actually willing to talk about favorite writers or about the stories slash fans consider good. It's passive resistance at best, outright scorn at worst. All of which is why it's a good thing there's a separate HP slash sub for folks who want to swap recs and hold forth in typical fannish style.

It's when someone comes barging in with a flaming sword to denounce all such stories and imply that fans of those pairings are disgusting and their fic preferences should be stamped out that I see a problem. Because then you're trying to purify the fandom, so to speak. Or the sub, if we're talking about this community. And why? Is fictional moral ambiguity contagious? If you're exposed to a transgressive or - as we used to call it - dirtybadwrong ship, will you start lusting after the wrong fictional configurations? Would it matter if you did?

I happen to like age-gap or cross-gen pairings sometimes, although only between certain characters. (I don't think there's anything inappropriate between fictional characters. What happens between real people is a completely different matter.) So Snape/Harry yes, Snape/Hermione and Snape/Draco no. Snape/Dumbledore, Snape/Filch, Snape/Minerva yes. Snape/Voldemort no. The dynamics have to appeal to me. I just can't be fussed about a fictional character's virtue.

********** It's not pedophilia because /it's not real./ There are no children. There are no adults. There are only words onscreen or on paper. In fact, calling it pedophilia - which is the actual, physical sexual abuse of /real children/ - diminishes the issue by treating fiction as if it's interchangeable with predatory acts against real kids. Fictional characters are not alive. You might want to find another way to describe your disapproval.

I realize you're squicked by it. That's understandable. But if you attack real people in fandom for the made-up crime of writing fanfic about characters who have no existence beyond letters arranged on a background, that's far more "not okay" than any fic. If someone commits crimes in real life, that should be dealt with by the law. Just as writers who murder characters in various horrifying ways in fiction are innocent unless they attempt to kill someone in real life.

I've read some fascinating Snape/Harry with school age Harry. The fics were dark, tragic, messed-up, funny, and emotional. They did what fiction is supposed to do - told a riveting tale. They didn't "promote" anything, and no one who read them ran out to begin a life of abusing kids.

I know this won't change your mind, but oh well. I'll continue to read and write whatever I consider an engaging work of fiction, and I'll continue to feel not a single shred of attraction to minors.

I remember people complaining about that and it seemed then (as now) to be a stupid argument. Either having a preference toward the sexuality of your characters is a valid thing to request, or it shouldn't matter at all.

I'm pretty sure the second view wasn't what was being sought as I never saw similar complaints on slash only threads, plus the very concept of going to a slash only subreddit would defeat that view.

The other reasons are reasonable (and realistic, from what I have viewed here). But this one is just contradictory.

Edit: It is actually a fine reason for creating/having another subreddit for it. It was when it was used as a criticism of the behavior of the board (insinuating homophobia) that it falls apart.

The constant NO SLASH, often in capitals, sometimes with exclamation points, contributes to the repetitive arguments about how dare people turn Harry gay, the comments about being squicked by or uncomfortable with slash (I have no problem with squicks, btw, but it was often in response to why topics got downvoted - if you're squicked, stay out of the thread rather than try to suppress it). The phrasing still singles out slash. Just say what you want rather than what you don't. In this sub in particular, very few commenters are going to jump to "oh, this requester must want m/m!"

I also suspect you have to have experienced the long history of NO SLASH or NOT SLASH or NO GAY in ff.net postings, the anti-slash diatribes in A/Ns and author profiles, and the frequent pushback against slash pairings while the commenter protested they weren't biased against homosexuals, /but/... to understand why harping on "no slash" feels like a "stay out" sign.

** Ah. One of those "I can't keep silent because the tags keep evading whatever I filter out!" responses.

I get it. I agree with you. But, you just gotta let it go. It's an outlet for those that want to explore queer pairings, but want to start with a built in audience of doing so, just like you'll have some authors write AU's, but want to start with the built in audience already inherent because of name recognition.

Also. Women (And some men) like writing about toxic relationships that eventually have all parties involved happy about the arrangement and having sex. I mean. If you haven't noticed. Romance genre. Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray bathed in boatloads of money. IIRC Nicholas Sparks (A guy) has made a boatload of money writing what is essientially downer ending romance novels (IE Tragedy's) that have been widly popular for the last 2 decades. A number of which have been made into movies.

Now whether said slash pairings respects either character....you can often say the same about harem stories. Which is that they don't respect the character(s) at all. You're not reading for a faithful interpretation of the character in either case. You're reading for what you want the character to be. But mostly for the porn. Or (in the case of slash) you're reading for the romance that's set in the traditional gender roles of said romance, but they just happen to be the same gender. And the porn.

** Draco is an arrogant bully, but authors who prefer character-driven stories like flawed, terrible characters because they come with a built-in plot based on redeeming them. In these kinds of fics, the story structure and resolution is based around the character development arc, as opposed to plot-driven stories where there's a discrete villain and external conflict.

The reason why authors want to redeem Draco in fanfic is because /Harry/ thinks he's redeemable.

And JKR think's he's redeemable, too. [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/22/jk-rowling-unnerved-by-girls-who-fall-for-draco-malfoy][According to her,]] Draco Malfoy had a hidden heart of gold all along.

#+begin_quote
  “His strange interest in alchemical manuscripts, from which he never attempts to make a Philosopher's Stone, hints at a wish for something other than wealth, perhaps even the wish to be a better man. I have high hopes that he will raise Scorpius to be a much kinder and more tolerant Malfoy than he was in his own youth,” she writes, ending: “His Christian name comes from a constellation -- the dragon -- and yet his wand core is of unicorn.

Not arguing, but this thinking always cracks me up. The popular rich boy who espouses his parents' (and society's) politics and opinions without any independent thought is pretty much the opposite of a bad boy. A bad boy is a /rebel/.

In RL history, the way these laws are never enforced properly on nations with real power (like the USA which has laws that ensures the USA use anything up to military power to defy any ICC judgements against its soldiers) just increases perception that they're window dressing, and lack the power to actually change behaviour. So the way you refer to them as if they were the bedrock of some sort of universal moral framework is a bit laughable.

** I mostly agree with the Drarry slash - it is a bad idea.

But the HPLV slash all the times I've seen it, it is meant to be creepy. It is meant to be chilling. Voldemort doesn't love, so in these stories he is usually possessive. He usually finds out that Harry is a horcrux, making him even more possessive. He manipulates Harry, and it is a very toxic relationship in which Harry is usually imprisoned in Voldemort's fortress so he can not get out. Some even have severe cases of stockholm syndrome that usually occur when Harry is heavily manipulated.

I have not been a fan of this genre as it has over creeped me out, but I have found two fics which I like. They are both by the fictionist.

As for HPSS, aren't those mentor fics? Mentor fics are remotely possible, but only with a lot of pushing, difficulty and character development.

The only way to make those pairings work while staying in character is by letting things go the only way they naturally could, meaning /nonconsensual/.

The only slash pairing I personally hate, and see a lot of hate for, it's Harry/Voldemort and Harry/Snape. It's not even for the slash, it's just utterly disgusting to see older men taking advantage of an abused child. Voldemort is *54* years older than Harry, and /killed his family/. Snape isn't any better, his hate for everything Potter brings to mind nothing good. A pedophile abusing his nemesis son, a poor abused and orphaned kid? Sounds... hilarious.\\

****** It's nice to see a fair few people jump in to say they're not anti-slash. I'm still interested in seeing what OP meant by their post though. I both do and don't agree with you. In terms of what does and doesn't make sense, I feel like half the point of fanfiction is to ask "but what if the story was different in 'X' way?" So fanfiction can explore most concepts and pairings that don't make sense in the canon but make them fit a newly-constructed story. Not to say that much of it isn't trash, but that's why we have such a great recommendation forum here, to sort the wheat from the mary-sue-american-high-school-lotr-elvish-crossover chaff :) Point being, slash fanfiction isn't really any more unrealistic or out there than many other readily accepted fanfic concepts.

I personally also have a great dislike of anyone in Harry's age group being paired with Snape, Voldemort, or anyone else in the older age brackets, but that's just a squick of mine, and I don't find the writing of it inherently problematic. Same goes with your kink for Harry/older women.

He was already starting to change in the last two books and in canon him and Harry nod to each other on the platform. Now granted that's a big difference than being in a relationship with each other but they had clearly grownup and didn't hold their pasts against them.

Also a lot of popular couples in books and tv start out disliking each other and then end up in a relationship. It's not realistic in real life but who is reading Harry Potter for the reality aspect?

I want to explore how such a little shit could be redeemed, how Harry and Draco could get over their differences, etc. That's far more interesting to me than a relationship without those barriers, or a story where the plot is driven by an outside baddie. It's exactly /because/ Draco is such a shit that I love the pairing.

It blows my mind that some people can't grasp that people...change? I'm certainly not the same person I was at 17, I've changed a lot, and I'd expect that for anyone on the planet.

I would certainly agree that the ff.net part of the Harry Potter fandom is larger, but ao3 being 1/4 the size of ff.net community I think is being too pessimistic and not reflective of its reach. Ao3 is the intersection on the Venn diagram between many smaller sites/communities because of it's purpose primarily as an archive. Many authors write their fics primarily on other sites (tumblr, wattpad, alternatehistory, DLP and even ff.net) and then back them up on ao3, where readers from other places can discover them.

All this to say that it's a very inter-connected part of the fandom, and when people minimize the site, or pretend that this sub's demographics and opinions are totally representative of the Harry Potter fanfiction community's, then they're not being accurate or fair.

FWIW I only tolerate Drarry fics where Draco is the one who realizes he's wrong and tries to change. Any justification for blood supremacy gets an unfollow and maybe even a bad review from me.

My opinion on Draco is complex. On one hand he's a bigot, a bully, and a coward in canon. On the other hand, he shows genuine emotion and remorse, even if his redemption arc sucked in canon.

Overall, he's a better person than Snape was.

Still have never read a good redemption story for him. I have a vague idea for one that ends up like Batman where both of his parents are dead.

** You'll have to /forgive/ my snark, I'm baffled at the popularity of this post it's so whingy and ridiculous. I don't mind people /avoiding/ a particular type of romance but there's no point in deriding or demeaning it.

This is fan fiction. If you want strictly canonically-compliant material then read those stories instead. Or just go read canon itself.

While I've never written this pairing I have read it. And there are just as many ways to tweak canon to suggest Harry/Draco as there are to Harry/Hermione.

Just from the outset, there are a tremendous number of opportunities to introduce drama/suspense (read: entertainment) into this pairing. Just by thinking for two minutes, I came up with the below points that I would have fun writing about if I were to undertake a story.

- Magical vs non-magical upbringing

- Privileged upbringing for Draco vs normal/sub-par upbringing for Harry

- Blood-purity conflict / Ideology conflict

- Slytherin / Gryffindor rivalry (Quidditch / housemate opinions etc.)

- The looming presence of Lucius Malfoy over any intimacy between them

- The loominger presence of Lord Voldemort over any budding relationship

- Personality conflicts (self-centred vs. selfless)

- Potential for hidden personality traits and characteristics (you don't /know/ Draco until he lets you), nor does Draco /know/ Harry due to their shared scenes being steeped in conflict.

- Draco being Marked vs him being unmarked and conflict derived from that can of worms

- To add on to the above, both of their lives have a conflicting "destiny" if you will, Draco to serve the Dark Lord, Harry to oppose the Dark Lord.

- Harry being parseltongue would be a curiosity to Draco, and might allow for creativity in writing about what is otherwise a hilariously unexplored ability.

- And many, many fucking more

There's countless variations of unique stories you can make out of just these points. What? You're telling me Harry/Hermione has this much material to work with? Objectively wrong. Most Harry/Hermione stories I've read the largest conflict is Ron thinking Harry has /stolen/ Hermione away from him. Harry gallantly stands up for Hermione, the "trio" is forced to mature or split and that's the end of it. The stakes are low and massively less far-reaching compared to a Draco/Harry romance.

To put it more simply, Harry/Draco type stories have an "us vs. the world" type of feeling pre-built into them. You don't get that with any other pairing (aside from Snape/Voldemort etc which have their own unique relationship dynamics).

If I sound pissed off it's because I am, this community shouldn't shit on certain kinds of stories. Do you want authors to continue writing within the fandom or for them to fuck off because their favourite pairing gets shit on by the largest community of their fandom?

** Ao3 pairing popularity for anyone curiuous -- I made this a while back while bored: [[https://pastebin.com/raw/3ZyTGTSF]]

Personally, I've never cared for slash (either F/F or M/M) -- I don't avoid a fic with it for the slash alone, but if it's a main focus of the fic, it just isn't my thing. Otherwise, with the exception of a few pairings, generally speaking I care more for how plausible a pairing is over how "politically correct" it is. If a fic allows sympathetic traits for Draco, and said traits are plausible (say, he got a major outside influence that allowed him to grow up a better person), I'm not going to shy away from Drarry/Dramione/etc. But if a fic portrays Draco as the asshole he's portrayed as in canon without proper redeeming and that his partner "gives in" in the end, I'm going to avoid it. I think the vast majority of Drarry fics is of the latter kind.

But with all this said -- does it matter? I actively avoid Tomarry alltogether, and fics with Jily as main focus, no matter the contexts (and I'm sure there are very well written Tomarry fics out there with the sheer amount of Tomarry fics that exist), but aside from threads explicitly asking for opinions, I generally hold those thoughts to myself. Ship shaming isn't conducive to a healthy community.
