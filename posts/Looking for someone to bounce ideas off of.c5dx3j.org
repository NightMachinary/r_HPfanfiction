*** I'm sorry, but I don't think the premise really works out. I think Ginny would be pretty much the only character that /wouldn't/ hesitate to kill teenage Tom after what he put her through in her first year.

Everyone else hates Voldemort but might accept that teenage Tom isn't that bad yet, but Ginny was manipulated, betrayed and almost killed by teenage Tom. She'd never forgive him for that, and she'd never trust him after experiencing how good at manipulating people he is.

****** This actually helps I might be able to use this in act 2

​

I can have ginny sneak into the boys dorms during a quiddicth match only for tom to spot her and confront her on this

they can head to the head master where ginny can lie to the headmaster and tell him she was planting a love note for tom while he was out.

​

Tom will flip it on her by accepting her confession of love and using it to keep an eye on her this also has him move the diary.

**** But Parseltonge isn't a learn-able language. It's an innate one. You could just explain it that Tom left a little of his soul behind in her or something. But that would also likely make her a horcrux as well.

Well I could just write that she remembered opening the chamber or I can say she brought on with her. Latter on in the book I plan to reveal that the world she came from is slightly more different that she and the rest of the good guys were forced to flee from the death eaters and take whatever they could with them.

** If I can ask, how do you plan to make her friend with Walburga ? Her portrait at Grimault may not be a totally accurate description of her, but she still seem to be very bigoted, and unless you created a fake identity for Ginny she would appear as a Mudblood.

She's still a bigot, but it's more of a thing that doesn't get brought up, but when it does ginny does chastise her for.

*** great thanks for helping

I'm working on a time traveling ginny fanfic where she heads back to the 40s to kill tom riddle

the big problem is getting her and tom to talk and for him to see her as something more then the masses

**** I guess it would depend of your scenario (for example, does she go to Hohwarts or does your story happen after it?), but Tom does have a good reputation in both case, having charmed everyone but Dumbledore.

So having them both interact is pretty easy, maybe Dippet asked Tom to help Ginny settle at Hogwarts since he is a prefect, maybe he decided to "help her" because he is Tom, always so helpful. Another way could be make Ginny have a fight with a follower of Tom, and have him intervene officially as a prefect, but in fact here to help the follower.

As for Tom to see more in Ginny than the masses, I guess you could either have her tell him something she should not know (that was revealed by the Diary to earn her confidence), or maybe say something in Parseltongue if you decide she retained this ability (in fact if you make her Parselmouth, you could probably have them meet inside the Chamber, he would definitively notice her then).

****** If this happens during Hogwarts, Tom wouldn't have created most of his Horcruxes yet. He may have the ring but Dumbledore speculates that it hasn't even been turned into a Horcurx until he leaves school. Even if by some chance the ring had - the cup, the locket, the diadem aren't found by Riddle until much later. Would you change that up in your story?

******** Oh, I see! So basically at this point, Ginny would need to destroy the 2 Horcurxes and kill Riddle himself to save the world? That makes a lot more sense now that you've explained it.

If you're still having trouble with separating her from the masses in Tom's eyes, I think just the simple fact that she isn't taken by him and his charms would probably be enough. I mean, he's used to everyone falling under his spell so someone who's socially desirable and don't find him to be, is sure to ruffle his feathers.

But I did see your edit about her going to the Chamber and him finding out as well as catching her in his dorms. Those are things that would make a person stand out so I'm thinking you've probably got that covered!

***** so far I have her meeting tom in dada and challenging him; he rejects her offer, but she gets put into the slug club where they have a little verbal argument about the war from the muggle point of view. This is going to set up the main theme of the story with both of them stating there positions on the war. Tom thinks that the more savage side will will because that's muggles true nature while ginny says that the muggle are better then wizards give them credit for.

​

Right now i'm looking for where to take them after there initial head to head.

I've got ginny becoming friends with walburga black but from there I don't really know where to take them
