Sirius was held in a high security cell, presumably and if Hagrid was said to be the Heir of Slytherin who was attempting to kill students, then I think it's natural that he would also be held in the high security section of Azkaban. Maybe Sirius recognises Hagrid, but Hagrid doesn't because Sirius has changed so much. Or he looks at him in passing and lashes out angrily, maybe he was located right opposite Sirius's cell. I just want to see them interact in prison


** That would be actually one good way how Sirius could be liberated before the third year, if he told Hagrid he was not the Secret Keeper. Of course, all problems with the premature release of Sirius remain (what to do with the third year, when its main premise has been completely unravelled?).

*** Actually, you could get into a situation where there's a manhunt (rathunt really) for Pettigrew. The only reason Sirius made the connection between him and Scabbers is that he had, by happenstance, been given the newspaper with the article about the Weasleys winning in some ministry-sponsored lottery. Were he free, in the process of recovering, and trying to get in contact with Harry, there would be no particular reason for him to look at the ‘paper that day; and there's no real reason for Harry to bring up his friend's pet, once they /do/ get to meet.

**** I don't think Sirius would need that newspaper that much. He knew Peter was the Secret Keeper, he knew he was the traitor, he knew the most natural disguise for him was to hide as a rat. He could probably recognize him in his rat form (Remus eventually did), and Peter would therefore probably immediately after Sirius' liberation run away from Ron, which might be noticed by Harry and reported to Sirius.

The newspaper article in the book was primarily motivation for Sirius to leave the prison, because he suddenly saw Harry was in danger. With him liberated, the newspaper would be mostly useless.

***** As you said, a pet suddenly disappearing is a lot more notable than a rat doing normal rat things. Unless attention is specifically brought to him, he's unlikely to be mentioned; how many times was Scabbers discussed after the train ride in PS and before PoA? I don't know that he's mentioned at all in CoS.

****** That's true, but Pettigrew cannot just stay put as a pet rat. The danger that the godfather of the Ron's best friend will see him (and notices missing finger, or recognizes him otherwise) is just too high.

Actually, when Harry first gets to the Burrow and sees Ron's room for the first time, he notes that Scabbers is sunning himself in a corner.

In real life, rats avoid direct sunlight, so it's actually a clue that Scabbers is more than just a pet rat

*** Well who would believe Hagrid? The naive and dumb half-giant? Now he could say something to Dumbledore, how Sirius claimed his innocents and how they switched secret keepers.

Nevermind that between Hagrid getting out of Askaban and Sirius breaking out there are maybe at the most two months...

now I could see a year were after Sirius broke out Hagrid is actual getting messages from Sirius with leads for his innocents and begs for help and to protect Harry from the real fake rat. And Hagrid being the most obvious bumbling secret detective of all times.

Given he was also the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, I would say it is pretty enough.

**** Hagrid tells dumbledore, when sirius breaks out Hagrid meets him and arranges a meeting with dumbledore

dumbledore then discovers the truth and arranges for petigrew to accidently be discovered

Dumbledore then talks to harry about his condition at home and discovers he is abused and decides that maybe losing the blood protection would be worth it if he could life in a house with a loving godfather

***** I just like the idea that the trio suspects that something happened to Hagrid in jail, like Sirius placing an Imperio on him or something or even that Hagrid is a polyjuiced Sirius and all that stuff

​

It would be adorable to think that the trio feels like they have to protect Hagrid from whatever makes him do stuff and for once suspecting somebody else but Snape, but never believing him to be bad

*** The Weasleys, not having to keep themselves out of the sun and away from dangerous locations quite so much to make up for the failing health of Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, chances a bit deeper into one unexplored pyramid than they should have.

How will Hogwarts handle having a family of redheads on its premises... when those redheads have been afflicted with THE MUMMY'S CURSE?!?!?!

Coming this summer to a theater near you.

** I did write a one-shot that picked up on the main events that we know happened to Sirius in prison --- including Hagrid's brief incarceration. In my fic, Hagrid ignored Sirius and cold-shouldered him, which is what I think he would have done.

  Myklos had already been in Azkaban for ten years when Sirius Black arrived, frogmarched between two sullen warders. Something about the young man's fierce bravado made Myklos curious, but Sirius would reveal his secret in his own time. And Time was what they had in abundance until the day Minister Fudge gave Sirius a slightly out-of-date Prophet. An Azkaban love story. (slash)
