I've read A love So green. Just started with The Aorist Subjunctive.So far very interesting, I haven't really read a ff in which Dumbledore dies before Harry's fifth year. It is holding my attention so far, I'm on the second book in the series.

I'm extremely curious about HarryxCedric, I honestly wish there were more of those, slash or fem!harry. I read a tumblr post by child_otk where she talked about the idea of one in which she could twist Cedric's loyalty and make it toxic and later worse because of Ron leaving and the locket Horcrux. I think I would have liked reading something like that tbh. It is easy to imagine a Cedric with a Bellatrix-like obsessive loyalty or even toxic protectiveness, especially if Harry saves his life.

I usually hear the argument that Cedric is a boring choice, but so is Hermione and there is no shortage of HarryxHermione fanfictions. I don't see why Cedric and Harry can't be paired together especially when Cedric is such a promising character. A near death incident allows you to change literally anything about his personality. There's so much scope.

Everytime I see a promising Cedric and Harry fic it inevitably turns into Draco and Harry.

Do you guys know any good ones?

Rose will definitely end up with Cedric. Right now the fic is reaching the conclusion of CoS and the fancying-part will pick up once year three starts. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

** It's a Potter twins fic, but Danny (female twin) does get together with Cedric. Last sequel is incomplete. That's pretty much all I remember from the first and second fic. I haven't read it since 2013/14.

  Fifth year will be starting soon but this time Danny Potter is determined to stay by Harry's side no matter what.
