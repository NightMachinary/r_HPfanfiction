Looking for anything with it. The child could be Harry, a classmate, or even an OC. Just wondering if anyone managed to make a half-decent fic with the "Luke, I'm your father" trope.


** It would also be interesting if Voldemort had no idea about his child.

** You could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]]. It does have Voldemort's kid as a plot point but also has Harry dumped to an AU by Voldemort and some major bashing on his universe's Dumbledore/evil Dumbledore. I liked it but the story is still in progress and the author hasn't updated in years.

*** Two years, but then, the Author also hasn't updated Jamie Evans in nearly two years as well. He's working on his OC works, rather than FF, and will likely focus first on Jamie Evans, rather than Elsewhere (that's from a PM he sent me).

**** Even canon Dumbledore deserves some bashing for the choices he made but not everyone likes that. I generally have no issues with bashing if there is a well planned reason behind it. I only complain when it comes out of the author not liking the character or giving a piss-poor reason to bash them.

** How about [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/fyre/HOV.html][Heir of Voldemort]]? It's an HP xover with BtVS

** I can only see him having a child to sacrifice in some sort of dark ritual. Interesting thought though!
