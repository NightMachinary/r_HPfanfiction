This post is somewhat related to a post of mine a while back asking for powerful!harry stories. Unfortunately i feel like i should have been more specific on the criteria as the responses, while vastly appreciated are left to be desired.

With that said, I'm looking for any story where Harry is already a badass/powerful/deadly..etc at the start of the story. As in Harry doesn't gradually become a force of nature as the story goes on because /he already is one/ at the very beginning, where he trains not for the sake of learning but for the sake of honing and sharpening his already pre-existing skills.

All pairings are welcome provided they're neither slashes nor OCs. Obviously the fic i'm looking for is an AU but i like to keep the story centered on Harry attending Hogwarts(a mentally adult Harry time-travelling back to his younger body doesn't count).

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

** LinkFFN(11859282) but it is the prologue and first chapter only and I will likely only be updating once a month due to time constraints to caring for an elderly relative with dementia. And writing on an ipad.

mini-outline: he has a hereditary magical power allowing him to use the shadows like weapons that he gains on the night of halloween at ten(eleventh anniversary of his conception). He can use it as a blunt instrument but as he grows older, his control and imagination turns his weapons into surgical instruments.

**** It is very much showing its age. Quite a bit of the characterization of Tonks and a fair few other plot points have become cliche since its publication. The writing also might not be up to current standards (I know mine have been raised since I first started reading fanfic way back when).

That said, I still reread it every so often. It's a classic. It's also one of the better Harry/Tonks stories out there of a longer length, even taking into account everything I said above. Most of the more recent and good stories of this pairing are quite short.

Some of the shorter or more recent stories worth a read. linkffn(6576767; 4014673). Those are both more relationship focused.

Renegade Cause. linkffn(4714715). Long, good, but very convoluted and complicated. It's not incredibly relationship-focused from what I can remember.

Also just about everything Harry/Tonks by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1824855/chelseyb][chelseyb]] is worth a read; some are better than others, but all of it is good.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
