** Started reading linkffn(13536654) recently, fits what you're looking for. Harry just stops caring after the Goblet of Fire spits out his name and no one believes he didn't do it, goes around being an asshole.

  Harry has spent years pretending to be someone he was not, but in his fourth year he had finally had enough. He would no longer pretend. Now the real Harry Potter is out, and everything is changing. Dumbledore bashing, Hermione and certain Weasley bashing. Grey/Dark Harry.

  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think. Alternate from Order of the Phoenix
