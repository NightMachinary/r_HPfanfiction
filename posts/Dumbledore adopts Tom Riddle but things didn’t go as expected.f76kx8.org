Harry looks at a badly injured Tom Riddle whose left hand and torso was almost cut off by sectumsempra. Blood covered his body and his hand was shaking with anger and despair. His last horcrux has just been destroyed by the sword of Gryffindor.

“I will restore Slytherin's glory! I will not allow wizard's heritage to be crushed!” Voldemort wheezed out his last few words because blood was flowing out of his mouth. Harry never agreed with his methods and ideas but he has to respected his willpower.

“In the end... I was not powerful enough... I was not the master of death... but father was... the power of Death surges through the wand's veins...” Harry gripped his wand harder, because he was sensing something was coming.

“With this, the wizard world's long night comes to an end...” A beam of red light shoots out of the Elder Wand and hit Voldemort right in his neck. His head dropped to the side but his body was still stiff and standing.

Suddenly, Voldemort's dead body was covered in a black liquid and a hand that wears a ring with a black stone slowly extends out of the cut on his neck and grabbed on the Elder Wand. A hand that Harry knows too well.

Standing before Harry was not the Dumbledore he knew when he died, whose body was fragile and hand covered in black. It was a way younger Dumbledore without his trademark flamboyant clothes and twinkling eyes. It was a man who took away thousands of lives to defeat Grindelwald, the one that Tom Riddle feared the most.

“Pitiful child... To return me from the great beyond and finish your last wish... Which means, Harry, I must destroy you...”
