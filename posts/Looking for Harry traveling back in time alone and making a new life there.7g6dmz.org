So we all know the countless "Hermione goes back in time and ends up with Sirius, Lupin or Snape" stories. But are there any in which Harry goes back / is thrown back, sees no way back and decides to stay there and stop the war against Voldemort? Preferably Harry/female OC but Harry/Neville's mum or Harry/Black sister will do. No slash obviously.

Please no "Death Eaters are the good guys" type of fic or Snape/Voldemort redemptions.


** linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). He goes back specifically to stop Voldemort, but ends up making a life for himself in the 1930s/1940s Wizarding world.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  So we all know about Hermione going back into time, but what about Harry? [sic]

You phrased this like Harry going back in time isn't one of the most popular genres there are. Outside of Drarry, you can't step outside without tripping on a time-travel!Harry story.

**** Exactly. There are thousands of "Harry goes back and relives his life...soulmate some Granger girl" stories. But I was thinking about Harry -> Rise of Voldemort.

Hell, I'd read Harry/Lily set in the 70s just because it is not a completely worn out trope.

** linkffn(Time Turned back by Sakurademonalchemist) fits your request pretty well. Harry finds himself in the past after an accident and adapts pretty well and solves the Voldemort threat before it becomes much of a threat.

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.
