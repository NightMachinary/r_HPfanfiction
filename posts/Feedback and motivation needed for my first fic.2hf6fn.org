** I haven't read your fic yet. I would like to give feedback, but I'm bad at giving motivation. In fact, I can be downright discouraging. Do you want my feedback? "No" is a perfectly good answer that will not upset me or reflect negatively on you.

Edit: scratch that, compared to most of what I see, this is glorious.

**** I can't see where you were going with it -- or at least, I couldn't until I saw the description.

Good points:

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation. You even used "discreet" rather than "discrete"! The cockles of my heart are all toasty now. So many people get that wrong.
- Using an uncommonly used character.
- Punching squid. Even if it didn't actually happen.

I don't really know how to write romance. I don't read romance. Going by the [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle]] guide, we have just gotten to some characters in their comfort zones. Pretty much nothing else. I'm not sure how to draw them together -- right now, it seems like they both want to get on with normal life more than anything else.

I'm not sure how to help, so [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBrDPorB80][here's Hatsune Miku singing Matthew's Passion by Bach]].

#+begin_quote
  /By Dan Harmon./ Storytelling comes naturally to humans, but since we live in an unnatural world, we sometimes need a little help doing what we'd naturally do. Draw a circle and divide it in half vertically. Divide the circle again horizontally. Starting from the 12 o clock position and going clockwise, number the 4 points where the lines cross the circle: 1, 3, 5 and 7. Number the quarter-sections themselves 2, 4, 6 and 8. Here we go, down and dirty: * . A character is in a zone of comfort, * . But they want something. * . They enter an unfamiliar situation, * . Adapt to it, * . Get what they wanted, * . Pay a heavy price for it, * . Then return to their familiar situation, * . Having changed. * . But they want something. * . They enter an unfamiliar situation, * . Adapt to it, * . Get what they wanted, * . Pay a heavy price for it, * . Then return to their familiar situation, * . Having changed. Start thinking of as many of your favorite movies as you can, and see if they apply to this pattern. Now think of your favorite party anecdotes, your most vivid dreams, fairy tales, and listen to a popular song (the music, not necessarily the lyrics). Get used to the idea that stories follow that pattern of descent and return, diving and emerging. Demystify it. See it everywhere. Realize that it's hardwired into your nervous system, and trust that in a vacuum, raised by wolves, your stories would follow this pattern. I will talk in greater detail about this pattern in subsequent tutorials. /Next article: *[[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_102:_Pure,_Boring_Theory][Story Structure 102: Pure, Boring Theory]]*/

** You're a fantastic writer! Hermione is believable, and you've taken Gregory in an interesting direction that I like a lot. Good prose too.

I'm not a Hermione/Gregory fan (but really, I doubt many people would say they are) and think it would work better as not a ship. Just two childhood enemies who realize that the other has grown up, that people do change.

EDIT: please, even if you lose motivation for this fic, wire something else! There are too many shit writers or overdone ideas; we need you!

**** Maybe you could use the friendship as a step before romance, instead of just skipping into romance. Seeing the unlikely pairing it would make more sense anyway.

Maybe the fast friendship between Hermione and Gregory can become the reason for Ron to break off the wedding too. I can see Hermione wanting to help Gregory either with his mission or even in his life in general, and that not pleasing Ron at all, you know, because he's an ex-Death-Eater, because he's a slimy Slytherin and all that (Ron in not the most tolerant bloke around).

I really hope you continue writing this fic. I thoroughly enjoyed it because it was well-written (despite some spelling / grammar mistakes) and it is so original. I'm really craving some unusual pairings for a change, so please, pretty please, do not abandon it!

** Use a summary. 90% of my fanfic reading choices are based on recs, but the rest are based on the summary. Unless this is literally just a shipfic, it needs one. Think of this as a dustjacket blurb, and make me want to read it. Maybe think about the target audience, and speak specifically to them.

Also, even if it /is/ just a shipfic, consider using the relationship tags for FFN. That will put a "[]" around the romantic relationships and makes it look more "modern" and professional. This will also allow you to add other major characters without making it look like a harem fic or some such.

--------------

As for content, I haven't taken the time to do a thorough reading (this isn't my ship and I don't usually read post-Hogwarts stories) but some things stand out.

You only use the default dialog tag "said" once in the first chapter, and it is not typographically correct:

#+begin_quote
  "Headmistress says you're to go to her office before you go in the lake*."* Filch said as he locked the gate.
#+end_quote

Always use a comma before quote when using dialog tags.

#+begin_quote
  the lake*,"* Filch said
#+end_quote

--------------

There is this, also first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "I was briefed" emphasis on the 'brief,' he thought, "on the squid's protected status, but I wasn't given much more than that. Is there any idea as to what started it off?"
#+end_quote

Missing comma before the first ending quote, and some awkward internal and external dialog mixing. This is where pure style comes into play, but parentheses indicate a reduced prominence, so I might do it like this:

#+begin_quote
  "I was briefed*,*" *(*emphasis on the 'brief,' he thought*)*, "on the squid's protected status...
#+end_quote

--------------

Same comma issue here, just before the quotes this time (chapter two):

#+begin_quote
  Gregory dropped his shoes in front of her and slowly said "Yes, Granger."
#+end_quote

Should be:

#+begin_quote
  Gregory dropped his shoes in front of her and slowly said*,* "Yes, Granger."
#+end_quote

--------------

Last, quotes over paragraph breaks. Always have to have starting quote marks:

#+begin_quote
  "[...]She didn't have the Mark, and I think she had been estranged from her husband for a few years at that point.

  They found his dad a few days later, in a car park in, um, Blackpool, I think?[...]"
#+end_quote

Should be:

#+begin_quote
  "[...]She didn't have the Mark, and I think she had been estranged from her husband for a few years at that point.

  "They found his dad a few days later, in a car park in, um, Blackpool, I think?[...]"
#+end_quote

--------------

Overall, seems well written. I'm not sure about the dialog-tagless style, but that is a personal choice. Just watch for those typos and make sure every dialog sentence is strongly anchored (or works with the alternating flow), and you should be fine.

I'd also remove the author's notes after you finish the complete story -- but again, that's just a personal preference. It makes sense when newly updated, but not after more chapters have been posted. It's fine to talk to the readers and show them what's happening with updates and the story in general, but the final work should stand on its own -- in my opinion.

Good luck and keep writing.
