**** Welcome to the world of Jordan Peterson. He thinks monogamy should be enforced so as to create a "better" society, despite claiming left wing ideologies are mistaken for trying to legally orient society in certain ways for better overall outcomes. The enforcing monogamy thing is pretty stupid, all things considered.

***** [I don't really want to start a Peterson discussion in this subreddit, but I think it should be OK in this thread]

do you really believe that Peterson, the guy who objects to the government compelling his speech, is in favor of legally enforced marriage? maybe a HP fanfiction fan is particularly susceptible to this interpretation because of the marriage law trope...

"enforced monogamy" may have been a poor choice of words in that interview but Peterson has since clarified what he meant. and it wasn't legally enforced marriage.

I realize that there's a limited amount of time in a day, and not everyone is interested in this topic enough to dig a bit deeper. but staying on the strawman level of interpretation seems unwise to me if the topic is important enough to comment on a "Harry Potter raised by Jordan Peterson" thread.

****** I wasn't even suggesting it was legally enforced marriage (whatever that means), but legally enforcing monogamy. At the very least Peterson accepts this obvious contradiction in his political views isn't a simple strawman, he what was essentially a consequentialist defense of the view ("society is better is we tilt it this way").

So to me, it doesn't even matter if he just pushes this as a non-political, moral view because it can't sit with his other view that those on the left are fundamentally wrong for wanting this type of reform in other areas. Either social reform to rectify hierarchies is wrong in all cases or it is sometimes justified.

******* sorry, bringing 'enforced marriage' into it wasn't ideal. here's how I got there: afaik bigamy/polygamy is already illegal in the west. and the article by Nellie Bowles made it sound like Peterson is in favor of forcing random women to marry incels. and you contrasted the monogamy thing with attempts from the left to /legally/ orient society in ceratin ways. all that amounted to the assumption that you think Petersons position is something like the marriage law trope.

I don't remember exactly how Peterson has responded to the accusation that he only wants to artificially influence hierarchies when it suits him, but I think a crucial difference between this issue and recent 'equality of outcome ' policies is that socially enforced monogamy evolved culturally over a long period of time whereas, according to Peterson, some of the utopian policies on the left are based on an incorrect understanding of the biological differences between men and women and are therefore highly likely to have unintended consequences. and unlikely to have the intended ones.

Peterson's idea is that, somehow, enforced monogamy is the solution to the incel "problem". It's no one else's fault if he can't be clear with his language, especially since polygamy is already illegal and socially the overwhelming view at this point, so it's a pointless position, frankly.

This is just ridiculous though, it's nothing but a naturalistic fallacy (x is good because it's natural or developed naturally). It's just a causal explanation for how something came to be, it doesn't lend any weight to the view that things should be that way. Any argument of this sort, which you have summarized as such, is demonstrably not the conclusion of a sound logical argument. Consider:

Negative (violent, distasteful, etc) reactions to homsexuality evolved culturally over long periods of time. Therefore, efforts by the left to normalize it and make it legal are likely to have unintended consequences etc etc.

The same logical formal as what you said, the same features in that homosexuality has for ages often been socially rejected, and yet this argument is unsound. As is Peterson's, therefore. Ignoring the silliness of objecting to the so-so-called "equality of outcome" response, this seems pretty obvious a problem.

I think he made a mistake when he said that it's "the cure". in a good conversation / interview they could have dug deeper into the idea and gotten to the interesting part - instead the focus was put on the ridiculous end of the argument. And I don't think it's a constructive use of anyone's time to argue about a position that he doesn't hold.

I quoted that Taleb tweet because I think it's a bit too easy to call Naturalistic Fallacy!

I'm not saying that the tradition of monogamy is particularly good. but maybe it's better than the alternative - afaik anthropologists are pretty clear on the fact that cultures with monogamy experience less violence from sexually frustrated unattached males. And I think you need to be able to seriously ask the question whether the rise in such violence in recent times may be causally linked to the widespread availability of reliable contraception and the increase in casual sexual encounters.

#+end_quote

I wouldn't have said /likely/, but yeah, sure. I think it's possible that those attitudes developed for reasons beyond some insecure dudes being secretly worried that dicks are delicious. not sure what those reasons might have been, and whether they're still relevant today, but I don't think it's far fetched to think that normalizing homosexuality might have unintended consequences. so far it looks like we got lucky, but who knows. (I feel it's necessary to mention that I, personally, am in favor of this change)

the key to a civilization not stagnating or imploding is the right amount of change. traditions etc. need to be updated to fit the present (and if clear, the future). but our current state of social, cultural and technical development is not /natural./ it took a lot of work to build up. any change you make may have unintended consequences. the left tends to underestimate those unintended consequences, the right tends to overestimate them. and Petersons objection to the changes of the 'indentity politics left' is that they not only underestimate unintended consequences, but also are operating from a faulty position (radical social constructionism).

I don't see the relevance unless a "higher dimensional experience" is defined. The point is the argument was indisputably argued for poorly because the structure was not valid.

Again, this doesn't make sense. Most societies (including North America) enshrine monogamy even in law, as well as in social practice. The existence of sexually frustrated young men isn't because monogamy has done the dodo.

You have misunderstood the point of the argument. The point being that the moral status of homosexuality (not people's opinions about it) has nothing to do with it being "natural" or "naturally developed" or not. That's the crux of the naturalistic fallacy.

#+begin_quote
  but our current state of social, cultural and technical development is not natural. it took a lot of work to build up. [...] and Petersons objection to the changes of the 'indentity politics left' is that they not only underestimate unintended consequences, but also are operating from a faulty position (radical social constructionism).
#+end_quote

This is essentially the silliest version of consequentialism. It's not that these changes are actually shown to have negative consequences (violent crime falls nearly every year, as it has for decades), but it's still bad because of /possible/ consequences (as opposed to the very real consequences of "traditional" views about homosexuals, transgender people, such as violence, hosing and medical discrimination, etc.). This ethical view is incoherent.

#+begin_quote
  not sure what you mean by that.
#+end_quote

Simply that the characterization of left wing views as equality of outcome is usually a strawman (e.g. universal health care isn't equality of outcome because the idea is that there's a basic coverage everyone gets, not that healthcare quality is at the same level for everyone).

#+end_quote

I'll work on clarifying that.

The author of the article wrote the following about 'incels' just before quoting Peterson on enforced monogamy:

#+begin_quote
  Some believe in forced “sexual redistribution,” in which a governing body would intervene in women's lives to force them into sexual relationships.
#+end_quote

I hope you'll agree that Peterson doesn't hold that position. and maybe you'll even agree that it's a bit of a dirty tactic to write this just before quoting Peterson as saying this:

#+begin_quote
  “He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That's actually why monogamy emerges.”
#+end_quote

if you haven't read it, here is Peterson's clarification of his position:

[[https://jordanbpeterson.com/media/on-the-new-york-times-and-enforced-monogamy/]]

the part that's missing from that, I think, is the explanation why this at all relevant. because, as you pointed out, monogamy is the norm already.

this is a bit of a compilation of things Peterson has said in different conversations: while monogamy is still the norm, the opinions on sex before marriage and casual sex have changed drastically since birth control became reliable. and in the casual sex game, the rates of success for men are more like a in polygyny system: a few men have a lot of success, some have a bit of success, and a lot have no success.

where it becomes difficult, imo, is quantifying the influence of this change on the violent behaviors of sexually frustrated young males. I don't think it's zero. but I also don't think it's quite as high as Peterson seems to think, to justify calling enforced monogamy "the cure" - I think there are more things in play here.

maybe this is a good segue to the naturalistic fallacy topic. if you trust the research done on male violence (some of which Peterson quoted in the blog post linked above) it is an evolved behavior. as such I would call it natural. but I don't think it's good. it just is. And while we might say that violence is morally wrong we can't just change this behavior by changing the rules. I don't mean we shouldn't, I mean that we are biological creatures with inherited hardware and firmware. we may be the blankest slate of all the animals with the greatest amount of learned behaviors, but we definitely aren't a completely blank slate. ignoring that reality and trying to change things through laws - well, Peterson thinks that's what led to the horrors of communism. I don't know enough about it to completely sign on to that, so I'll stick to high probability of unintended consequences and low probability of intended consequences.

you defined the fallacy as "x is good because it's natural or developed naturally". I don't think I'm saying that. merely that x is real.

#+end_quote

pretty sure that I haven't said that I'm against all changes. I said:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

are you saying that the reduction in violent crime over the past decades is the sole result of the social constructionist policies of the radical left? (whose reality-estranged ideas I'm opposing here)

#+begin_quote
  Simply that the characterization of left wing views as equality of outcome is usually a strawman (e.g. universal health care isn't equality of outcome because the idea is that there's a basic coverage everyone gets, not that healthcare quality is at the same level for everyone).
#+end_quote

sorry, I'm used to that phrase from the Jordan Peterson subreddit where it specifically refers to those policies that aim at equality of outcome. not all left wing views. I agree with your point about healthcare. examples are gender parity (especially at the CEO level), the "gender pay gap" and prioritization of diversity over competence.

I hope this clarified where I'm coming from.
