  Draco is a high-end prostitute who hides his identity. Harry unknowingly hires him. And then there is porn, questions about identity, domestic bliss, more porn, and truth as seen through a web of lies.

#+begin_quote
  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

#+begin_quote
  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.

** So many on this thread I haven't read before! It is great!

It is hard to pick from all the Drarry on my favorites list, but here are a few that fit your request as they are all angsty and over 100K words. For more check out [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][my rec list on ao3]], and you can filter and sort through that fairly easily.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5163386][Mental by Sara Holmes]] - Long Hogwarts 8th year fic where a spell causes Harry and Draco to be able to hear eachothers thoughts. Pretty quickly they learn how to control the link and become friends and then slowly develop feelings for eachother. This fic has an EXTREMELY slow build but it was believable and sweet. There are tons of parts that made me smile and laugh out loud.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][Volunteers]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3832147/1/Ember_to_Ember][Ember to Ember]] - I loved this series! The premise is that single-dad Harry and single-dad Draco end up volunteering together for a Beltane event in Scotland. Draco has been living as a muggle for years because of his probation after the war. All of the repercussions for Draco's involvement in the war felt really realistic and were some of the most well done I have read. All of the Weasleys in this were also very distrustful of Draco and not at all accepting of his and Harry's friendship, much less relationship. I thought that was also very realistic and again something you don't see in many Drarry fics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5673128/1/Two-Sides-of-the-Same-Coin][Two Sides of the Same Coin by Noiselessheart]] - This fic is a usual "Draco and Harry get together during 8th year" fic. What sets it apart is that 1) there was no forced "bonding" or anything like it to force them together 2) the angst and slow build to get them together is perfectly done 3) the writing is really good 4) Romeo and Juliet is a big part of this fic which I loved. If you like Harry/Draco, I would recommend this fic because it is well done even though the plot is nothing special or unusual. Sometimes a Harry/Draco 8th year UST angst fest is all you're really looking for though.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880][All Our Secrets Laid Bare by Firethesound]] - A great auror-partners esque fic. This fic really has it all - an angsty slow build, a loveable Draco, good writing, great character development, just the right amount of smut etc. The mystery is good too with a nice (albeit somewhat predictable) twist.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse by Mijan]] - In this fic, Draco abducts Harry from school and takes him to the dungeon at Malfoy Manor to wait for voldermort. He undergoes a huge (and very understandable and well written) character change and decides to betray the Death Eaters and escapes with Harry. They go on a long camping trip to try to walk back to hogwarts and slowly become friends and then even more slowly, develop feelings for one-another. This fic was such an emotional rollercoaster! One of my favorites for sure.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124273][The Printed Press by Soupy George]] - Incredibly cute and well thought out fic where Draco is hired to write Harry's memoirs. I love journalist Draco (probably because of TURN) and this fic was angsty but not too crazy, well written and sweet. I also love that the plot device of the memoirs forces Harry and Draco to talk about all of the things that happened at hogwarts year by year - it is so cathartic for a Drarry fan and suuuper well done. I highly recommend it!
