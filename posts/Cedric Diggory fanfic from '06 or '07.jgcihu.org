:END:
Does anyone remember a Cedric Diggory fanfic from right around when the 7th book came out that had Cedric brought back to life? Details on it are pretty fuzzy but I think he was brought back through a coffin in the Department of Mysteries? And one of the horcruxes was Harry's penis for some reason, and Cedric had to go cut it off? I'll keep thinking and update with more details as I remember. Any ideas?

E1: I also think there was a significant portion of the book that had Lupin being swayed by the werewolves and taking control of them and becoming a bad guy?
