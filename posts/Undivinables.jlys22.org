:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can't remember much about the fic except that at one point a character states that there are 3 things which are (like Gamp's Law) absolutely undivinable, one of which is the paternity of a child. Another character gives a rebuttal that that is not true for the mother for some reason I can't remember. It was a good fic and I think recommended by someone on this sub


** That's linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe). Specifically, chapter 27:

#+begin_quote
  "...Paternity is one of the three Utterly Undivinables.‚Äù

  (So a ritual can't be affected by it: otherwise the results would thereby work as a magical paternity test. The other two Utterly Undivinable Facts are the chastity of a woman and the magic of a child before their 131st lunar month, but they're not relevant here. Neither are any of the Contingently Undivinables.)

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
