I recently read an HP / GoT crossover which I quite enjoyed, the difference one man can make by joen1801 ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make]])

Got me thinking about any other good crossover stories I might be missing out on.

GoT, LoTR etc

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I've read the ones suggested and while they're really good, they're also unfinished, except for the power he knows not which is complete. High fantasy stories tend to be longer, so they're more likely to be unfinished.

** I remember reading some decent LOTR crossovers on ff.net, and starting my own crossover fic. (not that mine was decent- and also unfinished) Was long ago though, and I didn't save any of them.

Maybe that list will get you some interesting ones. Haven't checked out crossovers on AO3 for that yet.

** This might be a bit of a silly point to latch onto, but Game of Thrones is /not/ high fantasy; it's low fantasy.

*** Now I realise this is a subjective matter, but I would categorise GoT as high fantasy for these reasons:

Mythical world, not ours Global / Epic scale Obvious and known magic Good vs Evil

What characteristics of low fantasy would you say GoT has that would put it in that category?

**** Huh. Interesting that you see GoT that way. Well, first off, I don't think GoT really has a good vs evil struggle. The evil is the White Walkers, I suppose, but there's no real 'good' side in GoT, more like the side that wants to survive. The closest is Daenerys, but even then she's not exactly 'good' either. Her cause certainly isn't noble; she wants to reclaim the throne, not for the people or the good of the realm, but because she believes it's her birthright, and she is therefore entitled to it. That's pretty selfish, imo. And even if you disagree with my assessment of Dany's character, it's undeniable that the good vs evil struggle is not as clear-cut as it would be expected to be in a high fantasy story.

Magic in GoT is pretty vague too, imo. There's no sorcerer like Gandalf. There's no wands, no spells, etc. What magic GoT does have tends to be very obscure and mysterious - certainly a subtler and rarer brand of magic, the kind that I would expect to see in a low fantasy setting. It hints at something magical, rather than going full-blown magic battles where people are throwing fireballs at each other.

The scale of GoT is somewhat debatable too, because the first six seasons have been of a very narrowed scope, with the exception of the Night's Watch. In other parts of Westeros, the stories are heavily focused on individual interests and the struggle for power, which doesn't fit with the 'save the world' theme most high fantasy stories have. It's only the Night's Watch (and Varys?) that show any concern for the overall state of the realm.

Then there's also the fact that GoT is dominated by humans, and has very little magical creatures, which is a pretty big part of high fantasy, I think. There's only the dragons and the White Walkers (not counting wights because well, they're dead), but theirs is such a small population that I don't think it can really be counted to considering GoT a high fantasy.

***** ASOIAF is a bizarre series that kind of defies the general "low-high" paradigm of fantasy, because it has elements of both. In the corner of low fantasy is the fact that most of Westeros is dominated by humans (though we know other races existed prior to mankind) and the fact that magic is vague and mysterious, but it also has the high fantasy aspect of the Long Night and the prophecy surrounding it. Most low fantasy stories don't concern themselves with supernatural, cataclysmic events; the return of the White Walkers, along with the return of the prophesied hero to defeat them with a flaming sword is /very/ high fantasy. GRRM has often said that ASOIAF/GOT are a response to Tolkien, and I think I get what he's saying: essentially the story boils down to an Aragorn analogue (Jon/Dany/both depending on your viewpoint) defeating the forces of dark, but it's a more grounded take on that story, one that takes into account what [[https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/04/grrm-asks-what-was-aragorns-tax-policy/][Aragorn's tax policy might have been]], and how rulers struggle to lead both ethically and efficiently at the same time. Essentially, it's a low fantasy take on a high fantasy.

****** Yes, that's true. It's definitely not a classic low fantasy but a play on tropes and genres. I think that's true of many stories, that they can't be fit into one neat category. GoT is, however, more low fantasy than high fantasy, imo, with elements of the latter being mostly peripheral to a large part of the story. I've never really thought of it as a low fantasy take on a high fantasy, but I definitely see your point there, so that's food for thought.

******* I agree that it's definitely far more low fantasy than high fantasy, but I suggest the low fantasy take on high fantasy over it being a low fantasy purely because, while peripheral to a large part of the story, the framework of the story is more or less based on those high fantasy elements. While adjacent to the story for the majority of the series, Winter and the Long Night are likely going to be the major plot threads for the rest of the series (considering that the next book is titled The Winds of Winter, and the one after that A Dream of Spring), and it could be argued that the series is laid on the foundation of this very classically high-fantasy battle between the living and the dead. Without the looming threat The Others, the story is kind of just a lot of circuitous backstabbing interspersed with GRRM waxing poetic on the frailties of feudalism as a form of government. A lot of the plot structure surrounding characters like Jon, Stannis and The Wildlings, Asha, etc. falls apart. Plus the conflict brewing between Dany and Aegon as claimants for the Iron Throne will serve to cripple Dany's army in another Dance of Dragons, as well as increase the tension between Jon and her when it's revealed that he's actually her nephew and another possible threat to her rule, despite being the possible prophesied hero to save the world. Their interaction would be a lot less vital or interesting if Jon wasn't the designated hero of the high-fantasy section of the series and Dany wasn't the designated hero of the low-fantasy part of series. So, yeah, definitely more low fantasy than high fantasy, but the framework the story rests on IMO is very high fantasy.

***** Appreciate your thoughts, always good to see someone put the time into their argument!

Regarding good and evil, everything in game of thrones is about “good” vs “evil”. R.R. Martin did an interview I read a long time back, sadly can't find it at the moment, saying that he loved being subversive on how various themes are portrayed. So for example, a character who is good in one scene is the evil to another, constant flux.

Yes the over-riding theme, and one that if there TV show is your only exposure then may not be as obvious, is the alignment of good versus the ultimate evil. Everything else is the lead up, and let us not forget that the books are not even written yet. It will be interesting to see the divergence of the TV show storyline from that of the books.

Surely magic in LOTR is also pretty vague? Most people don't have exposure, wizards are rare, magic is more fairytale than everyday life. The children, skinchangers, he followers of the god of light etc. Some like the skinchangers are an explicit if specific use of magic, others like some of the actions by Melisandre you could say are more subtle. Don't forget that LoTR only has 5 wizards in existence. 5 magic users in the whole of history. Elves which are rarely seen, dwarfs who disappeared into their mines, hobbits who never leave the shire etc etc. Which leads into

Magical animals, if we are not counting the undead / wights then we cannot count the Nazgul, as they are also the undead. Dragons, white walkers, children of the forest, basilisk, wyverns, manticores,lizard-lion, shadowcat etc etc. Once again, less prevalent in the TV show, but instances are mentioned quick specifically in the books. As a world, middle earth is also pretty dominated by humans.

I'm not sure you can honestly say the scope is narrow for GoT, with wide ranging quests and journeys happening throughout and over large distances, pitched battles, going back to the good versus evil, we are often pushed to see one side as more good than another, yes this sometimes gets turned on its head however just because we do not question the facts we are given does not make the world change, it just shows our own limitations.

To save the world, first you must save yourselves.

The side of good must be created. This is a story about creating what good means, what does it look like? We must combat selfishness and petty ambition, no man is infallible to this. It is a story of humanity in that respect, political another, war and adventure, equality, ambition and fear. But despite this and all these themes, it is a story of good, versus evil.

We may just not have questioned ourselves enough or pushed for the answers yet. Content to let the story guide us, trick us and tease us.

The difference between high and low fantasy is not best judged by how clear the motivations are, but in the themes and topics presented within.

In this case, I stand by my original position of high fantasy.

****** I've always thought of the good vs evil in high fantasy to be a more overarching theme though. That is, good vs evil is more about an external struggle rather than an internal struggle like what you're saying about characters being good in one scene and evil in another. Sure, there are high fantasies like Tolkien's where a character has an internalised struggle of good and evil (e.g., Boromir), but there is always an external cause to it. Boromir is an archetypal hero of the fantasy genre, and it's clear that he is inherently a good person (though flawed, as all good characters are). He struggles with the evil presented by the temptation of Sauron's ring, but at the core of it, he is still a good person. There is nothing like the grey moralities of characters in GoT, which are present because that is /who they are/, rather than there existing a ring of evil to corrupt and twist them into behaving in an evil way. There is no struggle of good vs evil in that sense in GoT, only heavily flawed and controversial characters, imo.

True, everything else is a lead-up to the final confrontation between humanity (good) and the White Walkers (evil). But that everything else is a dominant part of the story, most of which has absolutely no relevance to the oncoming threat of the White Walkers. GoT is more focused on the low fantasy side of things (the politics, wars, power struggle, etc.) rather than the high fantasy side of things (the White Walkers). And while I'll agree there are elements of high fantasy in GoT, I can't help but consider GoT as /predominantly/ low fantasy because such a large portion of the storyline is low fantasy.

LoTR is written about an age where magic is passing into legend, I think. But while most people in LoTR haven't had exposure to fantastical elements (though they have had plenty of exposure to orcs), they still believe in them. It's a fact to the people of LoTR that wizards exist, Hobbits exist, elves exist, magic exists, etc. They are fully aware of the existence of the fantastical, and live in a world where it is accepted, where the magical are a good chunk of the population, if not the majority. In GoT, on the other hand, magic is something most don't believe in anymore, and there are very few magical creatures/beings left.

If we're talking about GoT's geographic scope, then yeah, it's pretty wide-ranging. I was referring more to the themes and storylines, though, which are more focused on the low fantasy side of things, and the great struggle of humanity vs the White Walkers is peripheral to much of the plot up to now.

It's interesting how different our interpretations of GoT are, maybe because I expect to see a low fantasy while you expect to see a high fantasy? But I don't think the story is about 'creating what good means' and debating what does good look like. For me, GoT is simply about power, and how far people will go to acquire it.

I think the biggest point of divergence in our interpretations is probably that I place more emphasis on the journey of the story, whereas you place more emphasis on the end-game of the story, if that makes sense. Though you've convinced me that it's at least not as definitively low fantasy as I thought, so I'll retract my initial comment. But just like you stand by your opinion that GoT is a high fantasy, I stand by mine that it's a low fantasy, with elements of high fantasy.
