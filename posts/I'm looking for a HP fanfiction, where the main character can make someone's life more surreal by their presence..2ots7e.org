I'm thinking of anything similar to both [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]].

Thanks!


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find them]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8509020/][A Handbook of Elf Psychology]] by evansentranced, where Harry decides that he is a magical elf, and he stands by that decision.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes... which you just have to read. Trust me.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6523209/][Death Eaters and Benadryl]] by crowlows19, where Harry is a bit of a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander][Cloudcuckoolander]].

*** I love Seventh Horcrux! I should have mentioned it, but thanks!

I've been meaning to read Fantastic Elves at some point, but I forgot about it. I guess that's what I'll be doing today.

I'll be sure to check out the last one too.

Thanks for the suggestions!

** You might want to consider stories with Luna. Also, many crack stories might match what you're looking for.

One that I recently re-read: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban]]
