Preferably ones where they aren't twins. Or enemies.


** Harry's adopted by Emmie Vance (who has a daughter) in linkffn(12205182).

I quite like it, it doesn't go into too much detail but therefore also avoids a lot of rehash. Dumbledore and the Order aren't portrayed in the best light but it largely avoids over-the-top bashing.

It's almost finished and updates are pretty regular.

  "All I can think of is Harry somewhere alone, all by himself for five years!" Emmeline confessed tearfully. "I promised Lily I'd look after him but I don't even know what continent he's on!" "Albus didn't tell you?" Minerva questioned in surprise. "He's with Lily's sister!" And Emmeline wouldn't very well leave her unofficial Godson with Petunia for the rest of his childhood...

"Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855): Harry got two new 'pseudo' sisters after time travels. They made lots of appearances in 2nd half. One was a jerk, and the other was creepy. Both sisters were on bad terms with each other.

"The World As We Knew It", linkffn(5511855): Harry had a sister in the new dimension, and he brought her back to the canon universe in the end.

** Linkao3(Red Sorrow) Harry has a half sister who was adopted by Snape when she was young (although she is also his actual daughter even though she doesn't know it in the beginning). Both have been marked by Voldemort but grew up separately. Has a lot of sweet sibling moments once they get to know each other.

This fic does focus quite a bit on father daughter relationship between Harry's sister and Snape. Also Snape is mostly in character so there is a lot tension and conflict going on.
