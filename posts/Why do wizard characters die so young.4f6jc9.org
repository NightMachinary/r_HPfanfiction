In most of the fanfiction I read where the story has an wizarding character die of old age, they always seem to die between 70-90 years old; and breaking 100 is pretty much a miracle. Which I find to be pretty absurd, as we frequently see wizarding characters that are still relatively spry at over 100 (Marchbanks, the Dumbledores, and potentially Slughorn are just a few).

So does anyone know why ff writers seem to give muggle lifespans to wizards?


** Because in Rowling's world (and fiction in general, to some extent), grandparents and older relatives are a complete nuisance to the story unless they serve a specific purpose. That's why Harry's grandparents, on both sides, conveniently died before his birth (or before his parents died) so he can be a poor lonely orphan whom no one takes care of.

*** Hell, we never even hear about any living Weasley relatives other than Aunt Muriel (and that squib cousin). I'd have to imagine that there would be some living, but they're never mentioned.

Draco's grandfather Abraxas is mentioned as having died around the sixth book. Unless he had Lucius at 60, he couldn't have been very old. Lucius was born in 1954, making him about 42 when his father died in 1996. Abraxas was probably at least 20 when Lucius was born, meaning that Abraxas may have only been 62ish when he died. I think that's a lower estimate, but it doesn't seem like he was very old.

I like the fanon idea that Abraxas was one of Riddle's earliest followers from their days in school. That would still only make Abraxas about 68 or so.

As others have mentioned, Narcissa's family wasn't that long lived either.

There is a bias towards people dying young due to violence though. It still doesn't seem to add up. Maybe it's more that wizards can live longer, but many still die at normal (for muggles) ages.

** JKR herself is very inconsistent about wizard aging.\\
Even discounting war victims, virtually noone /but/ Dumbledore and Marchbanks born in the 19th Century is shown as living in the time of Harry Potter, all having died before. Take the Black family: somehow after Sirius was incarcerated we are to assume every single member except for Sirius, Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix has died?\\
And additionally in the Pottermore short on the Quidditch thing she has already described Harry as having grey hair, barely in his 40s.

**** Did you get Dippet's age from the wiki? They used the screenshot of a Daily Prophet article from the second movie as a source. The oldest character mentioned in the books (who didn't use the Philosopher's Stone) is Bathilda Bagshot, who, being Gellert Grindelwald's aunt, was probably around 150 years old. And she clearly was a big exception

Albus, Aberforth, Slughorn and Muriel all seemed to be relatively fit at ages between 90 and 115.

So Wizards approximately seem reach about one and a half time the age of muggles.

It has to be mentioned though that Rowling is really bad at math, which explains most of the inconsistencies.

***** But they aren't exceptions though. In a population of ~6000, of which we see only ~300 and we see through the eyes of Harry, a young person (which inevitably means that most of the characters we meet are also young) and having a war shortly before canon events, having 8 characters confirmed to be over 100 years old and a few other possibilities (Slughorn, Bones, Flitwick) means that wizards almost certainly have a substantially longer lifespan than Muggles.

Even if we ignore that we have a biased perspective in Harry then the centenarian rate is ~2% compared to Muggle USA's 0.017%. The difference is far too big to discount.

****** Although we see more centenarians in the magical community, we don't see any magicals (except the Flamels) living past the normal human maximum (120s). This probably means that magicals have the same lifespan as non-magicals, but magical healing allows more magicals to achieve that lifespan.

******* Yes we do. Bathilda Bagshot was at least 140 by the time of her death (from Dark Magic not old age related illnesses, although Skeeter said she had gone mad by 1997) and Marchbanks was at least 125 at the end of canon (1998).

Still, that's only a decade or two. Could still be explained by good healing (as good as our medicine has become, perhaps regular humans still have more years in them with further improvements).

********* She was Grindelwald's Great Aunt (DH), therefore she was two Generations above Grindelwald who was 115-116 in 1998. Therefore 25 years older is a pretty conservative estimate, she could even be 60+ years older.

While that's an extremely reasonable guess, it's possible for a great-aunt to be /younger/ than their great-nephew. It requires some pretty young parentage for a few generations (or extended fertility spans) for someone to have a grandchild before their sister is born, but given the couple of 13yo parents we know of in the Black family tree and probable magical healing to help fertility, not impossible.

I'm saying you're /probably/ right, but that IMO it's not good enough to establish maximum age for magicals. We don't know if Gellert was visiting Bathilda when she was an adult or was a child living with family. /Probably/ an adult, but we don't know.

*********** If you read DH18 you'll see that while it is not explicitly stated it is *strongly* implied that she is well into adulthood by Dumbledore's childhood. It is stated that /she/ accepted Grindelwald into /her/ home. She tried to befriend Kendra when the Dumbledores moved to Godric's Hollow while she is a sort of mentor figure for Albus after being "impressed" by his first TT article. She also calls Grindelwald and Dumbledore "young boys".

The chance that she is young is as young as you say she could be given a. the implied textual evidence against it and b. the extraordinary circumstances required for her to be that young is so small that it can be disregarded.

In the end nothing is completely certain and you just have to discount possibilities with such small probabilities. (Unless of course new evidence comes to light which increases the probability of those possibilities.)

Also what 13 year-old parents are in the Black family tree?

************ Okay, but she could have been in her 20s when Albus/Gellert were in their teens which puts her only in her 120s when she died (admittedly by violence). There's still no /proof/ of magicals living past their 120s. Considering low probabilities, which is more likely -- that Bagshot died in in her 120s which is plausible given what we know, or magicals have a longer lifespan (an extraordinary claim, despite numerous fanfictions making it sound more likely)?

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pollux_Black][Pollux Black]] born in 1912, his daughter [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Walburga_Black][Walburga Black]] born in 1925.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cygnus_Black_III][Cygnus Black III]] was born in 1938, his daughter [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange][Bellatrix]] born in 1951.

I believe those dates came from the Black tapestry from the movies, which according to the wikia was based on a hand drawing by JKR. So author-canon, but not book-canon.

************* It isn't more plausible given what we know. You are assuming that wizards have the same lifespan as muggles and then requiring evidence to move from your assumed position. In fact there is little, if any, evidence, never mind proof, that wizards have the same lifespan as muggles.

On the contrary there is evidence, although no outright proof, that wizards have a longer lifespan. Therefore given the evidence we have (it pointing towards longer) we can say that it is far more probable that wizards have a longer lifespan than they do a similar one.

You cannot simply assume that what is true for muggles is true for wizards by default.

************** Of course I'm starting from the assumption that canon magicals have the same natural lifespan as nonmagicals. That is the logical place to start from (unless you've allowed fanfictions to skew your baseline assumptions). Asserting that they don't is an extraordinary claim and requires extraordinary evidence, which I haven't seen yet. Bagshot might support the theory (if she's much older than Albus and Gellert) and she might not (if she's only a decade older), so she's /irrelevant/ to the theory until her age is confirmed.

Anyone else?

** I never really noticed that. Most fanfics I read where people die it's because something killed them, not old age. But it could be a frame of reference thing, although 70-80 isn't an absurdly old age for muggles either. 90+ would be pushing it.

** There's a fair amount of next gen fics where grandparents die at what may be an early age by wizarding standards. In several fics that I've read, Andromeda gets killed off at 70ish so that Teddy spends more time with the Weasleys/Potters. It seems like Arthur dies somewhat often as well (more often than I would expect if wizards are supposed to live to 100).

As some people have mentioned, a lot of characters have died due to violence and not natural causes. There's the war with Grindelwald and both wars with Voldemort all within a span of about 60 years.
