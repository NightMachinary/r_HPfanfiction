I've asked for this fic on here before, but I'm trying again. There is an old fic where, in his 5th or 6th year, the order fakes Harry's death or disappearance and disguises him as a boy named Leo. He is sent to Hogwarts, but placed in Ginny and Luna's year to make it less likely that he will be recognized as Harry.

The story is Harry/Luna, I believe, and Harry becomes very close with Ginny and Luna. I believe Harry tries to tell Hermione and Ron who he is several times, but isn't able to (they don't like Leo, or don't pay attention, or something).

Remus is a father figure to Harry. Remus also has a wife and two sons and there is a side plot about them because Remus left them for a while after putting one of his sons at risk during a full moon.
