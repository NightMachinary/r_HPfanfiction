Are there any dimension travel fics? I just completed linkao3 (15465966) and I liked it a lot.


** Across the Universe :: linkffn(4180686). It's somewhat depressive, but a good read nonetheless. Harry travels to another dimension where his parents are alive, he has a younger brother, and Neville is the BWL.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] one of my fav Gen fics. Summary Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

*** Read the first chapter and good lord the people there are unrepentantly horrible and harry is a gigantic doormat.

Can you imagine winning a war then having to do it again and not trying to work against those that forced you to do so but seemingly have no remorse or care for you at all?

Harry even called snape sir and apologized to him and was completely cowed by dumbledore and the random oc..

Holy shit that was bad, I read one chapter and im furious lmao

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
