As I was looking up some Olympic AU fics in other fandoms in the spirit of Rio, I realized there are practically none for HP. This is doubly weird when you consider how huge the HP fanfic library is in comparison to others. In fact, total AUs have an extremely distinct lack of popularity altogether. Anyone have any theories on why this is?


** Because nonmagic fics take out the entire reason I got interested in HP and may as well be original fiction with recognizable names slapped on top.

*** Every good AU fic makes sure the characters maintain the same mannerisms and personalities. Some definitely are what you say, but the well regarded ones aren't.

**** The characters aren't the point of HP, it's the fantasy world they're in and the fantastic racism they're rebelling against.

***** If anything is the reason, I'd say this is it. TV shows in particular have quite a lot of AU fics, as the characters are what people identify with most.

** Actually, I mean, it depends where you're looking I guess? I follow a few authors on tumblr who write shorter fics but that are almost all modern AUs - provocative_envy I can think of off the top of my head but I know there are others. If you filter on ao3 by "alternate universe - non-magical" there are more than 700 fics. Granted, out of 103,000+ at the time of me making this post, that's not a lot at all (.6%?). I'm sure there are fics that aren't tagged that way but it's probably not a huge number. ff.net has a much bigger database overall (747k) but no way to really search for non-magical based fics.

So basically, I mean, they exist but there aren't a ton, but it might also have to do with the platforms they're published on.

And, because I think as the other commenter said, people come to this fandom for magic, so most of them probably consider that a requirement I would assume.

** I think people write HP fanfiction mostly because of the world. I don't see a lot of LOTR non-Middle Earth AUs, but then again, I don't read LOTR fanfics too often.

** I'm just not that interested in the characters themselves, i'm interested in the possibilities to explore with magic. With out magic, who would be the enemy? The magical government is interesting to explore, the muggle government, not so much. Without magic, its just a story about some kids in a boarding school. There are a few good fics where magic started to fade or disappeared entirely.

** I always wanted to read a non magical AU canon rehash with interesting ways of introducing characters and elements. I think it'd be interesting to see how creative people could be with bringing the important magical plot points into a non magic world.

*** Idk how you could really do Voldemort without magic... Quite a lot of it could be done but not a nigh invincible villain.

**** Well that's one of the things you'd have to write around and be clever about. When I was thinking about it I thought either a serial killer with an obsession with death kinda inspired by Jeffrey Dahmer but that's harder to include Death Eaters. So then I thought maybe a gangster-like Voldermort. Maybe instead of Harry Potter defeating him he was caught by the Police right as he was about to murder Harry, maybe his 6 horcruxs are 6 corrupt officials that are the reason he's released from jail. I dunno.

***** I thought that losing the magical parts wrecked a story, but then I read [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived.]]

Non-magic AU. Harworts is a school for spies, James Bond Style. Q-level gadgets, 60's spytech, Lord Deathstrike is a James Bond villain using experimental tech (cloning, high-tech weapons, memory-copies rather than soul anchors). The magical parts are nicely adapted, the changes fit, and the characters come alive.

It's also close to be finished, in year 7 - it has been updated 2 chapters per week, for 2 years, and they are now at the final fight. It doesn't follow canon very closely, and the plots behind the scenes are beautifully constructed.

****** I did start reading it and I did enjoy what I read however the breaking down of every single class and homework Hermione did and the amount of techno babble completely turned me off of it and didn't continue. Does any of that subside at all?

******* The homework and class subsides, though the classes tend to crop up at the start of each year. The technobabble is situational throughout the story.

** We must've gotten into HP fanfiction at different times. When I got into it back in the early 2000's, they were everywhere.
