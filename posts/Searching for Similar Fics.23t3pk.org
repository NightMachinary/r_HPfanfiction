** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived]] is a Harry/Fem!Harry pairing that kind of fits your criteria. I haven't read it in years so I can't guarantee its quality but I don't remember it being bad or anything. It doesn't have the sex stuff that twins had so if that's what you're looking for you might be disappointed.

** I'm writing a fic where Draco has a twin sister. If you are interested, since you said similar fics. It's at 27 chapters at the moment, with over 100k words. Starts 6th year, when Draco has taken the dark mark.

Edit: I know blatant self-promotion, but I figured why not since you seemed to like one twin fic.

*** Without blatant self promotion I wouldn't be reading your fic right now. Don't be shy about pimping your fics if they're relevant to the request!! :)
