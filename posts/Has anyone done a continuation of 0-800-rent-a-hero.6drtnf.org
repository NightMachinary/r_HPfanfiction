** After the author posted a patron (I think it was a patron) to be paid per chapter, the backlash led to the author essentially disappearing. I don't expect further updates, and I suspect it discourages other authors from pursuing continuations.

Sad, but justified.

**** I don't have a problem with writers being compensated for their time and effort if people are wiling to support via Patreon, or even accepting short (i.e one-shot) commissions. However, I don't agree with writers withholding fanfiction until they're paid, particularly when they've already published 20-odd chapters of the story.

***** I think current IP laws are archaic and 20 years is plenty of time for the original creator to benefit. I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to compensate writers that entertain me.

** I just wish the author would give an update telling us they abandoned it, that would be so much better than just ghosting.

*** I wonder if something happened there. Out of court settlements usually include some kind of NDA as far as I know.

Wut?

Anyway, it would have probably been a cease & desist and a fine. Smart lawyers wouldn't want to draw any additional attention to it.
