Ok so I do see this alot, but I don't understand it. I mean, if a fanfiction is entirely like canon, except with like one point of departure, or a gender change here or there, then it's not a total AU, which means the author IS NOT changing Voldemort's personality, motives, history, OR his thought processes. Which means: why /wouldn't/ Voldemort, with everything about him the same as in canon, still come up with the same idea to use the Tournament to his advantage, to use the Resurrection Ritual, and to do it in the graveyard just down the hill from his manor hideout? Why /wouldn't/ he make the very same canon decision to use Harry's blood for it, over the objections of Peter that he could use anyone else's?

If Voldemort is entirely as canon, then he WOULD make those same decisions, and come to those same conclusions.

So I don't get why people are always so upset about the event happening again. And even if it does happen again, I have seen a lot of them have a lot of differences in how it plays out in the details. So shouldn't people be happy about THAT?

I mean it'd be /out of character/ to just make Voldemort do something totally and randomly different, if his personality and thoughts are as canon, just because.


** A lot of the contempt for the scene occurs when there has been reason for change but we still see the same thing used. You've said Voldemort would use the same decisions and the like, but what if the AU had given him reason not to but the author still made scene happen? At what point did the author go from an original and somewhat interesting AU to a canon rehash fix it fic? We've read the graveyard scene. We've read it a thousand times. I don't want to read it again if you've given me a reason why it might not happen.

For example, Voldemort found out about the Triwizard because Peter Pettigrew met Bertha Jorkins in Albania. Bertha had been working on the event and knew about it. Voldemort tore the knowledge from her mind and made his convoluted plan. If the premise of your AU involves Pettigrew being caught then the graveyard scene shouldn't happen. If it happens then you've given up on being original and done something lazy. What about an AU where the events of the first book never happened. If Voldemort never discovered he couldn't touch Harry then he'd never have realised the power of taking Harry's blood over someone else's. Sure taking and killing Harry sends a statement but taking, for example Crouch snr would work to. Crouch was head of the DMLE and would have fought tooth and nail against Voldemort's efforts. Could Voldemort have collected the bones of his father before this all started and have them ready whenever he needed them?

Most people can agree that Voldemort's plan to get Harry to the graveyard was convoluted. This is often compensated by either fantastic writing like JKR had or by giving more details about why it needed to happen that way. Why not just kidnap Harry some other time? Was it just Voldemort's megalomania that made him want to kidnap Harry while everyone was watching from under Dumbledore's nose? If you make the stars align to make the graveyard scene happen then you've sabotaged an AU you've created. When it fits its fine but sometimes we basically have to reread exactly what happens in canon. It fits in something like linkffn(6256154) since there isn't a reason for it not to have happened but if you've made an AU where Harry has lived abroad for the first 14 years of his life to hide from Voldemort then you still have the graveyard scene go exactly the same way then you've wasted a chance to do something original.

****** That is semantics you are arguing but it has some validity. If Harry could "delude himself" into thinking that he is giving it freely (restrains are for some reason inconsequential) he theoretically could botch the ritual (if the author implies intent basis in magic).

But yeah you can delude yourself all you want but subconsciously he wouldnt want to give his blood.

******* No, you're missing the point.

Force is not decided on the side of the recipient of the force.

Force is not about not having consent. it's not even related except in that force can be used as a replacement to consent to obtain some goals.

I mean, take a beanbag, trying to put it into a container with an opening just a little too small. you can either force it in there, or gently ease it in through the opening. Nothing changes about the container nor beanbag, it is entirely a difference of approach.

forcefully taken isn't about harry's intent. it's pettigrew's intent.

******** I'm not entirely certain I can agree with this. Because the opposite is also true.

If Pettigrew deluded himself into thinking that he wasn't harming Harry - that it wasn't his intent in harming Harry - would that mean he didn't take it forcefully? Of course not.

I think intent from both sides matter.

Of course, this doesn't contradict your point that Harry himself could decide it wasn't forceful. Just that it's not ONLY Pettigrews intent that matters.

**** I can't think of any off the top of my head where it matters. I can remember a few if not name them where Harry was raised abroad until he's old enough to fight. Voldemort gets himself a new body and the story is focused on their conflict. Very little is normally said about the manner of Voldemort's return since the stories are more action focused.

** Looks like the previous replies have answered this but I'll add my own reason: because it was always such a crap plan even when Rowling used it.

I mean, Voldemort has had an agent in place all year, yet only puts a plan in motion when the whole school plus visitors is watching - and then wants to remain hidden? Hogsmeade isn't covered by the Hogwarts protections against apparition and portkeys, so Moody/Crouch could have slipped Harry a portkey at any point in a Hogsmeade visit, or side-alonged him away. Easy. Wait until Harry visits the toilet in the pub and they're off.

Voldemort's canon plan relied on luck and coincidence. There are far better plans to be written in fanfic, where it doesn't have to be the climax of a book.
