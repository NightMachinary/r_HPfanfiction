:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've found it on Wattpad but it only goes to chapter 19. I'm familiar with the drama surrounding it. It seems that it was available as a PDF on Goodreads about 5 years ago but that has disappeared. Does this fic appear anywhere in its entirety?


** Haven't found it in a quick search, but [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/documents/1295007758books/10219830.pdf][here]] is part 2 of the series in case you end up finding part 1.

EDIT: Nevermind, just had to look a bit deeper, here it is: [[https://idoc.pub/download/dumbledores-army-and-the-year-of-darkness-dvlrggw3gz4z]]

Never read it so no idea really, but it ends with "THE END" so I assume everything is there.
