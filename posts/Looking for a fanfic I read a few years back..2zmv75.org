I think it started quit a few years after last book but does not follow the ending as all 3 were still single,(although H/H got together at first ch. I think) harry and ron are star quidditch players while Hermione is a journalist, either all three of them rented a apartment or just Harry and Hermione.

It start out as kind of adult fan fic where Harry and Hermione went for dinner, kissed, and then later having sex, but from second chapter it seems there is a bigger and some enemy in shadow.

Doesn't follow the plot of last few books but well written.

It's old, it's either in progress or completed around 08-09

Thanks in advance!
