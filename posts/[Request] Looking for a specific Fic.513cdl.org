The fic I'm looking for is one where Harry is bitten and turned into a werewolf however it turns out he has no problem with control. Ron is pretty understanding of the situation but Hermione keeps freaking out about Harry losing control and doing something stupid.


** I think I know which one you are talking about, it's written by the same guy who wrote the 2 or 3 fics where Harry goes back in time and raises Tom riddle Jr to be a nice kid and fights in ww2, I think the guys name is dobbyelflord, give me a second and I'll try to find it.

*** It's not that one but that is a great one! If I'm remembering right, Ron realizes that Harry does have control and that it's through his emotions. Hermione keeps thinking he's losing control every time he's angry or feels some other strong emotion.
