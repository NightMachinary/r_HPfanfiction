** OK, this fic (Phoenix by Keira Marcos) was taken down until she completes it, but I will post the actual scene(s):

#+begin_quote
  Dobby appeared with a blanket and tucked it around Harry with a frown.

  “I leave my Harry Potter alone with Dumbles for just a few days and look what happens,” Dobby said with a sigh and a severe shake of his head. The elf inclined his head. “Dumbles be removing ward on Muggle house?”

  Dumbledore looked at the elf over his glasses. “As a matter of a fact I did.”

  “Good. Dobby not being able to get proper revenge with protections in place,” the elf cracked his knuckles and popped away without another word.

  Sirius looked at Dumbledore then at Amelia Bones who had followed them into the office. “Is that something we should worry about?”

  “Whatever he does to them, they deserve,” Dumbledore said.
#+end_quote

and, later in the same fic:

#+begin_quote
  Albus sighed. “Harry, my boy, call your elf.”

  “Dobby.” The elf appeared immediately. He was dressed in a pair of combat boots and a miniature set of military fatigues.

  “What...” Minerva huffed and turned to Harry.

  “Don't look at me like that,” Harry protested. “He's on a /mission/ and needed a proper uniform for it.”

  “You should see his ninja outfit,” Zale confided. “It's great.”

  “Dobby be very stealthy ninja,” the elf declared.

** A great one from the Parody Peggy Sue fic /Oh God, Not Again!/

Harry's marginally friendly with Draco in this fic and he asks him to ask Dobby to not "try to save his life" or "get him sent home."

Draco, bewildered, does so, but there's still the Rogue Bludger incident.

/"I thought Draco asked you not to save my life or get me sent home!"/

/"Debby wasn't trying to save Harry Potter's life, sir. Debby was trying to break Harry Potter's arm."/

** Runic Animagi (one of the better Harry/Daphne contract fics) has several rather amusing moments between Harry and Dobby, mostly while they're both high as a kite on pot.

  WIP. PostOotP. Harry gave his life to defeat Voldemort. So what should he do now? Hop through time with Dobby on some zany misadventures, of course. As if there really was an alternative.

** I'm not a fan of Dobby (My first thought about his death was "Thank God."), so I tend to skip over any mention of him in a fic.

That said, my favourite Dobby scene is actually from /The Warp Zone/'s "If Harry Potter had Facebook". It's a video, not a fic, but it's the only time I've ever been entertained by Dobby.

** The number of times I have seen 'Dobby fucking Narcissa' scenes is incredible. It somehow never failed to remind me of the time Caretaker Jimmy was found screwing the Nurse by the matron of my old orphanage. Poor Jimmy was only 3 feet tall, but he had a huge heart. And apparently a huge dick because holy fuck did the Nurse not stop gushing and giggling about him to anyone who would listen. Like I get it that you had a great experience and you wanted to share your joy with other people, but I was a 10 year old for heaven's sake! I did not need to hear about how Jimmy touched all the right spots at the right times. TMI woman! TMI!

Anyway, house elves and humans fucking is funny right? Or am I the only freak here that likes laughing at interspecies banging.
