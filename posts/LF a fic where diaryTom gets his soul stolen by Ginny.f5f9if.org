** What is it with the racism against people with red hair on the fandom ? Downvoted for that. Consider rethinking posting things like this. It is offensive to the HP fans with red hair.

*** Ginger is not a Race

A hair colour is not a race, you can not be racist to an hair colour nor can you be racist to a Eye colour you can walk arround muttering how terrible the greenies are to your hearts content

and I doubt gingers have thin enough skin to be offended by such comments anyway

*** Racism? Really?

I hope you left this

- /s

behind when posting.

If not... Do you think red hair is a race now?

But also, if anything the OP is requesting a fic that implies folks with red hair are STRONGER and MORE POWERFUL as they have the blood of Prometheus in them. Its not even discrimination, much less racism.

**** To be fair, that idea of Gingers having no soul isnt correct to begin with. I don't mean literally. I mean that the lore is that Gingers dont have a human soul because they have the blood of a god/titan in them and therefor they have a different "essence".

Think of it as simply a different type of soul, full of the power and emotions of a god.

***** Reread that answer, it said similar to racism, not actual racism. The word racism requires a Race, so it have nothing to do with race, red hair is hair color, the phenomenon is called gingerism, It used to be an existing Bigotry, but in 21 century it's a Meme.

****** I was replying to your ‚Äúyou bloody American!‚Äù not the OP.

America is a mishmash of races so of course it's not racism, more like nationalism.

******* That was not an anti-American comment, I am simply joking about how for some american everything is about Race, like it's the most important thing in the world. probably should add a (/s) but whatever.

*** I don't think they meant to be racist. They were, I suppose, stereotyping that redhead=fiery personality. But, Ginny is fiery and just happens to be a redhead so...I think it would be interesting to see this crack!fic, personally. I personally love redheads, fiery or not.
