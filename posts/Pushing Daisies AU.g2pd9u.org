You're telling me Harry Potter has access to a ring that brings back the spirit of dead and he /doesn't/ use it to solve murders and bake pies using fruit necromancy??? Tragic. Someone please rectify this at once.

Also would be nice if Harry's Master of Death powers had some drawbacks like Ned's, where you can only revive someone for one minute or someone else dies in their place.

And Ned totally brings his dog back to life, which is 100% something Harry would do to Hedwig.


** Linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin) has Harry summon the Hogwarts Founders so that they can teach him how to rebuild and restore the castle and wards, and remake the Sorting Hat after the 2nd war.

Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) has Harry really explore death and the afterlife using the Stone. He, later, also uses it along with his ability to see magic and souls and his Transfiguration skills, to resurrect people.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I can see a Hermione that's obsessed with justice dragging Harry along for every mysterious death that occurs in Magical Britain.

** If you think Harry would use the Stone while knowing it caused death, we probably didn't read the same series.

Also, resurrection is impossible. That's kinda the point.

*** Not that I necessarily disagree with any of your points, but OP /was/ asking for an AU.

In Pushing Daisies, only equivalent things die in place of what gets revived, so it's not too much of a tweak in Harry's personality for him to not mind the death of a random animal in exchange for Hedwig (or, he could just have someone cast a 'preservation charm' and revive her once he's in a chicken coop or something so that he can have a hearty supper). Changing the nature of one of the Hallows isn't exactly breaking new ground either when it comes to AU fanfiction.
