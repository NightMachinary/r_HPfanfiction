Petunia feels that Harry would be better off without his magic so that he won't have to attend Hogwarts and die like her sister. A ruined childhood is small price paid in exchange for a child's death averted. Vernon agrees even though he finds it distasteful.

+++

It would be more interesting if The Greater Good permeates more into the Dursley family dynamic - Vernon cuts down on his weight to avert high obesity death risk, Petunia takes a job for increased financial security, etc.

~~~

EDIT: More AU elements - the Dursley family and Harry are even more affected by the ideal of Greater Good, but it doesn't make them abusive. Rather than resort to abuse, the Dursleys do their very best so that Harry doesn't use accidental magic (There is 'good' in the Greater Good, after all).

- Harry is taught to be stoic and logical, and hobbies that train that mindset are encouraged (eg. chess/ programming, etc.)

- Petunia tries to scare harry straight by telling him how Lily got married right after Hogwarts ended, got caught up in a war and was finally killed by a superpowered serial killer - and how Harry would have suffered the same fate if not for a miracle.

- Petunia discourages Harry from joining the Wizarding World by mentioning his prospects there. About how the Wizarding World was insular, how Lily did not have many job prospects either in the Wizarding World (due to being muggleborn) or the Mundane World (due to having skipped 7 years of schooling) and as Petunia surmises, married early so that she would have some doors opened to her.

- Everyone in the Dursley Family is influenced by the ideal of the Greater Good - but what exactly is this Greater Good? Just whose Greater Good are they willing to sacrifice themselves to protect? ...Of course, it is Harry.


** "It's for the Greater Good that everybody gets along..." goes on a large academic streak. Deletes racism. Proves gingers have souls. And accidentally discovers that he has a piece of soul stuck on him. "The Greater Good doesn't let someone suffer like this." and goes on a misunderstood quest to release the pieces from their suffering.

Along the way Harry discovers that magic can be nice and decides that for the greater good, EVERYBODY should have magic. And does it.

Immediately afterward, the ghost of Richard Nixon sits Harry down and tells him to stop acting like such a commie.

** Ya know. I can't remember it well, but I think I recall a fic where due to those blood wards conflicting with Lily's protection. It ended up with a Gaara situation where /any/ harm towards Harry was met with immediate, direct, and downright vicious retribution.

Not sure how or why your prompt made me think of it. Your prompt is interesting, but would it be tied to the house, or /Harry/ who is technically the focus of the wards being the only magical on the residence. I.E, would Harry inadvertently spread the notion of the greater good simply by existing? It's an interesting notion and if I had any ability to actually write I'd give it a whirl. Sadly, I don't but I can give an upvote for a good prompt.

so. i know this isnt what you meant. and the rest of the post made this better.

but my first thought was autism ‚Äútherapy‚Äù where they teach/abuse autistic kids to stop being autistic.

------------------------

ok. onto the less depressing stuff. the explanation made this much better

i have to go do something rn, but I'm probably gonna come back in a bit.

i did read a fic where harry became a competitive ballroom dancer. it was different but kinda similar. idk if i can find it again. but its on ao3 if someone else want to look.

------------------------

edit: I'm back. ok. actual thoughts.

note these are all separate thoughts

Harry, raised to be a rational, free thinking human being, would question e v e r y t h i n g about the wizarding world. because a lot of stuff just doesnt make a whole lot of sense. ‚Äúprofessor what the fuck?‚Äù

he very well might talk voldemort to death. it'd be funny if he took interest in poli sci/culture studies and frequently talks about voldemort and fascism, xenophobia etc and what that effects and does to a society. everyone hates it. especially dumblydore

harry learns everything about magic with the goal to rationalise it. he figures out how it works and talks circles around his professors, dumbledore, voldemort.

harry casually using magic like baby anakin used the force. all subtle and no one /knows/ but its helping him do stuff.

someone tells him he's magic and he expresses pure d i s g u s t. he's been told what happened to his parents and sees absolutely nothing good of it.

** On that dreary day they found Harry, Vernon was startled to find himself cotemplating a diet. He had always held a deep distrust for people who were overly inclined to diet, but just the once he skipped on droopy, miserable eggs that seemed to beg for him to put them out of their misery, and stuck to toast. At least toast didn't look up at you.

Petunia was shocked to find herself planning a shopping trip to buy baby Harry babythings, before rationalising she didn't want the neighbours thinking she couldn't take care of two kids. Imagine the gossip...

If Dudley thought anything, it went unnoticed.

When they had to go to school the Dursleys used their influence and money to make sure Harry and Dudley had good friends. The more attachments Harry had in the Muggle world, Petunia reasoned, the less chance he'd want to go into a all-new world were he didn't know anyone and couldn't contact his old friends. Every day after school they got a nice snack and a set homework time, so they'd have good grades and prospects. Then they'd go to their friends until dinner. Later, Dudley received more help with his homework in that time. Harry didn't need it.

They tried valiantly to instill a love of chess or programming in him, but that didn't entirely work out. Sci-fi was however a big hit, and soon enough they had seen most sci-fi movies in the video store (neither of them was big on books, although they liked comics well enough).

Petunia told them about Lily, James and Snape, albeit with some reluctant. She said Snape had stolen her sister away, had told her about this brilliant world, induced her into the 'cult' (she spit out that bit with particular venom), how she met all sorts of people and wouldn't play with any other kids anymore... (she made no mention of the letter, of course), how, just when she thought it was over and her sister would find a nice place in the muggleworld, with a reconciliation in sight, she was told her sister had to hide away, under the best protections Dumbledore had to offer, that he was the best of the best and she'd be totally safe in his hands. And how he had failed in his duties, ruthlessly sacrificing /her sister/...

When the letters came, Harry and Petunia agreed that he could go, as long as he was home every vacation without fail, and that he had to do muggle homework as well and he better be on top of it or they'd pull him straight out.

The end of the first year makes him doubts if he wants to return to a school with a headmaster who would test him, but he goes anyway. If only because Dumbledore had told him that he hadn't been ruthlessly sacrificing Lily and that he regretted it went that way, but there hadn't been anything he could do. Plus, Hermione was great at helping him with homework, and Ron was a really good friend.

Everything is alright until fourth year, where he tries to pull out of the tournament (it doesn't work), and neglects his muggle homework. The Dursleys make spirited attempts to pull him out, but they get obliviated by Mad-eye before anyone can stop them.

The beginning of fifth year marks the point where Harry almost doesn't go to Hogwarts. The Dursley's are incredibly grateful to Harry for saving his nephew, of course, but they are painfully aware that if someone came to break Harry's wand, things could get nasty. Althought they want to run, Harry says that that'd be a bad idea, with Dementors out and about like that. So they stay and meet the Order and are assured of Harry's safety with them. The Order doesn't /think/ there are any more Dementors roaming free, but just in case Lupin stays with them.

The Dursley's do not like that Harry goes Horcruxhunting to, in the words of Vernon, 'fullfill a daft old man's last request,' but they appreciate Harry is old enough to think for himself now.

** The whole "Greater Good" nonsense is mostly just Fanon nonsense. Grindelwald actually did prescribe to such an ideology; but there's no evidence Dumbledore still had sympathies to the concept after his confrontation with Grindelwald.

In fact throughout the books we clearly see the opposite occurring. With Dumbledore actively avoiding the best course of action, for the sake of individuals livelihoods.

Evil, or manipulative Dumbledore is purely a result of mostly incompetent authors looking at plot holes in the original story; and then selectively applying often times flawed logic to build their preferred narrative(Simultaneously destroying any Narrative significance, and making the plot holes even worse in the process).
