Requirements: Hermione Granger is sorted into Ravenclaw House (though the sorting itself need not be portrayed in the fic)

Nice to have:

- Harry sorted into a house other than Ravenclaw
- Harry and Hermione eventually become friends or friendly rivals, but this happens in a realistic way

Nice to NOT have:

- Dumbledore bashing
- Hermione paired with people who are Death Eaters in canon
- WBWL

Basically as [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] put it in a previous thread, '[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2tnica/looking_for_ravenclawhermione_fanfiction/coacl4k/][What I'd like to see is fic that's essentially "Applied Cultural Anthropology, Ravenclaw Mode", where Hermione develops and thrives independently of Harry, only intersecting with his adventures occasionally.]]'


** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) updates very slowly but is basically what HPMOR /should/ have been.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
