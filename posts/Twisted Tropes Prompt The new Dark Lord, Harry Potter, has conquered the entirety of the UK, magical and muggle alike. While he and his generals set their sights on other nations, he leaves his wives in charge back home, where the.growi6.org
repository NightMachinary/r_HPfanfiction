Basically, a harem fic that doesn't include smut or "Oh, he has so many hot identical women in his bed, he's so manly!" Rather, it focuses on the inner politics between the cruel, intelligent women who would willingly join and marry a brutal dictator as they stamp out any rebellion against their husband and empire. Emphasis on intrigue as they backstab each other to subtly increase their own position and power. Strong emphasis on how each of these women has their own strengths, weaknesses, and agenda, as opposed to the usual harem fics where they are all the same sex-crazed character with different names. Harry himself should only ever be in the background, off waging war on other places.

Bonus points if his wives are less common pairings, instead of the typical Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Daphne.

Edit due to bot: Apparently I should clarify that this would be when they are all adults, post-war, having been out of Hogwarts for some time before they took power, yadda, yadda, yadda.

** This is great. I am imagining a Chinese imperial consort type system with the wives all trying to get their children as the rightful heir to the Heavenly Emporer, Harry Potter.

** Holy shit, what a post!!

I might use it for myself one day, adding my own twist if course.

I feel like Harry should still have an influence, like if you know BNHA Endevour and how he is treated could be interesting.

Harry could have spent his whole life trying to catch up to Dumbledore and his crazy power which is why he becomes a dictator. He doesn't want another kid try to live up to humongous expectations and fall short so in a twisted way he wages war to get rid of those expectations.

I would also add an arc featuring all his children were they battle to be his heir, and the won that comes 2and would be the one to kill Harry at the end as poetic justice or something.

Also fuck the bot!

*** You're welcome to the idea and your spin on it, just send me a link if you ever do use it.

In my mind, Harry's direct presence would derail the plot too much. It's not about him because he's already won the war in Britain and moved on to conquer other countries. But usually in the fics that have a dark, conquering Harry, the aftermath isn't explored well, if at all. On top of that, the harem fic concept has so much potential beyond power fantasy and wish fulfillment for teenage boys. Especially with magic involved.

The kind of women who would tolerate their husband having a harem just because of the political power it grants them personally are not kind, loving angels. They are ambitious, power-hungry, and most likely quite vicious. The sort of power dynamics between them when they are left behind to maintain control would be fascinating. They are forced to work together to some degree to keep order, but at the same time, each wants to come out at the top of the hierarchy. If Harry is there as King, or Emperor, or whatever other title, the story is forced to revolve around their interactions with him. With him absent, the political intrigue between his wives is more able to hold focus.

As for why he himself would be willing to have to deal with multiple cruel, cunning wives? If they're forced to fight amongst themselves for dominance, they have less time to plot against him. The same would apply when he fathered heirs. He would want as many children as possible so as to keep them fighting each other and not him. For someone like that, multiple wives and many children isn't wish fulfillment... It's pragmatism.

**** You are right of course, and your story if it is incredible and I would love to read it.

You have clearly put a lot of thought Into this, and while my spin on your idea goes in a different direction with different characters you really should write man!

You can do It if you've thought if this brilliant concept, and you should be proud!

And I will start the first couple chapters tonight, hopefully if I do constant writing for the next couple weeks I can a totally start to post it!

** Doesn't really feel like you've twisted the trope all that much. Ultimately it's still ultra powerful Harry with his harem of stunning super witches. The only real difference is that you've given the witches a side plot to entertain themselves with while Harry is off conquering the world.

More subversive, I think, would be if the harem of witches resented Harry for essentially enslaving them and worked together to bring him down.

*** Hmmm... I see your point, even if I don't necessarily agree. However, if more subversive is your taste, I'd like to offer an alternative. The women knocked Harry off years ago, and have been ruling in his name, 1984 Big Brother style. He's always off "at war", leaving them in charge and no one questioning it. They hype him up to the population as a super powerful dark wizard who it is pointless to resist, but in reality he's a set of bones six feet under.

** Hermione: In charge of running the muggle side of things. As far as muggles know, she's an important advisor to the (imperiused) Prime Minister.

Luna: Propaganda and "News".

Ginny: Sports and Entertainment. Works closely with Luna to keep the magical population happy and loyal.

Tonks: Law Enforcement for catching criminals and crushing dissidents.

Daphne: Economics and Taxes. Gotta keep the country running.

Fleur: International diplomacy. Can't be at war with everyone.

** I really like the idea of turning harem fics on there heads. Imagine a war between harrys harem and the death eaters. Just women and death eaters alike getting blown up from curses and spells while harry and voldy duke it out. Even better if harry cares for his harem as much as voldy cares for his death eaters...

Maybe some form of dick imperious based harem ship?

You do not even have to include smut in this story.
