** linkffn(The Closer You Look by Tony Samuels) has Harry using a deck of cards as a magical focus. I remember him teleporting with them, but I don't remember McGonagall being teleported. It's been a while since I read it, though.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
