I am a Harmione shipper and I love the fanfics in which they get together during the tri-wizard tournament. Recommend some fics of such. I like some bashing of Ron and Dumbles. Not sure about Ginny though. Harry should be more powerful.

I appreciate if the fics continue further after GoF to OoTP.

I also don't mind a time-travel redo fic. I only want a fanfic of Harry and Hermione during GoF timeline.

*** I've read that one. Everything in that one seems to be a bit forced. I mean, Harry and Hermione suddenly turning rebellious, Flitwick's relationship with Harry, these thinks lack of ground work. They suddenly seemed to be forced. I stopped reading it after half.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
