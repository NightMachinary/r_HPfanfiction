**** Click on 'Submit Text' on the right-hand side of the screen (in between two ads if you don't have adblock or Reddit premium). Then type in "LF a time-travelling Harry fic" into 'Title' and post a description of the fic you're looking for into 'Text'. You can copy and paste the description of what you posted on harrypotterfanfiction into 'Text' if you want. Once you submit, flair your post as 'What's that fic?'
