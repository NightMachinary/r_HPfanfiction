Looking for good fics about the Marauders, haven't read any so feel free to recommend anything well known/must-read.

I'd prefer if it's mostly gen with focus on friendship rather than romance. It can be only about them or Harry travelling in time but they should be still young at Hogwarts or pre-Hogwarts if that's even a thing.

Thanks in advance!


** This hits the criteria! Lily & Sirius friendship mostly.

It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] by TheDivineComedian) is a great one. It's categorizes as shipping, but it's more the set up for a romance than anything else. It takes place when they're in school.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] by TheDivineComedian) is a Marauders fic during the first war.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
