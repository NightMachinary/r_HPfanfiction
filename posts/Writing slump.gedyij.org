I'm in such the mood to write fanfiction but just can't think of anything to write. Gah! I used to play a prompt game (one word or sentence) with a friend but haven't done that in ages. How do you get out of your slumps?

** I get that feeling even outside of fanfiction. It especially sucks when you combine it with ADD.

Back when I was in undergrad, if I had a really, really bad slump, I just walked away for a day or two. If I tried to force it, it only got worse. Eventually I'd start hyperfocusing again and be able to redirect it to writing.

**** No problem!

The trick with ADHD is to make your symptoms work for you instead of against you. I was diagnosed young, so I'm able to recognize certain patterns and know when my medication is going to just not work for the day. When you know the hyperfocus is coming, position yourself so it'll result in something you need to get done. I managed to bang out a whole 30-page research paper in one day by doing that once.

It's also best to not force it when you're in a period where you just can't pay attention. Forcing it only makes it worse.

And if you're like me and on timed medication, a cup of coffee can provide a short boost if your medication turns off for the day. Mine usually lasts eight hours but I can get another hour or two if I have some regular coffee.
