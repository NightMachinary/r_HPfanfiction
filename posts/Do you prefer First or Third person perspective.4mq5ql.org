Fics in first person ("I ran down the hallway, my pet can following behind me.") can more easily express the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist, and maintain a coherent perspective. Additionally, mental things like depression, confusion, and more exotic conditions are often better explored from the inside.

Fics in third person perspective ("Harry jogged down the hallway, Crookshanks following closely at his heels.") can more easily switch perspective, and give an outside view on the protagonist. Pronouns can get messy, especially when weird things start happening.

The vast majority of HP fanfiction in in third-person perspective, as is the canon Harry Potter series.

Which do you prefer to read, and why?


** I'll take the average Third Person over the average First Person any day. Conversely, I'll take a well-written First Person over a well-written Third Person 100% of the time.

I understand why people prefer third person to first person, but I'm quite fond of the present tense and the informal manner of prose: it fosters a greater understanding of the character in question, or gives you greater insight into their psyche than you would had a faceless narrator told you how they feel a certain event, character, etc. When done right, first person feels like a conversation between protagonist and reader; like you're at a bar sharing drinks and exchanging stories. You get more of the character's voice than you ever would otherwise, and IMHO that's far more engaging than anything third person can throw at a reader. But, generally speaking, first person and third person have their own merits and don't need to fight against each other. First person is generally a much stronger POV for use in comedies or character-driven stories, while third person tends to be more effective in event/plot-driven stories, such as speculative fantasies and sci-fi.

The issue ultimately is that first person is far harder to master than third person, which is why most might seem a little lacking compared to their third person competitors.

** First-person works better for a more joking tone, where it feels like the main character is talking to you. It's also better for unreliable narrator shenanigans, where the reader's viewpoint is confined to what the character can see /and it's clear that the character might be mislead/tricked/. Of course, you can do this in third person as well, but it's less effective imo. It's hard to put into words, but read the first chapter of linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by JBern) and you should see what I mean.

Third-person is easier to do well, as it's more common (canon is third person, but so are most other published stories). You don't constantly have to filter events through what the protagonist can see and what they'd pay attention to.

As long as the author sticks to one (or has /all/ the transitions make sense and be clearly marked, such as a chapter that's a diary page from a character - switching to first person - and then continuing the story in third person afterwards) I don't mind which they use.

In a very few cases, first person is a major part of the story's flow. For example, linkffn(Pedestal by DigitalSkitty) [a Pokemon fanfic] wouldn't be as good in third person. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] [an original superhero webfiction] would be a lot worse, as a lot of the impact comes from the first-person perspective on events (the fight against Lung, for example, has a lot more emotional impact when you're looking through the eyes of a frightened girl, way out of her depth, trying to use insects to fight a half-dragon creature than if you're watching from the sidelines, as it were, even if you're still rooting for the same side).

As you can see, for good examples of first-person stories that immediately spring to mind I've had to go outside the Harry Potter fandom - it's that rare to find one that's not only well done, but couldn't be done as well in third person.

** Let us make a distinction between first person *past* tense and first person *present*. Good fanfics written in first person present tense are vanishingly rare, because they are surely written as a creepy self-insert for the author. It takes an exceptional author to plan well enough for this style of writing.

First person past can be done well, because you don't actually have to insert yourself in the place of the character. It can feel more like someone relating a story to you: "I poked my head around the corner and there he was, wand already drawn and mirthful gaze challenging me." It also helps when the author isn't afraid to drop the pronoun "I" when it's implied by context, which English is totally cool with.

In general, first person is difficult for most writers because it puts explicit limits on how time can flow, and also it makes writing suspense hard, because the reader knows everything the narrator knows, and nothing else. You can't see the characters walking into a trap and scream "No!"

Character exposition is hard to do well using first person narration because it's just awkward as hell for the narrator to describe themselves, "Harry looks into my shining blue eyes, before trailing his gaze across my trim hourglass figure, while his free hand gently teases my luxurious honey-blonde curls." Fucking /no thanks/.

There's a reason the majority of fiction is written in third person. It's way easier to paint a vivid picture of a world without sounding slightly strange.

This is true. I think it's also the case with present tense versus past tense; present is more "exposing" of people's flaws in writing.

** I think that first person can work, and it can even engage the reader more than a third-person fic with a similar plot, but whereas a third-person story can have any set of protagonists, the first person' story /requires/ that the point-of-view character be someone inside whose head you are willing to spend the whole story. It doesn't have to be a sympathetic point of view (think Humbert Humbert from /Lolita/), but it has to be interesting. Now, different things are interesting to different people. Those who want to spend several novels inside Bella Swan's head might not want to spend the time inside Taylor Hebert's, and vice versa. They are also situational. Relatively few people would want to spend a slice-of-life story inside the head of a Bella Swan who /doesn't/ meet vampires or a Taylor Hebert who /doesn't/ trigger.

With all that in mind, I don't know whether there are any characters in HP canon that are well suited. Harry Potter --- our everyman hero --- doesn't strike me as someone with a rich inner world; his motivations and plans are simple, and there is little thoughtfulness or hesitancy to him. This is not a strike against his character at all: if he were a character in a Shakespearean play, he might get the part of a decent, solid type like Horatio (from /Hamlet/). But he would get no soliloquies.

Every other canon character with even a vaguely defined personality has the problem that, because /canon/ is from Harry's point of view, and because the Harry--Voldemort conflict is central to the series, unless it's a pretty heavy AU, time-travel, or some other way to break out of the canon setting and general plot, they and the insides of their head aren't going to be central to the A-Plot; but breaking out of the canon setting and general outline ups the difficulty level of writing the fic.

** Third person is my preferred option. I feel that Third Person can accomplish anything a First Person Perspective can while being far less intrusive to the established style of the cannon.

On a mechanical level Third Person also removes the over dependants on "I", I did this, I saw that, I thought this, I arrived at... It's lazy writing. You can structure all those events in more interesting a varied ways in Third Person .

I also dislike the tense that First Person is written in. Third Person is all in past tense; he opened the door, he ran down the hall, he flew on his broom. I find it a more elegant form of writing as the First Person I've seen in the Fic community all has this breathless present tense style.

** I love writing in first person because I enjoy narrowing the perspective of my stories and allowing my readers' imaginations fill in the blanks (incorrectly or correctly though, is the game!). However, I much rather read fics in third person due to the opposite. In third person it is much easier to build expansive, detailed worlds because you are not limited to one person's sight/knowledge.

** I think the question of person is partially dependent on the question of tense. First-person is harder to do, IMO, but it can be much more "personal"-feeling, more intimate, perhaps. It tends to work better in the past tense because first-person present tense is often perceived as a bit gimmicky (think of all those edgy YA novels that try to be cool and do this), but of course, there are good stories in first-person present tense out there.

Third person, on the other hand, can work well with either tense. If it's present-tense, it can be wonderfully immediate and dynamic, just as first-person can be, but a bit more "removed" from the action on the whole, and it inherently tends to have less bias towards specific characters' perspectives. Third-person past tense is perhaps the most neutral, the most "classic", because it's the one that's used the most often, and it can feel much less intimate than any of the others can. But of course, thousands and thousands of great stories are written in third-person past tense.

Second-person writing, I think, usually only works well in very short fics or vignettes, and it's very hard to really write it effectively without being too gimmicky. But if it's well-written, the tense doesn't matter.

** A good writer can have a lot of fun with first person. It can read with great rhythm and works best with fics that can drop one liners well. A bad first person fic will get cutesy and tends to reveal OOC traits.

Third person on the other hand can be bad because sometimes the writer (including myself) has a hard time figuring out how deep you can get into a person's thoughts. This is where you get writers using the single quote 'thought bubbles' and combined with the omniscient narrator getting into everyone's heads this can get messy.

Overall I tend to prefer third person. I think it's because it's easy for an inexperienced writer to lose control of their character and introduce their own opinions. Less danger of of that with third person.
