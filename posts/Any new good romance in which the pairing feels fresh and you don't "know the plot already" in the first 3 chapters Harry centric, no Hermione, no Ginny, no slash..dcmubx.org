** I'd like this, too - I hate "I changed the pairing for *INSERT CHARACTER* but the plot stays the same!"...fuck this, I hate canon-rehashes in general :(

I accept using certain scenes (like say the troll to introduce Hermione or Harry getting the firebolt - but over all I don't want to read canon, or I'd re-read the books themselves!)
