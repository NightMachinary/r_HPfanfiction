:END:
Hey all

I was reading a fanfic last night about Harry Potter. He was going into his first year, but he was raised by Petunia and her husband (not Vernon, another guy whose name I forget). Harry had 2 hyphenated last names, his name went something like Harry James-Potter ???-a name with a V, Vennes or something?. The story was heavily centred around using science and deductive logic to dismantle / take advantage of the wizarding world. A few examples of that are it discussed using currency arbitrage between wizarding currency and gold/silver, and trying to determine what spells were doing by explaining them with physics. Harry was clearly much much smarter than an average 11 year old, he was written as a sort of savant in that regard. It was hosted on a site the writer made, but I also saw references saying it was posted on fanfiction.net. Any help finding it would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
