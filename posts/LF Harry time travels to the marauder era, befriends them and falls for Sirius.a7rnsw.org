First post here, sorry if I do this incorrectly.

I'm looking for a fanfic similar to the first parts of Choosing to change by SiriuslyUnreal, where Harry travels back in time and becomes friends with the The Marauders and eventually falls for Sirius. I love those! Love triangle with Harry/Sirius/Remus is also of interest.

Thanks in advance!


** There was a story exactly like that but with Hermione instead of Harry. It was about Hermione going back in time. It's a great read and very emotional too. I definitely recommend this story. linkffn(The Debt of Time)

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** Would you accept a teenage Sirius travelling *forwards*, rather than Harry travelling backwards?

**** *Cartographer's Craft*, by Copperbadge.

linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge)

Very old, very well known fic. Published around 2005, and these days the first result of a Google Search for Cartographer's Craft is usually the Ao3 copy!

Harry is seventeen, gearing up for the Horcrux hunt and the last push against Voldemort. Some experimentation with the Marauder's Map occurs, and something weird happens - the map vomits up a sixteen year old Sirius Black...

** This fits what you said, however Hermione travels back in time with him. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120/chapters/9843116]]

** I've definitely read something like this. Wait a moment, let me look it up

EDIT: Found it. Linkffn(A New Life by HarryPotterBlack7)

A word of warning: it's Incomplete and probably will be for a long time. I can't speak for the quality as I believe I read it ages ago and I stopped half way.
