I know it's a tired trope for Harry to get some kind of +Tardis+ Magical Trunk which is bigger on the inside, but does anyone ever explore the ramifications of these trunks, or similar devices (like the magic tent from 4th year and the Quidditch World Cup)?

For example, can you "nest" trunks inside of each other to create a Supertrunk? What happens if such a trunk gets broken - do the contents spill out, or are they Lost Forever?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] uses it as a repeating theme in the second half of the fic.

Also, you shouldn't mess around with those things. My second cousin's uncle had a friend who was inside one when the charms failed. They had to bury him in it.

*** Ah, you don't even know half of it! My father's coworker's nephew used to live in one of those trunks until the charms failed. Had to bury him in it.

**** That isn't even the worst part. I knew someone whose cousin knew someone whose friend decided to play a trick on them, and stashed a trunk inside of another trunk. There was wide speculation as to what happened that day, but let's just say I'm not so certain that it was Sirius Black that blew up all those muggles that day.

** I've seen this in about 50% of Harmony fanfics I've ever read. However, that's really a lot of them, so I can't recall any exact titles.

IIRC, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] also has trunks, but don't quote me on that.

** I think they come out from a partnership between Acme and Sarif Industries. Their effect is to create pocket dimensions that have the unfortunate effect to create holes in space-continuum if abused too much ( the technical therm is plot holes).

Other details are unknown , SCP collected information that [DATA EXPUNGED] which explains their creation.

Takes every cliche about a OP trunk and then some!

** I remember reading one where the trunk had a compartment that served as a training area or secret bedroom or something. But this is an interesting prompt, I love world/magic building things.

Can't say I've run into anything yet that had consequences/issues concerning the trunks yet!

** Hpmor messes with this occasionally - how do they work, what are the limits, how can they be used as lifehacks, etc, but it's very incidental to the story and only a few paragraphs out of 600000 words

Only mentioned because it's one of the more interesting takes on magic pouches/trunks I've seen
