Depressed oc character tips? My ocs grandparents pass away and he is alone going into sixth year as his parents passed away a few years before, some pointers would be nice first time writing this.


** One of the biggest things with depression is it tends to narrow your view a lot. Options you might have seen before just don't occur to you. I read something once that said your brain actually loses the ability to learn, take in and establish information, so say you learn something in class, you might not always be able to think of ways to apply that knowledge or use it in daily life.

Someone will actually point out that you know something and you're like â€˜wow, it honestly didn't occur to me', even if it's something you talk about every day you still might not think of it in that moment.

the other big thing is the exhaustion. Not only do you feel like someone turned up gravity or everything is like moving underwater, you also find that the future is hard to think about properly, and hope if or planning for the future is just...it seems futile, because you don't know what might happen. The further seems too big and too small at the same time

I hope this is helpful.

*** I wholly concur with every word of this!

To add on, a few things that I noticed in myself during depression:\\
Time seems to dissapear. Meaning one moment it's early morning, and the next it's late afternoon.\\
It's incredibly difficult to find the drive to do anything - even if you know it will improve your immediate situation (long term goals are even harder) like getting up to get something to drink because you're thirsty\\
You feel lonely even when people are with you and keeping track of your friends feels nigh impossible.

Another thing (imo the most important because so many people seem to forget this) is that even when you're so depressed you are actively considering ending it all /there will still be moments when you can smile, or even laugh./ It's not all dark all the time. The human mind is amazing, and will find (dark) humor even in the worst of times.
