I'm curious what rules or strategies folks think would make sense for using Time Turners at Hogwarts.

I'm assuming that other students wishing to take tons of classes could get one (and that Hermione wasn't the first student ever to do so).

- What rules would the Ministry have for Time Turner use?
- What rules might Hogwarts have for its Time Turning students? (Like maybe your double has to be in a specific room away from everyone else while not in classes)
- What strategies might the students have come up with on their own?
- What limitations of Time Turners might there be? (Like a limit you how far back you can go? A limit to how many times a Time Turner can be used to Turn back the same day?)

Interested in discussion on this topic and also any fics where these ideas are explored :)


** First, I hope you've read the wiki article?

I coulda sworn they made up a gizmo that they was the "public" name for the time turner that's intended to mitigate some sort of condition involving spontaneous duplication as the explanation for it... I'm starting to think that was just HPMOR though, not canon.

As for rules, I'd expect keeping a very close eye on and remember where you were and when at any point whenever you're time-turned would be at the top of the list to avoid bumping into yourself. Specified rooms makes sense but I doubt would be required unless the student actually got themselves in trouble yet were somehow still allowed to keep the time turner.

For a student strategy, stick to different routes in different iterations of the same timeframe, like avoiding the same stairwell or wing you used before outright even when you're either not there yet or not there anymore just to keep it simpler.

Regarding limitations, the wiki says 5 hours, HPMOR said 6, or the play-that-shall-not-be-named just kicked an 8 on it's side for all practical purposes as it was literally spanning a generation gap so yeah lol.

*** Spimster Wickets! I think that was the name anyway, and yeah it's from HPMOR.

Definitely think you basically have to map out your path before you go and stick to it so as to not run into yourself.
