Have a look! I hope you like it. :)


** I'm just not buying that Hermione would let anyone cast something like this on her, no matter how much she trusts Harry. That is the only thing truly putting me off this fic.

Otherwise its well paced, I like that canon moments are skipped over and don't eat up reading time, and I do like how we see into Harry's head in this.

I seriously hope you treat carefully, though. That stuff can deteriorate from "kinky Dom/Sub-play" to "rape fic" really fast and it would be a shame if that happened.

*** Could be the effects of the incredibly magical book that she's studying and spending a lot of time with.

** The pacing works very well here, by skipping over canon events it neatly reinforces the theme of Harry's new obsession.

I do think Hermione's characterisation could be more canon compliant however. To me she would make a more interesting 'final boss' given her personality.

The prose maintains a solid quality and i find myself interested to see where you take it plot wise which is rare for smut/lemon/etc.

** was decent, but why does harry who has a newfound obession with controlling people just instantly give over possession of the magic book that called him a master and was offering to teach him how to control people to hermione? espically after it picked him; seemed rather bizarre.

  Set in the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter has a strange awakening after the demonstration of Unforgivable Curses in that fateful Defense Against the Dark Arts class. How different is a Harry Potter with one deviant obsession, a twisted kink? Perhaps not at all, or perhaps incredibly so in the most meaningful of ways. Multiple pairings all centered around Harry, more of a web really.
