can someone please explain me why many writers do it . I mean i can understand Potter and Black and to a point Gryffindor( though i dont really like it) but Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuf, Peverell and hier to Merlin even. I mean really WTF and after giving him all those lordship they will not even play any significant role in the story except for giving him a big title and making the story look like written by a 12 year old


** Lots of reasons, but I'd say most of them stem from wanting to give Harry better than he received in canon.

Consider that some people don't think Dumbledore did what's best for Harry. Perhaps you inflate the abuse given by the Dursleys. You take Dumbledore's "For the Greater Good" to mean he's a chessmaster playing with people's lives and manipulating everyone and everything around him.

Giving him Titles, Lordships, power gives Harry the ability to subvert what hand he was dealt in canon.

Or the power to go on a shopping spree in Diagon Alley for an expanding trunk. Your choice, really.

*** "Expanding trunk"

Did you mean life sized simulation of earth that has everything as it would be without humans? Which is just sold in the normal trunk shop in the corner?

Or alternatively

Massive manor with a 1,000,000 acres of land around it, with a complete ecosystem habited by phoenixes, griffins, thestrals and other magical creatures, and the manor is self sufficient of course with each room being a room of requirement. Which again, is sold in the normal trunk shop in the corner.

Both cost around 4000 galleons, and seeing as the estimated revenue of a professor in Hogwarts is around 18000 galleons a year (if I remember correctly), that is fucking ridiculously cheap

**** I'm almost tempted to do a subversion of that, but have the room inside the trunk make a coffin feel spacious.

*** I can understand what you are saying but aren't potter and black enough for covering all of that and don't even let me start on expanding trunks.

Overall I like a fic where mc is powerfull but he shuoldn't be so op or rich that other characters feel useless infront of him

** Well, some of them were written by twelve years olds, so there is that.

But mainly I think that it is to give him a higher ground and political clout even if it's unrealistic as hell. Like, can you honestly imagine a legislative body/government official/political official giving a 11 years-old the time of the day? Indulging them, maybe if it's not much of a bother, but genuinely taking them seriously not so much.

Since the story pass in England the whole nobility thing just is the first excuse that jumps to mind, even more so when we discover that the Potter family was at least moderately rich. And them is the fact that many authors just don't bother with how historically the whole nobility thing was done, it really didn't work the way many seem to think.

Much of the nobility sub-plot could be removed with little to no effect from most stories by just moving the ages up a few years, but many authors are reluctant at doing so since older characters means scraping away most of the so loved abusive Dursley's/manipulative Dumbledore plots since adults wouldn't realistically be forced in such situations.

But I digress, for your question about why so many lordships the response is that it's a plot-device to justify giving Harry a much greater political clout than what his parents could -even unrealistically (in case it's cannon compliant until at least the brith of Harry) have-. But since it is mostly a solution for a problem it rarely have long-term consequences beyond solving the problems and is mostly set aside.

** I was reading a fic someone recommended on here and I was enjoying it, had some stuff I rolled my eyes at (the beginning of Ron and Hermione bashing) but subtly enough to cope with. Harry went back in time with another character who, after Harry is sassy to Snape and Snape demands Harry show some respect - announces to all present that Snape should show respect to Lord Potte-

Nope, fic closed. I cannot cope with it

*** really i mean he would talk to anyone however he want and then present his 100s of lordship to get away with it and also demand respect. I mean man please make it realistic. they just make him look like a arrogant asshole which is something he is not supposed to be. I am, ok with the fact that he is confident enough to stand up to snape but coming out like an asshole isn't the way to do it

** Same reason why they give him a mithril wand with a bisilisk venom core, or a magical core that is 10 times bigger that the other students. They want their hero to be "special" and just write a power trip/ feel good story.

** They probably look like they're written by 12 year olds because they are written by 12 year olds. Most stories like the ones you're talking about also tend to have completely black and white characters, rather then grey. This would fit with a child's mentality of only seeing the world in black or white.

*** naa man i have seen some very beautifully written fic which a 12 old can't but they just make mc overpowered and give him like 7 or 8 lordship and his magical core is like dumbledore + voldemort combined. i just don't undestand it. like read this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13251826/1/I-m-not-a-hero]] it's wonderfully written but voldemort just isn't a challenge for him and you just don't connect to harry as he is litrally undefeatable . They have try to cover that by presenting another villain but that too just end in a disaster
