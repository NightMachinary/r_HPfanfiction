** So drinking most likely.

Magically? Day-dream fancies. Just a quick 15 minute nip out of you day. Slowly taking over your life until you don't know what reality is anymore.

** Cannon doesn't touch on it much, but some of those magical plants/potions must get you high. I'm sure there's a magical marajuana equivalent somewhere.

*** But marijuana is already magical. To add to your point, a lot of drugs are some form of plants, and we know herbology is an important part of the wizarding world. So there would probably be an equivalent to coca leaves. Or mushrooms that are actually magic, or peyote that allows you to enter the spirit realm or something.

** - IIRC they smoke, too, so they'd just lace the tobacco with some kinda potion to make it potent. Or just smoke good ol' ganja, to hell with these silly muggles and their silly laws against certain kinds of plants, if I use it in potions, I surely can use it for fun!
- Alcohol
- Potions, which would maybe be their equivalent of hard drugs, possibly with much less side effects because magic

** I think blood dealers for like vampires would totally be a thing. Like someone kidnaps you, takes your blood, and like leaves you in an alley somewhere. And then they sell the blood to vampires in a sort of black market fashion.

Or, the dealers keep you and treat you sort of like a brand. Like, some blood might taste different than others or better, kind of like there is better quality clothing or food or whatever.

I've thought a lot about this.

** I just remembered that horrific arc in Torchwood about the aliens who got high off of human children. If you wanted to get really bleak, I could see there being some real sick shite going on with that kind of thing. Weren't there books on cooking human children in the Black family library?
