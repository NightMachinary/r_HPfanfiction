I'm getting really tired of reading time travel plot fanfics where everybody and their mother can immediately can guess someone time-travelled or realize immediately what the hell happened just because the MC who time traveled starts acting a little bit OOC from the time where he/she was really at that age. And Almost everybody guess it correctly! He/She must have come from the future! Just because they were acting a little bit of! You know, instead of entering the puberty which, lasts for few years and ironically the age the time traveler returns to! WTF? I mean, smart characters and smart but they are no Sherlock holmes and he would had taken few weeks of constantly observing the MC's behavior. I understand it was supposed to be a plot point to the Fanfic, where the other characters learns of their potential future and their reactions and such but it leaves huge plot holes to the story. Anyway, sorry for ranting a bit. What I'm looking for are Time travel stories where nobody realizes the time travel and MC tell nobody.

** Can you recommend some of the ones you were complaining about?I don't normally read time travel but well the only one I've liked is linkffn(Put into Lifetime Detention by Death by Harmonious Cannons) where the only people who know are actually told sometime into the story and the only person who figures it out properly being time travel is actually Albus Dumbledore and ie after a lot of observation.

  Reptilia28 Challenge response. Harry learns the fallacy of forgiveness at a Maternal! Reaper's knee. He realises that maximum control is the only way to destroy the Voldemort ideology. Slight McCarthyism. All Death Eaters (inc Snape) are bad. Mainly Revenge, minimal romance (Harmony), CRACK elements, distrusted but not bashed Weasleys and Dumbledore.

*** I agree, the only ones I've read where someone guesses it have been either because it was completely obvious, and they already knew about time travel, or it was a kid guessing because kids are observant, and naive enough to believe something so unbelievable. Usually, it's difficult to convince people without using memories.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano might be something you'll be interested in.

The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. No one knows that there's another George that travels to the past. Older George also have a sort of a mind link with his younger self. This causes problems with the younger George and Fred and they become quite stressed out about what's going on.

Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasleys. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

- Callidus Prince Series by ContraryToEverything is definitely something you might also like to look at as well. The author's writing style is brilliant and original. She does not simple rehash the books, but makes it unique while keeping the tone of JK Rowling's HP World. However, it's more of a de-aged story rather than a time travel story. Since the principles are similar though, I'll recommend it anyways. So far the author is on year 3.

The basic run down of the story is Severus Snape somehow got de-aged to 11 years old with only memories at that age. So he does not remember anything pass 11. He is aware that something is not right and he is in the wrong body. The beginning of the first chapter of the first book is from a perspective of an unknown character, but that character will not be revealed until later. However, the rest of the story is from Severus' POV.
