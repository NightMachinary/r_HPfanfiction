:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What I remeber is that The story used to be located on fanfiction . net but I can't find it, I don't remeber the title or author, but I do remeber parts of the summery and some of the story it self. in the summery it talked about haw Harry would find the ability to defeat the dark lord but at the COST of HIS MAGIC. In the story, Harry falls through a tear into a deamon dimension or into hell (that part is debatiable) but the fact is he ends up fighting a demon with his magic and loses his magic but he absorbs the demons abilities, he ends up fight a lot of demons till he finds another tear that he goes through and he finds that he's back on his dimension but way far in to the past and the only way forward is to live it one day at a time.


** Does anybody have any clue as to what I am looking for in this lost Fanfiction dealing with harry potter.
