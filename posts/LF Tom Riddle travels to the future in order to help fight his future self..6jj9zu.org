I bet nobody's ever done this before.

Inversions where a crazy/amnesiac Voldemort goes back in time to try and assassinate a certain upstart muggle-raised student called Tom Riddle are also welcome.


** "The Fox and the Stag" series by Kaederavensdale. Tomarry. 1st story finished, 2nd a WIP with active updates. Harry travels back in time to a parallel dimension to save Tom Riddle from himself. The pair travels back to the future in Harry's dimension to fight Voldemort. It follows canon a bit too closely and has a lot more fluffy moments than you'd expect with a nascent dark lord as one of the main characters, but it's an enjoyable read.

** Not an exact match but "Rectifier" by Niger Aquila linkffn(2595818) has a Professor Riddle testing his alternate worlds theory which leads to him being transported to the canon universe where he aids the fight against Voldemort. Although, initially, with a little reluctance.

Also, it's abandoned. But, the concept and execution were decent enough that it still might be worth a read.

** There is always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite!]] Harry goes back to Tom's time and they became friends, so when Harry goes back to the future, Tom follows him along with some other slytherins. Eventually, he helps Harry fight Voldemort, and there are some wonderful twists to how he does it! The story is even finished! It's not tomarry, although it feels like it.

The only problem is... It starts of really bad. Like, if you can get through the beginning you can find an amazing story, but the first few chapters are not well written and have bad grammar. It does get better, and it's one of my favourite stories, though!

Both are Tomione who more or less fit your request. I have another one somewhere but can't seem to find it. There's not time travel in either, but Tom Riddle is here and helps fight Voldemort.
