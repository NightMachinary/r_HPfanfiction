*** Whoa, that Petunia one.. I think it would make for a great launchpad for a AU story, assuming the author could do Petunia right.

*** I have such good memories of this! Six of us would pack into a tiny dorm-room and watch it on a tinier laptop. Rewinding to watch our favorite parts again and drunkenly laughing laughing until we cried.

** Death Eater propaganda and Wanted posters:

- [[http://pragmatique.tumblr.com/tagged/Death+Eater+Propaganda]]
- [[http://pragmatique.tumblr.com/tagged/Death+Eater+Propaganda/page/2]]

I look at those, and I can't help but weave an alternative history. The highly improbable (some philistines might say "contrived") sequence of events that had led the Elder Wand to be loyal to Harry was derailed. (Perhaps Draco never disarmed Dumbledore, so the Elder Wand died with him.)

As a result, of that, and, perhaps, a shorter Camping Trip, all of Voldemort's horcruxes were destroyed, but Harry and the Order lost the Battle of Hogwarts, suffering many casualties, particularly in the older generation. On the other hand, Voldemort is afraid to make more horcruxes, and since he is mortal again, generally keeps to himself to minimize chances of permanent death by bad luck or betrayal.

The Death Eaters, knowing that in a full on civil war (especially where Voldemort prefers to stay off the front lines), the populace that was docile while only Muggleborns and Muggles were affected might turn on them, try to ease the tensions by offering pardons to purebloods who stop fighting, and offer to hold "elections", even. A year or two later,

- Harry is abroad trying to rally other nations to help against Voldemort and the Death Eaters.
- Neville and Luna had taken the deal and used it to buy time to smuggle as many Muggleborns as possible to safety, until they were found out and forced to go into hiding.
- Hermione leads a guerrilla army mostly made up of Muggleborns who would rather stay and fight. Ginny also took the deal, but is secretly working for Hermione.

The plot involves Hermione organizing a bombing of the Death Eater Coalition meeting (a rally, really) at the Salazar Opera House, breaking an elite IRA bombmaker out of British prison to develop a hybrid technomagical bomb that is both "mundane" enough to shrink magically for easier smuggling and magical enough to punch through the Opera House's protective magic. (My headcanon is that wizards have an Anti-Explosion Jinx, which basically suppresses nonmagical explosions in an area, including ordinary firearms and internal combustion engines. Naturally, Death Eaters would be on guard against Muggles.)

Ginny seduces Draco Malfoy (who, naturally, has an invitation to the rally, and brings her as a guest), and Stuns him just before they are about to head out, stealing his uniform and wand. Dean Thomas uses Polyjuice to disguise himself as Draco, and together, they infiltrate the Death Eater Coalition and plant the bomb. Ginny then feigns sickness (during Bellatrix's presentation), and "Draco" escorts her out. Shortly after, the bomb detonates.

Draco wakes up to learn that his father and aunt (who were both speakers at the rally) are dead, as is his mother (though maybe not --- she might have followed "Draco" and Ginny out in order to offer aid after Ginny feigned sickness), and he is wanted in connection with the bombing. Realizing that he is going down either way --- even if he is "innocent", he is still the weak link who let the bombers into the Opera House, and his father's political rivals will not hesitate to capitalize on that --- he goes into hiding.

That's where all the Wanted posters come from.

The consequences of the bombing are mixed: many of the most powerful Death Eaters are killed or maimed, and the regime suffers a heavy blow, and simply cannot maintain its oppressive policies and programs. However, it also gives the wizarding world a vivid glimpse of Muggle-scale violence, where scores of lives can be snuffed out in a flash by one tiny device. Harry's diplomatic mission becomes much harder, and Muggleborns in all countries come to be viewed with suspicion. Also, thanks to how /small/ the wizarding world is, nearly every pureblood and many half-bloods have close relatives who were caught in that explosion --- whatever their political sympathies.

*** I just read "Death of Narcissa Black" and I loved it... it wasn't incredibly awesome, but for a comic-type thing, it's pretty good.
