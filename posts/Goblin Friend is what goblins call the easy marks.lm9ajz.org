:END:
That fic where goblins call muggleborns and other fools “goblin friends” to trick them into thinking they get better rates and what not.


** It's a plot point in the Perfect Normal series, through not a huge one. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464/]])

  “I see,” he said gravely, with an understanding nod. “Well you see, Miss Granger, the term ‘goblin friend' is practically synonymous with ‘easy mark'. It signals to any goblins who interact with you that you'll be easy to cheat -- a very profitable ‘friend' to their nation.”

  “Really?” she said in a disbelieving, small voice. “It's not a courtesy title indicating great friendship and respect?”

  “Really. And I'm afraid not. But you can take heart in the fact that you found out now, while you're still so young! A child who sees through their trickery and joins in their tradition of flyting -- an almost ritualised exchange of insults -- is considered worthy of respect. Now, if you'd reached your majority and still held the title of ‘goblin friend', then you may have found it difficult to ever be truly held in genuine esteem by them. Which would have been a great deterrent if you'd planned on a career in my department. So it really was a fortunate thing that your friend Mr. Potter here spoke up when he did, and you found out now, rather than later.”
