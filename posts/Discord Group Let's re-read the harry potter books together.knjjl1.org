Hi, I'm new to this subreddit, but I read the books growing up. I just rewatched the whole movie series, and it got me feeling nostalgic for my first re-read!

Anyone interested in joining a discord harry potter book club?


** I've re-read the books many times but I'm always up to do it again. I'll definitely join it though if you want more people to see this post you could post it in the Harry Potter sub.
