Am I the only one who gets super frustrated when authors mess up the names?

Like ‚ÄòAlbus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore,' or ‚ÄòAlbus Brian Wulfric Percival Dumbledore.' Like seriously, how hard is it to just do a quick Google search? A.P.W.B.D.

Also, when authors take liberties with expanding names. Like Tom Marvolo Riddle -> Thomas Marvolo Riddle. First off -- no. Second -- if Tom was really short for Thomas, he wouldn't spell out his own full name as just Tom Marvolo Riddle.

It's the same issue with Harry -- Hadrian? Harrison? Harold? Even Henry? Like, what? Unless Harry needs a false identity for some reason and wants to use a name that's close enough, Harry is Harry.

Lastly, when people get first names wrong. Look, I get that some aren't used often in the books, like Auror Robards, Auror Dawlish, Unspeakable Croaker, or Madam Pince, but again -- Google is your friend. Gawain, John, Saul, and Irma.

Some names aren't canonized, like Fleur's father and Blaise Zabini's mother, and some family relationships are mussed up, like fanon Harry's grandparents being Charlus and Dorea Potter instead of Fleamont and Euphemia Potter as it is in canon. Or Susan Bones -- I've often seen authors write her late father as Edgar Bones. According to the wiki? Her uncle.

But that's fine, creative license and all, and usually there's a point -- like Harry having Black blood or providing a backstory for Susan. But not taking the effort to get established characters' names right? Changing the names for absolutely no reason? Pisses me right off.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

** The most egregious to me is that all these characters' first names are in the FFN character tag drop down list, and even when it's one of the story's character tags it'll still be misspelled. So they refuse to even take fifteen seconds to check, or are so supremely confident that even when they tag the character it's still misspelled.

I'm an insane level of detail-oriented most of the time so I literally can't imagine skipping at least basic proofreading. My grammar might not be perfect, but like hell am I not going to misspell something even in a dumb internet comment. I even spellcheck myself when I'm drunk for fuck's sake (i.e. right now). So all the wrong names like ‚ÄúDelores‚Äù and ‚ÄúHadrian‚Äù and etc hurt me, though I'm mostly numb by this point

Then there's 'Hermoine' - instantly dropped, and 'Blaise Zabini is a girl' for no other reason than wanting Harry to have a Slytherin GF who isn't Daphne. Oh and also Macgonagall. Makes me wanna cry

****** This was my thought! The idea today that you couldn't just look something up is so foreign. Late 90s you were still dealing with dialup ü§£. I now read fic on my phone. Even in the early 2000s I had to sneak onto fanfic websites in the school library before the librarian saw and told me that wasn't what the computers were for, and print out each new chapter so I could read it at home. I didn't have my own computer until i left for college. The family one was for my parents work and our schoolwork. "Research" for fanfic was often either not possible or just very discouraged a lot of times. Then fandom developed and some things just became accepted.

I read my first fanfic in the middle of the night when I snuck onto the family computer (basement computer + upstairs bedrooms = nobody heard the dialup whistle LOL) Still remember what it was too, and funnily enough it was for the Night World. ([[http://www.angelfire.com/ma/EnterAtRisk/staria.html][Staria's story]]. Also, angelfire still exists? I thought it was gone just like geocities.)

The Night World one because it was a potential ending, and a few Highlander (TV) ones that did wonders for my historical nerdy self... and I think all of them were on random personal websites like Angelfire, Geocities and Tripod etc. And honestly, other than the Hope Saga by Parda (Highlander) they were all pretty bad and my teenage self knew it. It's only been about five years or so since I got back into fanfiction.

Once I got to college I no longer had internet "at home" (or a computer), and the college was rather tiny - there were only two computers in one of the student lounges for my program (we had our own building), and residence had six. Total. There wasn't a computer lab. So I didn't really even have the access to keep reading, and after a while it stopped being something I thought about. Although, I do remember sitting around in the student lounge playing neopets?

**** Yep, this is early fandom because it's a gender-neutral name and there was no textual evidence either way. Actually, because there were several obviously male Slytherins in Harry's year, the guess that Blaise was a girl wasn't all that unreasonable. Even now, Blaise is fun for fanfiction because of the lack of concrete information about him. He's more flexible while still staying technically canon.

***** That is, in fact, where the name Dolores comes from. It's derived from 'Maria de los Dolores' - usually rendered in english as Our Lady of Sorrows.

And Delores is one of the variants that cropped up with the name migrated into the anglosphere. As errors go, it's not such a big one, although in the British setting of Harry Potter Dolores would be /much/ more likely. And usually betokens at least some Irish heritage. Naming your daughter for the Seven Sorrows Of Mary fits with the old tradition - no idea how prevalent it is nowadays - of giving kids extravagantly religious names. (Personal favourite: from the late 50s, family member of mine was at school with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Gonzaga][Aloysius Gonzaga]] O'Leary, who she remembers to this day.)

*** "Blaise Zabini is a girl" actually has a very good reason (for us, at least).

He's mentioned in the first book but without anything to identify his gender. Now, in English you can say "Blaise Zabini went to Slytherin"/or whatever that sentence was without being gender specific... In my language no. Our translator did an amazing job, and has invented some brilliant terms as translations (for portkey, dementor, auror...), but when she bet on the sex of Blaise - she got it wrong. Who knows, maybe even JKR didn't know that Blaise was a boy back then.

Edit: I googled it. Blaise is a French name that is traditionally used for boys, but nowadays is also used for girls. Which raises another question - why do everyone (JKR included if it's canon and not fanon) say he's Italian?

About the father I kinda disagree... I mean, if JKR bothered saying he's Italian (and I honestly don't remember if it's canon or fanon), why not say that he's half Italian and half French? He could always be an immigrant, though, I suppose. However, I think it's mostly lack of care by fanfic writers/JKR, something like: "I've filled the 'quota' of the 'foreign dude', who cares if it's correct/fits/makes sense".

Same thing with Harry being named something other than Harry; in this case I simply wish it was Henry, which I've seen used pretty rarely.

You also have to keep in mind that some of these stories - probably not all, but some - may have been written before some of this information was available. For example, the whole reason that Charlus and Dorea Potter were thought to be Harry's grandparents is because they were the only Potters of that era that appeared in canon. These days I find it less excusable, but still that case might turn up.

Dorea is only 5 years older than Sirius mother, so she's in the age range to have been James's mother. She would be on the older side, but it would explain ehy James is so spoiled. Dorea died in 1977 which explained why Harry had to live with the Dursleys. We never heard about another Potter that died during Voldemorts first war, so people just assumed that James was the son that died.]]

*** I generally prefer Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents because if they aren't, and we know that Potter is a generally uncommon name in the WW, what happened to them? Where were they when Harry was orphaned? Are they unrelated to Harry (which seems unlikely as Sirius says all purebloods are somehow related, including he and James), did they not know or care about Harry, or are they just dead, in which case what happened? Before, it was pretty straightforward that if they were Harry's grandparents, they died before Harry was orphaned. Fleamont and Euphemia have just raised a lot of questions that JK will more than likely not be answering because she gives us info about things we *never asked for* and ignores what we want to know.

minor spoiler: Charlus went to America and got involved in the magical side of WWII, after which he and Dorea faked their own gruesome deaths. It becomes a Black family legend and the currently living Potters are the only people who know they're alive.

minor-moderate spoiler: as it's a time travel story, Harry's origins are initially unknown. James thinks that he's Charlus & Dorea's grandson, and the continued existence of that branch of the family is why he's not saying where he came from. A fun nod to how common that is in fanfiction

So many wizards who although have much longer lifespans than humans randomly died of dragonpox in their 60s, 70s, etc to help facilitate the plot of them not being there.

I mean I get JK is shit at math, but she needs to at least come up with a better excuse than Dragon pox for every character that somehow randomly died in their 60s/70s even though wizards have an average lifespan of 134 yrs. I mean I get for the plot it's convenient to have every Black killed off but the three black sisters and Sirius, but it's just lazy then again it is JK.

For example, in situations where Harry becomes the heir to the House of Black, Dorea being his grandmother lends legitimacy to that claim. However, if you're merely mentioning who his grandparents were, I'd prefer that you stick to the established canon. Basically at this point, you need to establish why Dorea and Charlus Potter are Harry's grandparents in the context of your story, because even though there is debate about the level of canon that Fleamont and Euphemia's relationship to Harry encompasses, it is still canon. Once you establish it, though you're golden.

** I get really irritated when people misspell another's name (or simply just /words/) and I can't tell you how many times when I've come across someone saying Harry's "real" first name is Hadrian. Sure, it's a wizarding world sounding name, but I really dislike Harry as short for Hadrian if you're doing it that way. Wanna give Harry a fake name in a time-travel or cross-dimensional fic? Sure, Hadrian Peverell sounds good. Just not Hadrian Potter.

Now if you want to expand Harry's name, Harrison is fine depending on the circumstances. Harold is one I'll hate simply because I hate the name Harold and Hank is typically a nickname for it anyway. And saying that Draco's name is Draconis in some instances is fine (say, for a very posh wizarding political fic where Draconis Lucius, heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy is a thing), just not for most fics.

For the messed up family relations, I actually prefer Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents and Fleamont and Euphemia being his great grandparents. It just helps more if you're doing a fic where you want Harry to have blood relations to the Black family. In Lord Potter-Black fics make his grandparents Charlus and Dorea, but in a Drarry fic make his grandparents Fleamont and Euphemia so they aren't blood-related, no matter how distant.

As for things not being canon, it's fanfiction for a reason. We're allowed to omit certain facts in canon. Take the Cursed Child, for example. Everyone hates it and no one believes it to be canon. We're allowed to nitpick canon and choose what we like and what we don't like. It's a part of fanfiction.

** Disagree on the names Harold and Henry. Many people called Harold might shorter their names to Harry, and one of the (formerly) most popular Royals in the UK is Prince Harry, but his name is Henry. If a person's fic wants to expand on "House Potter" or something, a posher name makes sense. Harrison is bad and there is no greater sin than Hadrian.

As for names where it's not spelt the same way e.g. Alastair for Alastor, I think it's fine as long as it's consistent. There are lots of variations of a name like that (Alastair, Alistair, Alasdair, Allister, Alister, Allaster), and I don't think it's that big of a deal if I'm honest, just as long as the characterisation is right. If you think someone's gotten it wrong accidentally, just comment about it if it's still being updated, an author who cares will be grateful. Purposely spelling it wrong and you can get in the bin.

Making names up for characters who don't have names is fine, just look them up to see if they don't. Pick something that fits with the character and the world.

I don't care what Harry's grandparents are called, just as long as there is consistency. Charlus and Dorea were his grandparents to those who read and write fanfic when they were the only potter's there were. And it kind of made sense, how quickly Sirius got on with James. Some people don't like the new stuff or what's in the EU and don't consider it canon (and this happens in so many fandoms) and that's fine.

*** Eh. I'd give Harrison a pass. Harrison Ford was in /Star Wars/ and /The Empire Strikes Back/ by 1980, around the time Harry was born. I can see his parents getting into him as Han Solo.

*** u/KingDarius89:

  y. If a person's fic wants to expand on "House Potter" or something, a posher name makes sense. Harrison is bad and there is no greater sin than Hadrian.
#+end_quote

it depends on how far back they want to place the Potter Family in the history of the world, honestly. the origin of the name Henry is French. Hadrian is Latin/Roman. Harald or Haraldr would work if they wanted to give the Potters Norse ancestry. you know, having a tradition of using certain names within the family.

Harrison i'm largely indifferent to, but isn't really a big deal for me, either.

**** Agree with this. Some of it is where you want to place a characters heritage, but mostly comes with how posh they were. But I absolutely hate the Hadrian->Harry reach, and just seems more like it comes with people being edgy or the Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-etc or something.

The issue with Harrison for me is that it's a patronymic, and would be given to the son of someone named Harry.

** Misspelled names bother me quite a bit, but I have a solution. There is a Chrome Extension called InteractiveFics, that allows you to change words in fics. It was made for reader insert fics I think, but can easily be used for this. I use it to change Lilly to Lily, just because I prefer it that way.
