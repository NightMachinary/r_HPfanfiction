** That would be For Love Of Magic.

Unfortunately, Harry in that story is a racist, bigoted tool for the author to make his own alt-right rants with, and it becomes difficult to read even if you're okay with a dark Harry.

I honestly didn't have that big of an issue with it. The whole fic is sort of meant not to be taken seriously; it is more of a guilty pleasure than a serious read. As far as the author espousing their own views? It happens common enough in fanfic that it isn't really a deal. Hell I've read HPMOR, if I made it through that, this was nowhere near as bad. Overall I found the fic a tolerable read, nothing spectacular but better than most out there.

Well, sorry, but shit like this is definitely a 'deal' to me:

  Speaking of dumb monkeys, Harry had never realized how many foreigners there were in Europe these days. People from failed African states and backwards Middle Eastern ones, every variety of sub-optimally cultured human. Which idiot thought it was a good idea to open the gates for the barbarians? London even had a Muslim mayor for fuck's sake.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Harry is pretty power hungry in Contractual Invalidation. I don't know if you would call him “dark” though, but his Slytherin characteristics definitely come out. It's Harry/Daphne. Linkffn(11697407)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
