So I started writing a fic almost two years ago, got over 40,000 words into publishing it and realized I had no earthly idea where I was going with it. Just wanted to make this post to see how other people have picked up their old fics and finished them. Did you leave the old one and reupload the first chapters to reflect your new vision for the story? Did you just pick right up where you left off? I have a vision for where the story should go now but I'm not entirely sure it fits with what I wrote back in early 2017.

â€‹

Edit: I've decided to create a new story, leaving the old one as it is. And will be posting the new one as a "Remastered" version.

** I have one I'm considering picking up again too..I think mine was about 80k, and it just wasn't going where I wanted it to. I think I'm going to delete the last couple published chapters and start again because they painted me in a corner I didn't like.

*** I'm leaning toward rewriting the entire thing, I think my writing style has matured to much in the last two years to reconcile the difference between the first 16 chapters and whatever I write now.

** I had one about 70k that i wrote over the summer about three years ago. And for some reason I received a massive amount of reviews this summer for that story. I had been planning to finish it for years and somehow i kept pushing it back. So I sat down, and wrote four or five massive chapters, thusly finishing the story.

**** I began that story when I was about 16, so please don't hold the cliched storyline against me. Also it's a crossover with supernatural, so i have no idea if that sort of thing interests you in the first place:

***** I'm on chp 3 and liking it so far (the writing is fairly good), my only issue is responding to reviews and kind of long AN's - you may want to go back and remove those.

Edit: also the chapter previews.

** When I write, I tend to already have a basic outline in mind. I don't formally outline or anything, but I know where the story is headed and I think about that end before writing each chapter. Having said that, the two longer stories I have I took a long break in the middle because I got bored, so I had to step back for while until I felt ready to continue them. When I did pick them back up again, I first went through and edited previous chapters (mostly for grammar but also to tighten up and even out the quality) which helped me re-engage in the plot. It's great to read your old work and realize 'this doesn't totally suck!'

As a reader, I encourage you to finish the old fic - even if you are planning to redo parts of it, completed long stories are a heaven sent.
