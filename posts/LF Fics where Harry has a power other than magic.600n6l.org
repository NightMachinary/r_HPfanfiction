Elemental capabilities, the force, ninja-awesomeness, ability to communicate with single-celled organisms, I don't care. He has something that's not magic and other people don't (or only a small number do). Preferably nothing related to creature inheritance and preferably something with an AU and not plot regurgitation but I'll take what I can get.

Slash, bashing, dark!Harry and crossovers are fine. Please no harems, smut/romance-centric plots, genderbending, pottercest or mpreg. Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] has Harry becoming a magical girl or something. I don't really know what the plot of it was since I just skimmed it for the hilarious Dumbledore scenes. 100% recommend this one. It's amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a Baby?]] Harry has a few bloodlines from the Naruto universe and is raised by a gang of international terrorists and serial killers. Absolutely fantastic story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9101451/1/Kaleidoscope-of-Magic][Kaleidoscope of Magic]] Dumbledore and a couple of other people get Harry tossed in Azkaban to awaken his sharingan or some shit during his third year. Funny as fuck but not intentionally.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11397202/1/Old-Soul-Reborn][Old Soul Reborn]] Harry appears to have some of [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/bleach/images/4/49/Ukitake_helps_out_Shunsui.png/revision/latest?cb=20130209024333&path-prefix=en][Jushiro Ukitake's]] powers from Bleach but the fic hasn't gotten to a point where he'll actually use them. Same thing with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503251/1/Memories-of-a-Former-Life][Memories of a Former Life]] but with [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/bleachfanfiction/images/8/8b/854921-aizen_21_animestocks.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100906172005][Sosuke Aizen.]] /Really/ disappointed the second one is dead because I liked the direction it was taking things. If you happen to know something similar I'd love to read it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] is a pretty fun fic. It crosses with a shit ton of things and Harry seems to pick up new powers wherever he goes. Tons of fight scenes so if that's not your cup of tea then you should probably avoid this fic.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5xodu2/lf_full_creature_harry_without_any_involvement_of/dek800k/][This Guy]] has some really cool drafts of stories. Goo Monster Harry and Blood Demon Harry are the two that best fit your request. Both are /very/ different from canon and don't have any romance so far.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11447653/1/][A Fallen God]] Harry has Loki's powers and Loki inside his head. Similar to Denarian series.

Harry is a Space Marine from Warhammer 40k in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]].

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11030096/1/][Doeskin]] Harry is a deer. A magical ninja deer. Naruto crossover.

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)

** I really liked linkffn(11674317)

I recommend watching a few of the original black and white Addams Family episodes before reading. Hearing John Astin and Carolyn Jones in your head as you read is awesome.

The "powers" are Addams Family powers, nothing over the top.

Edit: There are a few smut scenes if I remember correctly and sadly it hasn't been update in 6 months.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
