I found an ongoing fic some time ago, where adult Harry Potter was transported in another dimention and became a Divination professor in Hogwarts, teaching his female counterpart. Harry is heavily scarred, has an on-and-off thing going with some girl he met in the bar, and Divination is taken very seriously.

Unfortunately, that's all I remember. Any idea what was it and how I find it again?

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

**** I read it rather recently. I like it, but after 100k+ words you'd think it would be farther along.

***** Well, I kinda like slow with good descriptions. After all, most of the fics I read before were non-stop lightning fast or downward bad.

****** I agree. I like stories that don't jump from event to event and take the time to show how characters react to things.

** Does Harry ever grow a spine? I stopped reading because every chapter was a new way for him to be a punching bag to someone.

*** Yep, he does. He just takes it slow, but by the beginning of the study year, he will be in a fighting stance.
