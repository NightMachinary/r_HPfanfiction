** linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) is the only transgender!Harry story I can think of with the wordcount and updates.

It plays itself off more like a gender-bender fanfic ("Oh no, I've magically been turned into a girl"), but Harry's character development and thought process makes it pretty clear that she was a closeted/repressed transgender woman all along.

*** Yeah, I've already read a few chapters of this fic. It's basically another ''oh no, I've been turned into a girl, whatever will I do?'' story. Not really what I'm looking for. Thank you for posting though! :)

**** Well, I'd looked at it in the past and rejected it for that too. Then I saw it heartily recommended in some other post and decided to give it a chance. After getting through a few chapters I decided it was good that I did.

It's probably a big spoiler, but [[/spoiler][in this story Harry is basically a trans person who is still in denial at the time of the change]], and the story progresses (and Harry develops) with that as the centre of his change. There are some things in this story that I don't necessarily agree with fully, but as far as showing a potentially trans person coming through their changes and /actually/ changing I think it is worth to give it a chance.

***** I know...the story is very well written as well. But I am not looking for another of these stories right now. Don't worry though, this one is already on my 'to-read' list!

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** I unfortunately have nothing that fits your exact requirements, but if you don't mind less then a 100k and transgender works then there is this story which is in outline format. The authors style sometimes puts people off but I like it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]] Rated E.

*** It looks pretty good. Bummer it's only 10k words. Thank you for this suggestion though!

** This is about transgender Hermione (known as Hermes within the fic) and is told through the teacher's point of view during one-to-one sessions they have with their first year students. Other notable AU bits and pieces are: Harry sustained brain damage before Hogwarts, both he and Hermes were sorted into Slytherin and Crabbe is actually a nice person. I really like this fic because it has a lot of character building, especially with minor characters like Lisa Turpin and Mandy Brocklehurst. Anyway, here's Session Transcripts, on AO3: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/270848/chapters/427550]]
