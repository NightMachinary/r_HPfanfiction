Must Have's

- Harry is raised by both Sirius and Remus

- Pre-hogwarts

- Complete, or updated within the past 4 months

- No fem!harry

Things I'd really prefer, but if it's good and well written I'm pretty open

- Remus/Sirius

- Most any Harry pairings are okay (if it continues on to hogwarts, they are old enough, etc), but I really don't like Harmony or Daphne.

Thank You!

Edit: just wanted to thank everyone for their suggestions, I'll definitely take a look at them all!


** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry - verse]] is exactly what you're looking for - including RL/SB. The author intended to do 8 books (pre-hogwarts and one for each year of school) but s/he only got through 3rd year. It's still over 400k words iirc and totally worth reading.

** The Dangerverse series fits everything you want, except for no MoonStar. It's 5 complete main parts, with multiple one shots and short stories added in. Remus rescues Harry long before Hogwarts with the help of an OC older Granger sister. They then rescue Sirius from Azkaban and they raise Hermione and Harry together. Now that I'm thinking about it it's a good chance that it's Harmony, so fair warning.

*** > great idea

> starts out promising

> author is actually decent at writing

> ruined in the space of 5 chapters bc of excessive / SoD breaking fluff

;-; why does this always happen

**** Yep. It became very fluffy, very fast. Also, despite the title, there is very little danger but lots of hugs and crying.

There is also a weird "alpha-beta-submission" thing going on that made me really uncomfortable at times.

** linkao3(A Life More Ordinary by orphan_account)

I know one of your must haves is a completed/frequently updated fic BUT this one is really amazing and meets all of your other requirements and it's a real great read, even though it is unfinished. The author has abandoned their account and likely won't be returning or finishing the fic. But the fic is full of fluff and there is definitely MoonStar.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
