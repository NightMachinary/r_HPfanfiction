Barely remember a thing about this story, beyond the thread title description. It was set right after the epilogue and I think it went in a Harry/Hermione direction, though I'm not sure about that.

** There are a couple suggestions already mentioned, but here's my take on it.

--------------

"Why did you do it Ron? Why did you have to cheat?" Harry asked, eyes blazing with fire.

"And what," Ron asked, "should I have done differently? I'm not the Boy-Who-Lived! Everyone isn't bending backwards to please me all the time!"

"Oh yeah? How about working honestly to better yourself on driving before taking the test? Oh I forgot, you're the entitled bastard who thinks the world owes him everything!"

"Don't even get me started. 'Boo hoo Voldemort kidnapped me and killed Cedric! I just stood there and then ran away from him.' It's a wonder you were even selected for Head Auror."

"Don't go there, Ron. Let this argument go." Hermione whispered to him.

"No I won't! He thinks he's the paragon of justice and truth in this society? Well, wake up, because reality called! So many would still be alive if he just listened to us once in a while. And yes, he 'defeated,'" Ron made quotation signs with his fingers, "Voldemort, when all he did was cast expelliarmus a bunch of times!"

"Who saved your sister's life? Oh yes I did. And how many times did /you/ save /my/ life? Huh? I can't hear you! That's right, never!"

"That's because most of the time I was already stunned, bitten, cursed or wounded before I could help you! And that's because I don't have the innate genius in Defense that you have! Have you ever, even once in your life, struggled with anything?"

"Oh it wasn't as if a blood thirsty Dark Lord was after my life since I was born, was it? Oh no, I lived a life of sunshine and unicorns, right? News flash Ron, I didn't even know about unicorns before Hagrid taught us about them! That's the kind of childhood I had!"

"Oh don't divert this argument into sob stories, because believe me I have had many. My point is that you won't ever know how the normal Wizards live in this world, Potter, because you've always been hoisted on a golden pedestal that's higher than everyone else. You won't ever know, what it was like to imagine your family getting tortured because you were doing the right thing, because for better or worse, you never had a family!"

It's 2 AM here, and I'm quite sleepy. Will continue this if my muse returns after I wake up.
