/[HOT TAKE INBOUND]/ Not only do I find quite a lot of fanon material (including headcanons and ideas) inherently more interesting, thought provoking and better for the overall narrative; I prefer much of the HP Fandom's work to JKR's own.

And, in a lot of cases, I think a lot fanfictions end up better written and use the characters, concepts and themes (of their own or of the series) better than JKR did in the original series.

The Harry Potter series works as a great prompt/backdrop to be expanded upon because JKR didn't do the best job explaining or exploring it. And, often, her explanations made little sense or felt lacking, which gives fanfic authors the ability to pickup where she left off and go the distance with their combined ideas (like a relay).

I'd love to palm off my disappointment/disinterest with the main series as me being an adult looking back on a childs book series (which is partially the case), yet Skulduggery Pleasant, Noughts & Crosses and even the Wardstone Chronicles were also books I read at the time and they hold up far better.

Hence, I just prefer fanfiction.


** Canon by nature doesn't have time to build a world, lay the groundwork, move plot along /and/ explore all of the nuances of every single character/element introduced. It would be an editing nightmare. Fanfiction allows further exploration because people can choose what interests them and run with that. Most writers of fanfic don't have to deal with building entire worlds from scratch, which gives them time to execute their ideas well. (Not saying there isn't world building involved, but definitely not to the extent JKR had to do).

I agree that some concepts are done extremely well in fanfic and I also prefer some interpretations over canon, but don't think it's possible to generalize and say one is better. The two are totally different beasts

*** I fundamentally disagree, as that is what a story is supposed to do. You, as the author, are supposed to do all of those things in an adequate fashion.

Canon (or JKR specifically) had all the time she wanted to layout the groundwork for her worldbuilding and character arcs. She chose to leave things dangling or unexplored and as such the story is as it is.

Yes, fanfiction is supposed build on a ready made foundation (and to a degree I can understand what you mean about them being different) but when you look at some bad fics and see stuff like an actual magic system, explorations of the locations they have made or JKR did you can see the difference.

The Harry Potter world, as given to us by canon, is bare bones. Given very little in the way of exploration or depth as the characters are seemingly uninterested and the story decides to keep them unimportant. JKR gave basic ideas that fanfiction authors have had to flesh out themselves (even JKR had to add more meat to them in subsequent/additional content over the years to actually flesh out her world).

Again, I understand your perspective, but I disagree as when compared to how far fanfiction authors have gone with the basic principles given in canon, she didn't give them a lot to work with.

**** Yes, a story is supposed to flesh out everything to the needed degree, but a) that requires quite a lot of time and effort to do, which means that fanfiction has a big head start when a lot of the world building is already done, and b) canon is typically constrained by what can be commercially published, while fanfiction is not. If a fanfic takes a long time to explore a concept, its reader base may shrink; but an original novel that meanders will probably never be accepted by a publishing house at all.

***** Meandering is not the same as taking a long time to explore a concept.

Meaningless/excessive exposition will, undoubtedly, lead to a lack of interest in many, which arguably effects fanfiction and new authors equally. As it is a sign of poor writing that will make readers automatically check out of the story. I can understand the idea behind your point (comes back to the "sandbox" argument from before) as it is effected by pre-establish popularity that may lead readers to just endure the meandering and keep reading, but that same principle can apply to new books (or even sequels of original works) as many push through the "bad stuff" to get to the good part.

Meandering in stories isn't, to me, any different an issue in scale or importance if you are writing a fanfiction or an original work, as the readers will hate it regardless.

I've made my point about HP specific worldbuilding multiple times in this thread, so look back if you'd like to see my perspective on it.

** Canon was targeted at little kids up to young teens. As such it wasn't as detailed as what older teens or adults would prefer. It also went long enough that the little kids grew up into adults and could have kids of their own.

When you look back at canon with adult eyes you can see the plot holes that were there or the areas of magic that were barely fleshed out. Fanon on the other hand is targeted towards older teens and adults. And it is often focused on correcting those plot holes or fleshing out those areas that canon barely addressed. As such fanon often feels/seems more complete.

In terms of writing quality, a lot of fanon is poorly written (especially from a technical/mechanics viewpoint). It may do a better job fleshing out certain things than canon did but it was written specifically to do that and for many cases an older audience. There are certain fanon authors that are very good and should pursue a writing career (i'll leave that discussion alone as it truly is an eye of the beholder assessment).

Canon gives us the bare bones framework which due to the plot holes and areas barely addressed provides flexibility for fanon authors to pursue any story line they desire and still shoehorn themselves into being "a Harry Potter story".

Some of their efforts I have truly enjoyed others were not my "cup of tea" (coffee drinker by the way üòÅ). But I am truly glad and appreciative that the fanon authors chose to write their stories and share them with the rest of us.

*** Yep, I think you nailed it. Fanfiction has a very long history in the literary world, so I am not dismissing it whatsoever, but from just a story-construction standpoint, a lot of it is pretty terrible (my own is included in that statement, btw). The really great pieces usually are by authors who write 1-2 then begin publishing their own work, and more power to them.

For HP specifically, we're all just creatively playing with the toys that JKR thought up and created. I've never written anything with the scope that she accomplished in creating the HP universe. You said it perfectly when you said that fanfics can specifically appeal to certain audiences. Totally different ballgame than trying to claw out a fanbase from nothing.

** LOVE your take, hahaha, this is fun to think about.

I don't think it is a fair comparison. First off, fanfics 'play in the sandbox' that the OG author created. I have read fanfics that I enjoyed much more than I did the real HP series, but those authors just piggybacked off the characters, environments, settings, and world that JKR thought up. It's much harder to be the one creating all those things, instead of just cherrypicking the things you like and improving the things you don't.

Secondly, fanfic authors have a leg up and are allowed to be lazy (not meant as an insult, specifically; after all, I am a fanfic author!). By that, I mean besides not having to do all the worldbuilding I mentioned above, fanfiction also comes with a built-in audience. There are almost 1 MILLION HP fanfics on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]]. That's a huge number of writers/readers, that are *already interested* in your subject material!! Now, I know that interest doesn't translate to enjoyment - golly, there are tons of ships/fics/tropes that I won't touch with a 10-foot pole - but you have a fanbase waiting for new content. Its the difference between being Stan Lee, and being one of the guys writing for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (is that still on the air? I don't like comic book stuff). So, again, fanfiction has a leg up over 'normal' authors.

Finally, and here's where I agree with you, JKR was a shit-awful YA author. Her plots were full of deus ex machinas, tired tropes, and dissatisfying conclusions. Character development in the later books was a total afterthought (Ginny might have been perfect for Harry in JKR's mind, but came out of left field in her writing. "monster in the chest" indeed....). What JKR *excelled at*, though, was children's stories. Books 1, 2, 3 were outstanding writing! She did such a great job of making you love and root for the Trio when they were little kids. I would hold up her first 3 books as being as tremendous and realistic as any fantasy story aimed at children could be. It's just that she did not have the same talent and ability to write for YA/adults, and that comes through clear as day in books 5-7 and all of her subsequent works.

That's my response, what do you think? Thanks for bringing this up, didn't realize I had so much to say!

*** I'm gonna butcher my response to someone else in this thread to the "sandbox" argument, as I don't entirely disagree. It is a lot easier, from a reader and writers perspective, to use pre-established material than to build from scratch. HOWEVER, I think JKR did a remarkably simplistic and barebones approach to her world, her characters and the storyline in general that has facilitated some incredibly in depth, nuanced and intriguing ideas, plotlines and concepts that are (effectively) entirely beholden to the authors who came up with them as JKR gave them so little to work with. Again, I agree it is harder to come up with something new than it is to work off pre-established material: but a lot of the fanfics I think of when making this argument could just change some names around and publish their works as their own individual stories and it would be well within their rights to their popularity afterwards.

To segue, although I understand the sentiment behind your Stan Lee anecdote (and think the show's over???) I point to the fact that that was still rife with it's own starting out problems that JKR/Stan Lee would have had to deal with too. Yes they are benefitting from utilising pre-established material with a pre-established fanbase (which, in a way, JKR did with fans of fantasy, just to a differing degree to fanfiction authors) authors still have to: come up with the 'unique' premise of their story, establish their plot, establish how they are going etc. They are still telling a story, with all the trappings that come with it, the beginning stage is just a bit different.

** Fanfiction does some things better. I like reading digressions into magical theory, and different magic systems, and canon has barely any of that, while fanfiction explores it quite a bit. But for overall quality of writing, especially dialogue, canon is better than any fanfiction, and leagues better than the vast majority of fics.

** First, it's a lot easier to edit than to write. Basically, all fanfiction authors are editing JKR's works. She did all the heavy lifting of creating this universe that we love to nitpick to death and tweak to our own ends.

Second, there is a lot of really crappy fanfic out there. I don't think you can support a blanket statement that it's better.

**** A badly done central character is much worse for a story than having a background character of no importance in a series with many, many other characters that do have personalities and traits. Also, Daphne in the series does not have a physical description at all.
