Literally found less than ten dedicated to Technomancy, and I wanna know why are there so little about the subject?


** In my opinion the answer is pretty obvious in that its a REALLY hard subject matter to write about without some sort of engineering or technological knowledge. Magic (being made up), can be really stretched, but once you start incorporating technology that exists or connects to realistic possibilities in the future/past then it gets extra complicated.

** Your question could have several answers, depending on how you define Technomancy.

Do you mean wizard-based technology, like brooms, wirelesses and Dark detectors? Those fics might give it another name, like Enchanting, Runecrafting, Artificing, etc.

Or are you referring to adapting existing Muggle technology to work with magic? A number of fics mention it - either in passing or as some evangelical exercise to wake the masses up from relying on "antiquated" wizardry - and will refer to such practices as Technomancy.

*** Both, I'm looking for a happy medium between Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei(Irregular at magic high school) and Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Maō(Demon king Daimao). Kinda disappointed no attempted it yet.

** Both of my current fics have technomancy in them as significant elements, though secondary. In Darkness Ascendant it will become a larger element to the story but never the primary element.

edit: technomancy in my stories is recreating technology with magical artifacts and melding tech and magic to do things that were impossible or impractical to do with just magic or tech on their own.
