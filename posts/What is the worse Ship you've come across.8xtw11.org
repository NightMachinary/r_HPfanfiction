I don't just mean disgusting ships (Though feel free to include them, I'm sure there are tons) but ones that are just too out there, or weird, ones that just don't really fit together even if the Author writes a really good convincing story for them it still makes you go ehhh and feel a bit like nope.

For me it was when I read a story that wasn't originally meant to be a romance story but ended up only doing that with a Snape/Luna pairing.


** 11 year old Hermione with Hagrid.

Has anyone else noticed that all the really fucked up fics on AO3 get an extremely high amount of views?

***** But that is a horrible statement by itself, because it basically says that being conceived in rape means that you cannot feel love. HP even has the nerve to call it poetic justice, which is disgusting. There are tens of thousands children of rape and non of them is less deserving than anyone else.

I can completely understand a writer's need to correct/rebel against this bullshit.

TMR was a psychopath, fine, there does not have to be a reason for that and that he was conceived in rape was absolutely not his fault and is surely not the reason.

** there are a bunch of ships that i think are really bad and gross just because most of the fics promote and romanticise abuse but hands down the ship i'm most uncomfortable with now is sirius/hermione, and it's purely because i read a fic on lj where she had (lots of) sex with him in dog form and i wanted to die. it wasn't even tagged it was just a regular cute get together fic and then boom bestiality.

I once, dear lord this once tramuatised me, I like to read Snape-Mentors-Harry. And this one had him where Harry turned into a black cat animagus and ended up at Snape's door and snape takes him, soon realizing who it is. And then becomes his 'Master' and at night while sleeping harry turns back into human form and Snape has sex with him, but he's back to cat form when he wakes up. And it just basically goes on and on like that. And that's just disturbing to me, cause he otherwise treats him exactly like a cat and it's just no

** All of the Weasleycest pairings seem especially gross to me but other than that, I dislike when the author has to rewrite the character's personality to make the ship work and doesn't do so via actual plot. For example, I don't mind Dramione if their relationship develops through a plot that has them making concessions, changing opinions etc along the way but I hate when Draco is just randomly obsessed with Hermione for no reason, and not any effort is made to explain how he fell for her except for her "chocolate eyes". Actually, come to think of it, I hate all ships where anyone has chocolate eyes, lol.

******* They are described I think (I could be wrong) as dark as black or something like that. But no one's eyes are all black, they may appear black because they are so dark but yeah. I just assume they look black because of his eyes being dark brown. He didn't go all voldemort with his all red-eyes, voldie doesn't even have the white part of the eyes anymore. I could be wrong but I think if he his eye color changed it would be like a voldemort change, with no whites to his eyes. I can't really see Snape as a person who would go about changing his eye color for shits and giggles, like people with colored contacts.

I just think the over-usage is annoying really. I mean it's original when only a few fis but i can't even think of a fic with Snape as main char that doesn't use 'obsidian' now. I think Coal would be a better description for him really. If you want to continue the black eyes thing

#+begin_quote
  After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child. For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is. Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

** Not this fandom, but in Supernatural there's "Weecest", an offshoot of "Wincest" in which the two main characters (brothers) are shipped. Weecest is when they are a kid and preteen or teen and preteen respectively. There were a ton of people who tried to argue that it wasn't kiddie porn...but it is.

******* I never meant to compare them, simply that I disliked reading both of those kind of fanfics, not that the material in them (BDSM and Pedophilia) were at all comparable in themselves or equal to one another in moral wrongness or rightness.

The only comparison I meant to make was that I dislike reading them. There is no other relation to them in my mind other than that, I'm not some ignorant person who thinks they are similar in any way. I think you're reading into it too much, I can understand why, a lot of people have misunderstandings or misgivings about BDSM etc, to each their own I say, they're (the people into reading BDSM or practicing it) not hurting anyone. Perhaps I also should have worded it differently, I just assumed you would know what I meant. So my mistake.

Usually I do not read those, but there are plenty of times it is not mentioned either in the summary, warnings or A/N. I'll find this great summary and interesting premise only to find it nothing but smut after a mere two chapters. It's disappointing. I don't mind sex scenes, but I like it with plot, and to be promised a plot where the sex has a cause rather than just to exist, then find out it was all about porn is disappointing for me.

Some people like those fics, and that is just fine by me. That's okay that's what they like. I simply do not. I just get upset when I find a story I really want to read based off a summary only to be disappointed, because they didn't properly tag it. That is all.

******* Nowhere has J K Rowling explicitly stated that Hermione was the smartest witch of her age. Just because Lupin said it one time that Hermione was exceptionally smart does not mean she is the smartest witch in her generation. There are other schools of magic where there might be someone who is smarter than her.

Or there might be someone who is Dumbledore/Voldemort level in magic and be around her age.

Achieving high marks does not make you the smartest witch of the generation. If she was exceptionally intelligent, she would have been a little below Voldemort level. (Voldemort was making horcruxes at the age of sixteen. Sure, Dumbledore removed the books but there are other powerful and obscure magics in the Library). She would have been able to hold at least against the inner circle death eaters without extra training from Harry.

And she would have definitely used her brain when those two death eaters attacked the trio in the London cafe and killed them instead of providing them mercy(which lead to Remus Lupin's death as one of them was ?Dolohov?).

This is really a terrible argument for HP protagonists, because:

- The wizarding world was very small, and Hogwarts was the ONLY magical school in Britain. The kids didn't have a lot of choices unless they were willing to marry Muggles or foreigners.
- Harry's generation was further bonded by the War. Most named characters in the Books went through hell and back together, and you think they were your AVERAGE high school teens?
- Not 'EVERYONE' married their high school sweet-hearts. We know that Harry, Ron, Neville, and George did. Luna married someone else called Rolf SCAMANDER. Cho was confirmed by JKR to have married a Muggle of Chinese descent. Draco married someone from the school, but not his 'sweet heart' Pansy. We don't know whom Dean, Seamus, Katie, Susan, Justin, Michael, Parvati, Padma, Anthony, Dennis, Terry, Romilda, Daphne, Pansy, and most others ended up with!
- In case of Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, they were best friends and war comrades whose relationships were closer than the greatest majority of your average high schoolers could possibly imagine.

As for Ginny:

- Went with him into the DoM at age 14,
- Fought against for him in the Astronomy Tower,
- Tried to steal the Gryffindor Sword next year.
- She and Neville braved the terror and torture, organized the students, and drummed up just enough manpower to win the Battle of Hogwarts
- She was the one who brought Harry out of his funk during Christmas of Year 5
- She and Harry were total Quidditch buddies
- She completely supported him after the Sectumsempra incident (unlike Hermione)

****** I actually thought Fred and Hermione could've been a thing if he hadn't died. If I recall correctly, Fred had gotten especially angry at Draco for calling Hermione a mudblood for the first time and Fred has to be physically restrained from attacking him. If you think about it, Fred was born with a wizard background and most likely would've drawn his wand, but he didn't. He wanted a go at Malfoy physically. (This was when Ron's broken wand backfired slugs on him.) There was probably other things going on in his mind, but taking that scene into consideration made sense.

There was another point I did not thought about, but I wanted to quote this by Naila Hadjiyeva:

#+begin_quote
  Another hint is when Hermione is punched by the twins Boxing Telescope. Fred instantly offers her a healing balm, which by itself isn't a big deal until you consider their nature. The Twins has never showed an inch of remorse or sympathy when victims of their pranks arise, even when it comes to their own family, which begs the question, why does she get special treatment?
#+end_quote

There were others, but the point is Fred and Hermione could've been compatible for on another. Kind of like James and Lily's jokiness and seriousness (if those are even words). Fred would brought the fun side of Hermione, while Hermione kept Fred in check from having his or his brother's pranks from going too far. This does not even included the fact that Hermione could tell the Twins apart.

Despite his more mischievous side, Fred does have a strong sense of loyalty and a sense of right and wrong when it counts. Over time, I really think Fred and Hermione could have gotten together if Fred had lived.
