1) No Lupin/Tonks. If they do happen, it's up to the point she gets pregnant, but then they separate.

2) Harry/Daphne. Don't worry, she's not going to be the ‘Ice Queen'. I simply needed a female Slytherin with a flower name that already existed in canon, and it wasn't about to be Pansy. Speaking of which, Pansy will be shown in a slightly better light.

3) No redemption of Snape; minor redemption of Dumbledore.

4) Restoration of the DA.

5) Ginny is a background character.

6) Harry will still be friends with Ron and Hermione, but not quite as close. This forces both of them to realize their flaws.

7) More violence. This is war, and that there was only one, maybe two actual battles in canon is really odd.

Also the changing point of this story is that Daphne and Astoria's cousins from Denmark move in with them, so please provide information on anything to do with the Danish people, as I've never been to Denmark and don't want to stereotype them.

(Oh and if anyone has a good reason for two kids to transfer from Durmstrang right into a war zone, please provide it as well. Also any headcanons on the school.)

*** But really, how is your fic any different from thousands other post OOTP indy!Harry ones?

Since Daphne is already an OC, what does adding more OCs from Denmark do to the story? You are not even from Denmark and seem to be not familiar with this country at all.

Actually, the fandom is so full of 'Harry alienating from Ron/Hermione' that indy!Harry fics with an intact Trio are very hard to find. Remember that his friendship with Ron and Hermione was forged through life and death struggles, and he could count on their loyalty during terrible times. Even Ginny had shown her loyalty through the foundation of DA and the Battle of DoM. Why should suddenly a newcomer with hardly any proven track record gain Harry's trust? Lots of girls in the school had rather nefarious design on the BWL (Romilda Vane), and canon Harry was perfectly justified in being paranoid. Your Daphne better show that she could help Harry significantly with deeds, not only words.

***** You said Harry wouldn't be as close to them, and that would "force both of them to realise their flaws". That's pretty much the standard "Harry gets new and better pureblood friends, and the mudblood and the ginger traitor realise how badly they have been treating Harry" plot. Coupled with Greengrass as the girlfriend, and her family playing important roles, that pretty much seems to be yet another "Harry/Daphne" fic, where Ron and Hermione are at best minor side characters.

******* 1) Yeah. Special pureblood OCs playing important roles sounds like the standard pureblood trope to me.

2) Yes. But while Harry ending up a little less close to his best friends - who went through hell together with him - because he wants to spend more time with his girlfriend might be plausible enough, him making a whole new group of friends, instead of pulling Greengrass into his old group of friends (doubly so if her cousin is a Gryffindor too) is pushing it too much, in my opinion. Especially with Voldemort around. You'd have to be a special kind of idiot to focus on a bunch of untested strangers (from Slytherin and Durmstrang, even!) instead of those who joined you in battle already - for years, in Ron's and Hermione's case.

3) You said he "wouldn't be as close to them", even though there's no reason for that just because he's dating a girl. If they are his best friends, then what's this shit about "force them to confront their flaws"? Why turn to OCs if you have a perfectly good group of loyal and brave friends already?

Quite simple, why do you need to chase the typical "Harry dates Daphne, and drops his friends" plot, instead of Harry dragging Daphne into the DA and his circle of friends? That would be original - a Daphne who is the outsider, who has to prove herself, and who has to adjust her biased pureblood views.

*** Furthermore, I have these plot considerations:

- Dumbledore's redemption is achieved by taking competent actions in teaching Harry effectively and preparing the Order for his eventual demise. I expect to see Dumbledore showing Harry all the memories within a few hours, telling Harry about the danger of a Taboo, and offering different options in defeating an individual with Horcruxes.
- Daphne could confirm Harry's suspicion that Draco was a Death Eater and planning terrorist activities in the school. She could further offer to remove the Trace for Harry and his friends through her family's 'connections'. Her parents could advise him to go after Death Eater finances, such as seizing Lestrange and Malfoy vaults, if Harry stepped up to support Minister Scrimgeour and their factions. Also, Greengrass faction might provide additional material support if the Order agreed to a common goal.
- Daphne prompted Harry to restart DA.
- Draco was caught red handed, thanks to Daphne's support. He was forced to cooperate. The Order might 'kidnap' Narcissa to maintain the appearance.
- Voldemort showed up to defend his Cup when the Ministry was trying to seize the Lestrange Vault. He didn't succeed, many got killed in the battle, and Goblins were pissed at Voldemort.
- Pansy and Parkinsons defected following that Voldemort's defeat.

#+end_quote

Did I mention 'pureblood culture' at all? One big shortcoming of HBP/DH is that Harry didn't understand to utilize available resources. Hermione, despite her intelligence, had no clue about anti-terrorism and counterinsurgency operations. If there was something Daphne and her faction could bring to help Harry, politics and strategies would be their key contributions.

It's a cliche, but I think it actually makes sense. Of course, I would cut out all the pureblood culture stuffs, although the Greengrass faction certainly wanted preferential treatments after the war.

Was the Greengrass faction truly benign, and why would it suddenly help out Harry? Well, it obviously saw Voldemort as a systemic threat and bad for its business/influence. It was mostly made up of people like Slughorn, who possessed significant power and wealth, but were not courageous enough to fight on their own. Dumbledore originally didn't trust it, but with time running out for him, was willing to accept it as the lesser evil.

Regardless whether Harry was interested in politics or not, he had to accept it. For example, seizing the Lestrange vault to compensate the Longbottoms would be a perfect reason, Hurting Death Eater finances would be an added plus, and getting the Cup in the process was just the icing on the cake. Daphne would be able to explain very easily to Harry that for every X amount of Galleons seized from Death Eater vaults, there would be one fewer assassin/murderer for hire. JKR might not want to bring up true anti terrorism strategies in her children's book, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't either.
