"tongues battling for dominance" is an immediate fuck no. Also "emerald orbs", "chocolate-brown eyes", "Hermione screeched/said in a shrill voice" etc.

And while I won't quit reading "I'm Harry! Just Harry!" is a bit stale too.


** In addition to orbs instead of eyes there's form instead of body. Using them occasionally is fine, but it's like some people are allergic to the words eyes and body.

I especially find raven to be obnoxious for describing hair because it's overused/abused. The worst is when they refer to Harry as "the raven".

Other is pretty bad too because people will just use the word on its own instead of saying "the other boy/girl/wizard/witch/etc". Outside of fanfiction I've only seen it used alone when dehumanizing someone, so it's just weird to see it used all the time for characters an author clearly likes. Think of the Others in ASOIAF.

I stopped reading most HP het smut due to overuse of the term skullfucking. It's not as common as a weeping penis, but one day I came across so many in a row I just gave up.

Yeah. It's not even only with Harry. Draco Malfoy is "the blond"/ insert description of "aristocratic pureblood", Ginny or Lily is "the red-head"/insert description of "fiery",

Blond/e and red-head don't bother me as much though because at least the author isn't trying to give the character some ridiculously flowery description.

***** So I'm going to go on my own little rant here.

Incest will not produce physical deformities unless it is practiced for /generations/. Like on the order of ten or more. Every degree of separation will further increase the time necessary for deformities to appear. Having children with first cousins, while gross, isn't likely to give you the Hunchback of Notre-Dame on any appreciable timescale that would matter. Even one or two infusions of outside DNA during that period will massively delay deformities. Hell, the smallest sustainable human population to avoid genetic problems is 160 people. That is /tiny/. The purebloods of HP are not really inbred. They are inbred inasmuch as any small community is inbred.

The biggest risk of inbreeding is genetic disease, because inbreeding increases the chances of having the faulty form of a gene.

The fact is, if Sirius' parents were attractive, he is /very/ likely to be just as attractive seeing as he has their genes. The same is true for anyone else.

Of course i don't myself understand why Rowling would ever choose Malfoys to be redeemed either, afterall the fact that Malfoys aren't inbred doesn't make their actions any less monstrous. People seem to forget they gave a 11 year old girl a cursed diary that set set a basilisk on a bunch of children and the fact that no one died was purely coincidental.

********* No. Tom Felton is redeemed, because stuff. Draco not particularly, at least as far as Madame Rowling shows it, as outside of him nodding to Harry in the epilogue for fjord-knows-what-reason-that-will-never-be-known there isn't anything that would give him redemption, and the only reason that he wasn't a monster was that he failed to act like one, not that he didn't want to be or that he struggled in a clash of ideals but he was not strong enough to pull the trigger even though he wanted to do it.

There are some fanfics that go deeper into that and actually try to do something about it. I enjoyed one called “The Elite”, if you want a random recommendation there, but that's basically it. Canon does weird things sometimes, and this is one of those times.

  After the war, Harry decided to leave Britain to start a bird of prey sanctuary in California. He didn't go alone, Fawkes and Buckbeak left with him. Very soon the park became so famous that Harry became a well known name in the Zoological world. Could this Science Fair he was invited to participate in in New York possibly change his rather lonely existence?

** Any sex scene usually has a lot of reasons to make me wince. I make a fair amount of my living writing erotica, so I'm used to seeing pretty ridiculous phraseology, but fandom is just this whole other kettle of terrifying, sexed-up fish.

- Manhood/womanhood is very cringey
- The word "turgid" is not sexy, and yet...
- Her "core" - your core is for yoga, not for banging
- Her "most intimate place"
- Her "flower" /"His hardness" or "her wetness" like, */please no**

In terms of character, I think people just trying to change up language and not realizing they're saying something completely different to what they mean - the sort of thing where you're reading something and it feels like the person has recently digested an old thesaurus.

And then just Americans who don't understand where the story is set. Whether it's calling Hogwarts "English" or acting as if "Britain" is some sort of tea-drinking monolith, but then just using a lot of American slang and phrases that don't fit.

**** What I will say initially is that while I've written erotic romance in the past, the majority of what I write is straight erotica, which means the poetry is part of the banging rather than it being symbolic for the canoodling*.

So, firstly, the most important thing I'd recommend is considering overall sensation. In the act of sex, the entire body can be erotic, and one should be thinking about general sensation that may not be linked straight to one's hanky-panky toolbox.

For example:

- The hair: the sensation of hands through hair, hairs standing on end, the weight of partner's hair on your own skin
- The mouth: dry with anticipation, lips dry or chapped or wet or bruised from kissing
- The skin: hot or cold, wet with sweat or still dry, whether anything is pressing or rubbing on the skin (such as bed sheets, etc)
- The nipples
- The thighs
- Twitches of muscles, burning in muscles from holding a position
- Internal sensations such as muscle twitches, wetnesses or rushes of liquid, weights within someone, etc
- The feet (not necessarily gross stuff, but the position of the feet and spread of legs, etc.)

Secondly, I'd actually recommend reading guides to the body in general - descriptions of stuff should be as rooted in physicality as possible rather than being overtly poetic or allegorical, but it's really a matter of rooting your reader in this whole host of physical sensation that doesn't just happen in one's genitalia.

In erotica, your "sexy parts" can, effectively, be all your parts, as that sinks one into the fantasy the best.

What I will say is that there's a fine line for describing genitalia - just like "orbs" is ridiculous for eyes, but "optical stalks" is just scientific and weird, you have a similar line when describing genitalia, but with about 5000 more words to choose from.

Some hot and heavy tips for descriptors are:

- *Does your word choice match the setting?* For example, I love the word "cunny", but it's only appropriate in medieval settings or when you're looking at a character like Thor Odinson. Word choices like this can be a subtle way to steep your reader further into your setting - especially in HP, where different readers see it as more liberal or conservative.
- *Is your word too scientific?* So "penis", "vagina", "vulva" and "anus" are all going to be a little too detached - they're not very sexy in themselves.
- *Is your word too florid or poetic?* So again, "manhood", "womanhood" are very much OTT, as is any sort of flower imagery, but it can be subtler than that and still be over the line - such as "turgid length" or "wetness". They're too vague and don't really lend themselves to imaginations.
- *Is your word choice IC?* If you're writing from a particular character's POV, whether it be in 1st person, 2nd person or some kind of 3rd-person omnipotent narrative, you need to consider whether a character /would/ use certain words. A big tough gangster is likely to be more comfortable throwing around cocks and cunts than a lovely little shul-going guy who can barely ask for sausage at his local deli, you know?
- *How serious is this scene?* So, if you're trying to make your reader laugh, ignore pretty much everything I've said. Definitely go in for the obscene, ridiculous, poetic nonsense. But also consider the emotional weight of the sex scene, what it's being done for, what the feelings are between the characters; a rivalry is going to conjure up a more aggressive scene with words one might spit out, but two long-time lovers might have a more gentle encounter, and might even have particular pet names or in-jokes, you know?

The most important thing is just practice, though! The more you write it, the better you'll get.

***** Huh. I would have said "turgid length" was more OTT than manhood/womanhood, which are merely coy and boring, and even appropriate, depending on the setting. For example, if you're writing Victorian or Edwardian-era characters, I wouldn't blink at the narrative using "manhood" and "cockstand," whereas in a modern-day setting they'd just make me laugh (and then back-button).

Also, gonna disagree about "vulva." I think it can be sexy. Ditto labia. They conjure up a more specific visual, IMO. Even penis can be used in persuasive way.

I also want to put in a good word for colloquial language, and in HP I've seen excellent smut incorporating terms like quim, stones, fanny, nads, stiffie (very schoolboy), and obviously bollocks. It flows from characterization, of course. I don't see Harry using "quim."

Pretty much agree with everything you say here, though.

******* Yeah, apologies, I wasn't thinking about pro erotica when making the colloquial list. That was entirely HP-focused. Which is why 'fanny' is on there, for the UK usage rather than the US one, because the latter's rather silly.

And I admit, I made an exception for penis based solely on A Bittersweet Potion, in which Harry's fifteen and having his first uncontrollable erections, and constantly having to tell himself "Don't think about the penis." The scenes are humorous and self-conscious, but the usage also shades later into genuinely erotic moments because it's already been associated with Harry's confusion and growing awareness/discomfort/excitement. I'd say the story eroticizes the word through context rather than the word itself being instrinsically sexual. It also acquires an edge because it's transgressive, i.e., underage. IIRC, you don't like any of the Snape/Harry you've read, so I don't expect you to agree with me, but from my point of view the use of 'penis' worked exceedingly well.

***** It rather isn't. I put the thorn in the text because it is an easy way to make something superficially appear more antiquated without necessarily showing more depth, so it served as a showcase, and I actually do have it prepared for copy-pasting because there is a place where occasionally I use it when talking to a few people for amusement (since they seem to like it); I have no idea if there actually are authors who use it in writing any fanfics, but I am leaning towards “probably not”.

I can enjoy something that sounds antiquated when it is used in the right places and by the right characters because then it increases the immersion and even with the few unusual characters that Old English has (thorn, wynn, ash, the works) it would not be that difficult to get through it if you just take a look at the letter/character/whatever table for Old English. But that's when people actually give themselves a reason to use it in their works, and in those cases they tend to research it at least at the most basic level so while the exact writing is not as it would have been in Old English (now /that/ would have been a nightmare), it gives the vibes of being antiquated and olde-Englishy without being annoying. Heck, it's the same thing as with writing down accents: do it well and it's good, do it half-assedly and I really want a pitchfork and a torch.

And then there are people who put it in for the sake of putting it in. Those people generally don't research it any, it's usually copy-pasting /something/ and leaving it at that or writing dialogue that is /supposed/ to be antiquated but really is just full of exaggerated speech and old words (but the 9th-century /antiquated/ and /olde-Englishy/ knight still says “OK” and “cool”). Much of that is simply so cliched by now that it's not really worth looking at, and there are a few people who are so clueless with what they are doing that their attempts end up being immersion-breaking nonsense.

Of course, it all depends on one being able to accept the highly-AU worlds of their stories, so I can see why you would think that I had a bone to pick with them.

So I thought I'd go take a look at God vs. Merlin in the books and there's an even split - 17 each.

That said, six of the Gods came from Ron and two from Draco, while Hermione only used it once and Harry only twice. (Also two from Fudge, and one from Molly, Lupin, Ted Tonks, and an unnamed Muggle woman in HBP.)

Four of the Merlins came from Ron, three from Arthur, two from Fudge, two from Slughorn, and one from Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Amos Diggory, Crouch!Moody, and Aunt Muriel.

So what I'm taking from this is wizards do actually use God (usually "My God" or "Thank God") as slang as often as they use Merlin.

** Gotta say "I'm Harry! Just Harry!" bugs me quite a bit... probably because that's exactly what I don't want Harry to be. Silly or not, I want my main character to be special and awesome. Usually.

Y'know.. that also contradicts with the Sorting Hat's line, what did he say? Harry has a great thirst to prove himself?

Except he doesn't. He never displays that.

Even in situations where he'd be totally justified to be proud of things he's done, he isn't and doesn't care if anyone knows - perfect example being the Basilisk.

If you've got good examples to prove me wrong, I'd be happy to see them.

** Voldie or any variation thereof.

I don't think it's funny or cute and so totally out of character that it's jarring no matter when it's used. I especially hate it when it's used during an action scene since it's just too damn ridiculous to be able to take anything seriously after that. Plus, once one character says it in a fic, it's like a damn virus that spreads to the others (I mean, am I really expected to believe that someone like Snape is going to call Voldemort 'Voldie'...?)

**** Unfortunately I don't have any links on hand to share but I've run across it a few times and it makes me cringe every time. The worst offender I can think of was one where it was basically used as a rallying cry during a battle (à la "let's show Voldie what we're made of!") and from that point forward everyone, including Snape, used it. Which was... really unfortunate, IMO.

***** OMG, me too! The characterizations are very off putting and cliche.

Sirius: This one bugs me hard since he's my favorite character. Sirius was a child prodigy, notably gifted and talented, whip smart and had a dark edge. A /very/ dark edge. He was a Black and was borderline sociopathic. When people portray Sirius as a whiny, stupid kid who gets 'T's instead of 'O's I want to punch something. I want to punch the author. Yes, he was reckless but recklessness does not equate to stupidity nor does it equate to being a silly, whiny that is nothing but a womanizer. He was immature because he was in Azkaban and he should be given credit for the way he turned out. Sirius is a just a better kind of Snape. Kinder and more carefree with better morals. He wasn't a drunk, nor was he a womanizer, he certainly was not stupid and he was very dark. Sirius is a lighter shade of grey. This is one of the reasons I don't ship bloody Wolfstar. Sirius is always stupid.

I once read a fic where he pushed aside a first year who was soaking wet and lily wanted to hex him so badly. Wait, yes, Sirius was cruel but he was also kind and thoughtful. He isn't that type of cruel.

James: Just because James had a rivalry with Snape and 'stole' Lily from him does not mean that he hexed everyone he saw nor does it mean that he only existed to stalk Lily. It also doesn't mean that he was stupid or was the god of Transfiguration. James was much deeper than that.

Remus: Moony must've been not boring since he arrived late to his very first class and then proceeded to dress boggart!snape in an old woman's clothes so forgive me when I close a fic when he only moans at Sirius and James's antics. Remus was mischievous. Besides, why is he always addicted to chocolate? The assumption that he was the smartest because he was bookish is ridiculous. Sirius and James were the top of their year and by Lupin down words they beat Lily and Snape at Potions.

Peter: Wormtail was not a stupid tag-along. Period.

Lily: Ah! Dear Lily, all hail Lily full of grace and you'll be spared from eternal darkness forevermore. The fandom made me loathe Lily Evans. She is just the most overrated character to ever exist. Lily was described as pretty? If Lily isn't the hottest girl to ever graduate from Hogwarts and makes a veela look like a hag then you are bashing Lily! If Lily doesn't get straight 'O's at every single subject then you are bashing Lily and clearly haven't read the books. FYI, Lily was only described as genuinely bright at Potions so she was average in all subjects except Potions. I personally believe her grades were like Harry's except she got an O on potions instead of DADA.

Lily is the kindest girl Hogwarts has ever seen. She's everyone's favorite student and she's just very honest. Her temper is adorable and everyone admires her friendship with Snape because she's just soooooo selfless to befriend him and break stereotypes. She apologizes to her owl, (who most likely has the name Hedwig) because she was a second late from untying the letter. How selfish! Lily Evans, who cast the patronus charm, wandlessly and nonverbally at the tender age of nine is the best girl in her year. She's best friends with Dumbledore and McGonagall too!

If Lily isn't like Hermione then it's a hate crime. Lily in canon was bubbly, extroverted, relaxed, a daredevil, insecure, very funny, cheeky, vivacious and gave the impression that she'd much rather party than read a book. Why is Lily always a bookworm? Where did that come from?

Don't get me started on the temper! That stupid temper! Lily Evans yells at James Potter whenever she sees him and /she's just so beautiful when she's angry, right Padfoot?/ But wait, Sirius is now busy cheating on Emmeline Vance with Alice Prewett and Hestia Jones. (All the Order ladies were the same age as the Marauders, didn't you know?)

Oh, and how Marlene McKinnon is always Lily's best friend who is Sirius Black's love interest. She only exists to complain about bloody Sirius Black while Lily drones on about James Potter. She is then found kissing Sirius. And she's always a female version of Sirius. Always. She's very beautiful but Lily is ethereal.

I could go on and on and on and on and /on/.

** I know I'm late, but didn't see it mentioned so AK, AKed, AK'ed, AK'd, Avada'd or any shortening of /Avada Kedavra/ I haven't experienced brings the quality of a fic down a whole notch IMO. I know authors don't like to be repetitive. But JKR provided the option of /killing curse/ and describing the spell as apart of the scene (/green flash, whiz, crack, light.../)

I know people use on Reddit for convenience, but it should stay out of fanfiction. I'm I wrong?

*** You know, I could see it being used in a dialog context, maybe in a discussion between two Aurors.

Harry looked down at the body. The man was flat on this back, eyes staring sightlessly up at him. The man's half-open mouth gave him the creeps and he looked away, catching sight of Ron coming towards him. Ron looked down at the man, nudging his leg with his heavy boot. "AK?" he asked and Harry grunted.

"Must have been. Poor bastard."

So, in that context, it's used as a shorthand between two colleagues who don't need to say Avada Kedavra all the time. But, if it's a general narration, then it's just dumb.

Harry whirled around, casting an AK at the man creeping up behind him, watching in grim satisfaction as the man crumpled like an empty paper bag.

Not quite the same impact there.
