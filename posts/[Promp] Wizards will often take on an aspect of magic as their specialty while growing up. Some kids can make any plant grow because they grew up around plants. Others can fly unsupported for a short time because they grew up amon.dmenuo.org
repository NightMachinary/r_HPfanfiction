*** Seeing the quantity of "Remindme" show two things.

First: people don't know how to use it and/or read (seriously there should be a rule or something somewhere to explain it to people).

Second: No pressure and expectations on you at all. Hope you deliver. Good luck and see you in a month.

#+begin_example
  Ok. First formatting. The paragraphs are not tabbed, and are seperated by a new line. I prefer to tab each paragraph, without a new line, and to use new lines to indicate a new scene. I hope this makes sense. However,
#+end_example

if you like it the way it is, you do you. I'm not sure Harry should be able to remember his Dudly's fourth birthday that well. Maybe his sixth or seventh? Show not tell. Show us the humor. Hagrid did (humorous action) etc. otherwise it is kind of boring.

I really hope this criticism doesn't get you down. What I have said is mostly a quality of writing thing. Not too big in the grand scheme of things. (see the hunger games lol).

What you need to start next is dialog. everytime a new person speaks, new paragraph.

Also, keep writing. Do not edit untill you are done. Don't look back. It will be bad at first, but that can (and will) be fixed.

I believe in you.

p.s who is the villian this time? Quirral? Edit, fucked up reddit formatting lol.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I would like to see this taken in different directions outside of this. Would young children with mental illnesses develop in ways that further them or heal them? Obviously there is more than one factor that goes into determining what, lets term them "Aspects" for now in lack of a better term, develops. So do these Aspects follow a Hierarchy of Needs?

If so we need to define what this hierarchy is, and luckily Maslow did this for us already(Least important to Most Important):

×Self-Actualization\\
×Esteem(Prestige and Accomplishment)\\
×Belonging and Love\\
×Safety\\
×Physiological(Food, Water, Warmth, Rest)

Now we need to establish the relevent rules that govern magic:\\
×Good food can't be created (Gamp's Law)\\
×Magic has a punishment for delving into the forbidden/dark/mysterious(Fundamental Law)\\
×It is impossible to create Love\\
×Conjured animals tend to have certain characteristics if not conjured properly, normally with wrongly shaped limbs or a fusion between two animals.(*Principle of Artificianimate Quasi-Dominance*) ×True Reanimation is "supposedly" impossible(One of the strongest artifacts in Wizarding Lore can't do it)\\
×You can only go back in time 5 hours without injuring time or the traveler(Croaker's Law)\\
×Aspects can effect the physical realm outside of the user(Plant Growth)*\\
×Aspects can effect the physical body of the user(Quick Healing)\\
×Aspects can effect the energies around the user(Flight)

*Food can be enlarged or even duplicated so the growing of already existing plant material, especially if the plant is in an environment that would be suitable for growth anyway, is not a violation of Gamp's Law.

With those things established let us move forward assuming that Aspects work by providing the most important Needs before the Needs of lesser importance, and that Aspects are attempts of magic using the user's interests to fulfill the Hierarchy of Needs when applicable. As the Need moves farther from Self-Actualization however, the Aspect takes less of the child's own interests into account. For credit's sake lets call this Maslow's Law.

Using Hermione as an example we will work up the list of needs. Growing up she had a home that provided all of her Physiological and Safety Needs. What she lacks is Belonging, due to not having any friends growing up. Combining this with her interests in books, a suitable Aspect following Maslow's Law would be something along the lines of animating books to be her friends. Perhaps even using book as a Pensieve to literally live through the life of of a main character of novels in a form of escapism to gain friends that way.

Luna is going to be my next and last subject that I examine using this method. This time I will be working slightly backwards. Being Nine years old when her mother died it is very likely that Luna already had an Aspect(Most likely something to do with Animals, maybe talking to them) , but with the sudden death of her mother a very large portion of her Love Needs was left empty. I would argue that with that her Aspect shifted from whatever it was for a short time to help her cope with this. Shifting into an Aspect that allowed her to conjure small animals that were under the effect's of the PoAQD to provide her with love and affection. But after her Needs where fulfilled her magic reverted back to it's original Aspect, leaving her with memories and dreams of misshapen animals that no one else believes exist because she conjured them as a child.
