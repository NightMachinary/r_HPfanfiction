** Pureblood Pretense hands down. Really nice building of the pureblood society and the the poorer community too. Especially in the second and third years of the story. The only problem is that the first year does seem to be a little slow, and was harder for me to reread. Whereas I happily reread the second and especially the third year over and over again.

The whole world is significantly different to canon since Voldemort had a more political approach to taking over the magical world. Linkffn(7613196)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. (This one is not 75k+ yet, but give it a week or two and it will be)

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

*** From my experience when someone says "realistic" in any series with magic they don't mean that it couldn't happen in reality, they mean that they don't believe the progression of the story from A-->B (in this case the use of magic in the military), makes sense.

Saying it's magic, it's not supposed to make sense doesn't apply here (and shouldn't apply anywhere really, except a few soft magic systems like when Gandalf comes back in LotR, where your sense of wonder is supposed to supersede the need for logic), since he's not criticizing the magic itself, he's criticizing the use of it.

At least that's how I read his comment.

******* I think I recall starting to read this fic... Does Harry use his magic like a one-man flamethrower? It was that way at least starting off I think. From what I remember, Harry never got a complete Hogwarts education in this AU, so he was just using his magic in a simple direct way. For a better trained wizard, acting as a one person killing machine is pretty inefficient. It would make more sense to use confundus and other form of mind manipulation to cripple the other armies leadership I think. I think your overall point is definitely right, openly used magic would drastically alter warfare.

********** In a story of mine, the good guys, for lack of manpower, used squibs and muggles in their ranks, with Military weapons. Ron used an RPG to punch through a complex shield cast by Russian War Wizards. Afterwards, the Russians started to layer the shields, so a single RPG would not penetrate, using the same principle as tank armor, where the molten copper core disperses if there's air between two layers, forcing the good guys to adapt their tactics and weapons in turn.
