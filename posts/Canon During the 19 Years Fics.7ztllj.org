Anyone know any well-written fics that take place during the years after the war? Doesn't have to span the entire 19 Years, but I love a good canon After the War story. It's hard to find many good ones with canon ships and events.

*** Strangers at Drakeshaugh is actually pretty good. It does a really nice job portraying family life. I also love seeing how the wizarding cast all bump of each other and the muggle characters.

*** I second the motion. You may want to take a look at the author's other fics, too.

Solid characterizations and is still updating. Deals with the next generation coming to grips and understanding what their parents went through. My favourite next gen fic.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.
