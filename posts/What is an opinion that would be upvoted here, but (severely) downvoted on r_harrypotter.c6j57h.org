** “Can you give me some nice Harmony fics?” or any requests for AU fanfics will generally receive some upvotes here and lots of downvotes there.

Similar, discussing or proposing alternative theories will lead to same results. [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is basically canon orthodoxy central. They harbor a severe dislike for any deviations from the original, and the core hate for the Cursed Child and Crimes of Grindelwald comes from their seeming contradictions with the Books.

However, [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] does NOT:

- Blindly worship JKR, criticisms of her have been rising there too, especially after that wizards pooping on themselves tweet.
- Like Dumbledore and Snape particularly. Posts attacking them, if well argued, will often receive upvotes.
- Like Draco Malfoy. Anyone proposing Dramione pairing will get downvoted into oblivion.

In canon, they're supposed to be people that exclusively hunt Dark Wizards and are sometimes bodyguards. When people attribute general police procedural tropes to Aurors, I wish they'd put that stuff on the DMLE in general, and let Aurors be their own, smaller, cooler, less bureaucratic department.

Harry becoming a Dark Wizard hunter and travelling around stopping dark rituals is a lot cooler than him becoming a wizard cop and confiscating illegal potions ingredients imo.

It's purely told to us, and there's no direct showing of James' development in memories or flashbacks. So I could definitely see why James and Lily might not work out long term.

I guess this goes to show that there's two types of Harry Potter fan; the type that loves everything as is and is very grateful to Rowling for gifting the world with the series, and the type that sees a bunch of amazing ideas and captivating concepts mired in a few glaring bad ideas. This later type is perhaps more prone to writing fanfic. It would be interesting to make a post in the main sub running some kind of survey on fanfic reading and writing habits.

Whatever you want to say about the 3rd Reich, the "Hitler Youth" was their nationalized version of the boy scouts; they'd go on trips to the woods, learn survival, do hiking, camping, etc. between ages 6-10 within the "Little Fellows", or /Pimpf/.

Obviously there was a political overlay - so in that sense it was different - but this only started to become a greater focus in the German Young People group, or the /Deutsche Jungvolk/, between ages 10-13.

The group for people ages 14-18, "Hitler Youth" or the /Hitler Jugend/, built on the experience of the last 8 years, and this is when they earnestly began doing military exercises as well as actively learning the Party ideology.

I can't imagine Draco ever breaking a sweat or working for something. Say whatever you want about the Nazi youth groups, they weren't spoiled.

I seriously doubt that if I was raised by an abusive father and a mother who neglected me, along with being thrown into a dormitory for seven years with a bunch of Nazis in training at the age of 11, I would turn out any different. By the end of the series Snape had been a spy for 17 years, putting his life in danger every day for the order, he had abandoned his blood supremacy beliefs, and then died to save the wizarding world. He could've bowed out at any moment, but instead willingly sacrificed himself to save people who at that point despised him. I'm not saying he was a saint, Im not saying he was a nice person. I'm not excusing his treatment of Neville or Hermione. But to just dismiss him as a "piece of shit" and bash him forever, completely ignores the complexity of his character and his sacrifice.

**** Not necessarily, we know that she didn't nag /so/ much that the Golden Trio ever noticed it. She wasn't Harry Obsessed /so/ much that Harry even registered her. She may have been weird enough that she wasn't talked about in polite circles like Luna. Or she may have been mostly detached and kept her distance. She is also a pureblood because Astoria is one. The Ice Queen persona isn't hated because of the very premise, I think but because of the works that Trope has created.

***** Well, given that the Golden Trio barely associated with any Slytherins who didn't actively come to them, I can't imagine they'd /know/ what Greengrass was like, except that she wasn't confident/stupid/bothered enough to speak up in class frequently like Hermione, and didn't play Quidditch.

****** Yeah, I may have worded it poorly but my point was that there are some inferences that we can make about her. Like she wasn't extrovert enough to be noticed. Someone extrovert, whether friend or foe, not engaging with Harry /bloody/ Potter doesn't feel right. She also probably wasn't very confrontational and willing to stand out because of the above reasons and because she didn't join either Dumbledore's army or the Inquisitor Squad.

******* Sure, some inferences, but not many. We know she didn't join the DA or IS.

Is that cause the Greengrasses are neutral, cause she's not interested, cause she doesn't want to attract attention, cause she wants to join the DA but can't as a Slytherin, cause she's busy looking after her blood cursed sister, or cause of something else entirely?

I have absolutely no issue with Daphne as a pairing, nor do I dislike or disapprove of attempting to build a canon-friendly character for her from the very little information we have.

But I do dislike when someone criticises 3 fleshed out characters with personality traits, flaws and foibles, in favour of a character whose personality is 99% fanon. It's just poor form.

******** Well I wasn't criticizing you or defending the OP. I was just stewing over my thoughts on why people would rather give an essentially OC personality a Canon identity instead of just making an OC. A word vomit to another person helps me think. The difference between my thoughts on the first reply and the second reply is already quite something.

Basically even when we think we don't know this guy at all, a Canon name already tells us a lot more than an OC name ever could.

**** Disagree.

By now the fanon image of Daphne is pretty well established, nearly as much as that of Ron or Hermione. When you think of "Daphne Greengrass", you don't think of someone stranger than Luna - that's not the first image that pops into your head, not if you've read enough fanfiction.

By the same logic of "well, we can write her as anything", well, we can do that with literally any other canon character.

***** Except that other Canon characters have established personalities, behaviours, and the like which a fanon reinterpretation would contradict. Greengrass, by contrast, may well have an established fanon interpretation, but that doesn't invalidate any other fanon portrayal, given that we're here to write Harry Potter Fanfic, not Harry Potter Fanfic Fanfic.

****** Yeah, and I'm saying that doesn't matter. Character X personality was established in canon, character Y established in fanon (from hints in canon).

So it's perfectly reasonable to compare character X and Y, and responding with,

"character Y could very well be worse for nagging than X, stupider and more Harry obsessed than Z and more weird than X"

is besides the point.

******* From hints? What hints? Literally all we got in canon is her name and house. Every single thing about her other than those two facts and that she has a sister is completely fanon.

And fanon characters are not the same as canon ones. Canon characters are the basis for fanworks, while fanon characters are simply a part of fanworks.

It is not reasonable to compare a canon character to a fanon one, because only one of those characters actually exists. The other is the creation of fan works. You may as well say that Dumbledore is an evil mastermind because of all the fanfics where he's secretly stealing from Harry.
