Basically I'm looking for any fics where Sirius doesn't get sent to Azkaban and ends up raising Harry from the time Voldemort kills his parents (and of course Remus has to move in to make sure Sirius doesn't accidentally kill the baby).

Basically wolfstar being parental over Harry. I don't care if Sirius and Remus are romantically involved or just friends either is fine.

Ideally I would like a long fic that starts from the time Voldemort kills Lily and James running all the way through to Harry's final battle with Voldemort in the seventh year but any fic which has Sirius and Remus being loving parental figures to Harry will satisfy me.


** Linkffn(The Letter by mango-melone)

This isn't exactly what you're looking for as it starts when Harry is a kid and does not even address Hogwarts. But it's completed and I really enjoyed it. Sirius and Remus are friends here.

  "'Dear Mr Godfather,' the letter read, 'My name is Harry Potter, and I'm living with my aunt and uncle, but I don't like it very much.'" When through an act of desperation and accidental magic a letter finds its way into Azkaban, Sirius Black decides that his godson needs him. But how do you take care of a child when you're a wanted criminal?

  Love is a reason to live when hope is gone, and fight when it seems darkness has won. Love can help overcome fear, and change the world. Sirius lives for Harry. Remus loves Dora. Minerva is in touch with her inner Slytherin. And Harry & Ginny have a bond.
