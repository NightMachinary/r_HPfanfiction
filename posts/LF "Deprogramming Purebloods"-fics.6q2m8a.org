I don't dislike the element often found in Harry/Daphne fanfics about allying with well connected Pureblood families, but it is most often done by either a) Pureblood appeasement and compromises ("we disagree, but killing each other is dumb"), b) They've been 'good' all along or c) There's nothing wrong with Pureblood ideology (house-elf slavery is cool, yo!). Or any mixture of these elements.

I liked the sequence in HPMOR where Harry tries to deprogramme Draco by using science, but I can imagine all kinds of methods to achieve something similar. Only fics please where this is actually an important part of the story... not just "We watched Star Wars together and suddenly muggles are awesome!"

No slash pls.


** Incidentally, what are the common arguments presented in favour of pro-pureblood, anti-creature/anti-muggle/anti-muggleborn/etc stances in fics? Whether or not the narrative agrees with them?

Apparently, today's Google Doodle is about Albert Namatjira; an Australian Aboriginal artist. Apparently, under Australian law at the time, aboriginal people were considered wards of the state, with controls on where they could live and work, where they were allowed to go, whether they were allowed to drink alcohol, how to raise their children...yeah.

I wonder if the Ministry of Magic in Harry Potter treated various magical creatures like that? House-elves, goblins, etc? 'For their own good'?

And, doesn't it seem a bit strange to classify highly intelligent, social species like centaurs and merfolk as Beasts, simply because they (supposedly) object to sharing a Being status with hags and vampires? I mean, ALL of the centaurs and merfolk as Beast-class, really?

- Magic is hereditary (in a broader sense than just magic parents = magic child)

- Special magical abilities (animagus) are hereditary

- Magic somehow protects Purebloods from inbreeding

- Intermarrying with Muggleborn pollutes the bloodline

- House-elves enjoy being slaves therefore it's all good; or House-elves did some fucked up shit in the past and have been cursed an deserve what they get... paying off their debt.

- Goblins are evil and need to be controlled or they will do nothing but wage war.

- "bigoted" Traditions are good because there's some kind of hidden meaning behind them

- In the same vein: Magic is sentient and turning your back towards pureblood traditionalism is turning your back to parts of Magic itself... Magic will be lost/diminished.

Just from the top of my head.

**** Well, many of those arguments are obvious lies though, which the pureblood bigots would have to realise were they rational.

Tonks is the daughter of a muggleborn, and has one of the rarest talents in the Magical Wirld, since she is a metamorphmagus. Nothing ever climed that animagus was hereditary.

Too many of the most talented wizards and witches - Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Hermione to name a few - have close muggle ancestry. Only a fool would claim their bloodlines are polluted.

The Gaunts show that magic does not protect agaist in-breeding.

No, you don't understand. This shows that the ancient Black blood is so *strong* that it can even overcome muddy blood mixing with it and you still get a hereditary trait like metamorphism, despite the roadblocks!

For a very long time, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was also thought to be a benevolent politician by the public and the Jedi Order.

Her abilities in memory charms would make something like Inception look easy. Who needs the Imperius Curse when her targets thought they came up with those ideas themselves?

Maybe all 4 of them would be in this together, pursuing a long term, unspecified goal with utmost determination and ruthlessness. Even from the Books, we can identify significant darkness in everyone of them.

...Random thing, El Goonish Shive does have the concept of magic being 'alive' and 'aware'; it wants to be used, but not by too many people. In that webcomic, if magic becomes too mainstream, it'll change the rules it operates by to stop itself being overused.

So if you had that concept, you /could/ have an argument for purebloods wanting to keep muggleborns out of the magical community, or even kill them off; the 'source' of magic can only support so many magicals, and if there are too many muggleborns than the old families risk their children being born Squibs, or worse, magic might disappear outright.

In one of my stories, that's explained like this: The wizards did this to avoid fighting Goblin Wars (afterwards, there were just Goblin Rebellions), and the Goblins complied because otherwise, it would have been genocide for them. The Rebellions were usually staged as some "rogue elements" from the goblins, until the wizards got fed up with that as well.

Of course, that's the biased wizard POV - the goblins likely have another version of those events.

****** Mm, something I've been meaning to ask about that; in Divided & Entwined, are the goblins really as psychotic bastards as Moody paints them as, or are they overall good-intentioned but antagonistic towards wizards due to the aforementioned stereotyping and threat of genocide?

Or to put it another way, if they found a human toddler lost in Gringotts and there were no witnesses, what would they do? Arrange an 'accident' for said toddler, try and find its family, raise it as a goblin...?

******* It would depend in part on the goblin who found the toddler - it's not as if all of them act and react the same - but they wouldn't raise the baby as a goblin. Most likely, they would hand the baby over to the wizards to deal with, for a variety of reasons (losing a baby in Gringotts is bad for business, and someone is bound to miss it, can be used to earn some good PR, there might be a fee for recovering wizards lost in Gringotts). Generally, the goblins don't like the humans, and would happily exploit a situation where they could turn the tables on them. But killing a baby doesn't really help with beating the wizards. They're bastards, not Joker-style chaotic evil idiots. My general take on them is that their culture is that of bankers who think corporate raiding should be done with a cutlass in hand, but will settle for an eviction notice, and are unbothered by any moral qualms or limits. Certainly not good-intentioned towards anyone but themselves, in general. (But then, my wizards also are generally not good-intentioned towards anyone but wizards.) And they really hate to lose, and carry grudges.

** In one of my stories the purebloods do watch Star Wars. It doesn't make them think muggles are awesome - it just makes them think muggle movies are awesome. Muggle music still couldn't hold a candle to a magical music performance, and a muggle clubbing fad was very shortlived - it started because in the middle of the war, muggle clubs were safe whereas wizard clubs and bars could be targets of attacks, and ended with the war.

In that story, muggle movies had an impact because the wizards simply had nothing like that. They had magic, and they could have done something similar with magic, but hey simply hadn't the breadth of experience and manpower to create a good blockbuster movie, where everything, from cut to plot to music, from actors to visuals, forms one piece designed for the best impact.
