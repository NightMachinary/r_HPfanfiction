Okay, so this might be a bit of a strange request, but I'm looking for fics where the focus is mainly on the main character building and managing a base, for example a city or school or something else. Oh and preferably goes over a long period of time, so the characters become famous and legends etc. If you still dont get it, I'm looking for fics like The Avalanche which is a LOTR/Hp crossover and it's great so read it! :D


** My favorite current fic of this nature is an HP/GOT crossover by joen1801 called The Difference One Man Can Make. The first chapter is a bit shakey but oh boy does it pick up and become excellent. He updates on a regular basis.

linkffn(11132113)

Another HP/GOT base building fic is The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter. I really, really loved this fic and it's finished which is such a plus. It's all about building up a magic town and taking over Westeros.

linkffn(11255223)

Another favorite fic like this is an HP/SGA crossover called Space Haven by Esama . It's 140k words and abandoned, but still well worth reading. The Wizarding World moves to Atlantis and re-architects their society. This is a popular trope for Esama so you might want to check out some of her other fics including her Island of Fire series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]].

linka03(2849816)

In Xerosis by Batsutousai wizards move to the moon and create a new society. This is also complete.

linkffn(6985795)

In Harry Potter and the Kindling of the Fire series by TigerShark. Harry goes back in town and builds a magical town with prep-school. It has 2 complete stories in the series so far and 1 that's still WIP. Last update 5/15.

** Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy, and its sequel kind of follow this idea.

Lord of Caer Azkaban has some of those elements.

Earl of the North, as well.

Not sure any of them are exactly what you're looking for. But they're not bad stories either way.

Edit: these all have something to do with Azkaban as well, which I only just noticed.
