** Couldn't get through the first chapter unfortunately.

Not that I'm a paragon of grammatical accuracy, but there were too many simple errors that made the fic painful to read.

Edit: Missed the edit by the OP. I'll push through and see if it gets better.

Edit2: Five chapters in. It didn't get any better unfortunately.

** Aaaand its First Person POV.

Sigh, this is going to take a few attempts until my eyes stop twitching.

** Gush away. With a recommendation like that, how could I resist? XD. Adding it to my queue.

+1 for non-romance-centric fic

** Reading through the OP, I was very skeptical of this actually being good, and a few chapters in, and it turns out that it just isn't good.

  "... and while the Basilisk venom simmers, add a dash of Soul. Gently stir in the phoenix tears and garnish with some Mother's Sacrifice. Your freak of magic is now ready to be served". AU GoF packed with dark truths,betrayal, and new hopes. The world has no idea what was awoken deep under those stone halls...

*** Oh dear, first person...

Other problems: Harry is MIA for a whole year but Dumbledore organises a stand in. This is such a cop out. Clearly the author wanted to fast forward to book four without changing cannon at all.

Also /"I smiled innocently and tried to channel my inner Schwarzenegger."/ why would Hary make this reference? How would he be familiar with The Terminator?

** I loved it personally. I usually hate first person but he does it well in my opinion, and its very unpredictable.
