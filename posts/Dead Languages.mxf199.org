I was reading a Harry Potter and Grey's Anatomy crossover (don't judge me) and dead language was brought up and my mind that needs sleep though of this.

What is one of the perks of being the Master of Death is Harry knows every dead languages and older ones that Hermione doesn't even know about. So he curses in them until one of he children (canon or noncanon) curses in Old Norse perfectly and realize that his children gets the perks when he hears that


** Hey! Old Norse isn't dead. It's just called Icelandic, these days 🙂

*** I Google dead languages and that was with them. I was trying to find one that wasn't Ancient Greek or Latin because I believe Hermione would know them good enough

**** I know, it's just that modern Icelandic is extremely similar to Old Norse, and we can read that language no problem. The Norwegians cannot.

Of course, Icelandic has remained practically unchanged for almost 1200 years, and we supposedly speak almost the same way the settlers did.

Naturally, every language changes and evolves over time, but our isolation in the middle of the North Atlantic has protected our language from outside influence. Though it has been changing rapidly over the past three decades, or so.

Now, movies and video games seem to take some delight in butchering my language. Listening to Chris Hemsworth trying, in vain to pronounce words like: Mjölnir, Bifröst, Einherjar, Niđavellir, gives my ears the cramps.

And apparently, the leader of the frost giants is a guy named... Laufey. Perhaps he was the first transgender, because Laufey is absolutely, one hundred percent a woman's name and roughly means 'good fortune'.

There are more examples, but I think these might suffice 😁

***** Mythology Laufey is a woman, Marvel Laufey is a man. Somebody either screwed up in the comics or didn't like the sound of the name Fárbauti.

****** I know. In Norse mythology, Loki is Laufeyjarson. Laufey is an Ásynja (goddess) often associated with good natured pranks and humour.

******* Out of curiosity, are you aware of a good resource for Icelandic pronunciation? I like reading translations of the sagas once in a while (and recently picked up a copy of '[[https://www.amazon.ca/Sagas-Icelanders-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0141000031][Sagas of the Icelanders]]' so I'm currently working through that - damn thing is bigger than a bible) and I'm fairly sure that I butcher people and place names far more than Chris Hemsworth ever did.

******** No, but I am fairly certain that you could find something on Google. It's rather hard, though. Like Þór, for example. You begin like with TH, but ó is pronounced like o in 'o, that's right'. And you roll your r's. Þór 😁

***** That's so interesting! And yeah, I thought Laufey was Loki's mother in the myths, but then isn't there a intersex thing going on with the first giants? (I'm pretty sure there's a joke about the eddas being the first ever RPF fanfictions, lmao)

****** I thought it was just Ymir that was (potentially) a hermaphrodite due to creation myth nonsense - other giants being intersex is a marvel fanon thing as far as I'm aware.

** I head canon it as for wizards know a lot more languages than we do. Firstly, it is fun. Secondly, Crouch knowing over 200 languages, Dumbledore speaking Mermish and Gobbledegook and all of the visiting students in book 4 being fluent in English implies that magicals have an easier time with magic than muggles do.

Thirdly, and most importantly, witches and wizards seem to place great store in legacies from the past. This is seen in the 'family prestige' part of the pureblood dogma as well as the number of ancient artefacts, rattling around, like those used for the Horcruxes. Logically, given that Hogwarts, and presumably its library, date back to the end of the dark ages, some of that legacy would have been written words and possibly talking ghosts, portraits or other artefacts. None of these would have been in modern English. Even if the language (like various celtic dialects) doesn't have muggle written form, unless Hogwarts education has changed a lot, magicals have always been highly literate and as Hogwarts is not run by the Catholic Church I see no reason why they would have just stuck to Latin, so they could have derived their own scripts.

Hence I like to think that the children of old pureblood houses learn the languages of their ancestors at home as a mixture of a show of prestige (like knowing latin and greek has histroically been for the muggle upper classes) and to help understand their history. Or maybe that is what 'Ancient Runes' is.
