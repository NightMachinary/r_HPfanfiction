Basically being a murderhobo.


** Snape strode into his first year class, his cloak billowing behind him. He glared around at them, using his best sneer to ensure that the students were in sufficent terror of him. He reached his desk, picking the attendence parchment to begin calling roll.

"Abbot, Ha-"

"I ROLL FOR INITIATIVE!"

Snape looked up just in time to see a stool flying through the air. It cracked into his forehead, causing him to stagger to his knees as blood welled up on his forehead.

"What is-"

"Magic Missile! Wait, bugger that one isn't working! Quick, Hermione, what's a first level damage spell!"

Snape staggered to his feet, unsurprised to see Potter brandishing his wand and standing on top of his desk. "I will have you expelled for this!" Snape hissed.

"Um, I think it's flippendo, but I-"

Potter's eyes were burning with a manic gleam as he pointed his wand at Snape. "Flippendo!"

To the potion master's shock, he found himself flipped end over end. He hadn't expected a first year student to be able to perform any such magic. He dug into his robes for his wand, rising to his feet with murder in his mind and ready to-

The Weasley brat, wearing some sort of absurd leather tunic and cap and holding a quidditch beat's stick slammed it into Snape's chest. He spat blood, and fell down, unable to rise.

"We did it!" Harry shouted, jumping up and down on his desk. "We already beat the first main quest villain! Quick, Hermione, scavenge for ingredients we can use on healing potions and stuff! Ron, loot the body!"

/Oh hell,/ Snape thought. /Lily, whatever love remains between us, I don't know if you're worth it./

*SOME TIME LATER*

"But Harry, trolls are really dangerous. If Professor Quirrel was scared than we should be-"

Harry interuptted Hermione, shaking his head. "Look, even if we're not high enough level to loot the dungeon on the third floor corridor, I'm telling you we're at least level 2 by now, maybe level 3. If we can defeat a troll, we'll get loads of loot and XP. Trolls are CR5, but we've got acid and fire. We've totally got this."

Ron nodded, hefting the large kitchen knife he'd found. Behind them, Neville nervously juggled his satchel of healing potions. Harry had been thrilled when he found out Neville prefered to stay back and heal, claiming that the party needed a dedicated healer. No one much knew what that meant, but they all nodded and went along with it.

"There it is!" Harry cried. "Hermione, sneak around and hit it with those vials of acid. Incedio!"

The troll roared in pain as the fireball hit it, and again when Hermione managed to bean it with a vial of acid. It swung its club, which clanged off of the mismatched metal armor Ron was wearing, but sent the small boy flying. The troll pursued the shiny object, inadvertently reinforcing Harry's assurances that monsters always went after the person wearing the heaviest armor, because that was how the mysterious magic of "aggro" worked.

Ron got to his feet, his helmet so dented he could hardly see, and wildly swung his knife. Neville threw a healing potion at him, which both revived and hurt him as the glass shards cut at him.

"Keep at it Ron! Use a power strike!"

Ron wildly swung away, but the troll hit him again with his club, tossing him into a tapestry, which fell down, covering Ron and revealing a hidden chamber behind it. The troll blinked, covering his eyes at the reflection of objects stored in the room. Harry and HErmione hit it with more acid and fire, which made the poor creature bellow in pain and turn around, lumbering towards them.

"AHHHH!" Neville screamed, dropping his satchel of healing potions. He tried to scramble away, but the troll picked him up and held him up to his mouth, intending to bite the poor boy in half. Unfortunately for the troll, Neville dug out his holy symbol, a wooden cross Harry had stolen from somewhere. Neville chucked it at the troll. "REBUKE UNDEAD!"

At the same moment Neville threw the symbol, the troll opened its mouth. The cross sailed into its mouth, and lodged at the back of the trolls throat. The troll gasped, dropping Neville as it began to chock. Unable to breath, it sank to its knees. Ron stumbled up out of the tapestry, and somehow managed to skewer the troll straight through a kidney. The troll tried to cry out in pain, and ran out of air. It collapsed, dead.

"We did it!" Harry cheered. "And look! It did drop treasure!"

Hidden behind the tapestry was an old store room of various things that had once decorated Hogwarts, from old suits of armor to old paintings and janitorial supplies.

"Wow, I didn't even know rebuke undead was a real spell," Neville muttered, looking at his hands in confusion.

"I told you Nev, we'll make a proper cleric out of you yet!" Harry gleefully led them inside the chamber. "Look Ron, a proper sword! Huge upgrade, I bet this one does 1d8 damage!"

"Brilliant," Ron said, taking up the sword. He still wasn't quite sure how Harry had convinced him he was really a fighter and not a wizard, but he sure did like hitting things hard.

Hermione eagerly rummaged through dusty books, looking for something valuable.

"I told you all, we're going to be proper adventure's yet," Harry declared. "We'll have that dungeon on the third floor cleared in no time."

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.
