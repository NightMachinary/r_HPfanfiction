*** I'm currently working on one at the moment, it's fun to try to see how tweak it to get them together, I'm trying for a more Gray Harry, and a Pansy who only acts like she does because it's all she knows, rather than true belief in Pureblood Supremacy.

I can't decide if Ravenclaw Harry would be a better choice than Gryffindor Harry in order to get them closer to each other without forcing it.

Granted, it's an entire fic, and not just some romance short story, so it needs more than the extremely fun flair of Hansy.

***** I won't, that'd be silly! I mean, he might stay friends with Hermione or something, if only because they'd be a bit more similar, and I doubt Hermione would care about such things. But, I was thinking less of a brother/sister relationship, and more of a friendly rivalry or something similar, I read a story like that once, and found it incredibly interesting.

It will be fun characterizing other characters though, like Terry Boot, Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, Su Li, Mandy Brockelhurst, etc. to be his friends as well.

***** What to have them bond over though? Cooking? It would probably seem very odd for a Pureblood Princess like Pansy Parkinson (God I love the Alliteration in her name. One of the best parts of the ship! Pansy Potter ne√© Parkinson alliteration is great.), and the Boy-Who-Lived to not only cook, but /like/ doing it. There was an infuriatingly short one shot (Drabble my ass! It's a tenth of a story!) that had Pansy bake one, and she and Harry bonded over it.

I can't see Pansy giving two fucks about the Muggle world, so any of those is right out, especially since Harry's experience with the Muggle world is school, cupboard, small bedroom, and chores. Quidditch isn't really /odd/, nor is DADA, so they can't really bond over an affinity for the subject.

I'd really like for Harry to be in Gryffindor, and start the fic off in second, fourth, or fifth year, and have Pansy side with Harry for some snide reason, either that he couldn't be the heir of Slytherin because he's not a pureblood, he's too stupid to fool an ancient magical artefact, or /of course/ the Dark Lord is back (while subtly siding with Harry to possibly save herself from Voldemort, I can see her being like Draco, a victim of circumstances that didn't really see the danger until they were in the thick of it, but more proactive in protecting herself.)

** It's not so much a pairing as a tool used in pairings that most people find awful. Soul bonds. Even though I've only read like 3-4 that are actually good, I love them because the mechanic has so much potential if only it was written right.

There's so many ways to write them. You can have a bond where two people are connected, but not necessarily romantically inclined at first. Maybe they can feel one another, have some sort of tactile sensation from what the other is doing at the time. Maybe it's like a drug addiction, where the two must remain within a certain physical proximity before getting sick. Maybe it's just a sense of connection that draws them to each other, whether they like it or not. It's really a wide open mechanic that is sadly too often exploited by those who can't get past a very narrow view of it.

For example, I would love a Harry/Fleur bond that as unwanted by both, and forced upon them by a situation. Perhaps during the second task Harry and Fleur end up in a high stress situation where a bond develops due to their actions. They fight the entire idea, but eventually come to like each other.

If well written, it could be very good.

**** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][This]] is the best of the H/G soulbond stories. It's really brilliant if you can get past the first three chapters or so. Magical cores exist, and it's kind of stupid, but seriously the writing and characterization makes up for that /so much/. I normally /hate/ Harry/Ginny, but I loved this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2493456/1/Bond][This]] is slash, but it's /really/ good slash. Normally I'm not a fan of slash at all, but I'm willing to read Harry/Draco, because this fic /does a soulbond right/. Harry and Draco don't immediately fall in love, in fact they fucking hate each other. Seriously, this is the best soulbond story in the fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][This]] is the only Harry/Hermione bond fic that isn't trash. Seriously, I've tried to read every long Harry/Hermione bond story on ff.net, and this is the only one that isn't worth setting on fire and throwing in a dumpster. To bad it got abandoned just as it started up.

I agree with the Draco/Luna pairing but not in the redemption way, I love it because she would have a way of seeing past the arrogant exterior and even if he is redeemed she is still a pureblood. He's opened his mind and proved it because you would have to have an open mind to be with Luna.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Re: Draco and Luna, I quite liked what I saw of it in The Unspeakable Files.

I've been reasonably vocal about my OTP so I shan't rehash, but I also like Mrytle/Cedric and Filch/Pince.

** Harry/Narcissa (any sort of relationship between the two really, so long as Snape is not involved)

Snape/Sinistra is usually quite funny when it's around, though I haven't seen much of it.

Hermione/Fred or Hermione/Sirius (There's something with Hermione being attracted to troublemakers...)

** Does Drarry count as an "odd pairing"? I know quite a few people ship it, but I still find it difficult to tell my friends I ship them because I'm afraid they'll think it's weird.

*** It's one of the most popular non-canon ships, so it's not exactly 'odd'. But it is pretty amazing (fellow Drarry shipper here).

** Remus/Narcissa. It's so wrong but so right at the same time. Often I've seen it shoehorned into the 'Narcissa Redemption Trope' with the Lucius vs Remus dichotomy to give her character development.

** Well, I don't specifically look out for it as stories with just pairings and no plot I don't touch with a eleven foot pole, rather it's that I'd normally expect not to like it from the start and yet like it I did, but I did enjoy some Harry x Tom Riddle stories. Do note that I mean Tom Riddle, not Voldemort; Tom Riddle was a somewhat broken person who always had the potential to become bad (i.e. Voldemort), but there was a time when the two weren't one and the same. Of course, that means time travel was involved in those stories, and it just so happened that Harry was female in all of them which, though convenient for me, is something that I don't think necessary (as in, it's not a requirement for me to be able to enjoy those stories).

My favorite of these is by Inell, called [[http://inell.immobul.us/viewstory.php?sid=397][Island of Second Chances]]. It's not posted to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&c1=3&c2=748&_c1=1&_c2=6&p=1][ffnet]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=hits&work_search%5Bcategory_ids%5D%5B%5D=116&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&tag_id=Hermione+Granger*s*Pansy+Parkinson][Ao3]]. Still, there are 200+ fics on each of those sites with that pairing (follow the links for the filtered results).
