I cannot for the life of me remember what this fic was even about - possibly timetravel.

What I do remember is Harry reopening alliances for House Potter with several other families. Any ideas?


** There might be several. But having read about a thousand fanfics, I can't remember any names.

But I've read at least one.

*Edit:*\\
Was it one of these?

*** Thanks! I'll have a look through the first one - I recognise the name so might be that. Not the second one as I haven't previously read it.

EDIT: Yes it is that first one, thanks again!

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
