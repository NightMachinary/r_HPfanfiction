:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a story where Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel give Harry instructions to make a Phoenix. Harry's at Grimmauld place and only he can read the instructions and will forget them until it's time / if he finds someone to pass them to another. Dumbledore remembered so he could tell Harry, but neither he nor Flamel can remember the full process. I think it was the summer before 4th yr as he had to keep the egg attached to himself during the Quidditch World Cup. He told people the bulge was an injury from a potion brewing accident. Can anyone think of the fic where this happens? Thanks!

  This is a AU where Harry and Hermione use the timeturner to change one more thing and it makes all the difference. It changes the course of the world to a better turn. A lot of politics and also Fluff.Of course, this is a fan-fiction. I don't own Harry Potter in any kind or way and I don't make money with this story.

**** It is a fun read, but I dropped it after the egg hatched. The whole process is pretty new and interesting, but the summer it took place in lasted 36 chapters, and not enough happend in the timespan for me to understand where all the words went honestly.

I like that Harry is aware of wizarding customs, but doesn't entirely conform. I like how Sirius is portrayed. I like how Narcissa is still somewhat of a snob. I like how the author did away with the Horcrux. I just really dislike the pacing.

***** You made it further than me then. Assuming the author does not radically change his style in the later parts of the story, I would say that it could easily be cut down to 200.000 words instead of 500.000. Without losing anything. I mean, I have read many very long stories, some way over 1.000.000 words, and have absolutely no problem if it is done right. But the pacing in this is abysmal. I swear, more than half of the chapters I made it through could have been skipped, since they contained nothing of import happening, nor any relevant world building.

***** To be fair, in stories with a lot of exposition and setup you have to do that sort of thing. The other downside is you have to pump out a lot more words.

****** It isn't necessarily a bad thing. I do believe that there are a lot of people who enjoy reading super long fics and respect any author that has the dedication to keep up with them. I just personally prefer stories where I don't feel like I could skip chapters without missing anything while reading them.

**** I am not saying it is the best story in the world, I am not even sure whether I have finished it (and I am willing to read a lot), but that it is probably what the original author of this thread asked for.

  Ron will not be a big part of this story. He will fall out of touch with Harry and Hermione. I will not bash him overly obscene but I just don't enjoy this character.
#+end_quote

Author states that he just isn't a big part. not sure if that changes anything for you, I have not read it though, so IDK how accurate that is.
