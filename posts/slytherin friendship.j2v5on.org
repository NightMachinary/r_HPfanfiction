I'm looking for a story where harry becomes friends with any slytherin character in later years. Most fics I've come across have harry in slytherin befriending slytherins in 1st year. But the type of fics I'm looking for is a gryffindor, mostly-canon harry in 4th+ year becoming open minded and befriending slytherins. bonus points for powerful harry (a guilty pleasure of mine) bonus points if there is no bashing (ik that's almost impossible since most slytherin friendship fics have some sort of bashing) thanks!!

** It hasn't featured prominently yet, but all mine have Harry and Blaise as friends.

Edit: didn't read carefully enough. Mine is a slytherin Harry, but trio intact

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (Canon, EWE, dimension travel, AU)
