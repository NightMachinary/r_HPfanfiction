** Currently reading linkffn(11752324)

I have never read a story with a female Voldemort before, and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy this one. Her interactions with Harry are very fun to read, at least for me; and the dissonance between her personas is neat. Kinda leaves you thinking how Emily (Voldemort's name in the story) could be the same person as The Dark Lord. This is also what Harry seems to feel in the story as well, which is cool. The best part by far though, is that it updates every week on, or around Sunday night (EST).

*Opens chapter 18, sees Word count of 851 >.> *

This is more by coincidence than design. After a lot of technical manual work I wanted to get back in the habit of fiction prose so I challenge myself to do a chapter a week from the middle of December until the end of Feb. I do not know if I will be able to write and edit around 7000 words by Sunday night. But I'm certainly going to try to.

Thanks for reading though, glad you're enjoying the story!

*** Yeah, I came to this thread to leave a link to this story as well.

To add to what you're saying, It's brilliantly written and a concept I've never seen done before (surprising as it is in a fandom that's as well trodden and this one). Nobody's humanized Voldemort like this author has. It's intriguing watching Emily's slow fall from grace through the many flashback scenes in parallel with watching Harry's slow march to being suborned. There's been careful crafting of a dramatic ending that speaks to the author's skills at storytelling.

My lone quibble is the suddenness with which an event in the last chapter was handled. [[/spoiler][Specifically, the thing with Harry being snatch-and-grabbed by Snape in Chicago after Emily conveniently left her purse behind seemed overly contrived. I would have rather this been handled slightly more carefully. Also, no matter the hour, Harry's return after being gone for several days should have roused a few people out of bed to get answers.]]

That said, I'm very much looking forward to [[/spoiler][the fallout with the Order and his friends following Harry's disappearance and return]] as well as [[/spoiler][the resolution in the flashbacks of Emily's being rejected by her paramour after he proposed and then ran off.]] Some serious drama ahead.

One thing this story does particularly well is keep the reader invested in the characters and the story. This author's last story had times when my attention drifted. Not so here.

** Something I'd like to Discuss:

What's up with 8th year post-war stories in which Draco returns to Hogwarts. What are these authors smoking? If I have to read one more story in which Draco just returns to Hogwarts with a throwaway line like "Harry spoke in favour of Draco at the trial" I'm going to throw a fit.

Sure, whatever, I can imagine Draco getting a light sentence, maybe even avoid Azkaban... maybe Community Service? I don't know... but the idea that he'd ever be allowed to enter Hogwarts Grounds in his life ever again is so beyond ludicrous, I don't have words. *He lead a bunch of terrorists and murderers into a school full of children in order to assassinate the Headmaster*. If you don't get expelled for trying to murder the Headmaster of the school I'm really not sure about the world you're trying to craft there.

******** Let's assume that the magical legal system is pretty similar to the British legal system for the most part. Minors can be charged as adults for grave crimes.

Duress needs four points to be met to be allowed as a defence:

1. The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death

2. The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime

3. The threat must be immediate and inescapable

4. The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

Let's ignore the fact that not only was there no explicit threat made, that the only harm that could come was if Draco failed his task and was caught, and that Draco actually bragged about his assignment. We'll, for the sake of argument, ignore points one and two.

The threat was neither immediate or inescapable. Draco spent a year trying to kill Dumbledore while committing a litany of other crimes. Ample time to go to the aurors. While that might have got him killed for betraying his master, that leads us to number four.

Draco was a death eater. All evidence points to this being something he has strived for for a long time. No evidence is available that suggests that he was forced to join the death eaters - even if he did come to regret his decision. He was seen to be quite proud of it in fact.

In my opinion he doesn't qualify for any of the points that are needed for duress to be accepted.

All of that's moot because duress is not accepted as a defence against attempted murder in Britain.

Even if he somehow managed to get away with no prison time (as he did in canon), I can't see him being allowed back at school; in no small part because of the risk to his safety.

We have to assume that the majority of people returning for the '98-'99 school year are/were against Voldemort. A prominent peer who was a death eater, who took part in death eater activities (including torture) and presumably took some part in the torture of his fellow students, would have a pretty big target on his back for reprisals.

As for the original comment, there are a hundred or so stories on my watchlist but only about 20-30 are updated with any regularity. If it goes 3 months without an update, unless it is a really good fic, I drop it.

Most recently, I perused through DZ2 and Quatermass' latest stuff, since the latter at least has similar fandoms to me. I am just unutterably frustrated by those authors' inability to actually finish a goddamn story. So many fun ideas left to wither and die on the vine. In the case of DZ2, I swear his Autotext fills in the first four chaps of his stories, and all he does is write a new prologue and then slap "Keep reading to find out" at the end of chapters.

As for stuff I enjoy reading, In All Things Balance has been interesting as a SW crossover. I also have been enjoying The Mountain's Range, a SI GoT where the SI takes over Gregor Clegane pre-Hound burning. As for full HP fandom, Not even a first chance! by senawario is an interesting interpretation of Harry-goes-back-in-time fics. I have also been reading and enjoying Basilisk-born by Ebenbild and Stargon1's Cupboard series.

Wow, this turned into a giant essay.

I'm a bit surprised that it has actually managed to keep my attention so well. It can be somewhat hit and miss with the pacing - some sections feel absurdly long, even stretched - but for the most part it's been very interesting. One of the story's high points, is how well the author has structured the reveal of new information (here the pacing hits a strike). I felt myself getting excited several times when a mystery was revealed. It shows that the author had a good plan and executed it competently.

** *Spoilers for Sword of the Hero trilogy in this post - will not be tagging them individually*

So I'm reading Joe's Hero trilogy and I'm currently on the last book, Harry Potter and the Soul of the Hero linkffn(3994212, 4042356, 4413991).

My views so far are mostly positive. I'm a big fan of Joe as an author both in terms of technical writing ability, but also his style and how incredible he is a world-building which brings me to my first major positive about this series.

I absolutely love how he's developed a whole story line on top of canon. Whilst it is admittedly a bit grandiose, Harry fighting for the good of the entire universe, it still is incredibly refreshing especially as most fanfiction doesn't stray far away from the main Canon story line. This has always been one my favourite things about Joe's stories and remains true for the entirety of this trilogy.

I do have a little niggle though. I wish he had spent more time in the countless worlds Harry passes through in Book 2. They're touched on and alluded too but only 1 or 2 are ever directly shown to us in the story for a significant length of time. It feels like a waste of what could have potentially been an open invitation to explore countless worlds and seeing Harry grow into the man he became rather than effectively time skipping for 100 years.

The first book does a great job of pulling the story line away from canon and building the foundations for the AU that it eventually becomes. There's some great character development with Harry as well as some great action and fight scenes. Joe builds the suspense of the story masterfully and starts setting up the plot points for book 2 and 3. The only thing that I would say is truly lacking from the book is any development of both Ginny's character and their relationship. It would have been fine if not for how important Ginny becomes later in the trilogy. Reading through the rest of the series you have Harry being hopelessly devoted to her to the point where he abstains from any other women for over 100 years. However with the lack of setup of their relationship it just feels a bit odd and doesn't make much sense. This is only more noticeable in Book 3 as there are multiple scenes that are trying to be romantic only for them to flat because the characters have no real prior relationship before-hand and so it feels forced.

Whilst I really enjoyed Book 1, Book 2 is definitely the high point of the trilogy. You have a great over-arching plot line that has been setup in Book 1 combined with a new AU with fantastic character interactions and a great enemy. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book and it was overall just a fantastic read.

Book 3 however has been a bit of a struggle to read. It still has a fantastic over-arching plot and the fight developing between Harry and Voldemort is well set-up as are the measures Harry is taking. The sheer imagination, as always with Joe's work, is still there as well, with the story not being limited to 3 locations in Britain, but instead taking place all over the world.

However as mentioned before this book seems incredibly hampered by the requirement of Ginny and their relationship being a major part of the story. Harry is meant to be so in love with her that their love is a power that can't matched which means that there needs to be multiple scenes between the two where this love can flourish and can be shown. Joe knows this and so we do indeed have scene upon scene of Harry and Ginny together but it just doesn't seem to work for multiple reasons.

Harry at this point is around 120 years old and Ginny is 16 and you can definitely tell. Ginny comes across as immature in a lot of their conversations and that's a bit unfair to say because she is meant to be 16 and of course she'll have her immature moments. However that is what makes the relationship between them feel so unnatural, Harry has the maturity of an adult that only comes from many years of life and Ginny doesn't. A relationship is meant to be made of 2 equals and Harry and Ginny are no longer equal and it is often glaringly noticeable.

It's so glaringly noticeable and almost uncomfortable that I'm having trouble finishing the book. I know the final showdown will involve the love of Harry and Ginny and that we multiple scenes of them together to sit through before we get there and I don't particularly wan't to read them all. It's a real shame because I've loved this series up to this point and this one problem is making it glaringly hard to read.

Even with that all though I'm still a big fan of this series simply because of the strengths of Book 1 and 2. Whilst Book 3 has its problems and it is noticeable throughout that this is Joe's first story they're still an incredible tale with a scope that is unmatched in fanfiction. If it's a choice between a story of this scope and imagination and another canon rehash with Lord Potter vs Dumbles then give me something like this every time. Definitely one of the must reads of the fandom.

That ended up being a bit longer than I thought it would ! Well done if you made it this far. If you're still here then please let me know your thoughts either about this trilogy or anything else you're reading at the moment!

*** I /just/ finished the 3rd book, and I have very similar views as you. (If you're curious, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5xz12x/spoilers_sword_of_the_hero_trilogy/][this post]], which I made a few days ago after I finished book 1 and was asking for help figuring out if I should finish the series. Note that there is one comment I made which has spoilers for the end of book 3, but I marked it clearly.)

The rest of my comment will be from the point of view of someone who is part-way through book 3 but not finished it yet, so that we avoid spoilers:

I've been looking for a way to explain my issues with Ginny as well, and I think your analysis is spot on:

#+begin_quote
  The only thing that I would say is truly lacking from the book is any development of both Ginny's character and their relationship. It would have been fine if not for how important Ginny becomes later in the trilogy.
#+end_quote

I love Harry/Ginny fics, some of them are done so well, but at least for the first 2 and a half books or so, I wanted to see a lot more of Harry/Ginny. Ginny is his heart, his soul, his fire, and his anchor, but there hasn't been much showing the relationship between them.

Anyway, I agree that book 2 was the most..."epic"? of them all. However, I personally preferred book 3 simply because I'm more comfortable with fics where he's back home, fucking shit up.

You also said this:

#+begin_quote
  I know the final showdown will involve the love of Harry and Ginny and that we multiple scenes of them together to sit through before we get there and I don't particularly wan't to read them all.
#+end_quote

Not much I'll say here except, you can do it! The final several chapters are worth it, in my opinion :)

Another opinion I'll voice is that there's a /bit/ too much of the weird mystic chapter headers and quasi-philosophical language and intermissions that go like so:

#+begin_quote
  Love. Power. We last left off with our hero about to [...]. But such is the way. Here he was, both mortal and immortal. Evil but pure. Kind but powerful. Tall yet short. Harmonious yet sanctimonious. Imprisoned yet free. Nothing would separate him from his power---he was an Eagle, the Hope of the Earth, the Darkslayer. Grim Reaper. Death reincarnate. The embodiment of life.
#+end_quote

...and so on. You know what I mean.

One other minor thing that annoyed me to no end was the weird grammar and incorrect spelling at times. *Now don't get me wrong*: in general, I don't care too much about minor spelling issues in fanfics. *BUT*, when the story is so incredibly fascinating and well-written, with the author's powerful grasp of language and making the reader feel truly part of the story, it's simply surprising and a bit heartbreaking when I see "their" instead of "there" and it throws me off.

One aspect that I felt was very genuine and honest, but I /personally/ didn't like it, was Harry's amount of angst, especially throughout the first two books. In most fanfics, Harry is somewhat happy for a good portion of it, still having fun sometimes and so on. But I felt like during the /entire/ first two books (and about the same with the third as well), he was always

#+begin_quote
  depressed. He wanted to end his life. His only purpose in life was to kill Voldemort [or whatever]. Even Ginny couldn't hold onto him. etc etc
#+end_quote

Again, I feel like this is one of the few fanfics where it's actually genuine, where it makes complete sense, and where I would say "Yeah, if I were in that position, I would feel that way too," however, it was still too much for me at times and I had to take a break.

Overall, the trilogy was just incredible. I've only read three or so other fics that have made me feel this attached to the story, and that have had such... scary symbolisms, impressive parallels, and moments that made me say "OH MY GOSH :O ".

#+end_quote

For sure. I feel like with both this and the quasi-philosophical language you mentioned earlier, Joe got a lot better in his newer stories, you can see how he's still slightly unrefined in this trilogy and it definitely shows.

#+begin_quote

Haha I do definitely plan on finishing it, but as you said, I'm just having to take multiple breaks to get through it.

Yeah I definitely agree, this is a fantastic trilogy and I think as a series might be unmatched in the fandom just for the sheer depth and quality of the writing. Whilst there might be an individual fic that surpasses them I can't think of many series that maintain the same level of quality throughout.

** I finished [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3645205/1/][Faultlines]] after asking for some angsty Ron/Hermione. While I had a lot of issues with the story in general, it actually made me realize why two reasons why I hate a lot of angsty fics, even though I like the genre overall:

1) The entire story was built around long arguments that went in circles. And this is really common in a lot of angsty relationship fics. The author basically has one plot in mind and wants to stretch the story out as long as possible to load on the angst. But then every time the two love interests argue, it's the exact same fight. And it isn't as though big revelations are made. They just wind up in the exact same spot. Which I get is fairly realistic for a lot of couples who fight. But as far as a narrative goes, it is aggravating to read over and over again.

2) This fic made me hate everyone involved. The characters were so unlikable because they were so aggravating. And that's a major problem. I need to be able to root for these characters. Not want to throw them both against the wall in frustration and annoyance.

At the end, Ron and Hermione decide to be together and it leaves it ambiguous as to whether it will work. I'm fine with these types of endings but it does make you feel like everything you just read was as pointless as the 5th argument about the same issue. The truth is when you write a fic where the couple argues all the time about the same stuff, you can't really write a happy ending. Because if they get back together, you know it's based on unhealthy behavior and it can't possibly work out.

Angsty romance fics are actually really tough to write, in my opinion, without making one hate the characters or just get fed up with the arguments. This fic fell into the usual pitfalls. Yet it won a lot of these online awards for best angst fic and now I wonder if it's just me.

** I currently have 3 titles open on my iPad. "Three Turns", "Harry Potter and the Time Warp" and "Dignity in Fear".

- Three Turns

Charming Time-travel story playing in the Marauders era. Its quick, its sometimes witty and a very light-hearted read. However, I'm at chapter 29 and the characters begin to annoy me. All of them. Granted, they're very close to how teenagers act, but the worst is that they're so close to how teenagers act. The dialogues are often just... inconsequential. Just stupid banter for the sake of another exchange of words that, I think, should endear us to the Marauders and their "lol xD" quirky ways, but ends up annoying the hell out of me.

I'll give it a few more chapters to finally /get on with it/, but I doubt it will come around.

- Harry Potter and the Time Warp

I'm actually not sure why I torture myself with this one. I just really scrap the barrel here and at this point I'll give anything a look. Horrible writing, horrible characterizations, horrible plotting and I would suspect an awful plot as well. I'm not yet beyond the introductory chapters so I won't judge that. It has it all, of course. There is the manipulative Dumbledore, the love potion mixing Weasley women, the abusive and violent Ron and so on and so forth.

Probably the weirdest part of the writing are the paragraph-long sentences that just stretch endlessly by the use of the words "and then". Honestly, the funniest thing about this are the ANs as the author seems to be downright delusional about her (?) story.

- Dignity in Fear

This one. /This one/. I came across this in my alert feed. Back when I started following the story it was at 5 chapters or so, but now it bloomed into quite a sweet Hermione/Tonks story. The writing is good, the characterization just an editor away from on point and since its a romance, the plot really doesn't matter that much and therefore does the sensible thing - sticking to canon. Out of the three I currently read, this one I'd actually recommend. Femslash, obviously.

linkffn(9757451; 11689499; 10798339)

PS.: If anyone is interested for an original title to read: No One's Chosen by Randall P. Fitzgerald

Written by an independent writer who also lurks [[/r/worldbuilding]], its a surprisingly good read. If you look for some fantasy, this one is definitely worth its money, judging by the first ~100 pages.

Is it funny that your description actually made me remember this fic? It's been at least half a year that I've read a few chapters and I distinctly remember it for the terrible writing quality that you described. It's really really bad.

I too read that story much further than I should have... I think some of the plot-hooks intrigued me, but I just couldn't get over the terrible writing.

** I was reading the reluctant champion linkffn(5071058)

I enjoyed it, mildly. overall I found it only okay. the characters seem flat, even when there is tension I never really felt it and a lot of the time the characters had arguments with each other for absolutely no reason.

**** I quite liked that one.

I can sort of see what you mean with the characters but they managed to keep me interested. The main argument went on too long and got a bit contrived but otherwise the story worked.

One thing that always amused me about canon Harry is that he was such an innocent little soul throughout his puberty. He's an immensely famous wizard in a school where dozens of girls start openly drooling over him... and he basically ignores them. TheUnrealInsomniac always writes rather more realistically.

*** It could have been a good story if not for robst's inability to make life difficult for his heroes and heroines. He'd spend ages on a slow build up of a plan to cause Harry problems of some kind, then about half a page blowing it apart. In a similar vein, whenever any other character says something bad about Harry, all the other adults immediately turn on them and defend Harry. There's no tension at all. Even the ending (and it's robst so I'm not really spoiling anything here) was basically: "We won. We thought we'd lost Hermione for a moment but she's already fine."

There were some really good ideas in Harry Crow - escaping from Azkaban using a wand made from straw and our own hair always sticks out for me - but there weren't enough to keep it going. I stuck with it until the end but only out of bloody-mindedness.
