** I started reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]", it might correspond to what you're searching. According to the author:

  "Hopefully with this story I've avoided clich√©s that other Grey! Harry tales fall into: Harry will be powerful, but not godlike. He'll be cunning, but not all of his schemes will work. He'll be ruthless, but not evil."

**** I don't know sorry, I'm only beginning chapter 3. There is no ship yet. From what I already read I guess the story will lead to Harry/Ginny but I'm not sure.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Shezza's Denarian series comes to mind. Whether you consider his reasons for delving into dark magic as morally just is potentially debatable, but I think it fits what you're looking for. It's a slight crossover with Dresden Files, basically borrowing ideas--no knowledge of that universe is necessary for the story to make sense. linkffn(Denarian Renegade)
