For me, it's Victor Krum's saga. He retired after the 2002 world cup but came back for the 2014 world cup for a career redeeming, legacy defining win. Like /c'mon, gimme that sports movie./ That kind of shit gets me hype and for all the minor details that didn't matter, I'm glad to know that Krum had his "I WIN" moment. 10/10


** McGonagall's career highlights.

In the book timeline, she's been teaching for "Thirty-nine years this December".

In the Pottermore timeline, she lived in Scotland in the early half of the 20th century, went to Hogwarts, worked at the Ministry for 2 years, then applied for a teaching job.

In the Fantastic Beasts timeline, she was an adult teacher to Newt Scamander in 1908-1912.

In the Cursed Child timeline, she's Headmistress in the year 2019, still spry enough to dunk on the Minister of Magic's plot-induced Idiot Balling.

***** Ugg, no. I love Hermoine but she was not the only smart student. Jeez. I once read a fic (can't remember which) where the Departement of Mysteries awarded one of two studente each year with the use of a time Turner to see what creatieve things they would do with alle the extra time, and of course eventually recruit those students with the most talent. Hermione wasn't recruited because she used it only for studying and was therefor not creative enough. Anyway, I loved that idea of why time turners are given to kids and it makes much more sense than 'Hermione is just so speshul'.

Come to think of it, if you wanted to investigate its effects on ageing it would make sense to use a child as the test subject. Children (especially pubescent teenagers) have rapidly-changing bodies, so you'd be able to see measurable differences to their peers with less usage of the turner than with an adult.

The experiment would be shorter and if it turns out that, yes, you do age normally the whole time the child has lost fewer years of their lifespan than an adult would in the undertaking.

People take that quote much too literally, assuming she means wizards literally shit their pants without stopping a conversation. It's obviously not what she meant, they probably went off into a corner or whatever, but she worded it badly and everyone jumped on the bandwagon of mocking it.

If you interpret it like that, it's the best bit of worldbuilding she's ever done. It makes so much sense in the historical context, because wizards would have been the only clean people, surrounded by dirty, smelly Muggles. Wizards lived in clean houses, while Muggles were constantly in proximity to human and animal shit. Why would they bother with plumbing, when they're already /overwhelmingly superior/ to everyone else?

** I have got a ton of these that are all (mostly) irrelevant but oh so tantalizing:

- *The Ministry of Magic*: we get hints of massive size of a workforce in both GoF and OotP (depending on your perspective), but what sort of ballpark is involved in government work? I mean, the Ministry as a whole is made of branches that all revolve around enforcing the Statute of Secrecy in one form or another. And we know every branch that is at least in the Ministry building (its never clarified that is the /only/ place they work though). But the wizarding population is under 0.01% from what I can tell, putting the population in Britain somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 (at its highest) in the 90s.
- *The Veil*: so there is this possible portal to the underworld at the bottom of the Ministry of Magic. Yeah...in the Muggle world this would be the sort of things that make conspiracists froth at the mouth. Hell, the whole Department of Mysteries is a goldmine of conspiracy and speculation that we only get tidbits of. Example: why does the DoM have a room filled with prophecies if no one can access them (as the DoM is strictly secret to anyone not employed there or at the top of the Ministry pyramid)?
- *Transfiguration*: is it permanent or only temporary? The problem with this is Rowling has stated explicitly back in 2004 that it is temporary, but we see no hints of this in any of canon for instance. Would Malfoy have always stayed a ferret, is Crouch Sr. still a bone? My gut says "it depends on the skill of the caster and the magnitude of the change," but some clarity would have been nice.
- *Pensieve*: is there only one of these, or are their multiple artifacts available? I imagine this would be incredibly useful and probably drastically expensive. Only problem is, if this exists in greater amounts why isn't it employed more often?
- *Hogwarts Courses and Clubs*: we get hints that there are other courses (i.e. alchemy) but their is never any expansion on them in canon, and we never hear of anyone taking them either. While I am at it, what about all those clubs that are mentioned as well? Gobstones Club for example. We spend so much time focusing on Quidditch (or rather on Harry being really good at flying), but the rest of the organizations in school are left in the wind. What does Charms Club do anyway? How about the Choir, who only are implied to perform during the opening feast.
- *Dark Wizards*: there are a bunch of dark wizards mentioned offhandedly, but never really expanded on. Whats interesting is none of the others really tried to go for broke like Voldemort and take over Britain (or are mentioned as such) except someone like Grindelwald. Mostly we get variations of Emeric the Evil (who comes across as more of a mass murdering psychopath), Ekrizdis (created Azkaban and mostly just spent time chilling with the dementors and torturing sailors), or Raczidian (who sounds more like a fairy tale villain than a historical character). In other words, it seems Voldemort and Grindelwald are so dangerous because most other dark wizards were variations of serial killers, tribal leaders and mad scientists (to use Muggle terminology).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That was conjuration, not transfiguration. The permanent nature of transfiguration was depicted pretty consistently.

Transfiguration is defined as the branch of magic concerned with altering a thing's physical composition and structure - what JK Rowling refers to as an object's ‚Äúfundamental nature‚Äù:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúEvery now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

  Spell: The generic term for a piece of magic.

  Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.‚Äù (JK Rowling's Old Website: Spell Definitions)
#+end_quote

Although JK Rowling phrases this as the difference between ‚ÄúCharms‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpells‚Äù, from the example of ‚Äúturning a teacup into a rat‚Äù she's clearly talking about Transfiguration. A Charm, unlike a Transfiguration, is stated to ‚Äúnot fundamentally alter the properties of the subject‚Äù, which means that the reverse holds: Transfiguration does fundamentally alter the properties of the subject.

JK Rowling has been consistent on this. As early as 1998 she stated:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúWith a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.‚Äù (The Herald, 7 December 1998)
#+end_quote

The change that Transfiguration makes is a permanent one. We know this from two sources. The first is the pig's tail that Hagrid gave Dudley, which did not go away on its own and had to be surgically removed:

#+begin_quote
  Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. (GoF Chapter 4)
#+end_quote

The second is from the legend of Quintapeds in the companion book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them:

#+begin_quote
  In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and Transfigured each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five-legged creature. [...] The Quintapeds cannot talk and have strenuously resisted every attempt by the Department for the Regulation and Control of magical Creatures to capture a specimen and try to untransfigure it... (Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: Quintaped)
#+end_quote

Now, no one knows if the legend of the Quintapeds' origin is true or not. But the key part is that wizards, including the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, consider the story credible enough that they have attempted Untransfiguration. That means that the story -- including the permanence of the Transfiguration performed -- is within the realm of Transfiguration possibility.

So Transfiguration is not some kind of tactile illusion. It is not that the original object lurks ‚Äúbeneath‚Äù a layer of Transfiguration magic. Rather, the object is fundamentally, physically changed into a different object.

The permanence of Transfiguration also makes sense. Since Transfiguration is a physical change, there's no reason for the object to revert to its previous state. Physical objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects in the absence of magic. You would need some new magical intervention to make a further change.

However, Transfiguration can be reversed with Untransfiguration:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúI would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved ‚ÄòExceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level.‚Äù (OotP Chapter 29)
#+end_quote

But the possibility of Untransfiguration does not mean that the original object is still there, ‚Äúunderneath‚Äù. We know from Dumbledore that magic always leaves traces:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúHow did you know that was there?‚Äù Harry asked in astonishment.

  ‚ÄúMagic always leaves traces,‚Äù said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, ‚Äúsometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.‚Äù (HBP Chapter 26)
#+end_quote

So from what we know about the nature of Transfiguration as a fundamental change, Untransfiguration would appear to be a reversal of that change, not a removal of it. The fact that magic leaves traces explains how this is possible, even though nothing physical of the original object remains.

How the fuck did a poor 11yo (supposedly) muggleborn from an orphanage manage to raise power within a pureblood society?

A smart, handsome, and charming student that the teachers and the ordinary student loved is possible. However, some high-society pureblood? I can't believe Draco Malfoy would even befriend Hermione Granger, even if she become her fanon Mary Sue self.

Edit: A lot of people doesn't seem to get this, but I'm trying to draw a parallel between Tom Riddle and our beloved Indy!Harry. Except Tom didn't have the fame and money Harry had, but he's a lot more charming. How can he get standing within the pureblood Slytherin as early as his 5/6th year while making the story realistic as possible?

That's highly impressive. Plus, I'm guessing that apart from the few people who followed Tom Riddle, orphan muggleborn Slytherin, because they believed in him, he hid his identity after he quit Borgin and Burkes.

I assume he didn't have money to buy a new robes. He can't hide the fact that he grow up in the muggle world, culture isn't something you could read from a book in a month. Not to mention he must have a London-street accent, it's not something you could hide forever. If I'm a pureblood, it's easier to assume that that new guy's parseltounge is simply a random talent that show up in a muggleborn rather than accept that the random poor kid is a descendent of Slytherin.

Thats what make his rise to power so interesting. He has to be charming enough that everyone loved and doesn't suspect him while having a limited resource, and also trying to gain power in the pureblood community.

Power.

Magical power is the most important resource and that's the easiest way to gain power among blood supremacists. That and a hatred of muggles, which he had in abundance.

He had a lot more time than a month. At the very least he learned of magic the middle of the previous December. I also think you're overestimating the importance of an accent with someone as talented as Tom Riddle.

I can see Abraxas being his 1st "friend". Taking the talented Tom Riddle under his wing after realizing Slughorn loved him and seeing him in class. Lucius pretty much did the same with Snape and Draco wanted to do that with Harry.

Immediately his brilliance shines through, he's already more magically powerful/in control of it than basically any new Hogwarts students, he's charming - and soon enough he's opening the Chamber of Secrets and learning dark powers.

It's not all that surprising that he was charismatic and powerful enough to draw in an orbit of followers - followers that he'd deliberately choose for their wealth/prestige/blood purity in the WW. Plus, he's selling them on an enemy and way to 'take back control' of their world...

*** My theory is that it was slow, and probably didn't actually happen until 6th or 7th year.

Early on, he probably would've kept to himself, pretended to be a half-blood (yes, he's actually a half-blood, but he grew up in a muggle orphanage; he might've assumed he was a muggleborn), and tried to ride the line between powerful enough that his classmates wouldn't bully him but not so "uppity" that the upperclassmen would teach the mouthy halfblood a lesson. At some point, he probably gained a pureblood sponsor (like Ash_Lestrange suggested) that helps smooth his path a bit.

5th year is where he really gets the ball rolling, I think. At this point, he's probably the strongest student in the school. I doubt he has the loyalty of the purebloods yet, but they won't cross him either. If he plays it smart, he can slowly usurp control of his year from whichever pureblood holds it, and then either do the same with 6th year or just wait till they graduate.

And then 7th year is where he takes it up a notch. At this point, he's claimed the Gaunt ring and can pretend to be a pureblood. As long as he keeps it vague -- he probably pretends to be Morfin's kid, to some unknown witch who brought him to the orphanage -- he can now get support and loyalty from the die-hard blood supremacists.

Finally, the Wizarding War doesn't start until 20 years after Tom graduated from Hogwarts. I can easily see a charismatic and powerful halfblood controlling a group of teenagers. It's only Lord Voldemort that's truly lording over the purebloods and I think he could accomplish that in two decades (and most of them think he's pureblood anyway).

  ‚ÄúYes, we can!‚Äù said Mrs. Figg indignantly.

  Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù he said aloofly. ‚ÄúWhat is your story?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúI had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,‚Äù gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, ‚Äúwhen I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running---‚Äù

  ‚ÄúRunning?‚Äù said Madam Bones sharply. ‚ÄúDementors don't run, they glide.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThat's what I meant to say,‚Äù said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. ‚ÄúGliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhat did they look like?‚Äù said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh.

  ‚ÄúWell, one was very large and the other one rather skinny---‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù said Madam Bones impatiently. ‚ÄúThe Dementors... describe them.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. ‚ÄúThey were big. Big and wearing cloaks.‚Äù

  Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air...

  In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded.

  ‚ÄúBig and wearing cloaks,‚Äù repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. ‚ÄúI see. Anything else?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Mrs. Figg. ‚ÄúI felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt... as though all happiness had gone from the world... and I remembered... dreadful things...‚Äù

  Her voice shook and died.

  Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.

  ‚ÄúWhat did the Dementors do?‚Äù she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.

  ‚ÄúThey went for the boys,‚Äù said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. ‚ÄúOne of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that that is what happened,‚Äù Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.

  Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, ‚ÄúThat's what you saw, is it?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThat is what happened,‚Äù Mrs. Figg repeated.

It's a common misunderstanding that evolution favours the strongest. It doesn't. Evolution favours the species that reproduces the most.

It's consistently observed across human societies that as prosperity increases and infant mortality decreases, families have fewer children. Wizards have likely had a standard of living higher than that of modern Muggles for centuries if not millennia.

In short, wizards likely have been having a number of offspring that does no more than keep them at replacement rate for as long as recorded history.

If magic exists, then it rather casts doubt on the truth value of the body of scientific knowledge.

E.g. I doubt wizards are much interested in the periodic table of elements when they know full well that the universe is actually made of earth, air, fire, and water - and can perform the magic which proves it.

The problem is we see some families that have above-replacement (Weasley's) and some that are below-replacement (Malfoy's). So there's variation in completed fertility. Natural selection needs heritable variation in fertility to act upon..

Over time, since completed fertility in low-childhood mortality conditions is partially heritable, like all complex human traits, the proportion of wizards who have above replacement should gradually rise, and wizard population should grow.

Muggles (us) have only had ~100 years of low childhood mortality-- let's call that 6-7 generations, and our society has been radically changing for most of that time. The invention of the Pill, women having higher education, women not being legally restricted from workforce, fall in religiosity, etc. are all radical changes in social conditions, and we're still adapting...

but if wizard society is more stable, and has been exposed to a longer timespan of low childhood mortality and lack of scarcity, I would expect humans to be adapted to that, and reproducing quite a bit again....

**** What I was thinking was that evolution favors those that /live/ to reproduce the most, and magic (accidental or otherwise) would help people live more back before society was a thing. But then you get the question if magic was always there and other problems (like the one you pointed out) arise.

Yet, muggles still threw atomic bombs at Japan (using muggle science), which means that it's valid enough to make weapons of mass destruction. Wizards don't have access to those kind of weapons (as seen by their absence during the Voldemort wars).

Also, computers are something that developted due to a need to make multiple calculations faster (a need I assume is quite universal in money making). Yet, there are no magical computers (that we see)

And then you have electricity, I guess wizards wouldn't have much use for it since they have magic.

This is the thing about science, regardless of it's truth value, it works. Our theories could be wrong, but they are true enough that they bring about predictable results. Unless those results are different behind the scenes in Harry Potter we can only assume that it's the same for there.

‚Äã

If it wasn't obvious, I'm still waiting for someone with actual scientific knowledge to make a scientist Harry Poter fic (because fuck HPMoR) that would explore possible ways to use magic to further the scientific knowledge.
