"I should like to ask your advice about something," Severus said, his voice casual. "I know of another fifth-year Slytherin who was being bullied by Gryffindors. He was wooing a beautiful Muggleborn girl, who came across him being bullied, and tried to rescue him. And he called her a mudblood, and that was the end for them. He apologized, many times, but she never forgave him. Have you any thoughts for what he could have said or done, to win from her the forgiveness you gave Lestrange?"

"Erm," Harry said, "based on only that information, I'm not sure he was the main one who had a problem. I'd have told him not to date someone that incapable of forgiveness. Suppose they'd gotten married, can you imagine life in that household?"

There was a pause.

"Oh, but she could forgive," Severus said with amusement in his voice. "Why, afterward, she went off and became the girlfriend of the bully. Tell me, why would she forgive the bully, and not the bullied?"

Harry shrugged. "At a wild guess, because the bully had hurt someone else very badly, and the bullied had hurt her just a little, and to her that just felt far more unforgivable somehow. Or, not to put too fine a point on it, was the bully handsome? Or for that matter, rich?"

There was another pause.

"Yes to both," said Severus.

"And there you have it," said Harry. "Not that I've ever been through high school myself, but my books give me to understand that there's a certain kind of teenage girl who'll be outraged by a single insult if the boy is plain or poor, yet who can somehow find room in her heart to forgive a rich and handsome boy his bullying. She was shallow, in other words. Tell whoever it was that she wasn't worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty."

Severus stared at Harry in silence, his eyes glittering. The smile had faded, and though Severus's face twitched, it did not return.

Snape is asking about his relationship with Harry's Mother, So many feels


** ::sigh::

SOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!

The chapter in that book that gave me the most feels is the one when Severus kisses a student he's about to Obliviate (at her request) and she realizes that he's never kissed anyone in his life. It was sad.

END SPOILER!!!!!!!

I tried reading that story, got a long way through it, but got increasingly annoyed at how the author was using Super!Harry as a mouthpiece for his/her own philosophy. It got creepy and cultish, even if I tried to get past the misogyny (see above) and violence . . .

*** The spoiler wasn't that sad. The author has even said that they were mocking romantic!Snape stories by showing the kiss as awkward and cringeworthy.

*** Yeah I'm only 30 chapters in and Harry doesn't really seem like himself it's really similar to Ender's game in that it's about kids that grew up to fast.

** I have it partially read, but its very dense so I've been avoiding reading it, as it's a heavy read...but this part is amazing and sad, all at once.

*** It's so good I had crazy feels at that point, realized shortly after it clearly stated this was what it was talking about but before I read that far it hit me like a brick wall.
