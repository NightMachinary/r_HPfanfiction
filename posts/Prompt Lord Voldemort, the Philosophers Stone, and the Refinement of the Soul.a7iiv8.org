Alchemy is often thought of as the process of trying to refine base materials into gold. But alchemy can also be understood as the process of refining the self / the soul, as an internal process.

Prompt/ Suggestion: A story where Lord Voldemort manages to steal the Philosophers Stone at the end of Book one. By using it though, he (unwittingly) begins the process of healing on a spiritual/mental/emotional level. By the time he is fully restored he has also completed the process of transmuting his soul from the tattered remains of a sociopath into the whole and healthy one he should have had if his life had gone differently.

Possible wrinkle: in the time it takes this to happen the diary gets sent to the school and atom manages to kill Ginny, escaping from the book and gaining a body.


** This could be interesting for sure.

Pile-on to the wrinkle, as Quirellmort is trying to heal, he starts talking to Ginny not realizing he is talking to her because of the growing link to the diary. At first, he tried to make her do evil, but that slowly changes as he becomes a more complete person and sees the value of having her do well and own her success to him.

** It doesn't happen exactly as you described, but Voldemort repairing his soul and regaining quite a bit of mental health and sanity is the theme of linkffn(Benefits of Old Laws).

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

*** I know soul repair and regained sainity have been done. I'm looking specifically for him transitioning from being an objectively bad person to becoming an objectively good person.
