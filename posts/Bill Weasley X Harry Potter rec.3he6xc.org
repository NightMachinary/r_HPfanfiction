Also open to the idea of Charlie x Harry or Weasley Twins x Harry. Pref stories not porn. I'm a bit of a weirdo with my pairings.

** You are basically looking for linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure) and the sequel, linkffn(Turn Me Loose: A Harry Potter Adventure). If you haven't read those, then drop everything you are doing now, and read those, for they were written by the JBern allmighty. Not slash. Not your usual fanfic.

*** He said Harry/Bill Weasley, not Harry/Luna?

**** But maybe he'll settle for stories where Harry and Bill are just together, not /together/. He said HarryxBill and then said stories not porn. And that is a good story. OP, if you're reading this then just skip the intro chapter altogether and come back to it at the proper place in the story, it's more fun that way.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?
