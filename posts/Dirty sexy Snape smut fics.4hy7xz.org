** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6479652/lena1987][Lena]], writes Snape/Hermione fucking beautifully. Snape is still harsh and Snape-like, but you can totally see why someone could come to care for him, I think. It's been ages since I've read her things, so it might not be entirely what you're looking for in terms of how he's portrayed, but I distinctly remember liking everything of hers that I'd so far read. She was the person that made me ok with this ship, I think. Also: It's not insanely smutty, but The Birth of Venus by her. God. It was just fabulous. I loved, and you might!
