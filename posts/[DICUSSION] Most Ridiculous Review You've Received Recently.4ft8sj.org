(EDIT: I in fact meant "discussion", not dicussion. Sorry.)

I haven't published any fanfic on FF.net in several years now, and I definitely haven't been publishing as much as I am recently, where I think I've written 20k or something in the last week or so. On the one hand, the sudden burst of inspiration and motivation is great.

On the other hand, with regular updates come ridiculous reviews. I've got one reviewer at the moment who literally only posts ":D" or, occasionally, if I'm very lucky, ":D :D" on the chapters they read. A similar person puts "LOVE IT" on each chapter, in the same vein.

There's another separate reviewer who punctuates her reviews with :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD and !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to such an extent it makes me feel like I've been rewound back to 2009, and proceeded to tell me how much they don't like cigarettes when I mentioned later on in the series a character would be a smoker.

My favourite stupid review so far, though, has been "HAVE HARRY KICK QUIRREL IN THE FOREBIDDEN ZONE WHE NHE FINDS OUT THE TRUTH."

Fills me with inspiration, that does.

What's the most ridiculous, pointless review you've received recently?

(Also, I just followed the FAQ tip and downloaded the Reddit Enhancement Suite, and God, my life is changed.)


** On April Fool's day, I made a joke fic that took the piss out of terrible tropes in Harmony fics. I set out to make it as shit as you can make a fic that's only about 100 words long and I don't know how I could have made the sarcasm more obvious. Despte that, I got a review saying

"Not too bad, but I prefer Robst."

** My reviewers on ffnet are lovely and I've never had a weird one, although I get the occasional flame that is meant to be nasty. I did have one on HPFF that was the reviewer pretending to be a cat. I deleted my account a while back, but I remember them making a bunch of cat puns like "purrrfect" and doing random hissing throughout the review.

**** Maybe. /shrug/ I mostly just wanted to know what, specifically, they were screaming about. It was a long chapter. Any of it might have set them off. Or was it all of it? I'll never know. Plus, there are different kinds of screams - frustration or outright anger, fear, excitement. I'll never know which, or if it was something I could have fixed. :/ It really didn't communicate much - therefore, pointless.

** This is from an old fic I posted a few years back. I wrote a Harry Potter oneshot, definitely nsfw. Most comments were similar to "I love this" "that was hot" or "well written, you made a typo here" (I always encourage constructive criticism whenever I post a fic).

But one comment made me feel kinda, well, gross and uncomfortable. It was along the lines of "I jerked off so many times reading this."

How do I respond to that? Thanks?

I felt like I needed a shower afterwards.

*** I mean, there is another way you can look at it:

That review's about as creepily-worded as possible, but isn't that kind of the point of smut? It's basically written porn. So, I mean, if you actually got somebody to literally wank themselves raw over it, creepiness aside, that's the best compliment you can get. Your erotica actually got someone off. More than once, apparently.

Always look on the bright side of life, I guess.

**** Oh yeah definitely. A part of me was thinking " Ah, cool, someone really liked this so I must have done a good job. I'm happy", because, as you said, it was smut and the point for smut is to, in a way, explore some kind of fantasay.

But another part of me was just thinking that certain details are best kept unsaid, lol.

**** I wrote a lot, but I took a step back and looked at the plotline for a bit. It will eventually update, but I want to make sure that the whole thing actually goes somewhere. I also have the Salem Settlement, which I enjoy writing - a lot. And I'm working on a fem!Harry thing which I enjoy, as well as my own personal novel project.

But yes, I do love to see people writing what they like, what they suspect will happen,... Just as much as spite, these encouragements also help to find motivation and inspiration.

** Mine was for my Mass Effect fanfiction, but gave me a bit of a chuckle. In this story, Humanity is fighting aliens species. They humans are far weaker, have no big space fleet to speak of and have a small army.

The review insisted that they should go to every alien capital world and nuke it to oblivion, then move on to the next. They then complained that the Human leader had obviously never played a 4x strategy game if he couldn't grasp such a simple concept.
