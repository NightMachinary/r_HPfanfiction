I've read Divided and Entwined, and Sum of their Parts, and I liked them (although I greatly preferred Sum of Their Parts, I would have liked it longer!). It doesn't matter if it's a pureblood revolution, a death eater revolution, muggleborn revolution, order of the phoenix... I'll read whatever as long as it's well written!


** The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina has a revolution in Hogwarts during 5th year that spirals out into the rest of Wizarding Britain. Basically young Purebloods read Marx, Sartre and other authors and their magical minds are blown. The winds of revolution blow soon after, all over Umbridge. The Ministry is a lot more sinister in tone than canon.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Since you mentioned Divided and Entwined, a lot of the other fics by the same author have similar anti government revolutionary themes. Marriage Law Revolution is quite similar but post VW2, Returned Reformed and Really Trying is a bit more humorous revolution with DL Grindelwald, Democracy is about peacefully abolishing the old system through politics, Spygirl has a similar "let's blow them up with lots of explosives" theme, Lady Thief has more spying and breaking into places while also politicking, Patron is more about the Voldemort war than about anti government stuff, and Granger Principle is more muggle style battle and espionage.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
