Hello!

As the title suggest I am looking for a fic(or a book/movie/tv show, really) with a very well written reunion scene. I've always been a sucker for those.

For example, long lost relatives finding each other again, lovers reuniting after thinking the other dead, friends fighting different parts of the war and finally seeing each other again after the victory, etc.

Doesn't matter if it's slash, femslash, het or gen. Thanks!


** OK, this is probably too stereotypical and sentimental, but I just like the meeting of Harry and Ginny in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3301733/chapters/8499589]] and then of course [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/601124/chapters/1233595]] (the whole story is excellent and I feel very underrated).
