Thoughts?


** Why wouldn't the Master just leave rather than staying with the Dumbledores?\\
I guess it could be because he thought learning magic would be useful, and he then teamed up with Grindlewald to take over the earth, but wizard-style.

You could have so his sister dying did change him, or he realized that perhaps openly taking over the world isn't that great of an idea so he gained power in the wizarding world. It would probably diverge pretty soon tho.

If you really wanted to be weird have so Tom Riddle Jr. is The Doctor, but he doesn't know that Albus is The Master.

If you wanted to go for an amusing humor story you could have:\\
The Master and The Doctor do something (Perhaps when he takes the Tardis and the doctor somehow comes with?) and they end up back in time, and accidently kill Tom Riddle and Dumbledore with the Tardis (landing on them perhaps). Perhaps these are important enough people and they both replace them. The Doctor becoming Dumbledore(or Tom Riddle), and the Master as Tom Riddle (or Dumbledore). The Master tries to kill people and take over with The Doctor attempting to stop him.

I just went with my thoughts there.

*** When he was YANA, the Master did not KNOW he was a time lord. He was genetically a human then.

**** I'm tired and I haven't seen doctor who in like a year. Completely forgot about their ability to 'become' a human until they do whatever with the pocketwatch. So I just assumed a Master where he was still a time-lord.

***** No worries, i should have stated that in the op but didn't cuz i'm so busy cleaning house and prepping for an estate sale.

I did dig the idea of them taking the place of the two. I think i might write that story.

** What is this discussion about? Some fic where Dumbledore's true identity is in question?
