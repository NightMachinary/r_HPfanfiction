A problem I've heard people talking about here is 'muggle wank', or when fics go on and on about how muggles are better, in some way, then wizards when in fact canon wizards have a ton stuff they do incredibly better then muggles. And I get that. But at the same time fics with lack of 'muggle wank' annoy me because if wizards are so overwhelmingly better then muggles at everything, there should be no muggles left (if wizards and muggles evolved at the same time). And even ignoring or explaining that, considering the amount of damage one wizard can do to muggles, and that blood purism seems to have been a thing for a while, why hasn't a community of wizards ever wiped out all the muggles in a country and made it their own? Why is it that (in fics), not even the most racist wizards are doing anything about how muggles are causing global warming, or how the muggle population is growing at an unsustainable rate? Why did Grindlewald even consider taking muggles as slaves when, considering how broken wizards can be, he could have easily wiped out every single muggle in Germany (if he hated them that much)? He was already at war with the rest of Wizarding World; why not go for it?

Essentially what I want is a good, new idea for why wizards haven't completely dominated muggles that isn't just 'they don't feel like it'. Wizards are powerful people, and throughout history powerful people have been trolling and killing the ever loving hell out of their weaker peers.

But in the end what I want aren't reasons for why groups of evil wizards haven't wiped out muggles. What is want is plausible reasons (to use in a fic), for why they wouldn't be able to. For why even groups evil racist wizards are forced to live in secret, hidden away from the muggles they hate so much. Reasons that have to do with the muggles themselves, and not things like 'other wizards would stop them'.

Maybe muggles disrupt magic the same way magic disrupts technology, making using powerful magic in muggle dense areas impossible? Maybe muggles have crazy powerful magic ability that they can only access after coming into contact with magic (explaining all those demigods and impossible strong dragon slaying heroes in legend), and so the whole secrecy thing is all about preventing too many muggles from getting those powers? Those are just the things I can come up with writing this right now; have you guys come up with any ideas for why/how muggles could actually be interesting in a fic, and not just 'boring people who don't have magic who wizards could wreck anytime they wanted to'?


** I like your idea.

It's basic human nature to abuse every advantage they have. I absolutely don't buy that Wizards went into hiding because they didn't want to rule over Muggles. They went into hiding because of an existential threat.

As for what that threat was, it didn't even have to originate from Muggles. It could very much deal with some powers that Wizards feared and respected.

*** I do really want the threat to come from the muggles themselves though, because I want the dominant species on a magical planet to be magical as well. A magical species so invasive and genocidal that all the other magical creatures said 'fuck it' and went into hiding.

The coolest idea I could come up with is that science and technology actually is muggle magic; the universe is actually inherently magical and muggles, by observing it, force reality to obey the laws of physics, fucking up everyone else's magic and building nukes.

This is meaningless.

Lots of science can be performed by simply looking hard enough at it. For instance, you can prove the Earth is round by looking at the moon, running down a long flight of stairs, and then observing from the bottom that the position relative to the horizon has changed.

If you're referring to the higher sciences, fine, that's not immediately observable in most cases. But at the same time, you're essentially saying that reality is magical until you observe it, at which point it's classifiable. Which, really, just means it's always classifiable. Superpositions cant exist if the observable outcome is always certain. That's not how they work.

***** No. I'm not talking about anything like what you're going on about.

In this theory, the story world would literally be run by something akin to wild magic: the world would literally work like a story, or a vaguely animist religion. Animals are capable of randomly attaining sentence. The weather is a half sapient force. Magic is everywhere, animating everything, giving everything from gravity to magnetism to trees a certain will that means their behavior can't be predicted.

And then muggles stroll up and turn the world from an animal into a machine. And it's magic because it only happens for muggles. For a wizard how fast a fire spreads would depend on how fire us feeling that day, while if there was a muggle nearby suddenly fire would behave differently, following what muggles think are the laws of how reality works, but is actually just the shape muggle magic forces reality into.

Essentially muggles would be reality warmers that warp reality in one specific way, but I admit at this point the story would be hard to fit into the shape of Harry Potter canon.

******* Holy fucking shit this was not the reply I thought I would get. This being the internet I fully expected you to come back in a wild, incredibly ignorant rage, ready to take a hot steaming dump on my ideas and insinuate questionable things about my mother. You may have single-handedly restored at least half my faith in humanity with this.

The main problem I have with the idea though is that it kind of divorces muggles from the entire magical world. A story like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them couldn't possibly have happened in a world where muggles worked like this: Jacob would have wrecked any magic he came into contact with.

So I'm trying to think of ways to turn it into more of an active ability, rather than a passive one, but even then it feels underwhelming to have, mostly because it isn't of much help to individual muggles. What's the point of forcing reality into shape where building computers or spaceships is possible, if as a single person, you don't have the education, materials or manpower to do such a thing, and now your life is so much harder because the easy way (magic) is gone?

Any ideas?

That's entirely true. However, kinks being worked out that you elaborate on lower down, it would be a legitimate catalyst for the over-the-top rage you see at some magic users against muggleborns.

Sure, them having magic means you're forced to deal with them /somehow/, but when they try to "fix" the wizarding world without really understanding what that means, they actually threaten quite a lot more than just social structure. If you try to approach magic scientifically, you tear it down.

A story like HPMOR where Harry tries to spread science could have led to a magical extinction.

This might not actually be necessary. Maybe /everyone/ was magical, at one point. Maybe it only took one person using what most would perceive as common sense to tackle every day problems to start breeding non-magicals.

Imagine, some guy is kind of shitty at aiming his spells, so he tries to work out how to do it. He takes into consideration the air, the angles and, wallah, he completely loses the ability to use magic. But his descendants make bows and arrows.

It was slowly as technology grew (primitive, granted, but growing nonetheless) that wizards realized what was happening. Magical people started to be less and less magical. Muggles arose. Wizards were still dominant, but were now definitely and distinctly different from muggles.

Then comes what we consider the Renaissance. Suddenly muggles are born more and more and more and wizards, frightened that magic is completely dying, isolate themselves.

Once isolated, they find that this happens less and less. Wizards are very unlikely to have "squibs" than before. However, when it /does/ happen, it's extremely shameful. It shows that the parents, at some point, attempted to look at the world in a structural way. People, like the Weasleys who had an accountant in the family, are considered Blood Traitors.

Obviously we're getting /very very/ AU at this point. Lots of stuff would have to be changed to properly reflect it, but you can use a whole lot of snippets and callbacks from the original series to make people /really/ think about it.

********* Ah while I do like your interpretation, it isn't quite my idea. In my idea wizards would be completelely incapable of trying to structure the world like muggles do; they wouldn't posses the ability to tame it. A wizard trying to figure out how to aim a bow and arrow better would quickly run into a brick wall; how accurate his shots were wouldn't depend on things like wind resistance or thrust or anything he could predict (though they would play a role in making the bow work), but rather on magical stuff like how the wind felt about him vs. how it felt about his target, how the bow felt about being used by him (was he been maintaining it well enough for it to 'like' him?) and stuff like that. Science as we know it would be completely impossible for wizards, and a story like HPMOR would involve Harry realizing that no matter what he does, he can't study magic that same way muggles study nature, and being forced to adapt.

The reason muggle technology wouldn't work in Hogwarts wouldn't be because magic interferes with technology, but rather because without a muggle nearby to keep them honest the electrons just won't behave themselves. In fact, the more fiddly technology gets the more it requires muggle attention; the Hogwarts train is the highest technology wizards can use without help, and the Weasley car would have never worked, or gone crazy the second there wasn't a muggle close enough to keep the engine from developing free will.

The problem with replicating the old spells of past wouldn't be about lost formulas or words, but rather about trying to replicate the relationship those wizards had with nature; parseltongue would be broken because it would give wizards who have it an even greater ability to converse directly with parts of nature, and strike deals. Spells being language and costing energy would be explained away as deals that nature liked so much it lets everybody use; complex rituals would complex because the wizard to form a more personal connection to achieve what they're doing.

And even then there would be a hard cap on wizarding power (why wizard could never cause global warming) that wouldn't limit muggles, because there would be things nature simply wouldn't let wizards do.

It wouldn't be about wizards being afraid of becoming muggles. It would be about wizards being unable to operate the way muggles do and being unable to just conquer them, and the modern era making them consider if maybe, just maybe, they might have gotten the short end of the stick.

Because they get something out of it: resources, greater manpower for military forces, superior terms of trade, religious dominance, etc.

Muggles have literally nothing that wizards want. There is no incentive to conquer them and even less to wipe them out.

Which is in turn why it's nonsense to talk about wizards being "forced to hide". Wizarding secrecy is something wizards /value/, not something they consider a burden. There is nothing that wizards are missing out on by maintaining secrecy.

In any case, in every functional sense wizards already have conquered Muggles. They interfere in Muggle government at will, at both the domestic and international level.

*** I'm not talking about conquering. I'm talking about genocide.

Genocide is a thing humans do, when we are convinced we are better or that the enemy is disgusting. Hitler tried it and, using modern technology and infrastructure, was terrifyingly effective.

And yet no wizard Hitler has tried? No magical community ever tried to create their own country without muggles, the same Nazi Germany tried to create a country (and world) without nonwhite people? If magic in Harry Potter is as strong as the stuff I've been reading about in the anti 'muggle wank' threads, then I don't see anyway how a muggle government could really do anything if their wizarding community turned against them, and I don't buy the argument that wizards have always been so enlightened that nobody ever tried.

Even in my original post I said I hate answers like 'cuz they can't be bothered/ it's not worth it. Even if a society didn't desire any if the resources, all it would take was one terrorist cell teleporting around to every major city casting fiendfyre to kill millions.

People can always be motivated to do terrible things by hatred. And I want good ideas for why muggles, which so many wizards seem to hate even in the modern era, managed to survive enough of (if it mimics muggle history) what would have been a much more hateful history to become a dominant species.

Tribal shaman, priests, priest-kings, court wizards, nobles etc. Some posters don't seem to understand that many people like it, like it very much if they are above other people.

Not too many wizards would have wanted to go from a person far above the muggle peasants to just another wizard among many, without anyone to lord it over - and worse, being the most bottom rung of the new society.

***** But why? Why has there never been a whole society of racist wizards willing to try? Cuz if there never has been then we're getting to the point were wizards, morally, really are better than muggles. If wizards never had any of the ethical stumbles muggles have had (we've done genocide a whole bunch of time, and spent a lot of the time in-between them abusing each other), then the Malfoy's are right. Wizards are better than normal people, and Wizarding society is better than normal society.

I just can't buy a society of powerful people living alongside a society of what is essentially powerless people without abuse. Maybe not the genocide I'm talking about, but definitely abuse. Muggle governments can barely prevent date rape and people travelling to third world countries to do bad stuff to children. Wizard criminals and psychopaths live right next to a society full of women literally completely and utterly powerless to stop them, and yet nobody ever talks about all the opportunity for abuse?

Every unsolved crime in muggle history could very possibly have been done by a wizard. Hell, considering how easily a wizard could frame somebody possibly a lot of solved crimes as well. I don't see how the Ministry of Magic could stop this, seeing as how the Trace is removed from adults and mind magic is broken powerful.

That's what I'm trying to get right in my mind. If wizards just don't/have never abuse muggles on a wide scale / tried to genocide them, the wizards and wizarding culture really is superior to muggle culture in a significant way. But if they did, then how did they not succeed?

And what I'm interested in is not debating forever why wizards wouldn't do stuff like that, but rather brainstorming interesting ideas for why they couldn't.

******* But throughout history, people on the whole have also been pretty god damn racist. And societies on the whole have done some pretty fucked up things to other societies.

I love people. And I know that people are nice to other people. But throughout history it has been really easy for people to convince each other that the people living over there who looked different, or acted different, weren't actually people. Nazi Germany was exceptionally brutal yes, but the British Empire came before it. The whole colonial age came before it.

People are awesome, and nice yes. But we're also really good, as societies, at dehumanizing each other when it's convenient. Entire societies can be pretty overwhelmingly racist (like the US during the Slave Trade), and those societies can do some pretty inhuman things to other people, not because they're all sociopaths, but because they don't see the humans suffering as people.

All throughout history, humans have been good at treating each other well, and just as good at taking any tangible difference (either in behavior or appearance) between their in-group and an out-group to justify bad behavior. Wizards could still abuse muggles and be law-abiding, if there are no laws against abusing muggles (like their weren't any laws against owning slaves). Wizards can treat each other well and abuse muggles, because why would that matter? Members of the KKK lynch a black person and then go home, kiss their wives and be wonderful dads to their kids; racists don't just go around yelling racist things all the time; when they're not being racist, they're being people.

So I don't think my view of human nature is inaccurate. I think Men in Black said it best: A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.

So I just don't buy that no wizards, who have a truly tangible, life-defining difference between them and muggles, a much greater difference than any of the ones muggles have used to justify killing each other, don't use that difference to abuse muggles, especially considering how hard it would be for the Ministry of Magic to catch them (mind magic, lack of trace, etc...).

And I don't buy that there was never a society of wizards who (like how the US decided black people weren't people during the slave trade) decided muggles weren't people. That would mean that wizards, despite having their own societies completely un-reliant on muggle society, never went through any of the moral stumbling that muggle societies did and still do. And that would imply, to me, that Draco is right and wizards really are better.

To make my point clearer; yes a civil society mandates that it's members accept that societies rules and acts as a group to enforce them. But the rules that society agrees on don't have to be anything us sitting here would say is moral, or ethical.

So, to get back on topic, my main point was that if wizards really were so overwhelmingly powerful than muggles then, considering how blood purism seems to have been around for a long time, there should be no muggles left. Back in the Dark Ages a single wizard could wipe out an entire village. And considering how muggles used to burn witches, plenty of angry wizards would have plenty of reason to do so (cuz even if the muggles can't actually hurt you cuz of the flame freezing charm, you would still be very, very angry).

And what I actually wanted from this thread were reasons why wizards wouldn't be able to do that. Reasons why muggles came to dominate the world instead of wizards that don't rely on wizarding apathy or good nature, because one of those isn't relevant, the other means wizards really are better than muggles and, looking at history, neither reason truly make sense to me.

The one possible reason I could get from your answer is that wizarding society initially sprouted from muggle society (muggleborns are the source of magic) and so wizards couldn't go around wiping out muggle villages because every village and town would, undoubtedly have a small community of muggleborns defending it. Because that's what would make a lot more sense to me; not wizards just uni-formally coming into existence with the morals and ethics muggles took hundreds of years to develop. But prehistoric, smaller scale wizarding societies sprouting from muggle ones and protecting their non-magical neighbours. Do you have any idea of the whole 'all wizarding lines began with a muggleborn' theory being canon? Because now that I think of it I think I've seen it a lot in fics theorizing about the source of magic, but it could just be popular fanon.

******** I think there's a few points you're missing.

1. I already mentioned Voldemort's regime as a time when wizards did exactly what you say they have never done: as a large scale group embarked upon an industrial scale act of evil which would sooner or later turn its eyes on the Muggles. But as I mentioned above, other wizards stopped this regime, just as tends to happen to such regimes in the Muggle world.

2. I think you're overestimating the extent to which wizarding societies are separate. The international wizarding community is far more integrated than the Muggle equivalent and there is a common, international, cultural consensus that the Statute of Secrecy is a good thing for wizards. So any society of wizards (e.g. Grindelwald's followers) which went against this would quickly find themselves clashing with the larger international wizarding community.

So fundamentally I think not only are you overstating the evil of Muggle societies but also the goodness of magical ones. The fact is that the wizarding world, just as the Muggle one, is generally good but has instances of bad people who sometimes gain significant followings, but sooner or later are defeated by those who are generally good.

Not long ago a whole industrial nation kept an entire race as slaves and no other country went to war with them over it. And before that Britain sailed around conquering and subduing people's all over the world and other countries only fought them because they wanted to do the same thing. And the further back you go the more brutal people got towards each other for the simplest of reasons.

I'm not talking about modern muggle societies, I'm talking about how considering how xenophobic people have been throughout history it's hard to see how muggles still exist. Look what happened to the Native Americans. That's what muggle society is capable of, when we feel like it. And if I wanted to google I could probably find more examples.

It doesn't matter how nice muggles are now: the learning curve was steep and took thousands of years. And if wizards had to go through a similar learning curve, then I don't see how muggles would still exist unless some wizards were protecting them for some reason (my muggleborn theory), keep there was something about muggles that prevented wizards from attacking them.

Also is the wizarding community really so well integrated? If so why did no one intervene to stop Voldemort? Your first and second points seem to clash to me, and I can't think of any canon events that would indicate that wizards are more globalized than muggles (the UN is muggle after all, as well as the Geneva Convention, and those are pretty comparable to the Statue of Secrecy).

********** The historical answer is simple: prior to the statute of secrecy, wizards had greater allegiance to Muggles of the same nationality than to other wizards. We know, for example, that the Malfoy family fought for William the Conqueror in the Norman conquest of England. Since every nation has wizards, they more or less cancel out, but certainly there will no doubt be wizards participating in magical aspects of what we consider Muggle atrocities.

/After/ the statute of secrecy, the aforementioned international cultural consensus on non-interference with the Muggle world holds, and the community is self-enforcing against individuals like Grindelwald who try to break it.

The ICW has much more power than the UN. It's more like the EU in terms of the way it infringes on national sovereignty. Some examples of wizards having much greater levels of international integration than Muggles:

- The ICW has removed at least one Minister for Magic from office (Damocles Rowle).

- The ICW forbade wizarding interference in WW1, something which national wizarding governments had to enforce (though there were many breaches).

- The British Ministry and MACUSA agreed not to involve themselves in the Muggle American revolutionary war, picking loyalty to kind over country.

- The British Ministry cooperated with a foreign Ministry in HBP to have a foreign President forget to telephone the British Prime Minister.

*********** To add to the cooperation of making the president of "a far distant county" forget the phone call:

- Two wizarding governments coordinated within /seconds/ to have the leader of another country being manipulated, or Britain was at least confident enough to get it done before the president would call (minutes at max, since the PM was "waiting")

** Grindenwald didn't hate muggles, he just thought they were inferior and should be ruled over by him.

The way I figure it, even from the beginning, it was a question of quality versus quantity. HP magic, while extremely powerful in many respects, just doesn't seem to be effective against more than a small crowd of people at a time. If it is, it's never shown. The only examples I can think of are utility magic like muggle repelling wards or the Fidelius, and I still maintain that such magics can be broken if put under too much strain. Otherwise, combat magic and such is mostly single target. Fiendfyre is less so, but it's also incredibly double edged, just as likely to kill the caster. Kings and military commanders in those days were quite willing to take large casualties if it achieved their goals, so throwing numbers at the problem would be a valid tactic, and one most likely to succeed. Another tactic is good old assassination. Unless a wizard goes full hermit, they have to interact with other people in some way, and that would leave them open to being stabbed in the back, whether literally or figuratively. Not even a wizard can counter every method of assassination.

In the modern day it's even more true. There are millions of muggles in any given city. Wizards simply can't fight that many people. At best they can set off a nuclear winter or descend the world into anarchy before they get swamped by lynch mobs, but any winning case for wizards is a pyrrhic one.

*** Muggle-repelling Charms work on any number of muggles. Tactically, wizards can easily mind-control muggle leaders - or any muggle they want. Like, say, the one with acess to the army's heavy weapons, or those who can order the soldiers around.

A muggle mob is easily stopped by a mind-controlled squad with a few machine guns.

**** You say it works regardless, I say it's got a limit. Makes it slightly more realistic.

And sure, they can mind control whoever they want... assuming they have the knowledge and skill to cast one of the Unforgivables, have the willpower required to hold onto a mind and bend it to their will, have muggles around who even have guns, and, last but not least, have any single goddamn idea about anything muggle whatsoever, much less their military capabilities, their chain of command, or any other part of the muggle government required to carry out a hostile takeover of said government.

Mind control really doesn't solve every problem. Very few wizards are capable of flinging the Imperius around at the drop of a hat.

***** Four of them are enough to get the leaders of four world powers.

That is not the problem at all. And Draco Malfoy, who is never shown to be incredibly skilled, can cast it against two people (Rosmerta, Katie). Harry could cast it on a Goblin. Barty Crouch could do it, so could his father.

I'd do a different argument: The only time we know of a Muggle being Imperiused is with the vice minister (start of HBP), which leads to him going crazy.

****** If it were that easy, it would have been done already. Grindenwald wouldn't have tried to make an army, he would have just gone ahead and imperiused people. Voldemort imperiused people, and it wasn't an immediate key to the city, it was another tool in his arsenal. There is zero reason for immoral people not to use it if it's that damn easy. There has to be some kind of limitation.

I do like the idea that mind magic negatively effects muggles more than magicals. Probably something that was never widely studied because nobody ever cared to, for various reasons.

** I'm going to throw this out there;

Risk vs. Reward / Effort Vs. Reward

To wit, we don't (in canon) know of any wizard farmers. We know of wizard herbologists, but there don't seem to be any wizards out there devoting themselves entirely to the task of growing wheat, and raising cattle.

Why? Because it isn't worth the effort of doing so. Not when muggles focus on doing it already, and being as there are so very many muggles, growing such massive quantities of wheat, raising a veritable avalanche of cattle, why would a wizard bother? After all, their muggles grub about in the dirt for them.

In my mind, this is the entirety of Gringott's stranglehold on the wizarding economy - the goblins managed to keep the wizarding world on the gold standard, while being the only option to reliably transfer wizarding currency into muggle currency, for the purposes of purchasing food.

So, wizards focus on wizarding things and Gringott's reaps the rewards of ever increasing profit. (1 oz of gold, converted dollars, then the dollars spent on wheat buys a ~lot~ more wheat in 1990 than it did in 1890. Not that the Wizards know that).

This same logic applies to ~everything~ non-magical. From cotton to timber, muggles just do it on a grander scale and cheaper. Why would you want to wipe out your servant class?

Continuing the argument, all these things that the muggles do so well, takes massive tracts of land. Even given the less than whole percentage value of wizard representation of the overall population, that is still land that would have to be obtained, and then obscured. Which represents a risk in dealing with muggles wondering who bought the land, what is being done with the land, and neighboring muggles/muggle corporations wanting to obtain the land for themselves. Why take the risk and deal with the hassle?

We can easily make our arguments about human nature, but I choose to base mine on one that has been proven again and again. The path of least resistance for the greatest reward.

Now lets look at it from the muggle perspective.

Wizards. Who gives a fuck? They can't magically create food and most of their magic doesn't do us any good, and even if it did, a significant majority of them are uneducated luddites. Yes, some of them cause trouble when their trinkets fall into the hands of the mundane population. Yes, catching their criminals is unreasonably difficult. Luckily, we have contacts in their government to send the reports, to and really we have larger issues.

Wizard Dark Lords are a danger, but while they can kill with ease and seeming impunity, one man and his deranged cadre of a couple hundred followers, even with their magic tricks, isn't any larger of a threat than domestic terrorism. Fortunately, most of their targets are their fellow wizards, although the targeting of a wizards muggle parents is rather unfair.

If the trend of killing each other off in significant numbers every generation or two continues, our current data, as gathered since 1906, indicates the population sustainability should terminate before 2200. We expect a complete breakdown in wizarding social services several decades before that, with muggleborn wizards no longer having the option of a wizarding education. Our current plan is to treat muggleborns as having a genetic disorder/medical condition, and offering supplemental classes on controlling their condition alongside a standard education. With a normal background, and proper civic values, it is entirely possible one of our citizens might one day find a way to make a useful contribution with their condition. Maybe they can finally figure out how to vanish nuclear waste, or to have transfigured materials interact normally with technology.
