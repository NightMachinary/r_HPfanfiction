Is there anything like that? Like, maybe Voldemort takes more time to come back to life and body, Harry decides to become an auror because he knows he'll have to fight Voldemort someday, and Harry is actually a competent adult wizard when they collide, so Voldy isn't underestimating him at every turn? Or something, anything, /remotely/ close?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is another fic that has Voldemort coming back after Harry was an adult. But instead of going after Harry, Voldemort went after that traitor Lucius Malfoy first.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** That's GOING to happen later in my story, Fight For Rights. :) It's going to be twenty years down the line, when the main character is in her forties. :)
