It's football season in America. Or handegg, depending on your point of view. In any case, I'm looking for some good quidditch-centric stories where Harry is playing at the professional level or something like that. Shipping is welcome and encouraged, because romantic tension is always good to read as well.

Basically, more stories like linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup)

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

** I have plenty of objections to linkffn(12745758), but modifications of the Quidditch rules were done very well, and the description of the matches was good as well.

** 'Hope' by Jeconais has a lot of Quidditch in it (and I think it is some of the best done) but isn't necessarily a story just about Quidditch.

It's also one of the stories that launched a thousand tropes, and the main relationship is between a girl who is 16, and an adult, which is one of the points of conflict in the story ( not just gratuitous exploitation.)

  A young squib is rejected from Hogwarts, but drafted by one of Britain's long-standing Quidditch teams. The Chudley Cannons! A questionable decision by its manager. Are the fans in for another season of disappointment? (An original take on the fantasy/sports genre.) *Cover art adapted from Etsy and depicts Sora from the story.
