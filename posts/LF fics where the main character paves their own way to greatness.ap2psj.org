  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

** That is typical for Ravenclaw! and Slytherin!Harry fics. For example:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] - Ravenclaw!Harry, Dumbledore mentor, focused on mind magic but many other aspects of magic as well. linkffn(12740667)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - WBWL Slytherin!Harry, wants to prove himself better than his brother and become strong enough to never be taken advantage of again. Mostly focused on 'Dark' magic, runes, and potions. First book in the series is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]" linkao3(12608820)

It's also a common theme for fics that focus on Tom Riddle while he was growing up, especially AU fics in which he doesn't turn into a psychotic maniac. These two fics in which Tom and Hermione grow up together are good examples:

*** Why are fics with good Tom Riddles so hard to find?

Sturgeon's Law in full force there. 95% of Riddlefics have psychotic maniac Voldemort (though to be fair, that is canon!Voldy, which is also a boring, one-note EVULZ character) or, on the other side, a smirking, palette-swapped fanon alternate of Draco Malfoy.

Hardly any fics show what how brilliant he's supposed to be... Even canon made him look like a complete dumbass.

**** In my opinion part of the problem is that most Tom Riddle fics focus heavily on shipping, which usually involves the fic author passing out idiot balls like there's a half-off special in an attempt to get two characters who would normally hate each other to fall in +love+ lust.

As for portraying Riddle as brilliant, I'd argue that's a problem shared by any fics that focus on an intelligent character: The intelligence, creativity and knowledge base of the character are limited by the intelligence, creativity and knowledge base of the author. Consequently, fics that truly shine are rare.

***** Holding the Idiot Ball is part of Voldemort's characterization, based on how he acts in canon. But in canon, he has enough magical feats and inventions to suggest he's not a drooling dunderhead. Shipfics rarely have enough magic to make up for the Idiot Balls, so the characters feel even stupider than normal to me.

The two Riddle fics you rec'd are labeled as shipfics. How bad are their Idiot Balls? I haven't read them, but I don't want to start a fic if it turns out to be yet another example of characters with Informed Intelligence. If there's anything worse than intentional bashing, it's accidental bashing --- where what should be clever and talented characters have as much presence as a flobberworm.

I do like fics that actually run with that. One recently has Snape visiting Bellatrix in jail and telling her "I fought for the /Dark/. Even you must admit that by the end he had become a liability."

There is, of course, a lovely parallel with Hitler there, who was such an Idiot-Ball-hog that his enemies refused to aid any assassination plan because all possible replacements were more competent.

******** You'll want the various briefing papers around Operation Foxley, which was the planning workup for a possible assassination of Hitler, assessing various methods: it's the most comprehensive set of currently-declassified documents on the matter.

As well as weighing up the various methods - the use of a sniper emerges as a clear favourite - there was a considerable weight of argument that dropping the whole idea was actually the best option. That any possible replacement would have been a better strategist was the primary point of the arguments against taking it beyond the planning stage, the secondary argument being that by that date the war was won and giving Hitler the post-mortem influence of a martyr was going to be counterproductive to plans for the post-war world. In the events which transpired, the noes had it.

Both of those fics focus on friendship rather than romance. In fact, even though they are tagged as HG/TMR neither one of them has reached that part of the plot yet, so you could enjoy them as if they were gen. In my opinion they do a great job exploring how both Hermione and Tom grow into stronger individuals by intellectually challenging each other over the years.

So far the authors have written each character with consistent motives and personality that develop in believable ways; thus, no idiot balls.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
