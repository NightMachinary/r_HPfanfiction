Please tell me your favourite Harry!Ravenclaw stories. please don't bother with Methods of rationality.


** linkffn(2740505) is really good, but unfortunately abandoned. It has lots of interesting ideas and changes a lot of things from canon.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** Please, keep them coming. I've had such a hard time finding good and long Harry in Ravenclaw stories. I would also find it acceptable if Harry is in other houses if he is very intelligent, but I don't mean like a scheming bastard. I just want to read about Harry who is genuinely and deeply loving magic and knowledge.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
