*** At this point I'm seriously considering just going ahead and renaming it, 'Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches --- THE Guilty Pleasure Fanfic.' It does seem to be the only thing that everyone agrees on.

(Mostly a joke... mostly)

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(deprived) fits in there quite nicely. People here recommend it more times than it quality would demand. Hilarious op Harry, horrible WBWL, ridiculous op Harry, 2 animagus forms, extremly op Harry, pet dragon, a fucking op Harry, bashing left and right. Unfinished, thought I think that actually helps with guilty pleasure fics.

And yet I have read it more times than many other, way better, stories.

*** I think it helps that the blatent wish fulfillment in it is much better written than other fics along the same lines, and Harry's actions aren't too out there. Also because Dumbledore isn't the lord of all evil, and is actually a cool dude.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** Basically nothing needed to enjoy it, since you see the SW universe from Harry's perspective, and so anything essential you learn with him.

This reply is so late because my exams have only just finished, and if this is any indication of how much I like this story, this is the one I'm currently rereading, and its still good!
