I'm looking for some SI fics were the author takes things seriously, and the MC is not a Mary Sue, Such as linkffn(11452174) or linkffn(10972919)


** Well, it's a bit crackish but my favourite HP self-insert is undoubtedly [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The Perks of Survival (HP SI)]].

** linkffn(Magical Me by Publicola) this is one of my favorite fics, real hilarious and it talks about the mechanics of magic in a rather interesting way and works with badass characters like Amelia Bones who you don't really see all that often

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

**** This was pretty decent. I've never bought the 'Greater Good Dumbledore/Master manipulator" theory but the author has at least put some work into developing the idea. The main problem with it is that its abandoned though. It's all buildup and Lockhart never even gets to Hogwarts.

** linkffn(8586147). It started out pretty good, but then (IMO) it fell off at the [[/spoiler][love triangle storyline with William, Hermione, and Harry]]. But it has decent writing and it (for the most part) fits your request. And I can definitely see how others would like it, so give it a shot.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

**** Tried to read this one once. It starts out okay but the main character really starts to come off as inappropriate towards Hermione. It was weird because he actually had some chemistry in the beginning with Hermione then the author took it too far and it came off skeezy. Then there's some random Ron bashing in the middle to get Hermione/Harry together.

Also, special wandless magic user warning.

  This is an extremely girly self-insert, very likely a Mary-Sue type of story, where a lot of the characters aren't at all straight. I thought I'd let you know straight up so you can just pass it by it if that's likely to upset and/or offend you. Otherwise - welcome to the Malfoy family.

  Reborn into the world of Harry Potter, Poppy Evans has only one goal; make sure she's not the only magical Evans alive by 1982. And maybe save that smug Potter while she's at it. Regulus Black didn't fit into the equation; he wasn't suppose to be so distracting. A Mature SI fic

*** Depends on the genre. If you read Naruto fanfiction (or even if you just have a loose grasp of Naruto and are curious), linkffn(Dreaming of Sunshine) and linkffn(Deja Vu no Jutsu) are stellar reads and SI.

**** It's worth noting, though, that the vast majority of Naruto-style SI's are really isekai stories; the tradition of labeling them SI stories is a quirk of the fandom due to the enormous influence of Dreaming of Sunshine and the countless works it inspired. For instance, the author of Deja Vu no Jutsu has other "SI" stories on her account with main characters that have entirely different histories and personalities.

Granted, the same is probably true of a good chunk of the stories listed on this page, which were almost all written after DoS and probably inspired by its fandom.
