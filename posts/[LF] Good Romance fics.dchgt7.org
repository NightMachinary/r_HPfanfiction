Hello, im gonna start with a rant: I'm so tired of reading a fic and suddenly there is some misunderstanding between małe and female leads and suddenly they break up, and for next 20 chapters they each make more mistakes and causing each other pain, or some other shenanigans like the female lead is being put into a marriage contract by her parents and suddenly małe lead is like 'how dare you not tell me about that, you traitorous bitch' and then they split, or someone tells the małe lead that they saw female lead with someone else and they immediately go into rage Mode and break up. Ugh.

Okay, im finished up with the rant, so:

Please recommended me some good fic with a strong relationship where partner depend on each other and deal with stuff together, where they communicate and dont let misunderstandings or assumptions fester.

No hinny or h/Hr or slash please.

Help much appreciated, thanks!


** I think my story would be right up your alley. It was partially inspired after experiencing the same frustrations.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards
