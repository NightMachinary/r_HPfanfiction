I was thinking that fanfiction has some easy changes that it could implement to make it a better site, mostly around filtering for searches. I was wondering if people on here have ever gotten together to create some sort of list that we could send in an email to the site administrators and see if we get a response? It might take several tries but I think it could be useful.

Some ideas I have on how to make the site better:

- Filter for Rated: Incuding a T+ rating. I don't NEED my stories to be M, but I don't want to exclude them either when I search for T-rated stories. If there was a T+ rating, it would probably best encompass the maturity level of the stories I am looking for without being filled with 90% smut like you get searching the M rated stories.

- An anti-filter? If there was a way to exclude certain pairings, I'd enjoy that much more than being able to filter FOR a pairing. Just getting sick of search results being flooded with Draco-Hermione, Draco-Harry, it would be nice to exclude those 2 and see what hidden gems are out there.

- Maybe a new filter that allows authors to let people know how often updates can be expected. Maybe like an "update frequency" option. Authors can choose "daily", "several a week", "weekly" "bi-monthly", "monthly", "every few months", maybe an "on hiatus" for WIPs that they may have temporarily abandoned but plan on coming back to.

Anybody else have some good ideas?


** From an author perspective, getting rid of the ridiculous doc manager function would be a huge improvement. It makes correcting mistakes too much of an ordeal and just seems unnecessarily convoluted. Other sites don't use it, is it really needed?

** I'd like a filter that would involve record a running average of the lengths of time between updates, and allow you to filter for fics whose average is less than a given time, or exclude those which have a given deviation from their running average (so if I gave a deviation of 7 days, then a fic that was updated weekly for a year, then not for the past month, would be excluded, but a fic updated monthly for the last year would be included, thereby excluding abandoned fics without excluding long-time-between-updates fics.

** Features other people have already pointed out that would be great:

- Some sort of rating system, out of five stars or whatever
- Entirely scrap the doc manager bullshit, exchange with something easier to make edits with (AO3's is better, as an example)
- More precise character/pairing filters wouldn't be unwelcome
- Some way to publicly respond to reviews would be great (AO3 wins here too)

Damn, that last one, wanted it so badly once recently. Someone left a review saying they had high hopes about the fic (The Long Game), but they are abandoning it now, because they can see where the plot is going, and it's bullshit. And /every single one/ of their assumptions about where the story was going were wrong. Every one, he got not a single thing right. And not only was it a guest review, so I couldn't tell them they were wrong directly, but now it's sitting on my fic and I can't leave a note on it for anyone who sees it like, Yeah, this guy is completely wrong on every single count, silly person. Ugh.

My personal gripe with FFN is their overzealous url filtering. It is a bit silly that they have one at all, but sometimes it deletes things that aren't even intended as urls. Since I'm an enormous nerd, in some of my notes I'll include how some word or name or whatever I made up is pronounced, including IPA for any other nerds in the audience. More times than I can count, FFN has decided the IPA is a url, and fucks the whole thing up. It's very annoying.

** Filtering crossovers. I love crossovers, but it's either, for example, Harry Potter Crossovers with all fandoms, or Harry Potter Crossovers with a specific fandom. Being able to filter for HP crossovers and select multiple fandoms to browse from would be nice.

Also with the length filter, more options would be great. Right now, it's just <1k, <5k, >1k, >5k... I'd love a <10k or <20k filter. Sometimes I just want a bite-sized fic that isn't too short.

That's pretty much it for me, personally. Although, seconding FloreatCastellum's idea, because seriously, Doc Manager is just such a pain.

The formatting of the resulting page is much closer to AO3's page style, as well, and I've always found AO3 to be much more readable than FFN.

Probably right about the update frequency, but I think over time its popularity would increase and could be very useful for those of us who like to follow along to WIPs. -specifically identifying the temporary hiatus ones could be useful because rather than assuming something is abandoned, I may be more willing to take a chance if the author makes a not that it is on temporary hiatus for that fic.

** I'd like more length filters. Or at least the ability to sort fics by length on the archive page.

I don't think reviews are a great indicator of how good a story actually is. I understand why they are there, but to a reader, the review count simply shows popularity. I wouldn't mind a (five) star system in which logged in users can rate a story (5 being best, 1 being pretty sloppy). Each user has one rating for a fic, and they can change it as the fic improves or worsens. With this, the number of stars is displayed in the fic info along with how many people rated it. Since a rating can be changed, I feel like this would be an accurate indicator of how "good" a story is.

I think some of the entries in filters should be moderated. It's weird when you see OC names mixed along with canon HP character names in the character filter.

I like AO3's comment system so you can see what the author responded to a particular user. So if multiple people have a similar question, they can all interact with each other.

I like ao3's ability to tag multiple things, but people overdo it (e.g. I want to read femslash, so I filter for it and 80% of the results are m/m or f/m with a femslash pairing appearing in a dream of a dream of the pet of one of the distant relatives of the main characters. ffs, don't tag parings if they have almost no screen time! */rant*).

So because I doubt people are going to start tagging properly anytime soon, the ability to tag for primary pairings and categories, limited to one pairing and one category? Or maybe the ability for readers to fix fucked up tags? So if you've tagged something m/m but it's het it will be fixed?
