And unfortunately, I'm picky. I can't get to enjoy anything poorly written, hard as I might try.

I'm looking for a story similar to Vahan in that Harry grew up away from Dumbledore's hands, is mature and competent, and very much has his own “thing” going on. Bonus points if his “thing” is illegal or he's otherwise morally ambiguous/grey/against Dumbledore/independent/etc.

Alternatively, if anyone could tell me how to search for such a thing?

Thank you!


** You might like linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai). It's unfortunately unfinished, but what is finished is definitely worth the read.

*** Awww it looks abandoned. :( I have a hard time with those. I get super invested and then bam - ripped away without a resolution. It's like...reading blue balls. XD

  AU: At 5, an abused Harry is taken in by a powerful family. Taking the name Gabriel, he grows up into someone very different. How will Hogwarts and Voldemort react? Soldier!Harry, Neutral!Harry, implied child abuse.

** I haven't read that one as it seems to cover things I'm not interested in reading, but I would suggest going to [[https://archiveofourown.org][archiveofourown.org]] instead of ffn if you haven't already. AO3 uses a different tagging system, so you should have a better chance of finding stories fall within the type you are looking for. If you are set on using FFN, you might try googling to look for some stories. Also, there is this reddit thread that may be helpful:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/8khoko/how_do_you_search_for_fanfic/]]

As to being picky, it will probably still come down to you going through a bunch of stories to find what you like unless other users happen to have specific recommendations for you.

*** With AO3 the writers seem awfully tag-heavy. The tags, in my experience, often only barely fit. I do like the format better than ffn though!

**** Yeah I usually use the filters to narrow down to a smaller category and then promptly ignore the rest of the tags unless the summary doesn't give me enough detail to decide if I want to read the story. AO3 has finally finished updating its filtering system so you can include and exclude based on your search criteria. I haven't explored it too much yet as I've been more focused on exploring the communities function on FFN.

***** That's good news. I haven't checked it out in a long time and didn't even know they were doing an update. Thanks!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/1/893]] This is a Yakuza Harry, really enjoyable story, some bits need a bit more editing with the writing though so you may or may not find it enjoyable

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/1/Jaded-Eyes-of-a-Prodigy]] And this one is a bit dark and a bit messed up but I found it a very enjoyable read
