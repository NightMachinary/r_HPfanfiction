Pretty much the title. I would prefer it complete but as long as it's written well, I won't mind. I've only really loved and read one fic and that was linkffn(Clash by shezwriter). I just love the style and vibe from that fic, how it's such a dark interpretation of the series and develops the characters so well. If you haven't, I highly suggest you check it out. Thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is the only one worth talking about.

Complete, well-written, blends believable OC and proper canon/canon-compliant personalities of the rest, and serves as a gateway drug to AQ, it's the full package.

**** ...which this is. This features Teddy Lupin in his first year of school, and is thus 11 years after HP, and 8 years before the epilogue.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
