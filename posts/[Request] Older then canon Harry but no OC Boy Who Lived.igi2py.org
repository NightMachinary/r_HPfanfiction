Looking for fanfics that have Harry older then canon, for example a Harry who's in his seventh year when the Philosopher Stone happens. Don't want any oc Boy Who Lived so either Neville or the prophesy doesn't happen. Prefer if Harry was naturally born earlier then canon but time travel and other means of a Harry are also ok. Thank you

Harry is in his 5th year when Voldemort tries to steal the Stone.
