I would like to see a prank war or a challenge/contest between the two members of Maunders (Sirius and Remus) vs the Wesley twins (Fred and George)

-Bonus-

Lily and James still alive and added to Maunders team and Harry on twins side along with 4th member. Takes place at hogwart school and all students/professors on ground is fair game.

OR the fic could be about Maunders be searching for juniors to take up its name and decide to have a Prank contest during a school year. Just like how Triwizard was.

  COMPLETE. [Third and final story from the 'Where in the World is Harry Potter' trilogy] No one is safe when Harry happens. Not the living relatives, not the dead ones. No one.
