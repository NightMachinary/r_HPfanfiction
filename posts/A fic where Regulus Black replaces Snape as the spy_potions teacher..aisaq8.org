I would really love to find a fic like this or really anything with a good Regulus.


** I have nothing with Regulus in a teaching role, but the Regulus in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina]]) is pretty cool in my opinion.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Oh, I've been reading some Regulus stories recently! Would need to look on my ao3 account for more recommendations but lately I've been reading Face death in the hope.

It's about Harry traveling back into time and coming across Regulus in the cave.

  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.

  What if Regulus Black, and not Severus Snape, ended up being the turncoat Potions Master of Hogwarts? A not!fic written in bullet points, ignoring the Deathly Hallows entirely because they annoy me. Beta by my immensely patient Best Beloved, Turn_of_the_Sonic_Screw, and by the delightful starbirdrampant.
