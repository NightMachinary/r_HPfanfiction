For me

- slash with characters that have no indication or bisexuality or homosexuality or hate each other

- draco with leather pants

- harry gets an inheritiance, special items, powers that lead to him becoming overpowered (ex look a mr chaos pokemon harry potter crossover series,)

- mpreg

- bashing

- harem:
