My fiance and I are addicted to Bob and Alyx and have noticed that they haven't updated in a while. It had been mentioned on their author page that he was unwell but getting better, then we haven't heard anything since. We're hoping he's okay but I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone was aware of anything.


** Thank you all for letting me know. This is really heartbreaking. I hope Alyx is doing well. After reading so many fics by people, especially folks who have such wonderful intros, you feel close to them even if you've never met.

RIP Bob. Much love to you Alyx.

** Bob passed away from cancer, iirc. His wife is still alive but I don't believe she's continuing anything.

I was quite saddened, Bob and Alyx created fics that maintained their quality despite the length and even unintentionally pioneered some tropes in the fanfic community.

** It really makes you think how quickly life can end. All the things you want to write or do or say... you might never get a chance unless you do them today.

** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGjdl3EOL4J3dEUmqP-lZFFe3w4E-jfxGhMtTqfuJ9I/edit][This]] might be pertinent , it is not by Bobmin, though it expands on the storyline. Think if it as a fanfic fanfic.
