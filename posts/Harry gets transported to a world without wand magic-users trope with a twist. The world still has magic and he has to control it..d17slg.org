So, it could be the normal Harry gets transported to a new world, maybe avengers for example. But in this new world there were never wand users that access the world's natural magic. Let's keep with marvel and have people who use magic like Stephen Strange but he uses dimensional magic.

My thought is that wand users, who don't have a magical core, instead have an ability to channel to the world's natural energies through a wand and shape it to their will. And over time, this energy is being used across the world and siphoned off as it is being produced by the planet- a balance. But in this new world, the magic has built and built over time until strange things start to occur, mutants, mutates, people surviving things that should have killed them and integrating it (spiderman, hulk, captain America, iron man, etc) and attracting all sorts of attention to the planet.

Into all this, Harry appears. A world so overflowing with magic that it's affecting the planet's inhabitants. And Harry casts a spell... simple. Right? Harry's body grabs a big chunk of the magic around him like normal to cast a spell. BOOM! More magic than he's ever felt rushes through him and the simple lumos bursts into a massive flare of light that alerts everyone around and knocks him unconcious because his brain isn't used to trying to shape so much magic and practically short-circuits, fuses blown from overload.


** linkffn(13095858) has an adult Harry wake up in the forests of Wakanda de-aged back to 4. Since he doesn't have the Elder Wand, he spends a long time trying to harness the natural magic around him, and he finds himself really powerful. The problem is, power was exchanged for control.

  Harry wakes up in a strange jungle seemingly de-aged and without his wand. He has to figure out how to live in this whole new environment that he has seemingly warped to. And what the hell is a Wakanda? First few chapters will be about entry into the world and not much else. Obviously takes place in the Avengers universe. Will primarily use the MCU as a reference.
