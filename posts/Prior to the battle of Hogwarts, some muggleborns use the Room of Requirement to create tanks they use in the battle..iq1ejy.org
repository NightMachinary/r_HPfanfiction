Since electronics apparently don't work around Hogwarts, perhaps they have the room create ones that run on magic? Simple controls would help too.


** Why's the lack of electricity an issue? Ask the room for a tank with a crank-start Diesel engine and you're good. No electric motor to turn the turret, but tanks have turret hand-cranks as a backup. And early ones just had hand cranks

Of course it'd still get stopped in it's tracks by an Immobulus. Then blown to bits. But at least a lack of electricity isn't the problem.

** Inspired by [[/u/Ich_bin_du88]]

"P..professor McGonagall!", one of the Weasley twins screamed amidst the steadily increasing rumbles, "We really need to evacuate the Great Hall, now!". Now, Minerva is not the kind of witch easily cowed by noises. She just sends dozens of enormous statues marching through. But after years of accepting that Sagara's "proportional response" easily involve a destroyed classroom for harmless pranks against Chidori, Minerva unleashed her second castle-powered spell today, depositing everyone still running around the great hall to the nearest room fast enough to escape an acromantula crashing through the hall, the original goal of the spell.

And not a second too late, because just when she's starting to ask someone just what's going on, an explosion, no, it's the wall being broken apart by sheer momentum, of, is that muggle's tank? She's not clueless about muggle's operation, but it looks more like, right, "Mr Sagara, could you kindly avoid damaging the castle more than necessary?", she asked in a normal voice, knowing whatever contraption in that Arm Slave should be able to focus to her voice. The "head" of the oversized vehicle (since it's still far larger than the usual Arm Slaves she saw on London) nodded, and efficiently maneuver through with only crushing the Slytherin table. Well, that's definitely accidental.

George disappeared, returning with one of those teddy bears that wouldn't look out of place on both Muggle and Wizarding theme park, except it's more armed than even Moody after Sagara gives him a tour of Muggle's warfare techniques. Behind him, dozens of similarly armored bears with colored ribbons on their arms are coordinating on their battle plan. At least that what Minerva guess, since all she hears is those cryptic combinations of "Fumo", "Fumomo" and "Fumofu". Ah, no risk of Death Eater spies listening in when even she can't understand a word then.

The Death Eaters aren't fools. They know there's a risk of the Muggleborns bringing their weapons to the battle. But all the Slytherin ever see and reports to their parents are just Sagara's idea for securing Chidori from the danger of color switching spell or the occasional Weasleys experiment went wild. They never have any idea that the white Arm Slave standing in front of them isn't just bigger or more advanced than regular Arm Slaves. This is the very Arm Slave that wiped out an entire army just last week, dominating the muggle television in-between news about their raid on Muggles.

And the Bonta-kuns... Years after the battle, the easiest way to find out if you're in the company of ex-Death Eaters is to simply mutter "Fumomo", in the most innocent, childish way possible. Because while Arbalest calmly walks toward Voldemort's position and continuously firing magically replenished explosives, a demoralizing maneuver, sure, it happened far from their position. The Bonta-kuns, armed with apparently non-lethal weapons despite their loud noise and blinding flashes, are instead tasked with taking down every single Death Eather from a close quarter, protected by magically resistant synthetic fur courtesy of Slughorn quick thinking. Today, those who were captured can still recall the maniacal and indescribable laughter while they're being shot and pounded, all they can grasp is the phrase "Fumo! Fumo!"

** Wouldn't an strong blasting spell counter them quickly? All it takes to kill a Tank is a fast RPG. Now a fortified Howgarts filled with foxholes and machine gun nests operated by the ghosts and or at distance through Magic....that could make the DE taking of Howgarts a worst task than Omaha Beach Landing.

*** We saw blasting curses from extremely strong people blasting stone walls. And from regular people throwing other people around.

Vs. Reactive and Composite Armor? 300mm to 600mm+ thick? Eh, we never saw that.

I would think it's too big a target.

They would be better served by creating MG42s, or M2 Machineguns, they are better at anti-personnel warfare.

And traps, loads of traps.

********* No it doesn't. The fact that a piece of wood can stop the killing curse but protego can't points towards magic protection only. Plus, wizards have only 2 advantages over a muggle biased army. Imperio and apirition, wich and self respecting army could counter pretty quickly via, canonical easy to notice when looking imperio. It literally looks like the average muggle fantasy mind control. And aparition pop sound wich would get that location pumped full of lead.

** Hey, I have several versions of this.

-

Alright, folks, let's get one every 30 feet, three boxes per gun, go, go, go!"

Minerva was confused by that command, and then she turned and saw several students carrying or levitation what she knew to be muggle guns, really big muggle guns, the size of a broom stick, and the smaller students were carrying metal belts of what she knew were bullets, really big bullets, some the size of her finger.

They started assembling them on the windows, and then the battlements, then some came levitating large sacks of sand and placing them to reinforce the low walls at the door.

"Okay, it's one M2, and one MG42, M2 guys, go for the big targets, MG42 can go for smaller ones."

She saw it was being commanded by one Muggleborn student, a Mr. Nelson, from Ravenclaw, followed by the Weasley twins, who were distributing strange curved green objects and telling students to place them on 'choke points', "And remember," one of them shouted.

"Front towards the enemy." the group responded.

"Mr. Nelson, what's the meaning of this."

"Oh, Professor McGonagall, me and some other students decided to pitch in and help the defend the school, those bast-I mean those guys out there talk so badly about out muggle heritage, and we want them to know it better, to show them how wrong they are."

Minerva looked at him, unknown to many, she had some participation in WW2, countering Nazi Germany's own troops of Wizards, and so she was a bit familiar with what those things could so.

But she was also desperate.

"They will have giants, do you have something...appropriate, for that?"

A smile bloomed on the three teenager's faces.

"I am glad you asked professor, some of our friends that came to help from Durmstrang had similar ideas to yours." he turned to one of the students dressed in red, which was near several wooden boxes with different script, "Oi, Boris, show us the gifts you brought, the ones for the big targets."

Said boy, smiled widely, and brought one of the long boxes up with a levitation spell.

"From Russia, with love." he opened them, and Minerva saw what she would later learn were RPG-7s.

The boys and those around laughed, but Boris wasn't done and pointed at another set of boxes, "We also brought Kalashinokovs, have to represent."

More and more boxes started being brought, some of them on carts, and McGonagall saw the students placing helmets and vests, some were picking up pistols, others rifles, all with care and dexterity that showed training, even if some looked to be beginners.

"How, how did you bring all this here, and how do they know how to use it." she indicated Susan Bones assembling and loading a very fancy looking assault rifle(that she later learned was called L-85)

One of the twins turned to answer, "Well professor, let's just say the Room of Requirement is really, really powerful, that House-elves can be really helpful if you know how to ask, and some of your illustrious students here are very well connected." he place a hand on Mr. Nelson's shoulder.

"And some of our 'handlers' are really bad at counting." the other twin complemented.

"Hey, Bernard, the Yankees came through, they sent something called a..." he looked at his clipboard, "M61 Vulcan, three of them, what do we do?"

Mr. Nelson laughed, and turned to twins, "Well I know what to do with two of them, place them in battlement positions 16 and 26, our mechanic guys know how to assemble them and to use them, " he stopped to think for a moment, "ask Wilson, John, and Miranda, from Gryffindor."

"Miss Calhoun?" Minerva asked shocked.

Mr. Nelson just smiled, "One of our best shots with high-rate of fire weapons, and these ones came with the fancy mounts."

As she nodded, a bit perplexed, Mr. Nelson turned back to the other student.

"As for the third one," he placed one hand in each of twins shoulders, "What do you two think of some improvements to that flying car you guys got back from the forest?"

The twins smiled was absolutely feral.

"Well then, boys," McGonagall began, standing up straight, and speaking in her best stern voice, "I will see to our magical defenses, we need to be ready in less than half an hour, continue as you were." she had to hold a smile as a lot of the people around her saluted.

Those Death Eaters were in for a big surprise.

-

Bonus:

"Er, Professor McGonagall, I think we should send someone and tell the centaurs to not appear, and we already told Hagrid to hide Grwpy."

McGonagall turned to Neville in surprise.

"Mr. Longbottom, we need all the help we can get."

"I know that, but Luna went to the Room of Requirement, and asked for help, I don't know what she asked but some....er, people appeared. And it's best the others, er...leave for a while."

Minerva turned to look at the smiling Luna, whose smile got bigger.

"I asked for the wrackspurt hunters, the Protectors of Mankind, defenders of humanity and they came." she laughed.

"They are coming!"

Minerva turned and saw the Death Eaters advancing, some on brooms, and the giants were in front of them.

And then she heard the gunshots, terrible, loud gunshots, and the giants on the front started falling, giant holes on their bodies.

And next, she heard a terrible electronic voice, full of authority.

"THERE COME THE BEASTS AND THE HERETICS BROTHERS! THEY SEEK TO ENSLAVE HUMANITY! STOP THEM! FOR HUMANITY!"

And dozens of electronic voices answered in thunder.

"FOR THE EMPEROR! THE EMPEROR PROTECTS!"

And then dozens of giants clad in golden and blue armor advanced while the students hid, some were carrying what looked to be oversized muggle guns, but others had giant swords and axes, some had had what looked to be a chainsaw sword, and others were carrying weapons so big they could be in a vehicle. They all had golden omegas in their armors, that were very very ornamented.

And then others /flew/ from he battlements, with large jetpacks, carrying giant electrified hammers that made the ground shake as they landed in the middle of the Death Eather army, their users swinging their weapons with deceptive ease and brutal efficiency.

"Merlin."

She saw one advance on Voldemort himself, he was using a large shield(almost as tall as himself) to deflect and block all the spells, and then, after throwing the large axe he was carrying, pulled a pistol that glowed blue and /destroyed/ Voldemort in two shots, shattering his shield with just one.

A dark cloud came out of the crater, but then another armored soldier appeared, but this one was carrying a staff, and had a large banner on his armor, with what looked to be Latin words in it.

He pulled a transparent sphere from his belt and pointed it at the cloud while raising his staff, bolts of lightning came out of it and pulled the smoke into the sphere, trapping it inside.

"Yay, we won, I think Harry will be happy, he will love Captain Titus, he too likes to do things alone."
