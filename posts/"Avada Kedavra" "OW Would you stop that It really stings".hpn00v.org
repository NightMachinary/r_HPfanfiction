** Never read it in a fanfic, but I kinda like the idea of Harry being immune to the Avada (don't care if there's no "logical" explanation, I just like the idea). Mostly because it cracks me up imagining people's reaction around him like "what's up with this? Why don't you die?" ðŸ¤¨

** When I read the title it made me think of Mad-eye's comment when teaching about the killing curse. Something along the line of the whole class could cast the spell and not even give him a nose bleed. I could see this becoming the Hogwarts version of the tide pod challenge. A bunch of stupid kids running around casting AKs at each other to see what happens.

**** More than one person honestly. You need hate to use the killing curse, but it doesn't need to be justified. Draco Malfoy in a fit of childish vitriol could be just as dangerous as Bellatrix Lestrange.

Barty Crouch Jr. showing off the Unforgivables may honestly have prevented some students using them in a fit of anger.

Harry is ridiculously overpowered, but in quite a dark world.

*** Now I need a story where the Weasleys single handedly defeat Voldemort and his death eaters. Molly feeds the Carrows love potions and locks them in a room, Ginny fangirls Snape to death, the twins prank Bellatrix Lestrange until she kills herself in frustration, Lucius Malfoy is bored to death by Arthur talking nonsense about Muggle technology, Percy is the bureaucrat from hell and of course Voldemort faces the worst of them all, Ron Weasley, who somehow defeats the dark lord by stomping his feat and acting put out that /he/ wasn't chosen as Voldemort's nemesis.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
