I read this fic probably around 3-4 years ago. Harry and Draco went back to the founders time unwillingly, and were found by Rowena and Helga. They assumed that Harry was Salazar and Draco was Godric. The two boys stayed in a hut in the beginning? I don't remember most of this fic, apologies. I'm also fairly sure it was on FFN but I can't say for sure. Pretty sure Harry and Draco end up helping build Hogwarts but I may have made that up. I also remember that the boys assumed something had happened to Godric and Salazar because the two never actually showed up.

I've only started looking for this fic a week ago, and I still haven't found it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

  AU after CS17. Harry pulls a very different sword out of the Sorting Hat, and that changes everything. The Sword of Slytherin has powers that go far beyond just killing legendary monsters, and soon Harry finds himself caught up in an improbable adventure and a bizarre case of mistaken identity. It just goes to show that strange things can happen when time meddles with wizards...
