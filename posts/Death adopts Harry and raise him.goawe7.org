I'm searching for a fic "As good as Death" like.

Not a crack fic, just... Death took Harry under it's (his?her? Well... I just can't see Death much as a female. Is more a It or a He, not a She for me.) wing.

Maybe a Necromancer!Harry at some point? (Is not necessary)

SOMETHING COMPLETE! PLEASE! The suspense has got me sick too many times! ðŸ¥º


** There is one very good one, which convinced me to see Death as female. It doesn't precisely fit your prompt, but it is very similar to this. One of the few tastefully done fics of this type too.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.
