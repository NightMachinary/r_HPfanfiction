Any fics like that? Instead of indy!harry story who goes to the queen to whine about his situation, the queen or her children is a muggleborn.


** I remember a one shot where McGonagall meets the Queen because she wanted to see Hogwarts before sending her grandkid/niece or something. McG remembers being a little girl seeing the Princess and her mother saying to her that while she will be a Queen one day, she'll never have magic.

*** Was it linkffn(Majesty by Kelly Chambliss)? Another Queen-gets-involved and probably the best of them is linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides), but it has no niece anywhere.

** The queen is a criminal; she personally covered up Jimmy Saville's abuse of children and prevented him from being prosecuted. Please don't put her in any sort of positive light.

**** It is the fucking place. It's like asking for a "Hitler's grandson goes to Hogwarts fic" except where Hitler being the evil person he is isn't even acknowledged in the fic. She defended children being abused. She's evil.

Your desire to look at her through rose tinted glasses insults every single one of her victims.
