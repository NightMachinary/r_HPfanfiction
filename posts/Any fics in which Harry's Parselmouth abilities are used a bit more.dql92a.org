It drives me crazy that Harry has an incredibly unique gift that is barely used through the series. Can you recomend a fic in which he speaks to snakes a bit more often? I'd preferred to avoid the overpowered!Harry or Dark Harry - just our usual Harry, but using his gift a bit more.


** Linkffn(If looks could kill)

Arthur Weasley almost died from Nagini's attack. What do we learn from this? Snake assassins are really useful, but Voldemort chose a rather ineffective species. Harry has experience dealing with a much more deadly and effective snake.

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

******** Aight! I'm ready.

So I read the first 105 chapters of the 133 you have posted. At that point I couldn't go on and ended up just skimming 128-133.

I give what I read a solid 7/10. Give or take half a point.

When I give a review I give praise after each critique or question. This way the author knows what they're doing write and what they should work on. I also do this so don't hurt people's feelings. I like to give constructive criticism not comments meant to hurt you or tell you your writing is perfect. There's always room for improvement.

Praise: I really like your character building. I thought the amount of OC's would be annoying because of a previous comment but I like them. I can tell work went into crafting their personalities, quirks, backstories and more.

Questions: Why did Harry lose his sight? I understand it's because Harry waited 10-20 minutes but I was recommending your story earlier and didn't know how to explain it. It was here on Reddit they'd have to give the premise a hard pass because of the ‘nonsense' regardless of the quality. It made me wonder and I ended up rereading a few chapters to get a sense of what you were trying to tell the readers. Honey, I think you should go over that. You mentioned it but I feel you could gone into that topic more so the reader really understands what's going on. Like why did he survive 10-20 minutes with the venom in his eyes? Harry has access to some handy tools and a huge library. I suggest you let him explore that so he really understands his situation. Especially after Oliver's letter. Now would be a great time for that.

Praise: Back to characterization. Your cannon characters are really well done. They seem in character. Molly's fussing, Ron's foot in the mouth disease, the twins and their jokes, Ginny's sadness. It all makes sense. That's impressive because most fanfiction writers struggle with displaying the faults and strengths in a character. You tend to end up with Mary Sues/Gary Stus/ so incompetent they always lose/ so mediocre the reader wants to snooze. However the characters are well done. You even acknowledged Albus's blatant favouritism. That's rare to see in fics. They usually just bash him these days.

Critique: I mean this in the nicest way possible. What is the plot? Is it Harry's journey to finding himself? Is it how Harry goes through Hogwarts without sight? Is it about the relationship between little friend and Harry? It's not clear. I suggest you sit down with a good of cup tea and some shortbread biscuits and figure it out. The plot is often the hardest thing to display in a long work of writing. Fanfic, Book, movie, anything that's long. You often get lost in describing every detail you forget what you're for. The easiest way to figure out a plot is to find out the message behind the story. Is it disability awareness? Is it child abuse awareness? How does your story teach the reader. Not all stories need a deeper meaning but Baslisk Eyes needs one. You can't have a story over 50,000 without a lesson of some sort because the story become pointless. From that point on the reader will start to struggle to get through. I only lasted long because I regularly read writing to critique it. And I give most of them a 4/10. Perhaps the plot is in the name? Baslisk Eyes can mean a lot of different things.

Praise: I love the attention payed to the life of a blind person. Like people just grabbing Harry's hand in an attempt to help him. Touching randomly and more annoying shit like that. They mean well but they're not helping. I especially like what you did with Ginny and the blindfold. Being blind is not the end of the world. My great grandmother always said “if a man doesn't have it, he doesn't need it.” She said this after she lost the ability to walk. That always inspired me. Maybe because it's the truth or maybe it's because I can't help but look up to a woman who jumped of the top of the stairs to catch a baby. That's why she couldn't walk. She couldn't walk but she didn't have to. I have a cousin who was born without arms but she adopted a child recently and she takes care of the baby boy with her feet. She uses them like they're hands.

Critique: it's been 400,000 plus words. It's no longer a slow build; it's a drag. The story doesn't feel like it's moving. I suggest a rewrite. Finish this draft but as you're going through rewrite the chapters. Oh, you can't think of what the next chapters should be? Rewrite the first few then. A story needs a beginning, a build to the climax, a climax, a build down, and an end. After all the reading I've done I can't identify a climax. It's like swimming through rubber cement. You can't write a quality story like that. Your readers will drown and not in a good way. If you're going to write something this long you need to know where you're going.

Praise: I admire your dedication. It takes a lot to write 400,000 words of the same work. Most would have given up but you haven't. 👏🏾 That's impressive.

In conclusion, Baslisk Eyes has so far exceeded my expectations. I'm going to keep an eye on it and see where it goes. It has potential. I hope everything makes sense and feel free to ask questions. 🤗

Well Wishes, DeDe

********* [[https://www.reddit.com/user/DeDe_at_it_again/][DeDe_at_it_again]] Thank you so much for your lengthy and detailed review! You said you would and here it is! I admire that you've dedicated so much time to reading my story (as well as others) and writing meaningful and reflective reviews. What a gift!

Thank you so much for the praise for the original characters as well as the characterizations of cannon characters. It means a lot that you found them intriguing and balanced.

I could be dismayed at the critiques, but I think you are absolutely right and have identified the biggest issues with my story. It does lack a plot and is ridiculously long. I keep trying to figure it out. I mean, it is a story of recovery and figuring out how to do things in new and different ways, adjusting to change, and all of that... and I'm still trying to figure out what it is about. 400,000 words later... I'm learning a lot as I'm going and I feel as though my writing has improved... I really value everyone who has commented and helped me become a better writer in the process.

I think I have a number of tangent plots as well. Each of the original characters has their own backstories that are being revealed slowly... (Mei, Aminah, Gemma, Tony) in addition to learning about canon characters more... such as how did Ginny handle being possessed by Tom Riddle, why was Remus Lupin absent from so much of Harry's life, and how is Neville getting along? And there is the subplot of Harry and the snake... I am working on a one-shot about their friendship.

Your point about how Harry lost his sight is a good one and I'll go back and work on that to see if there is anything I can do to make it more clear. I explained this in another post (the thread you mentioned) that in my story the venom enters Harry's system in two ways - the first one is through the fang in his arm - which is directly into his vascular system. Fawkes cries on his arm and heals that cut and the systemic poisoning. Though before the healing tears, his eyesight is failing. In my story, Harry also gets blood and venom in his eyes and it takes him a while to ask Fawkes to cry tears directly into his eyes - in that time, his optic nerve is damaged beyond repair. I'll work on making that more clear. I will also work on a re-write. I'm clearly invested in the story.

Your grandmother sounds like a wise and brave person. Wow. What a terrifying and defining moment. And kudos to your cousin as well... it sounds like she's following her heart... and I imagine she's had to weather comments from people who doubt her ability to nurture a child.

Mami Wata! I was researching mermaid fairytales and came across her! It was a perfect fit for our little side trip to the Western Coast of Africa.

Thank you again for the time you spent reading my story and writing useful feedback!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

This one is not that well known, but I read it some time ago and I really got into it. It portrays an independent and resourceful Harry, and at the same time keeps him vulnerable. Also -a warning, in case you don't like this- he and Draco become buddies.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

** Is it weird that my first thought went to how his Parselmouth abilities make him the king of cunnilingus in soooooo many stories? I feel like it's becoming a trope.

But I guess that is not what you had in mind with this request...
