So you know how people do march madness with the shooty hoops and the basket touch downs and the brackets? Can we do something like that? Like have our own little tournament arc with teams and stuff. Say a bunch of people get together form teams and have a one shot fic off. Then each week we vote best fic and those teams move on while the losers drop into a loser bracket. We all get a bunch of fics and authors get that warm fuzzy feeling from writing fics! It's a win-win!


** There's a site called [[https://animebrackets.com][animebrackets.com]] that lets you create tournament brackets and vote by logging in with your reddit account (so no fake votes). I know it says anime but it should work for anything really.

*** Nice. I used to help run Starcraft tournaments back in my college days, there should be lots of online tournament stuff to handle the brackets, seeding, etc.

** I would absolutely love that! Count me as keen. For the teams, we could do houses or even Quidditch teams.

** If the mods allow, I would be willing to organize this. As [[/u/EquinoxGm]] said, a two-person team consisting of a writer and a beta would work best.

We could set the word length limit to be something like 5k or 10k words, and I could come up with a handful of prompts for the community to vote on beforehand to decide what prompt the teams are working on.

** The difficulty you'll have is the time it takes to write decent fiction, even short stories. Most people can't write a story a week.

** Fanfiction.net has the Quidditch League and they have "teams" where they set up writing challenges. They have rules and everything and when the cycle is over they're always looking for players.

Here's a blurb of their process from the invitation:

#+begin_quote
  Hello!

  We would like to invite you to join the 7th season of The Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition. The Quidditch League is a successful writing competition that started in May 2013 and has since progressed through 6 seasons of Harry Potter fanfiction writing set out in a Quidditch game format. (Meaning, while you will be writing about anything and everything HP related, you'll be doing at as part of a "Quidditch team", under a specific position, like Seekers or Keepers, etc.). We are soon about to begin our seventh season and would love to see you there!

  The forum was created as a means of bringing people and their love of Harry Potter and writing together, to make new friends, work with like-minded people, step out of your comfort zone, as well as participate in a fun competition where you write and then receive detailed, constructive feedback on your work so you can improve your writing skills. It is relatively laid back, and although we have rules, the main focus is to have fun and make friends!

  Of course, if writing's not your cup of tea, we have other options for you, liking writing for the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/176015255/1/Daily-Prophet-Issue-1][Daily Prophet]], which is our forum's "newspaper" that has a lot of fun articles and competitions you can write for.

  If you are interested and/or are curious, please follow the link and read the rules and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/175730009/1/Rules-Regulations-Updated-for-Season-7][regulations]] to gain an insight into how the competition works. If you are confused regarding anything or have any questions, we have a comprehensive Q&A [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/175742934/1/General-Q-A][thread]]. If you still have questions beyond that, please don't hesitate to ask, as there are plenty of people on the forum who have participated in one or more seasons and know the ins and outs of the competition well. We also have a practice [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/175779792/1/Practice-Round][round]], which you can use to test the water, to see which position or team you'd like to sign up for, or how the competition works in general.

  Tryouts for all players will open on March 17th, i.e. the coming Sunday, at 6PM UTC. A countdown timer has been added at the top of the tryouts page for your [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/175779424/1/Player-Tryouts-OPEN-FOR-CAPTAINS-ONLY-opens-17th-March-for-other-players][convenience]], and we hope to commence the first round of the season on March 31st. Every team has a captain who has completed at least one full season before, meaning every team has at least one experienced player to help out where needed. In the meantime, the general chat [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/175742746/1/The-Cheer-Squad][thread]] is open at all times to come and talk to others.

  It is a relatively long running competition, running for at least 6 months, so if you don't feel like you're able to commit long-term that is perfectly fine! We also have options to be a reserve player as well as a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/218720/176193104/1/Reserve-League][Reserve League]] where you can submit for whatever round or position you want, whenever you want, no pressure! But signing up as a reserve means you'll also get a chance to play as a part of a team, too!
