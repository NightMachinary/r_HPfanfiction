We don't yet know the end, but we can assume there are events that will happen after HPMOR. I know this is open ended, but what are your thoughts on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterword][afterword]] that has yet to exist.

** Afterword? The author will come up with another scheme to try to sell his fanfiction for profit.

*** He hasn't been selling anything. He does use his author's notes to solicit for donations for the two 501(c)(3) non-profits he works with.

So you believe that Yudkowsky will find a way to sell his existing work to line his own pockets between now and finishing the story, and then write a final author's note about him finding a second way to do the same?

**** Not-for-profits which employ him and pay him (and for which he in the past held chapters of his fanfiction hostage).

Newt Gingrich paid himself $220k/month to manage his own 501(c)(3) so you'll pardon me if I believe that working for a not-for-profit is hardly a guarantee of nobility or poverty. (Case in point: the CEO of my not-for-profit employer drives a late-model Porsche GT-3 and pulls down a salary making it look like a dumpy daily driver.)

***** I know what kind of salaries CFAR and MIRI pay. They're pretty terrible for the level of expertise involved -- as in, you could get hired by a starving startup and keep the same salary, or go for a startup with venture funding and double your salary, or work for one of the major tech companies in the area and triple your compensation.

MIRI recently added its second and third FTEs. You might reasonably say that Yudkowsky is leveraging his fan fiction to pay for these hires. Unless he's getting a raise that outpaces cost of living increases, though, he's not profiting personally from HPMOR.

As for holding chapters hostage, I hadn't seen that. I have seen him releasing on a specific schedule and accelerating that if sufficient donations go through. I get annoyed when I see authors refusing to publish chapters unless they get enough reviews -- it seems petty. I don't get annoyed when I see authors publishing weekly under normal circumstances and more frequently when they get more reviews -- the reviews serve as motivation to work on the story more often. This is similar, except his employers are also willing to make writing fan fiction part of his work duties if it proves to be a sufficiently useful means of advertising.

  But hey, keep up the downvote brigade, all you classy, albeit humorless, friends-of-Yudkowsky.

You seem bitter about HPMOR. You could simply ignore it, pull your fedora down over your eyes a bit whenever it's mentioned.

Not bitter so much as that I find MOR, EY, and his one-man Wiki crusade to be the most talked about fanfiction celeb to be irresistible comedic material. I shared a tongue-in-cheek comment to this sub and received the obligatory downvotes from his army of disciples. Not wholly unexpected.

I've watched the MOR saga since the beginning, including episodes of extreme DLP asshattery (e.g., a user Silens Cursor apparently thinking it appropriate to share publicly private communications with the author that were disparaging to the site, leading to a predictable pile-on before wiser heads stepped in and slapped SC down for being a douche; I think the thread can be found in DLP's "Hall of Shame"), as well as several instances of LW's trolling. I once had the poor judgment to have corrected the guy in a PM on something he had gotten wrong in one of his stories and received a rather condescending response, one which told me what I needed to know about the author.

I've even read his occasional comments to the effect of believing himself entitled to cash compensation for his unlicensed derivative fiction, that his story was really more his than JKR's source. Doubtless, such comments are hard to find online anymore (except as dubiously sourced quotes on various forums), as I'm sure his employers have no wish to be fed CAD letters by JKR's army of lawyers, but they happened.

I don't harbor bitterness, though I do find the author and his antics to be incredibly amusing.

******* Eh, I can enjoy the fic without caring about the drama behind the scenes. I'm not going to be scammed out of my money just because I like the guy's writing. It's like saying you shouldn't read or appreciate Lovecraft because the guy was a huge racist.

And DLP hates to death everything that gets "undeservingly" popular, they're not the most reputable source. I too find EY's antics amusing, though.

EDIT: Oh god I'm reading the Hall of Shame thread now, it's fucking hilarious

  What exactly is so wrong about us taking the time to bash LessWrong? What is so bad about retaliating after he talked shit about DLP? Now Silens is accepting blame for starting the bash fest in the MoR thread. What the fuck is up with that? Yudkowsky, the little pretentious shit he is, deserves to be verbally attacked

******* FWIW, I am 100% behind you here. It's a train wreck to be sure, but every failure contains a little lesson and a fair bit of schadenfreude.
