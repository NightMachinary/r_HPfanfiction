I am so incredibly invested in how music meshes with stories - how a song can inspire a story. Would anyone be interested in hearing a song and writing something based off something new?

I normally like to create playlists for each fic I read, but would love to hear how others interpret music and fics too.


** You know what's mad? I was literally trawling through my indie pop playlist trying to find something I could write to just yesterday!

I can't promise I'll have the time to actually write anything but if you have a prompt I love to give it a go?

(I'm currently in a Marauders/Black family funk atm so whatever you give me will probably end up being about them...)
