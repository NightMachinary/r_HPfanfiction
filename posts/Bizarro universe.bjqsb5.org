Looking for any (completed/quickly updating) fics where a character (any character) travels to another universe due to crazy shenanigans, and finds that universe a complete opposite of the "original" one.

Death eather/Blood supremasists Weasleys. Order of the Phoenix Slytherins. Social butterfly Hermione, things like that.

Should be fun, right?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] linkffn(4025300) Hermione is thrown into a universe where Dark Magic is largely used by everyone. Muggleborns are on the top of social hierarchy. Purebloods are fighting to keep their traiditions and practice their light magic. Tom Riddle is heading a resistance against Dumbledore.
