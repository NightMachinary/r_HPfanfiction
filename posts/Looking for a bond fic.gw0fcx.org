:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It starts with draco and most of his cronies which in this fic includes daphne and tracy casting a curse on the train that will bond him to daphne and tracy but it backfires and bonds him with susan bones and I think hermione or ginny because they get to his side first. After getting off the train at king's cross they find out they cant separate and all 3 are sent to the dursleys. I cant remember much more other than the curse was called something like the tri bind curse or something.


** What. What does this even mean?

**** Are they... Physically attached, and literally can't go anywhere else? Is there an emotional bond made with magic? Can you specify what "bond" means?

***** Sorry. Similar to a soul bond I think. They had to stay close. They tried to separate them to go to their own home and they all collapsed in pain which was how they realized what the curse was.
