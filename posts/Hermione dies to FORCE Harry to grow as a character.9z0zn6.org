I don't hate BOOK Hermione (Though I do hate Movie Hermione and despise Omniscient Mary Sue Supergodtier Fanfiction Hermione) except for Book 6. Book 6 Hermione was bordering on bashing (though they of course corrected that in the film because Film Hermione can do no wrong or Emma Watson fanboys would whine - the same reason they took away Ron's good lines and gave them to Hermione, weakening Ron as a character a LOT in the film) She was a bitch, getting pissy about the HBP Book and Harry beating her in potions (Which was useful, and Harry offered to share) she was like a lovesick puppy pining over Ron, actively Confunded McClaggen so Ron could get on the team, ruining her growth from Book 5 where she was basically willing to get Umbridge killed in order to protect Harry.

Then you have Book 7, where it fixes everything, and basically becomes Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hallows, rather than Harry Potter.

Getting rid of Hermione, the ideal time would be at the end of Book 5, killing her instead of Sirius. Have Harry actively manage to get to London and the DOM alone, thinking he avoided being followed, but Hermione and Co come with him, not too far behind, to help their friend, and Hermione either dies to Dolohov's curse, to Bellatrix, even to Voldemort.

Without Hermione as the Super guide, Harry will have to grow, and fight as a Character, and might actively start throwing Lethal Spells. Have a moment of breakdown, followed by someone building him up. If Bellatrix is the one to kill Hermione, have the Crucio Harry tries WORK. Even go as far as to put Bellatrix in the same state as Frank/Alice Longbottom (Poetic Justice)

Actual Consequences for both sides. Out of Voldemort's Followers, over TWO Wars only Rosier, Wilkes, Regulus Black (who went traitor), one other generic Death Eater, Bellatrix and Snape died, out of ALL of the Death Eaters. In the Battle of Hogwarts, as Snape was a spy, Literally only Bellatrix died out of people that were on Voldemort's side (And Neville should have got that kill, ramming the Sword of Gryffindor through her back whilst she was duelling Molly Weasley instead of random Housewife overpowering top tier Death Eater)

I call her Herwhiny.

Technically, the only one who should have made it out of the Ministry battle alive should have been HP, since the Death Eaters were specifically ordered to not kill him. That six teenagers managed to avoid getting killed by a group adult wizards who can kill without blinking, when said group of wizards is actively trying to kill them is just another one of the many nerfs the Death Eaters get throughout the series.

But even just one of the "Ministry Six" dying should have happened, and for this Prompt, i wanted it to be Hermione, so everyone realises "It's a war, stop pissing about with disarming charms and tickling spells and fucking kill your opponents".

It's the fact that the smart Death Eaters didn't manage to kill a single teenager that makes you wonder. Bellatrix could have just collapsed the shelves as Luna ran through, as she knew Harry had the right Prophecy, crushing Luna under the rubble and glass.

****** I think that's more a problem of how JKR unintentionally made the Avada the only spell that could be practically used in real-life duels (I think it was discussed on the HP sub a few months back). The only way that the DoM battle is plausible if we assume that the killing curse has its own set of problems when cast.

Also, I'm not too sure about Bellatrix. She tortured Neville's parents to the point of insanity and then - kept them alive? Where in real life would this ever happen?

And finally, you're right about how stupid it was to have Molly manage to defeat Voldemort's most powerful lieutenant. Here's a woman who stopped dueling after her first son was born (at the very least) and remained that way, without practice, for nearly three decades and now, out of nowhere, Mrs "Not my daughter, you bitch" appears, duels for hardly a couple of seconds and then actually KILLS Bellatrix.

Probably the case of "Psychos were torturing them, were about to kill them before backup arrived to capture the Psychos" and Frank/Alice didn't get treated fast enough thus Insanity (In the real world, likely Comatose would be more realistic i suppose) (Why did no one ever try Elixir of Life or something, the Flamels would have probably helped if Dumbledore asked)

Its Harry's escape and destruction of the orb that labels their mission a failure. Voldemort doesn't give an ounce of shit about the others.

That people die in apparently.... sorry, which books for children have you been reading where there's at least one death a book? Seriously, we're have Quirrel in the first, multiple near deaths in the second, almost a trio of murder by werewolf in the third, Cedric died in the fourth, Sirius died in the fifth, Albus died in the sixth, and a whole slew of people died in the seventh and final book.

That is not material for children. Maybe the first 3 books could be argued that they're for children, but once the death tournament is introduced, it's not as kid friendly.

**** I think the excuse was they didn't want to accidentally harm the prophecy orb. There's also the fact that for some reason everyone uses a wide variety of curses (the only reason for death eaters not to use unforgivables is to take advantage of silent casting, but that just means they should be using the strongest spell they can silently cast, as for the good guys it should probably just be stunners) I get it for Dumbledore vs Voldermort where they're both far too talented to actually get hit with any normal curse (Voldermort does try killing curses, he just stops when he realises Dumbledore is just going to block them with conjured objects or animated scenery) and resort to inventive displays of harder to dodge magic.

A fair number survived because they got taken out by something not instantly lethal and the fight ended fast enough to save them, which is OK I guess (it's realistic that they don't bother making sure they finish people off, since that's time not spent fighting those still standing)

Not a stretch at all. Look at GoF - Voldemort doesn't summon every single one of his followers, he summons his closest ones. He specifically says, "My true family retunrs," where he's referring to his inner circle. Crabbe and Goyle were part of that inner cirlce, ergo they are (or at least were) very useful to Voldemort in the first war. They might not be as highly valued as Malfoy or Bellatrix, but they were right up there.

There isn't a single war where there have been no deaths on either side, the nonsensical approach to the second war notwithstanding. They were loyal Death Eaters to Voldemort, which means they would have taken part in raids, attacks and they would definitely have killed. It's not as if Voldemort was hosting tea parties and trying to get in power through charisma and politics. Same goes for all Death Eaters, not just Crabbe and Goyle.

The Death Eaters in Azkaban aren't all deragned either, despite what you think. Rookwood, Dolohov, Crouch Jr - none of these three are shown to be mad. Crouch Jr has one moment in the movies where he's distracted, otherwise he's capable of acting completely normal. Don't push Bellatrix's unhinged behaviour on the rest of them.

You realise that whenever the children get hit with spellfire, the effects are not as damaging as you'd expect? Ginny gets a broken ankle. Neville gets a busted nose.

** Putting Bella into same state as Frank and Alice would not be poetic justice. It would be the hero's foible.

Whenever someone asks for this kind of stuff, I get the feeling they completely missed the point of the books. Harry Potter books are about staying pure to yourself, no matter how much the outside worlds wants to change you, about staying true to your ideals and figthing for them. There are only two instances canon Harry uses Curiciatus, on Bella and on Carrow. On Bella it doesn't work. On Carrow he is under heavy stress and the knowledge that two evil people practically defiled his home and then went onto spit on McGonagall's face in front of him angers him a great deal yet he stops after a few seconds still.

Both cases were used by JK to show Harry's emotional state, magical understanding and character.

With Bella it fails because even his GODFATHER's death doesn't give him enough anger and hatred to widh upon someone untold pain.

With Carrow it works because now Harry has seen what war looks like first hand and still, even with necessary anger mustered, he doesn't have it in him do actually cause damage.

I mean the main challenge Harry faces since his first year has been the same: there is no good or evil, there is only power vs. Doing the right thing even when its harder, period. It's what makes Harry a hero, the hero. That's why he's Voldemort's equal, because he is the opposite of Voldemort even when their stories rings so similar.

Is there a deleted comment? No one talked about doing that to Bella, only about Neville and Molly tag teaming her and Neville getting the death stroke. Also, no one talked about Harry being callous or being grittier, we're only annoyed because Hermione's presence in later books either out right hampers Harry from academic progress (HBP book provides valid and useful brewing tips) or gives him an academic crutch thus preventing his character development. Also, especially in the movies, her presence gets in the way of Ron's character development and we end up with poor Ron constantly being accused of marrying above himself and ruining Harry and Hermione's great love story (not a fan of Harmony BTW). I get that JKR wrote her in as a savant or some such, but it's so obvious that she is there to primarily keep Harry and Ron from being forced to develop academic intelligence or logical thinking that her character is its own plot hole.

Edit: In a war, soldiers are not evil just because they use the same force as their opponents. What you said does not make a hero, it makes a martyr.

Edit: Actually, mental dead Bella and darker Harry were both mentioned, but not to the point where he is Voldie's new twin.

Like what he tried but didn't have the will to do when it happened to Sirius who he only met a few times, if it was Hermione he might be pushed over the edge, and then regret it horribly afterwards, but there's consequences for Voldemort's side as well as Harry's (Hermionecrutch is gone, Voldemort's top Death Eater is mentally dead) and Harry gets over it eventually, but realises that it's really War.

Even Jeanne D'arc killed people in war , and she was literally Saint Martyr. Basically a realistic side where Harry actually shows negative emotions like Rage and Hatred rather than just being a moody teenager (If it wasn't a Children's book, would harry have told the Dursleys to fuck off at least once?, or would that be too OOC for him) when people he love actually die.

Report to Dumbledore? But he didn't have the power to fire her. Report to the ministry? Fudge refused to believe a death eater's confession under Veritasium and you think he'd believe an allegation about how one of his most trusted officials, who he himself sent to Hogwarts and gave almost unlimited powers, was abusing Dumbledore's poster child? He'd probably say that Harry did it to himself. Or yell "Fake News", if we want to make it palatable to today's audience.

The only alternative was somebody attacking her in some way. Again what do you think would have happened if somebody did that? Yes, I know Hermione managed to get Umbridge attacked by a horde of Centaurs, but it was the result of a spur-of-the-moment idea (under extreme stress) and a miracle, really, that it happened the way it did.

Edit - Also, don't forget when the goddamn Minister of Magic, ol' Scrimegour himself, was presented with evidence of Umbridge's abuse (Harry showing his arm at the Burrow) - he did nothing. Umbridge was certainly not fired, let alone arrested, because she managed to get back to a powerful position under Voldy's puppet regime

Practically, that would have been well nigh impossible. The Confundus would have to be powerful and maintained constantly to ensure Umbridge didn't slip for a moment. And prolonged exposure would have almost certainly curtailed her mental faculties, causing another set of problems. And finally, you think the entire Slytherin house and her very own Inquisitorial Squad wouldn't notice when she weirdly began behaving out of character?

A good solution would be the Polyjuice but, like you said, only Sirius or Moody (or maybe, Tonks) would have the balls to do it.

****** I'm honestly about 50/50 on this statement because an abused child perspective changes depending on the scenario and their own personality. Children are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. Generalising abused children into saying they act meek and do what adults say is quite wrong.

Some are loud, others replicate their abusers, some never bounce back, others become functioning, some end up meek and submissive, and others create a new life. I can tell you for a fact, I will never trust an adult in my life. I would sooner die than turn to an adult for something. That abuse never leaves you, no matter what.

**** On edit one: No one said anything about not killing, that is inevitable and I'm not against Harry taking a life in a story. I am against Harry being capable of murder and torture. There sre many ways to incapacitate someone without resorting to magics that would require Harry to give up on five years of character development.

On edit two: But that's the thing that tangibly separates Harry from Voldemort. From Olivander's words on expecting greatness, to hats advice that Slytherin would make him great, everything in Harry's life makes him afraid of becoming another Voldemort. That's one of the reasons he clings to the idea of being just Harry so vehemently. A character that well defined with his self imposed morality wouldn't just throw around dark magic like that.

Now, if you made his descend into darkness a gradual process, that would be believable.

***** 1. Incapacitating a more skilled/powerful oponent who is trying to kill you is a lot harder than killing them because you don't have control of the fight, your oponent does. In modern times it works because law enforcement is on average better trained and armed than average criminals, but even they have shoot outs where people die and police are forced to use lethal force against violent offenders (we'll avoid the racism arguments because that's a more complex issue). Stunners and magical binds are not going to win any group fights, and the DA pretty much only learned decent shield charms because Harry taught them and even those can fail.

2. Anything Harry does to incapacitate can be undone - 'ennervate' or other counter spells pretty much mean that the only incapacitate opponent is dead or seriously injured (and I don't see anyone having the time or the opportunity to go around providing basic medical aide to Death Eaters). By serious injury I mean cutting off a limb, preferrably their wand hand.

3. Some, like werewolves, can only be fought off with more powerful (and therefore more damaging) spells.

4. I'm personally not saying Harry and co. should be throwing around AK's like they're candy, but setting opponents on fire, cutting them up, those make sense to use. If you want him to transfigure people into inanimate objects until the end of the fight, then he needs to be motivated to study, doesn't he? Which means Hermione needs to go in order for Harry to take his academics more seriously.

5. It's not darkness, it's self defence. Voldie is separated from Harry because Voldie is a psychopath - he does not feel guilt for anything he does, sees no issue with killing and torturing random strangers, and cares only about himself. Voldie is also a narcissist and a control freak. Harry is none of those things and so he is not Voldemort - killing others in self defence will not turn him into voldemort or make him a murderer. In a gun fight, someone is going to die, and wands are a lot more dangerous than guns. I don't like evil Harry fics, but I want a realistic Harry, a soldier older than his years, not a 17 year old Ghandi who achieves world peace by commiting assisted suicide.

6. What character development? We have 5 years of an emotionally abused (if not worse) kid being implicitely told that nothing will get done unless he endangers himself and his friends. The root cause of the issues (the damage that childhood isolation and abuse has on people) is not addressed, we only have Tom turning into a terrorist and Harry being forced into a martyr role.

****** I agree with you on first four points and that's what I mean by incapacitate. Take them out of the fire and if they die because Harry was heavy handed, that's okay. He'll grow with the experience. But I completely disagree Hermione. Without Hermione, he'd fall even further behind because in Harry's mind Ron is the bar for normalcy. I've reread the most of the books recently and realised just how much Harry panders to Ron's whims. To be honest, if JK hadn't done a great job of establishing Harry's loneliness before his friendship with Ron, or if I started on the books at midpoint like in from the third or fourth book, I'd suspect he's gay, not that I'd have mind. So I don't think its Hermione's help that holds him back ass much as his desire to always take Ron as his baseline. On the contrary, most of the times, Hermione is the one to be his support when his lack of confidence strikes.

I feel like you are far too hung up on the martyr point and that's really not accurate. It was Dumbledore's schemes that helped hin survive a second curse, something that had to happen for Voldemort to die. Yes, Dumbledore's manipulations to ensure it happened were underhanded not to mention borderline evil but they were necessary evil.

******* I just have a problem with children routinely putting themselves in danger while the adults are like 'good thing you were there, otherwise things would not have turned out well. Good job!' That's my biggest issue with the first two books, and I think they pretty much set the pattern for self-sacrificing Harry rather than use common sense Harry.

Harry would have been aware of how well Ron's brothers did, as well as how his class mates are doing just from socializing with them in class, so I don't see how he would only use Ron as a comparison. I freely admit I don't like Hermione, but even disregarding that, I have issues with her impact on Harry's academics. Mostly, it's because it is very obvious that she and Harry have different styles of learning (rote memorization vs hands on) but she kept expecting Harry to use her study methods to succeed. When he tries to use his own methods, she scoffs and nags about how he's not doing things properly or not following the teachers' specific instructions. She does that to other people, too, but Harry's childhood left him very vulnerable to that kind of influence so he listened more to her than other people did (except Neville, maybe). This then leaves him to choose between goofing off and barely passing or Hermione's style of very boring and exhaustive learning - as a pre-teen/teen, which would you have picked?

As for the first part of your reply as well as the martyr comment, your first post was about Harry not killing or using lethal spells because that would make him a murderer. If you've changed your mind, then why are we arguing about it? I want a Harry that fights back with all he has, but not one who goes psycho-assassin and throws unforgivables in all directions.
