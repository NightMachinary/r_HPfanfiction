This is /not/ intended to be a comparison (or a fight) about which is better, book or movie.

Instead, I am curious about what things from the HP movie adaptations have entered you head!canon. Things that are /not/ part of the books, or images that you always imagine like they were in the film.

For me, I always think of:

- The moment Snape steps in front of the trio in HP and the P from A.

- The cut scene from DH where Draco throws Harry his wand in the battle of Hogwarts (as an inner impulse for Draco, a fantasy he didn't /actually/ manage to follow through on).

- The sight of Petunia alone in her house before going into witness protection.

- Luna's appearance (other characters I often imagine looking quite different).

- The specific image of Neville looking at the photograph of the order in the R of R.

I am sure there are other things that don't come to mind right away.

So . . . what moments from the movie really affect how you think of the book/read or write fanfic?


** Among other things: a) Hermione's gown at the Yule Ball (was blue in the book); b) Snape's appearance (Alan Rickman, with all due respect, does not look thirtysomething, as Snape should.); c) the appearance of Thestrals; d) the dance in the tent during DH1.

*** Yes, AR definitely does /not/ look age-appropriate, even in the earliest films. His portrayal is masterful, but his age does kind of get in the way for me . . . wish they could have turned back the clock on him a little. If we could have seen a mid-thirties AR in the part, I think that it would have given the character an entirely different flavor . . .

***** Great scene, I just don't understand the why behind it. It's scenes like that which irritate me, why not just incorporate money into things that actually happened in the books, and can aid to the plot in a positive way, instead of just confuse people.

** Harry and Luna in the forest with the thestrals is a really sweet scene. In the book he's just kind of confused by her, the movies did it much better.

I agree with you about the Draco throwing his wand to Harry thing, it would have been awesome if they left it in, but it works as you put it.

Also, Moody's appearance and accent in the movie is awesome, a lot of the casting I picture differently, but Moody is just /awesome/.

** Clothing. Specifically, Hogwarts uniforms. All I can picture is their prep school attire: with the grey jumpers, the black slacks/skirts, the colored House ties, and the light black outer robe that opens up. It's nice because virtually zero fics employ anything different.

How many times have I come across a sex scene where one character uses a House tie to bind another character's hands?

Answer: Thousands.

*** Funny, because I don't think about uniforms at all, just the robes and perhaps the scarves for outerwear. I went to a private prep school (ugh-good education, bad company) that did /not/ have uniforms, just a dress code (button up shirts and belts for guys, skirts a certain length for girls).

I tend to imagine that the students are dressed in their own clothes (though perhaps there is a uniform option that isn't required) under the robes, and that they are only required to wear the robes during regular class-hours, breakfast + classtime, but not on weekends. I have trouble thinking of the students roaming around and sitting in the grounds in all weather in what I picture as "academic" robes.

Heh. Thanks for bring up a detail I never considered.

Didn't the movies suddenly shift during PoA? I remember being surprised at Hermione's clothing, especially during the Slap Malfoy scene.

Same! Considering it's a bunch of teenagers, making them to stay in uniform every day would be impossible anyway.

The directors changed. They changed again the next year, and then finally settled on David Yates for OotP through DH2.

Each director had a different vision of how things should be, although most seem to have built on the image created by Alfonso Cuarón. (PoA)

Can that really work, though? Cause in the book he was 100% unconscious. So that would go against book canon.

I love the tale about Lily's gift to Slughorn, the fish Francis. That's in my headcanon now. I'm also with jiltedtemplar, I can't picture anything but the movie uniforms (plus it makes way more sense to me than the full-robes sometimes implied in the books).

** [film] Time Turners allowing the person to watch the past roll back. Also, that they don't take the Turning person back to where they were, as if to choose a different path.

[book] Polyjuice changes the voice as well, and isn't limited to an hour- that's just the average for a competently-made batch.

[film] Harry and Voldemort having an actual duel at the end of Deathly Hallows. This isn't really relevant for fanfiction, as most stories rewrite the end, but if someone's writing a post-series story, I prefer the meaningful duel. Also, Harry snapping the Elder wand.

[film] Ron and Hermione's relationship. Credit to Rupert Grint and the related directorial choices- Ron's a better friend to Harry and a more plausible companion for Hermione in the movies than the books. I particularly love the banter between Ron and Hermione during Prisoner of Azkaban.

[film] Hedwig dies taking a Killing Curse for Harry while in flight- not trapped in his cage.

[book] Snape has no direct involvement with Halloween 1981. None.
