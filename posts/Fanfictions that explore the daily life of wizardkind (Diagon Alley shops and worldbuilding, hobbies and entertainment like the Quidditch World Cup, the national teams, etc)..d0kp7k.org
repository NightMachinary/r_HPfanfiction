Money quote:

Shirking Quidditch turn-out was generally felt by Wood to be a mortal sin. Some of the House Second Seven spoke bitterly of "morning Woods," or early practices, which only a strong passion for the sport could forgive. (It will come as no surprise that these became known as "morning Johnsons" when Wood left and Angelina became captain.)

** I love the rigel black chronicles-- they are 4 novel length stories set in an au crossover with Alanna the lioness series. It has the most in depth world building I've read in quite a while-- some is carried over from the Alanna series (which I haven't read) but a far bit is just sheer inginuity. In particular, there is a lot on wizarding London, potion magic, and politics.

**** Some elements are borrowed but executed very differently in the fic compared to Alanna, such as the sleeping sickness, Leo and the court etc. Alanna the Lioness has not aged very well, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it now. It can feel very cliched now, but it was probably still fresh in the 80s
