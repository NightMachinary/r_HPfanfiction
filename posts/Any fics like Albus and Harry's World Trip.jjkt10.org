I found linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) through this sub and I just finished it at 5am (lol RIP tomorrow me). It's amazing and I've enjoyed it so much and can't wait for the next update.

Are there any other fics like it? I'm not expecting a similar plot like Albus taking Harry on as an apprentice but more about the spirit of the fic: how it mixes fun and light-hearted with clever and imaginative and serious and moving. I absolutely love the characterization, especially of Dumbledore (probably my favourite Dumbledore of all time) and Harry, but honestly everyone is fantastic, even Lockhart and Skeeter (which I really did not think I would ever say).

If anything, I would say the fic I've read closest in feel is linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary), which I also found through this sub and loved. So, please give me some funny, clever, feel good recs!

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
