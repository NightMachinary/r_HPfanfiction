*Harry Potter & the Honeychurch Institute of Magic!*

The FANFIC is divided in two part, the first one is 100K words and is finished while the second one is 50K words and has been abandoned. The story is a "cute" post Hogwarts professor Harry Potter, the ship is original and blends well with a possible future for Harry Potter.\\
I don't recommend the second part as it is 1) Abandoned and 2) Goes in a new plot direction that I utterly hate (Kid Voldermort).\\
Grade: 6/10 = MEH
