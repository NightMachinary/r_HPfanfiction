Would the person who made the Horcrux be truly immortal because phoenixes can't die?


** It would probably be destroyed at the next burning day.

*** Would it? I mean the only known things that can destroy horcruxes are Basilisk venom, Fiendfyre and the Killing Curse.

I don't think a Phoenixes burning day would destroy it considering Fiendfyre is basically cursed fire.

**** I imagine that a phoenix is of a similar level to a basilisk in terms of magic potency. So, I think it's fire could possibly be just as potent as basilisk venom, maybe.

***** There's also the fact that phoenixes are *reborn* from their ashes. To be reborn, one needs to *die* first. And a horcrux placed in a living thing would not survive the vessel's death. Ergo, the first burning day when the old phoenix dies to be reborn from it's ashes, the horcrux would perish at the point of death and the newly reborn bird would arise purified.

****** To add on to this, however, I reckon that the horcrux would “know” this and try and prevent the Phoenix from dying. So you'd wind up with this old haggard slightly-evil ‘pure' creature that refuses to die of its own accord (thus needing a killing curse or other external mechanism of death to start the burning and “purify” it). Kind of like how sometimes you need someone else to get you out of the mess in life you find yourself in. Quite poetic, I feel.

******* The natural burning day of a phoenix, like the one Harry saw when he first encountered Fawkes, would come at the end of it's natural lifespan. The horcrux would not be able to prevent it, just like it would not be able to prevent a human from dying of old age. Just because the phoenix will be reborn to repeat the cycle doesn't mean it does not live the same cycle every other living being is following, unless killed prematurely - being born, living, getting old, dying of old age. A phoenix would be just as powerless in fending off their burning day as a human would be in fending off their own death.

******** Yeah, but diaries can't write back, people can't survive the killing curse, and diadems can't possess people under normal circumstances. I'm willing to believe that an object as astounding and evil as a horcrux would be able to bend magic a little to ensure it's continued survival if possible.

********* So you're essentially saying Harry Potter would have been immortal, immune to anything save basilisk venom, fiendfire and the killing curse if he had chosen to not confront Voldemort?

********** No, what I'm saying is that an object as powerful and dark as horcrux would react with magic in unexpected ways. It makes an artefact designed to enhance the wearer's intelligence turn into something that can almost entrance them into touching it. It can ensure that someone has a one-use-only get-out-of-death free card in certain circumstances. It can make a diary possess a schoolgirl and give her a talent (parseltongue) temporarily that she'd normally not be able to do. Who knows how a horcrux will react with [insert other magical thing here], I'm just trying to propose one seemingly random yet somewhat logical idea to how a horcrux might behave.

****** Plus phoenixes are kind of like unicorns, in that they're inherently pure of heart. I don't think they're compatible with the level of corruption a horcrux embodies. Either both would die or the phoenix would destroy it.

** It would probably depend on how the writer depicted horcruxes. For example I've read some fics where Harry rids himself of the horcrux by cutting out his scar physically and destroying that which would imply that the horcrux is bound to a physical object in which case it would probably be destroyed by the Phoenix being reborn. On the other hand I've also read fics where the horcrux attaches to Harry's soul and not just his body and in that circumstance I would think it likely the horcrux could survive the reborthing process. Either way it would depend on the writer and you could probably make an argument from either side.
