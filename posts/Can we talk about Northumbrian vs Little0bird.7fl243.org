I know these two have been discussed over and over again but I just want to say that I recently gave up AGAIN on reading Northumbrian's stuff. Don't get me wrong, the writing is great and does follow cannon for the most part, but the portrayal of the characters just feel unauthentic to me. I hate how Ginny is described as some hormonal teenager and then later on as a drunk and unthinking adult who becomes a public nuisance.

Sure, she WAS. A teenager and probably hormonal, and as an adult we all get tipsy and whatever, but I feel that her portrayal made her sound like a dumb ditz. Also, the whole wanting to jump Harry's bones and touch him all the time right after the great battle just feels too soon.

I have great respect for anyone who can write story after story following my favourite characters but I'm honestly disappointed by Northumbrian after reading all the excellent reviews. I tried Little0bird after abandoning Northumbrian the first time and loved it. The events and character portrayal felt much much closer to the originals and I could actually see everything come together nicely. I wish she had finished the last fic she wrote.

Not sure why I'm writing this, am just hoping to find someone who agrees with me?? Hahahha. I just feel like Northumbrian's stories are good! But why can't the characters be more "them"?


** Haven't read any of Little0bird's fics, so I can't really say anything about them... but I have read a lot of Northumbrian, and I think I can say this: He's better with original characters than he is with the canon ones, and he writes the Muggle world better than he writes the wizarding one.

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is -- at least in my opinion -- his best fic, and that story takes place in the Muggle world and the main character is a Muggle housewife who becomes the neighbour of Harry, Ginny and the kids (with her own kids becoming friends with the Potter kids). I love this story, and much of the fun of it is to see the familiar wizarding things and characters through the eyes of someone who isn't in on the secret, as she gets closer to figuring it out.

The only other Northumbrian fic that is anywhere near as interesting is "James and Me," which ALSO takes place in the Muggle world and stars a Muggle OC who doesn't know about the wizarding world (in fact, she's the daughter of the main character from "Strangers").

I tend to lose interest pretty quickly when Northumbrian tries to center on the wizarding world and star the canon characters, I'm always "noooo, I want more Muggle OCs!" I think he'd make a pretty good urban fantasy writer... I think he's better with his own characters than with other people's characters.

*** That makes lots of sense! While his writing is good and the plot is always interesting, what's most jarring to me is the lack of authenticity in the HP characters. I guess it's not the style for me!

If you like stories that follow really closely to the original, I would highly recommend Little0bird (:

*** James and Me is excellent. My favorite Northumbrian fic. I wasn't expecting it to evolve from what looked like a typical rom-com to an interesting mystery story with innovative magic and a dash of history.

** Yeah his characterisation of Ginny is why I can't really enjoy Northumbrian. There's also weird manufactured drama about Ginny wearing revealing clothes around other men in one of his fics, I think, which made me roll my eyes so hard they nearly came out the back of my head.

That said, the sheer scale and consistency of his writing is really something to admire, not to mention the technical quality. Strangers is not my cup of tea but is very creative and deserving of it's rep.

**** Even during Grave Days, which follows just after the war; Ginny is portrayed in (to me) a very uncharacteristic way. She's hormonal, constantly PDAs, and behaves in a rather flighty manner. It's not just that it's unlike Ginny, it's so strange because it's just after the war and she has lost so much (friends and family).

*** Yes that's exactly how I feel! The writing is great, but as someone who loves the original characters so much, it's really jarring to read at times. His version of the other characters I can take, but his Ginny seems to be a whole other person. Just makes me sad because I do love his plot lines.

** I don't recall some of the dumb ditz stuff about Ginny, nor her acting like she wanted to jump his bones right after the battle, but I might just not be remembering it right. Ginny as a drunk was a plot line in that story relating to her being poisoned. The whole point of the story was that she was being made to not act like herself, so I don't think you can fault Northumbrian for her characterization there.

The ironic thing with little0bird and Northumbrian is that Northumbrian incorporates a lot of the Muggle world into his stories, yet little0bird's stories, while fully in the wizarding world, felt a lot more like a typical muggle life where magic didn't really play much of a role.

Northumbrian is better for plot-heavy stories, while little0bird is good for slice of life, "this is how their lives probably would play out absent a Voldemort villain." Not always interesting but still a good story and it makes the characters feel real.

** I glossed over Northumbrian's works focusing on what happened right after the Battle of Hogwarts and went straight to the ones where Harry was already somewhere high up in the Auror chain of command. I liked the world building there, on how Harry revolutionized the Auror corps for example by making unconventional choices like hiring a werewolf, a vampire and a Muggle, and how the mirror phone was developed.

** I think a lot of it comes from popularity bias. Their stuff gets recommended loads and loads. It's some of the first fics that get recommended to new and new-ish readers. So that creates an imbalance between how often the story gets read verse how good they actually are. I don't really like the writing style (or subject matter) of most of their fics, but I could see why some people would. It's just not for me.

** The best Northumbrian stories (Strangers, James and Me) are better than Little0bird's best (Questions and Answers). But I feel Little0bird's average fic is better than Northumbrian's average. A lot of Northumbrian's works, esp. his early ones (Grave Days, Aurors and Schoolgirls, and a few others) I couldn't bring myself to finish, while Little0bird's Dudley and McGonagall and Teddy fics are all good without being exceptional.

I think I prefer Northumbrian just a bit (peak is more important to me than average). [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] beats them both in quality, though she hasn't written as much.

*** I think Little0bird's popular for "The First Day" which picks off right after the Battle of Hogwarts. She then continued the story all the way up to when most of the kids attended Hogwarts, sadly the last one remains unfinished at 103 chapters but in my opinion it's a fascinating read. It's not particularly action packed and mainly deals with the day to day of the characters and she does cover quite a number of them.

I have no idea which ones are Northumbrian's popular fics, I just started from the beginning but lost interest after maybe the 7th one chaptered piece.

Well, I don't actually agree with you - I don't have problems with the characterization as such - but rather, I find Northumbrian's stories stupefyingly boring. I read like 10 chapters and realized I couldn't be bothered to actually give a shit about any of these characters.

Also, really, a muggle housewife as a protagonist? I think he was going for creating the blandest protagonist possible, to contrast with the Awesome!Potters, but reading about some random bint doing housework annoyed me to the extreme.
