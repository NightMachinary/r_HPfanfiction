** Oh boy. Here we go again. Also, hardly anyone considers Cursed Child palatable, let alone canon.

** No. So please stop with this idiotic statement. And while you're at it, stop acting like Cursed Child means anything.

*** Ya know, while I don't agree at all, I appreciate you for having the opposite opinion to this for once. Don't see that very often.

** I wouldn't say she "deserves better". I think they both should have dated and then figured out they both care for each other but wouldn't really work as a couple without a lot of outside help. Just my thought though.

** The HP world is very lighthearted about what we would consider horrifying mind altering substances. In PoA, Harry overheard Molly, Ginny and Hermione joke about using Love Potions and Molly implies she fed one to her husband. We see the incident with Ron and Romilda too.

Jealousy is a part of Ron and always will be. How he lets it affect him is what defines the character. It's the same with many of us in real life as well. That's how humans work.

Also, who in hell said that Hermione became a housewife? Just because she had kids doesn't make her one. Nor was it mentioned anywhere. How can you mention Ron resenting her being the Minister in one sentence and say that she was a house wife in another?

Edit: There have been many, many discussions about canon pairings and JKR has even said that if she were to write the story again she wouldn't pair Ron with Hermione.

Full disclosure, I'm tired of Hermione in general so take all my opinions with a pinch of salt.

Does she? I'm pretty sure she just admits she made one, not that she gave it to Arthur --- or even anyone.

No she hasn't. She said she wrote them as wish fulfillment. She then goes on to say they'll probably be fine.

** I feel like people have taken to reading fanfiction and have gotten it in their brains that it's canon. There's a little too much of that going on.

** Meh. People are far too obsessed about that. So what if Ron is her first adult relationship? So what if she runs into it listening to her hormones instead of her brain?

Relationships are not set in stone. They can break apart. People can make bad decisions about who they jump in bed with. People learn and grow.

There is that amazing thing called a "divorce" Ron and Hermione can have and once they had this they can get together with other people.
