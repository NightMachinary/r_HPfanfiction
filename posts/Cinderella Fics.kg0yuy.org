Hi! Looking for some good old fashioned cinderella fics, multi chapter nd from either perspective!

Please the standard pairings (either marauder's era or Harry's era, no mixing) and no mc Draco at all! Thank you!


** 1) Ever After by SweetShireen Harry Potter u:10-19-2020 - "This Cinders girl is just like you!" Dudley snickers as he watches the television. "Dressed in rags, does all the chores, always dirty, and no one wants her!" Later, when Harry lies in bed and stares up at the dusty cobwebs on the cupboard ceiling, he can't help but wonder wearily: "If I'm Cinders, does that mean one day someone will come to save me too?" Oneshot. HHr
