** It's an old trope. 'Foreign Partner moves back to the old Country due to parental pressures' is a thing that's been written before. Often gets followed by the Rom Com protagonist who goes to tell their parents how much they love them, and then those parents get persuaded and let the foreign partner come back and everything is happy.

It's Hallmark Nonsense, but it's not an overly uncommon trope.

And well, in all honesty. In what's basically a pointless race war, getting the hell out of dodge is probably the smarter option. Frankly, if I were Mr Patil, I'd probably do the same.

In terms of why they might write a relationship they plan to end - a lot of fandom has slight cynicism regarding the typical Harmony-esque relationship progression where two characters meet at age 11, get together quickly, get married quickly, and live happily ever after. Most people don't marry their childhood sweetheart, and so they get a little tired of that 'idealised' first-relationship-is-last-relationship thing and give Harry a first relationship that ends before he meets whatever marriage partner the writer puts in next.

** There's a big... Craving? A lot of people seem to have to just read/write pointlessly sad stories. A lot of my favorite fics have needlessly sad middles, but I'm not fond of sad endings.

Is that just the ending for these fics? Is it possible they were trying to set up months/years of pining before Harry shows up in India but the author got a new job/didn't know what to do next/lost interest?

*** That checks out. A lot of the stories were abandoned

** Really there are so few stories where would play ANY role, that to collect any Harry/Padma stories is an achievement in itself! The only which even from far looks like having anything slightly resembling Harry/Padma is “Hermione's Plan by chem prof” linkffn(3290886) (and it is fundamentally a Harmony story), and the only other story with Padma as the main character is “Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers” linkffn(11858501), but that's very much unfinished (I like Lovegoods there!).

  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.
