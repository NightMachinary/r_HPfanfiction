What I mean is he's been holding in his grief for so long one day he just lets it all go.


** Well, while not /exactly/ what you're asking for, linkffn(Stronger than Hope) has Harry post-OoTP essentially suffering one long breakdown compounded by summer isolation.

Also has a mentor!Snape that doesn't ruin Snape's characterization, so that's a nice bonus.

**** Can never be too careful.

So definitely give this one a try. While I do have problems with the execution of certain ideas, the fic as a whole is very good, though the summary makes it look like a terrible mentor!Snape story.

** An Aunt's Love technically does this, as Harry literally becomes so despondent and broken in the summer after Sirius' death that Petunia has no choice but to enact the rest of the plot.

  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.

** linkffn(2163835) The Refiners Fire

First fanfiction I ever read--it has a completed sequel too!

Starts out in the summer post-OOTP, finishes after 6th year. The sequel deals with Harry's 7th year. For reference, this was completed in 2005 (3 weeks before HBP came out), so you won't see any references of HBP or Horcruxes anywhere.

Also, the Harry/OC in this fic is honestly one of the most well-written I've ever seen for that pairing. It eventually becomes Harry/Ginny though.
