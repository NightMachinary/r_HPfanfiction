Often I see that she is the brightest of her generation (like Hermione) but there are people around who argue otherwise. Both are convincing arguments

1) I'm writing a fanfiction and I really need to know whether I should write her as Harry in grades (except switch around the O to potions with Lily) or like Hermione (everything O) but Sirius and James were described as the very top and I want to adhere to Canon?

2) So do you think she is overrated when it comes to abilities, skill and intelligence and I should not portray her like Hermione or an overall above average student with an outstanding talent at potions (like Harry)? Or should she just be in-between? Or is she underrated?

3) Also, what electives do you see her taking? We have no indication she would've taken Arithmancy or Ancient Runes and for now I am sticking with Divination and Care of Magical Creatures (in my headcanon she likes animals a lot).

4) What do you imagine her OWLs and NEWTs to be like? I am also conflicted as to whether she should be the very top of her class or if I should make other girls smarter and brighter than her?

5) And lastly, Lily is a blank state in the books so how do you picture her personality to be like?

6) What types of friends would she have?

7) Was she canoncially short or tall?

I personally see as very kind and extremely involved in extracurricular activities, making her Head Girl and extremely popular. She's a social butterfly and likes to hang out with people when she has free time. She always befriends the underdog, making her extremely popular with everyone but she also panics quickly and is extremely anxious, and tends to overthink and over analyze stuff a lot and is very uncreative in her way of thinking and needs to follow a book to find a solution.

She's also too forgiving for her own good (like with Snape) but knows her self worth. She has a very black and white view of the world like in TLAT and has an extremely goofy sense of humor. She's also clumsy, and very tall for a girl (is she canoncially tall or short?) which makes her more lovable coupled with her wonder and sense of humor. She's very open to the idea of free love of the 70's and extremely nature and animal-friendly, making her even more popular.

She is not a party-pooper and would party rather than stay cooped up with her homework (more like Ginny than Hermione here).

She's also sassy but not terribly so as to not hurt other people's feelings and makes people comfortable as possible. But she also tends to overexaggerate things and make a big deal out of nothing sometimes. She grew up as loved by everyone and doesn't understand why others aren't the same way or why they can't be 'perfect' like her. She tries to bring people out of their shells and make them more outgoing (which is why she stuck around Snape for longer than necessary).

Lily gets angry very quickly and tends to jump to conclusions and then becomes passive-aggressive until you apologise because she grew up spoiled and expects people to come and apologise to her and just know what's wrong.

If you find anything that contradicts Canon then please tell me so I can correct it. I'd also like to hear your opinion.


** 1) I think she should have more 'O‘s than Harry, but still not /all-/'O's. From what we know of her, she was much more of an instinctive witch (precocious at wandless magic and such) as opposed to Hermione's studios, academic type, so maybe she'd have 'O's in all practical classes, but only 'E's and 'A's in academic classes such as History or Astronomy?

2) She's above average without being exceptional. She'd be a shoe-in for a high wizarding position like Auror, definitely could hold her own, but maybe she isn't quite brilliant enough to be "extraordinary" in the way Voldemort, or even Snape, could be. There's definitely wiggle room, though, since she died young enough she might well have reached Snape-level later on. Make up your own mind.

(But keep in mind that Slughorn or Dumbledore's fond remembrances are to be taken with a grain of salt; considering the tragic circumstances of her death, they'd have good reason to only remember the good about her, much as they did with James, and much as they "remembered" Sirius being unstable and evil, and Peter always being cowardly and sneaky, the moment they "learned" that those two were spies.)

3) I don't think she'd have any patience with a sham like Divination, unless you write her as an actual Seer who would have a reason to take the class. Care of Magical Creatures does sound good, though.

4) Call me lazy, but I'd just say, refer back to Item One, concering her OWL and NEWT grades. And she should be top /girl/ of her class, but still below (albeit directly below) the four Marauders if we're talking Gryffindor at large.

5) Beyond general love, kindness, bravery and stuff, and moving on to personality traits that aren't virtues, she must have a mischievous, humorous side if she could fall in love with James --- but with an upbringing that made her resist against it rather than give in (typical exchange:

#+begin_quote
  *LILY* (/thought/) *:* "Okay, James's prank was hilarious, but he is /breaking rules/ and /being a bad boy/, must not laugh must not laugh"

  *JAMES* (/aloud/) *:* "Oh come on, Evans, don't be such a sourpuss! Put a smile on that pretyt face! Pwease!"

  *LILY* (/thought/) *:* "Do you /have/ to rub it in?!" (/aloud/) "Back off, Potter, I hate you! You don't have to tell me how I should feel about your /stupid jokes/!" (/thought/) "Oh god I hate my life."
#+end_quote

basically.) From her friendship with Snape I infer this humor also manifested as appreciation for deadpan snark and other subtle verbal humor; your choice on whether she dished it out on her own.

Even less positive, I see her as very impatient. I'm not quite sure why, but I imagine Lily Evans as quickly getting annoyed at the antics of people who are being stupid, goofy or just plain obnoxious. Hence her "break-up" with Petunia and her exasperation with the Marauders, who are the type to have good joke ideas and then go to far and belabor them till it's not even remotely funny anymore except for themselves.

6) The type who have black hair, are in Slytherin, and are called Severus Snape. Kidding aside, there's a long-standing tradition of her being friends with Alice Longbottom-to-be, which is fine, I guess. No particular support for it in canon, but nothing to contradict it either, so why not? Generally she would have good school camaraderie with most non-obnoxious girls in school, including non-Gryffindors (we know from Snape that she's okay with being friendly to other Houses). But I do think Snape was her main "deep" friendship; she was never again quite this close to anyone until she fell in love with James.

7) Not a clue going off just book-canon, but in the absence of an answer there, I think it's fair to turn to the movies, wherein she is depicted as just kind of... average size. Slightly smaller than James, who is average-going-on-tall.

*** I was planning on making her be challenged by two girls her year - and them coming out on top. But since it seems like everyone is saying she was the top then I guess she was? So I guess being directly beneath Peter would make sense.

Thanks though! But I thought Alice was a well-respected auror? If she was indeed Lily's age then that would make her too overpowered since she'd have given birth to Neville at twenty whens he wouldn't gardauted at eighteen. Auror training itself also takes time, so she would have no time to be so well-recognised and respected by the magical community. I was thinking Mary MacDonald would make sense.

I really can't see her getting lower grades than Peter. Even in (what little we see of) people's fond reminiscing of him before he's outed as a traitor, there was never any mention that I recall of academic prowess. His only achievement is becoming an animagus young, but there's no canon explanation for how one even learns that, so we can't know how much he was carried by James and Sirius.

Even post-Voldie resurrection, we never see him do anything more than be generally pathetic. Hardly seems like top student material. I've always assumed Peter was an average to slightly above average (via osmosis from the other three) student with one impressive skill that he may or may not even be able to take much credit for.

***** Peter was not stupid. I think it's a common misconception that he is. Yes, he was pathetic and cowardly. No, he wasn't stupid. McGonagall described him as horrible at dueling and overshadowed by Sirius and James, but everyone tends to underestimate Pettigrew. He blew up an entire street with a single spell (and he's supposed to be overshadowed by Sirius and James, so they must make worse damage) and he managed to brew the potion to restore Voldemort to his body as well as take on Moody with Barty Crouch (but that's probably all Barty with Pettigrew just there).

His only weakness was DADA and transfiguration (of which I'll make him get E's with the help of the other Marauders) and make him good at charms and potions, as well as care of magical creatures, where he'll achieve O's. As for the other subjects, I'll have him get A's and maybe another E in astronomy.

******* I looked for quotes that implied it but he was described as a horrible duelist and he hero-worshipped Sirius and James in the flashback. There's nothing to suggest he was lazy or unacademic and didn't study hard to keep up with them. There are certainly people who are smart and don't get good grades but I don't think Pettigrew is that, really. He was a hatstall between Gryffindor and Slytherin after all, so he must have had some ambition at the very least to study and get good marks.

******** I got it from the conversation Remus and Sirius had with him in PoA. It sounded like he never was as good as any of them, but they helped him every step of the way and let him be friends with them.

Sure they were angry, but there is some true to it, additional he was really terrible at taking tests. I mean, he must know how a werewolf looks like and still didn't manage to remember in the exam? That is not a weakness in one subject, that is a weakness in remembering stuff and being able to recall it when asked.

No he can't write down something he should know very well, but he doesn't. That shows that he just doesn't pay attention to things.

Where did you see any indicator that he knows anything about herbs or anything like that? He is by no one described as smart or even kind of smart or having his own smarts. While Lily on the other hand is described by a lot of people as smart and good at magic.

It just doesn't make sense to place him above her in grades.

*********** Well he did manage to brew the potion that restored Voldemort to his body. And someone must be talented in one subject, at the very least. I have a headcanon that he was the first marauder Lily befriended and it was through their love of potions. There is evidence for it (you don't just need to follow rules, you also have to have an aptitude for it, like Hermione. Otherwise, Harry and everyone in the class would've gotten better grades if they just paid attention to the instructions) more than evidence for him being good at potions than anything else in the series. So if he was good at something, I think it would be potions.

Again it's all part of the story. But wasn't it Hagrid and Slughorn that said Lily was good instead of 'a lot of people'? I also don't like seeing Pettigrew be all pathetic and his only trait is 'meek'. I want to write him as someone who is generally smart but blends in the background because he is overshadowed by his much smarter friends, no matter how much he tries. He has a good sense of humor and is friendly with everyone in general, but holds grudges. He tries to prove himself and makes it his goal to prove others wrong. He's brave (you can't be in Gryffindor if you don't have at least a bit of it) but not like his friends. For example, he'd try out an extreme sport or take on a dare but when it's really life-threatening, he becomes cowardly.

A plot point in the story is that he introduces Lily to James. They team up to get better grades than the Marauders (they sort of succeed, but not really) and by the end of it, Lily had gotten better grades than one of the girls ahead of her, placing only two on top of her (in addition to Snape and the Marauders). By the end of it I plan to have him and Lily being equal in their O's (three each) and E's as well as possible A's. I want to portray them as hardworking individuals.

************ If it is your story go for it, but I just don't think it is canon.

In canon Peter was weaker than Lily in that way and that is fine. He doesn't have to be a genius and he doesn't have to suck.

I don't like him being just a doormate either, but it is shown in the books that he is a lot behind James and Sirius, possible Remus too, but Lily is described as a very cable witch.

And yes, Slughorn and Hagrid say it, but didn't Moody say something when talking about the old order as well. Why don't you trust those words. Is there anything in the books that disagrees with them? No. But at the very least she was good enough that Voldemort at least once offered her to join him. A muggleborn. She must have made one hell of an impression on him.

************* I recently was reading through PS and Hagrid said that he wondered why Voldemort *didn't* try to recruit Lily and James and alter said they were too close to Dumbledore.

See, I don't want to write Lily the top at everything like 90% of fanfiction makes her out to be. I want her to struggle, and to work hard for her position as head girl. I also want Peter with a personality. I don't want Sirius and James to be idiots like the overwhelming majority of fanfiction makes them, funking every test. And I don't want to portray Snape as a misunderstood angel who Lily wronged in everyway possible. I don't like seeing Lily as a prize to be won. I also hate Remus as a goody two shoes and friends with Lily. I want to switch it around a bit.

I guess I'm planning this fic to defy most tropes and clichés because I honestly don't like them. I don't see Peter as better than Lily in potions, in fact I see it this way: he helps her with charms, she shares tips with him on potions.

Moody only mentioned the names, he never said anything describing the younger ones' powers (Marauders and Lily). On the contrary he did say that Dorcas was killed personally by Voldemort and Edgar Bones was a great wizard. So I plan on writing all of them as joining, confident in their abilities only to be stumped by all these much more skilled and powerful people.

I also see Voldemort approaching Lily and Peter because they're incredibly advanced in potions. I think Lily would be like Tonks in her abilities: able to hold her own, but eventually loses to the likes of Bellatrix. But Peter is someone who works behind the scenes.

************** Like I say, it's your story, but don't claim it as canon without support of canon.

We know that Remus talks very high of Lily. Peter doesn't ever mention her. We know that she has a wand that is excellent for charms so I'm not sure why she would need extra help with it, but fine.

That James and Sirus are stupid or don't do well is of course not true we know that from canon, same with Snape.

We know that Remus doesn't always like what James and Sirius do, but never says anything, but sometimes makes them feel guilty. That doesn't mean he is a goody two shoe of course, he is still a marauder. And Peter was a part of their group and they trusted him, so of course he had a personality that they liked.

JKR once said that one of the times L+J defied Voldemort, was that he offered them to join and they declined.

*************** But I haven't really watched all of the movies, and the part where Remus said she was is in PoA. Just by watching the scene it seemed lien Remus was her best friend or something, talking all about her eyes as though he doesn't know James. I don't like them and never finished them so I don't consider them Canon. I know a lot of people don't but I'm not sure. I'm not claiming it's canon, just how I interpret things.

See, I see her an already 'O' student in Charms as well as Peter in potions, but there are different levels of outstanding (for example, Lily seemed to have an instinct for it so maybe she just /knows/ but Peter was like Hermione in the subject). So charms is Peter's field of interest and potions Lily's.

As for Rowling, that's interesting because Hagrid says he never did, so it must mean that they kept it secret that he asked for them to join. Or the poor guy was just misinformed.

****** I didn't say he was stupid. I specifically said I think he's average to slightly above average. He's never shown doing anything that requires being an excellent student. I also never said he didn't have a decent amount of power, but so does Harry without being near the top of his class. And not every potion is super complicated or difficult to brew. We only see him haphazardly tossing a few things in and then lowering Babymort into it. Successfully following directions doesn't make one a genius.

I don't think there's /any/ canon evidence to support Peter being academically excellent aside from the ambiguous animagus thing.

** Others have said well. Given the tidbits we have seen in the Books, she was definitely more Hermione than Ginny. That's why I think it's quite ridiculous to hate H/G based on some Oedipus excuses. Even the shades of their red hairs were different,

I think lots of readers come from places where red haired people are rare and they automatically associate redheaded women with looking alike. They probably don't know that redheads make up almost 10% of the British population.

** 1) Seems quite likely she'd be closer to Hermione in grades. Supposed to have been excellent in Potions and (I think) Charms (from Ollivander, with regards to her wand's aptitude). It's unclear, but I somewhat doubt James and Sirius were the very top, or at the very least it's highly unlikely either was above Snape in Potions and DADA ("Snape knew more Curses as a first year than most sixth years" comment). If they were below Snape in two classes, short of Snape being crushed in his other classes, it's hard to imagine them being higher (especially given how Snape is described as being very thorough in answering the questions in his OWLs).

2) Lily should be put somewhere near Hermione, but probably a little lower overall. We know of her Potions aptitude and likely Charms, but all else is up in the air. Probably near the top of her class, but she's not that much like Hermione (as far as we know) in terms of being extremely into learning. But we know she had an unusual amount of control over her magic before even having a wand, so she was clearly powerful. But given her knowledge of the sacrificial protection, it can be reasonably inferred that Lily knew quite a bit about some obscure magic.

3) I'd go with CMC and Arithmancy.

4) I'd assume she got E's and O's. Definitely O's in Potions and probably Charms.

5) Well, she'd be like Harry. Dumbledore suggests Harry at base is far more like Lily than James. Perhaps this means Lily was the kind of person who would lay her life on the line to save friends and doesn't take kindly to those who think they're naturally superior to others (not surprising given her being a Muggleborn and what she said to Snape).

6) Don't forget her dropping Snape as a friend and despising James for awhile (for being an arrogant bully). She only gave Snape a chance because of their history, whereas those 2 Marauders seem to have gotten on her shit list early. So friends would be those somewhat like herself: those who don't like bullying or pranking, and aren't full of themselves. Oh and Quidditch prowess didn't seem to impress her much.

7) No clue, just make her average height. :)

This doesn't mean she has to be Dumbledore-level skilled with a wand (she only needs to have read of the possibility of the love protection), nor that the whole thing isn't a testament to her motherly love (whether or not she knew it would magically save Harry, or just did it as a thoughtless act of desperation, she /still/ willingly gave up her life in an attempt to protect her son).

Again, it's nothing certain; I'm more inclined to think it was an accident; but it wouldn't be implausible for her to have "planned" it, nor would it detract from the symbolism in her sacrifice.

*** Concerning James and Sirius, I agree with you that they were not at Lily or Snape level in potion even though I can easily see her at Hermione level since they were able to concoct a very complex potion such as polyjuice potion at a young age.

However the fact that Snape knew more about dark arts in first year is irrelevant, what matters is how they developped trough DADA lessons throughout the years. That's why Hermione who knew more spells than anyone in first year was surpassed by Harry who was particularly talented in the subject once he got a great teacher (Lupin).

Most aren't batting a hundred dementors, or dueling Voldemort or killing the strongest Basilisk with a legendary sword. That's why Hermione wasn't as good as him. Snape was even creating his own spells in school. Those who are good at DADA are good at the Dark Arts, and vice versa (e.g. Harry knew quite a bit of curses, and so was able to execute a Sectumsempra on his first go).

It's very hard to justify saying James or Sirius had something that made them develop faster in the way Harry did, so Snape ought to have been better. Canon might indicate they did if Lupin was right, but it just makes me squint my eyes a bit.

The only extra-lesson Harry got from Lupin was about the Patronus charm, otherwise he was fairly the best student in DADA of the year succeding where Hermione failed. Nothing to do with extra-lesson, he was simply more gifted than her in that area of magic.

James and Sirius lived in an warring era, in a school where some students didn't even hide their intents to join a cult which purpose was to slaughter people. That's imo a good reason to take DADA seriously other than the fact they might have very well be gifted in it just like Harry. After all in the SWM they showed some good jinx such as impedimenta that Harry only learned to prepare the third task in GoF.

It's not about taking it seriously, but about the kind of pressure they faced or didn't face.

  A: Very good question! Because until about halfway through Azkaban, Hermione would have won.

Apart from Quidditch*.

There is nothing about Harry having to faced more danger, he is particularly talented in it just like he is in Quidditch.

Snape was never mentioned as some prodigy in dark arts, he was depicted by Sirius as some kind of odd ball who learned hexes and jinxes when first year should play hide and seek like usual kids. Nothing should have prevented them from filling the gap, once they put their minds in it, as they did throughout their years at Hogwarts.

At the end the only time we saw James facing Snape (after the DADA exams where he and Sirius were sure they would get an O something Hermione wasn't able to), he easily disarmed him and even used his own jinx against him.
