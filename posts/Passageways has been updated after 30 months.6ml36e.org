** Not to be morbid or anything, but her author note kinda makes me think that she's dead set on finishing the story "before she dies"

Maybe that's just me reading in-between the lines incorrectly tho... hope the author is okay.

#+end_quote

Passageways happens to me one of the most popular stories on this sub/FFN and is one of only two "mainstream" Harry/Bellatrix stories that a large majority of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] can stand. It's a bit cliched but it doesn't detract from the story.

**** I've read it (skimmed it), and I'd say it greatly detracts from the story. There's pretty much not a single original thought in the entire story, and almost none of it is done in a new or interesting way at all. Also, popularity =/= quality.

***** True, popularity doesn't always equal quality, but I think it is done in an interesting way.

Of course, it's subjective to the tastes of the reader and one's mileage may vary on what they deem "interesting" or "original".
