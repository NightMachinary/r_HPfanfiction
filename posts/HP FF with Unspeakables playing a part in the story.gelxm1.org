Looking for Harry Potter with ties to Unspeakables. Can be heavy or light involvement. Cannon or completely AU. Preferably action and adventure, but all ffs welcome.

Also, if you want, I would like to hear your favorite descriptions of them (I know I read a story were people could not remember their faces and I thought that was a cool characteristic)

Thanks!

Maybe not exactly what your looking for but its one of my top 3 favorite.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Deep within the Department of Mysteries, a clandestine unit dedicates itself to the destruction of Voldemort's surviving forces in the aftermath of the Wizarding War. This group, lead by Harry Potter, does not officially exist. But for those who fight the darkness that threatens to engulf their world, it has a name, heard only in the shadows: Operation Wrath of Merlin.

** The Lost Son series (apparently called the Paradox of Plurality but that's only on [[http://www.mags-nificent.com/MSW/LF/Paradox.htm][this one site]] which is also the only place it's easy to get to all three pieces) by Lachesis AKA Lakhesis AKA moiraithanatoio. It's brilliant and heartbreaking (and Snarry so skip if you don't care for such).

For some reason, the author never claimed/posted the stories on the moiraithanatoio AO3 account. The first two stories are there under Lachesis thanks to the ISF archivist (The Lost Son linkao3(7866325) and The Ripple Effect linkao3(7876195) ) but not linked as a series and the third story, The Vanishing Twin doesn't seem to be there at all. The three stories are all on the moiraithanatoio LJ account, but with no tags so you have to go searching or know the links to find them. (For the record: 4696 (3 parts), 7147 (5 parts) and 8587 (2 parts).)

** Well you can try Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk where the unspeakables take a much larger role in stopping Voldemort and the Deatheaters.

linkffn(9750991)

You can also try Harry Potter and the Unspeakable Time by DrgnMstr. It's roughly 244K words but regrettably it's abandoned. It's got a squad of unspeakables doing everything they can to stop the dark lord(s)
