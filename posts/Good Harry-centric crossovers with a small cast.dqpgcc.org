I feel like a lot of crossovers shoehorn everyone even remotely imaginable into the plot because the author wants Harry to meet X, Y, Z and so on. And while that can be amusing to some degree, it bloats the story and slows it down considerably. So you end up with fics like "I still haven't found what I'm looking for", which take 350k words for the set-up and mere hints of romance.

So are there any fics where Harry and a small number of characters from the other fandom interact to get shit done? Preferably with Harry (and only Harry) in the other universe.

*No Marvel, no DC.* Preferably no animes either, unless you don't need to know anything about them to follow the fic. If there is a romance, please only Harry/female character from the other universe.


** I wish you luck. I too have been searching for this, without any reward so far. (Although I personally am not fussed by slash relationships)

*** linkffn(10784770) was pretty great in that regard, even if the relationship was kinda meh (had good and bad sides to it). Could have used a bit more narrative focus after getting together.

linkffn(10839027) was ok, although it's Harry and Luna dropped in another world. Pretty cracky and enjoyable, but no Nobel Prize candidate. Although I haven't read the last few chapters yet (the author took a long hiatus).

I don't find a lot of male characters interesting because they feel very stereotypical to me (from a male perspective), which makes them rather boring. And quite a few of the ones I like are interesting due to their canonical het relationships or what it symbolises (eg Anakin Skywalker, James Potter or Edward Tonks). And for others like Moody or the Master Chief, well I am not interested in shipping them with anyone. So I don't really have a shipping pool for male characters. For example, from Harry Potter, there are Harry and Sirius.

  When the true nature of the Veil of Death is finally discovered, Harry and Luna embark on a journey unlike anything they could have possibly imagined. An authorized reimagining of Lightning among the Stars. "f*ck this is good! and fun! I don't want to read the story this is based on because nothing shall distract me from this!" - papiliokaze

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?

  Having a deranged dark wizard after you is not too great. Having something you cannot quite explain after you in a strange world where the kindest fate is to find yourself on the wrong end of a sword makes that first thing seem like child's play. Geralt/Yennefer, Harry/? Rated M. Because there's no other way to write a Witcher story.
