So me and my friend decided to write a Harry Potter Alternate Universe Fanfiction, but we're stuck on how to write it.

Should we do all the years in one book?

Four books, two years per book and a 7th year grand finale?

One book per year like the actual Harry Potter series?

Split the books into two, revolving around lower years (1-4) and higher years (5-7)?

Or something else that we haven't thought of?


** Ask yourself the following question:

When is the latest you can start your narration so that the reader still gets what is going on and what has changed? If you only change a few things in book 2, you can keep that to a chapter or even summarise in a paragraph rather than write 50k words which is just canon paraphrased.

** It depends really, Harry Potter makes sense as 7 books because they are 7 interconnected stories, every one revolving around a plot point.

Think it like this "What is the main conflict of my story?" and "Can the minor conflicts be stories on their own?" if the answer to the second question is "No" then keep it as just one book

** It depends on how long your books are going to be.

500k words for the whole fic covering years 1-7 is great and could stay in 1 fic, but if you have ridiculously long years for some reason or other, then split them depending on length.

*** Maybe, but a 500k word story could be broken down i to two 250k stories or 4 125k stories. If they want to release it all at once rather than regularly posting chapters than splitting it up into multiple stories would be useful; you'd get each story released completed but can release each part quicker.

** I find following the book years tedious. Skip the first few books and go on straight into fifth year or onwards and put your world building into that, try not to infodump, that's a trap, and develop the characters the way you want to.
