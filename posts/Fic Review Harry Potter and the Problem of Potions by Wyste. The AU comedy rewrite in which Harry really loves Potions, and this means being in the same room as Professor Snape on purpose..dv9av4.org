  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.
#+end_quote

This is the direct quote from the AO3 summary for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] (Potions from here on out), as it was such an apt description of the entire premise of the fic that I would be hard pressed to paraphrase it. This is an AU rewrite in which the only point of divergence from the canon is the above quote. The most direct and enduring result of this is that our young and impressionable Harry falls unconditionally and irrevocably in love with Potions.

This is a gen comedy story, with elements of ‘fixing' the canon to have a more positive spin. It's *T-rated* and could comfortably be read by anyone of appropriate age to read the canon books, though some of the jokes might be lost on a younger audience.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
The plot is largely a deep dive into Harry's relationships with Snape and Draco, which he is determined to make positive due to his love of Potions. Snape is Harry's favourite teacher purely by way of being the man who teaches his favourite subject. Harry does his best to at least have a civil relationship with Draco because Draco is better at Potions than Harry is, and Harry wants to get better. Since in this AU Harry has changed his attitude but Snape and Draco have not, setting up and maintaining these relationships is a tremendous task, in which much hilarity (and heart-wrenching angst) ensues.

If we're going to talk strengths and weaknesses though, I'd say plot is the weakest point of Potions. In terms of fanfiction structure, you can sort of take one of three possible roads: You've got canon-complementing stories, extra-canon stories, and AU stories.

I define canon-complementing stories as what you might call “extra rooms” in the canon house. They happen alongside canon events -- usually starring another character, but they can be about Harry -- without deviating from them. The source material largely writes your plot for you and keeps you on track. The challenge lies in creating your own story without breaking the confines of canon. Works like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]].

An extra-canon story is a story which functions in a sequel or prequel capacity. It assumes that all the canon events will happen/did happen, but the plot of the fic itself has little to do with canon events. For these types of stories, you have a future/history to build on, but you're probably in much more of a state of freefall writing the plot itself. Since you're dealing with a point in time which isn't covered by canon, you've got no train tracks to follow to a conclusion. Works like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of their Parts]].

An AU story on the other hand can be anything at all. It has no obligation to follow canon events, canon characterisations, nothing. All the creative freedom to play with the characters and settings lies in the author's hands. Theoretically, this would be the hardest type of fanfiction to do well.

But of course with all three of these types there are blends and sub-types, and the sub-type for Potions is the AU rewrite. Now don't get me wrong -- AU rewrites can be and often are excellent. But if you don't deviate enough from the canon plot, then it can feel lazy because you have all the creative freedom you want, but are also still clinging to the canon plot to pull your story along. It's a slightly different rehash of the story I've already read multiple times, instead of a story I haven't read before.

The Problem of Potions dances this line. It took me a while to figure out why I struggled through some sections, especially through years 1 and 2, because the writing is so strong as to make up for it in large part. Theoretically, the only thing which has changed in this universe is that one line in the premise -- Harry really, really likes Potions. There are of course, other deviations which occur along the way as a result of the first, but they have a surprisingly small impact on how the later books play out, and largely the plot snaps back to canon like an elastic band. The author states in the tags that they're going on the idea that “time is sticky”, but since this is an AU and not a time travel fic I think it could have done with less canon and more AU.

Having said that, as it's technically also something of a parody fic, it's likely that the author would feel that something would be lost if the fic deviated so far from the canon as to no longer be parodying the same events. The balance of what is too much or too little is highly subjective in this respect.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
Potions is largely a parody of the heart-warming variety, and the writing style is light-hearted, clever, and reminiscent of J.K herself. To truncate the seven books into 184k words, many canon scenes are marked by just a line or two then passed over. There are swathes of canonical paragraphs sprinkled here and there for the scenes which aren't passed over, marked with italicization to distinguish from the fan work.

It's done in short(ish) chapter format, which might be anything from half a page long to several pages, but there are 162 chapters in all. It was written in 2017 over the course of about 2 months, which is actually an insane pace to be writing at, and the author's notes confirm that this was being written in real-time, rather than being pre-written and then released.

When you consider the breakneck pace at which they were pumping this out, it's superbly written. The author is a naturally talented writer with great wit and structure, though there is scattered evidence of rushed work. A chunk of chapters spell McGonagall as McGonnegall, there are a few grammatical mistakes here and there (nothing consistent), and particularly as we go through Half-Blood Prince there are continuity errors - Hermione researches horcruxes before Harry finds out what a horcrux is, and Ron and Lavender appear to break up twice -- things like that. In my opinion it's easy enough stuff to clean up, but it's also small enough that it's unlikely to bring the reading experience down.

The humour is definitely what makes this story. It's very British-style comedy (the author is likely British), mostly using deadpan, sarcasm and understatement. Some of it pokes fun at canon events or attitudes and some stands alone. One of the best lines of the opening chapter was:

#+begin_quote
  Snide or not, Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal Potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.
#+end_quote

During the course of his education, Harry manages to make just the right mistakes in the creation of a cleaning solution that he accidentally makes it semi-sentient and names it Kitten. It infuriates Snape because it was a result of carelessness, but is interesting enough that he wants to see if it can be re-created. So they do, on a hair care potion. It succeeds, and immediately latches onto Snape's head like a face-hugger, leaving him with beautiful glossy black locks. I absolutely loved this, and everything to do with Harry's experiments-turned-pet potions.

It's the type of humour which doesn't rely on character bashing, but rather the inherently different world views of its interacting characters (and occasionally just literary slapstick), and comes across as very good-natured.

* Characterisation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: characterisation
  :END:
The humour and the characterisation tie in together as the best and largest part of the fic. Part of what makes Potions stand out so well as a comedy is that Snape is kept so well in character. We see slow burn changes in him over the course of the fic, but they are small, believable and do not significantly change his base personality. You can never truly take the snark out of Snape, and Potions just goes with it so well. Harry instead learns to read nuance into Snape's nastiness, giving us such gems as

#+begin_quote
  Professor Snape's Look 52, 'disapproval with a side of you should have been drowned at birth.'
#+end_quote

But there are other sides of him which we saw glimpses of in canon and are further delved into here, like how surprisingly responsible Snape is for the children in his care, including Harry.

Likewise, Draco is kept fairly close to his canon personality, though less so than Snape. Most of what he does or says in canon he still does in this fic, but there's much more of an undertone of frenemies to his relationship with Harry rather than bone-deep hatred. Again, the difference in Harry means that Harry tries harder to accommodate Draco and see eye to eye with him, and as a result Draco finds himself changing in order to maintain a relationship with Harry. Draco is so central to this re-write that he even has a few chapters dedicated to his POV.

A favourite headcanon of mine is that Slytherins are very susceptible to flattery. When Draco finds out about the dragon in PS, Harry tries to stop Draco from taddling on the trio by saying that given his name, Draco probably has a special bond with dragons and is might even be a dragon animagus. Draco still taddles, but he becomes fixated on the idea of being a dragon animagus, devoting himself to transfiguration and developing a closer relationship with Professor McGonagall in the process. Spoiler -- he does find out his animagus form, and it is cute and adorable and definitely not a dragon.

Ron and Hermione are also kept impressively in-character, but their roles to not significantly deviate from what they did in canon, so they take a backseat in the plot-ride. Harry really ships them though, several times hoping for them to have loads of “curly haired babies” together.

Sirius Black's role is somewhat larger than in canon as well, and we get to see a little more of his parenting techniques, which aren't half so bad as you might think and possibly he's a little more chill than his canon counterpart. He also ships Remus and Tonks together.

Harry is the major player who has changed. Whilst the premise states that the only change is Harry's love of Potions, in fact this Harry comes with quite a different personality to canon as well. He reminds me a little bit of a protagonist in a Charles Dickens novel. He's very sweet, unassuming, people are mean to him but he's still pretty unfailingly nice to them, and a lot of the jokes come from his unwitting innocence. It works really well when portraying Harry at 11, but it's harder to maintain this image of him when he is still very similar at age 17. Again as this is an AU, Harry having a different personality is fair game, but the changes in him are definitely more far-reaching than what the premise describes.

For my part, I quite like this version of him. He's refreshing, he doesn't get bogged down in angst or edgelord fantasies, he's not arrogant or condescending, and while he still maintains that canonical disconnect with acknowledging or articulating his emotions, he's a pleasure to read.

Voldemort also plays a much larger role than in canon. During OotP, Voldemort's connection to Harry becomes so strong that he can drop into Harry's mind unannounced and have conversations with him whenever the whimsy takes him. Given that Harry is 15 and living a 15-year-old's life, this does lead to some great lines. Right after Harry has his first kiss with Cho for example:

#+begin_quote
  /Teenagers. You do realize this is rather distracting?/

  /So's you trying to take over the world. At least mine's fun./

  /I will settle for the United Kingdom. I am not unreasonable./

  /I've never kissed anyone before./
#+end_quote

Aside from some problems that stand out about how Harry realistically couldn't have kept any secrets from the Dark Lord with that level of legilimency, it's a fascinating look into Voldemort's personality, which here is cold but intellectually curious, and chillingly, terrifyingly reasonable (this is also a noticeable departure from canon but is more interesting). Harry has moments where he forgets who Voldemort is and what he's done because with Voldemort literally in his ear there are times when he just seems so normal. There is a conversation between Harry and Ginny that I wish had happened in canon, in which Ginny tells Harry that "the worst thing about him is he's not all bad”, and they both just get it and I get it so achingly well and did I mention this should have been said in canon? I really wish Harry and Ginny had talked about this a lot more.

* The Shipbuilding
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-shipbuilding
  :END:
So the way romance and pairings are done here reminds me a lot of an anime setup, which is to say that there is kind of a slow-burn build up to absolutely nothing. Harry still dates Cho (at least, there are maybe 2 sentences in the whole fic which mention that it happened), and there is a whole lot of set up and avoidance of direct romance thereafter. Harry still has his canon crush on Ginny, but for external reasons they don't date in Half-Blood Prince. There is also some teasing of Harry potentially having more-than-friendly feelings for Draco, but by the end it's highly up to the reader's interpretation if Harry is more likely to pursue Ginny or Draco or neither in the future. I believe the author is intending to write several companion pieces to this work which explore multiple possibilities of where Harry might go from here.

Most of the canon pairings are still around, but oddly enough the romance sub-plot with the most screen time is dedicated to Luna Lovegood/Gregory Goyle. As mad as that sounds, it works surprisingly well in the context of the fic. Points given for selling me on what would normally be a total crack ship.

* TL:DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
This is an easy recommendation to anyone. It's a really fun romp back through the books with a great ton of laughs to carry you through. It has some heavy parts and “fix-it” elements, but these are more good-natured than cynical and the overall feeling throughout is a hopeful one. I feel like it could have benefited from clinging less tightly to canon and by association not having quite as much direct canon text in the story, but I don't think this has too significant an impact on the readers' experience. There is no real sexual content or explicit violence, so it suitable for all ages and probably also enjoyable by most. Most of all, it is probably the most believable and touching redemption story for Snape I've ever read.

This one gets 8.5/10 from me.

Next up on the list for review is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346/chapters/7472102][D.S.S Requirement]] by esama.


** It's an incredibly funny fic, if you like British humour.

For example, this statement caused me to giggle uncontrollably when I first read it:\\
'The trick to having a civil conversation with Draco Malfoy, he thought, was to assume Draco had only a passing relationship with the reality everyone else lived in. The reality Draco lived in meant people relaxed while talking about blood and were offended if someone suggested they weren't a natural born murderer.'

I will warn you not to bother with the sequel. There's a very large plot bomb that is dropped at the very end of /The Problem of Potions/ and unfortunately this bomb forms the backbone of the sequel. I started reading it and dropped it just a handful of chapters in because the premise was completely uninteresting.

** Agreed pretty much 100% with everything in this review, thanks for writing it!

This fic is my ultimate "comfort fic" that I default to when I'm feeling down. I've read the entire thing... 4 or 5 times, probably? It's just got a perfect blend of exactly my type of humour, great characterization (of particular note: Snape, for how close he is to his canon self, and Voldemort, for the exact opposite reason. This is my favourite version of Voldemort - he feels actually scary and less like a cartoon villain.) and some great additions to canon (like Harry and Ginny actually talking about a similar experience they had, I too wish that had happened in the books). Luna and Greg is such a crack ship but it works so well.

And agreed on struggling through the first two years - it does get easier on rereads and they have some amazingly funny lines, but the chapters are very short and glued to canon - they feel somewhat disjointed as a result.

I did not realize that this was written in such a short time, that is actually insane.

** I commend your effort to write up this review. It clearly shows your enthusiasm and willingness to discuss the subject in a dedicated and structured manner. Seeing how this is Reddit for ff and not (enthusiast or) professional literature critique, I'm glad to see this being done at all.

Structurally, I'd say you could try to work on transparency, brevity, and purposefulness. How ship-building doesn't fit into characterisation or what exactly the disjunction of premise and plot is supposed to effect remains unclear to me. In general, plot summaries, especially for reviews, don't want to go into minute details. Cost efficiency in all types of writing -- which include meta discussions -- reign supreme; you should only mention plot elements beyond the general premise that serve to illustrate arguments you're trying to make (stylistics, characteristics, technical writing, etc.). Speaking of those, it is unorthodox and likely fruitless to spend the majority of a review on plot and characterisation, leaving the technical aspects of writing virtually untouched except for a lengthy paragraph about one stylistic characteristic -- its employment of humour.

Now, before you all rip into me, I want to reiterate that I'm grateful this type of post is being done at all. That being said, anything that calls itself review has to strive for more than cursory impressions neatly written down with a catchy little score underneath.

Still, just so we're clear -- I really am grateful for the time you put into this. Thank you.

*** My writing structure for these reviews is evolving with me for sure. You're probably right that I could do with making them more succinct. This is one is a full 500 words shorter than my last one, so I'm working on it, but I do have a habit of getting bogged down in details. Do you think a more standard short-form review would be better to run with? 1000 words or so? Less?

And in what respect do you think I should work on transparency?

In terms of arguments - I'm not going for an essay-style format here where I make an assertion and spend the rest of the review breaking down and backing up that assertion. It's only intended to be more of a gage on the quality of the story broken down by core elements, and yes, subjective to a degree to my impressions.

Sometimes I include 'shipbuilding' details in the characterisation section, but here it didn't feel like a natural segue so I gave it its own section. Mostly I just try to go into what I would want to know about a fic that I was considering reading, or what I would want to hear the opinions of others on with regards to a fic I'd already read.

I am sorry to hear that with the level of detail I go into you still consider this to be a cursory impression though. Perhaps you could provide me links to review examples you believe hit the right level of depth?

**** First of all, thank you for being very mature about your response. I wrote my original post after twelve hours of work yesterday, and I realise now that the tone was definitely a bit off. I apologise for that.

Brevity: I wouldn't go so far as to say that you should aim for a specific word count. At times, you will have more to say; sometimes you won't. That being said, you don't want to spend too much effort on one detail of your review at the cost of neglecting others. In that sense, your review should be well-rounded: For fanfiction, technical aspects, characterisation, narrative techniques, language, plot, and such should all feel like parts of a sum. It's hard to imagine one aspect dominating the others to a degree that the others are safe to be cut entirely -- unless abysmal orthography ruins the entire story or some such maybe.\\
The summary (or premise), however, is in all respects the least important bit of a review.\\
If you struggle with getting lost in details (as I do), I can share a useful technique: after finishing, aim to cut 5-10%. More often than not, you'll end up killing filler words, redundant phrases, or slightly obsolete details. But there's always something to cut -- trust me.

Transparency: I was simply referring to how you offer an overall grade, but it remains arcane how you reach this score if you don't give grades to other elements of your review (like plot).\\
You can stick to this model, but the more common approach would be to either rate every subcategory and thus derive an overall score or don't give a 'score' at all. Words can carry assessments just as well after all.

Subjectivity isn't a problem. All reviews are a matter of opinion, no matter how much professional critics insist otherwise. You should look up correspondences between leading feature writers; it's funny when they tear into one another.

I wasn't trying to say that you need to bother with an argumentative-style essay write-up. Still, logically speaking, presenting examples of humour (as you did in this one) are still arguments of your case. Really, I was just trying to make the case that you should only outline the plot and mention anything else only to illustrate a point.

I suppose the entire ship-thing is a matter of belief: I personally despise judging fics based on ships, and I don't get why people would or wouldn't read something based on characters that in 99% of all the cases don't behave like their canon counterparts anyway.\\
People put so much stock in distinguishing AUs from other types of fanfiction that they forget that ultimately any type of fanfiction is AU by definition (unless it literally retells canon) -- which includes the characters.

I haven't read very many fanfiction reviews, and it wouldn't help to point to a review of some other genre -- which would only miss the target audience and bore us all to death. I could, if you would like me to, write up my own review about one of your next projects (preferably something not overly long as I'm somewhat busy right now), and we could compare notes and see what we like with each review we end up with.\\
Just to put my money where my mouth is.
