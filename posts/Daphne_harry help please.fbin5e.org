:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What fanfiction is the one where Hermione tries and gets harry to fall in love with her, I know she tries love potions and she believes that her and harry belong together like james and lily and because of that she falls into the dark arts, I think that it's a harry and daphne fic but I'm not sure

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
