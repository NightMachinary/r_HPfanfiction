  Harry's ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces.\\

  Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him... If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse... he'd have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching...

I'm more curious to know if it exists more than wanting to read it, but does anyone know a fic where Harry /does/ know how to cast the Cruciatus at that point (maybe fake Moody went into detail about how it was cast), and /does/ use it on Snape then?


** Doubt it.

Remember that the use of an Unforgivable back then was a free ride to Azkaban right away.

and unless we are talking about a really unhinged or DarkPleb Potter its unrealistic to attack Snape with an Unforgivable Curse.

Anyways, the Canon delivers the information on how to cast the Unforgivables aswell as the requirement for the Cruciatus (Bellatrix said you must WANT to cause the pain) in Book 5 while in Book 4 Moody shows the Unforgivables in action - that includes probably the wand movements, if there are any.
