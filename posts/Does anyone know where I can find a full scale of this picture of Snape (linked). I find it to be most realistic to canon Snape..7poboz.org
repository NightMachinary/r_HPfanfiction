#+TITLE: Does anyone know where I can find a full scale of this picture of Snape? (linked). I find it to be most realistic to canon Snape.

*** Haha, that's not that. It sure looks like the Snape from "My life as a background Slytherin".

** Here's the author; [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=/]] He has lots of similar art, of many characters including Severus.

- [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/art/Break-199460398]]

His favorites list has other people's art, with a similar style to the image you are looking for. [[https://vizen.deviantart.com/favourites/]]

However, the specific image you are linking to seems to be a custom job for some other dude, on livejournal. [[https://dhorrible-mod.livejournal.com/]]

Here is the direct link to your image in its fullest form; [[https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/verdeckt/32723798/594/594_640.jpg]]

*** Vizen's "she," not "he." Not a dude. The image was created for the Bring Back the Bastard fest hosted by the Deeply Horrible community, also run by not-a-dude. It was a fairly short-lived community created in reaction to the excess of fluffy, romantic Snapes in fandom. The goal was to encourage fanworks of canon Snape in all his malicious, bitter, grudge-holding, Dark-Arts-loving glory, and Vizen, who is a well-known Snape fan artist, contributed the banner.

***** Pretty good search skills, though - you brought up all the relevant links. I'm just a big Vizen fan. She draws some of the best Snapes in fandom.
