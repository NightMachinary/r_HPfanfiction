Has anyone run across any good Fantastic Beasts Franchise fanfiction? I'm looking for something that closely follows the plot of the movie/s (which I haven't seen yet). I tried reading the released screenplay, but I just can't get into the format and was wondering if anyone had written a sort of novelization of the movies. Thanks~


** there's a very good series rewriting and FIXING much of jkr's issues and plot holes. it's g-rated for the most part but does have multiple ships and romance elements.
