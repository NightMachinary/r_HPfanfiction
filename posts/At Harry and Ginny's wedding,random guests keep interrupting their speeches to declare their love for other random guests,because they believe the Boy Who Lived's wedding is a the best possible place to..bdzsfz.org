** Hmm...well, that gives me a funny and adorable mental image.\\
The Hogwarts dating scene is on a roll; Ron gossips to Dean that he's planning to propose to Hermione on Harry's wedding night, but wait! Neville was planning to do it then for Hannah too! And George is planning it with Angelina, Luna suspects that Rolf's up to the same thing, Cho Chang thinks it'd be romantic too...\\
Notes are compared, eyebrows are raised, and word gets around...

Finally, at the marriage of Harry Potter and Ginerva Weasley, vows are exchanged, husband and wife are pronounced, he does now kiss the bride...\\
And then, almost all of Harry's male school friends stand up (and a few besides); they turn to their partners, simultaneously go down on one knee, and each produces a ring. They choreograph a /synchronised marriage proposal/. With the wedding's musicians kicking into an appropriate love song.

*** Love that !

My own shallow little version of the aftermath;

All stood still in the church. Ginny was looking at the kneeling men and surprised women with a look of pride . Molly eagerly leaned over and began to chatter excitedly with Mrs.Diggerory and Professor Sprout.

Then Parvati Patil,ever the dramatic one trilled " Of course I will ! " before grabbing Dean by the scruff of his collar and pulling him in for a passionate kiss,Lavender and Sally-Anne immediately following suite with Seamus and Ernie.

Never one to be out-done by her sister,Padma also accepted the ring that would make her Padma Corner before pulling Michael over with a force that made him yelp as Terry was assaulted with kisses by Lisa Turpin. Cho beamed at the younger girls before turning back to her Muggle boyfriend and planting a delicate kiss on his lips as she accepted his proposal.

Susan looked at Justin with delirious happiness as Katie and Oliver began to talk about what names to give their children ( Katie swiftly shooting down Ludo ) George and Angelina were in a tight embrace which mirrored the ones of Luna and Rolf and Neville and Hannah

Harry recovered his thoughts and widened his eyes. Hermione was looking at Ron with love in her eyes as she accepted with a heartfelt " I do " Ron whopped with joy " In your face,McLaggen ! "

McLaggen was too busy having his face practically devoured by Romilda Vane to respond

** Twist: they see it coming, so they get married first in a private ceremony in the Chamber of Secrets, and solely use the public marriage as a publicity stunt. Harry gets Malfoy to constantly comment how utterly tacky it is for others to propose because the Boy Who Lived isn't that special anyway. He weaponizes the Malfoy smarm.

** "Do you, Harry James Potter, take Ginerva Molly Weasley to be your lawf---"

"I love you Luna!" cried Neville from the back of the church.

Harry could make out two humanoid shapes making their way out of the wedding, and congratulated Neville in his head.

The priest started again, "Do you, Harry Jam---"

"I love you Harry Potter! Marry me instead! Leave that redhead bitch!" came the shout from a Harry Potter fangirl... Let's call her Karen1.

Hermione's wand was out before everyone else's and Karen1 was bound, stunned, silenced, and glued to the seat in a heartbeat.

Harry gulped. He turned around to see Ginny smiling at him. Shit. He turned to Jesus and prayed for mercy.

The priest stared at everyone in the hall.

And he waited.

And waited.

When no one was saying anything more, he again started the ceremony.

"Do you, Harry James Potter, take Ginerva Moll---"

"YES!" echoed across the church from the third row.

"I /told you/ not to shout Dean. Why would you shout when I whispered my proposal?" asked Seamus.

Dean's cheeks coloured, but then he looked around to see encouraging nods and death stares, and couple wisely decided to leave.

"You dated a poofter? What were you thinking?" Harry asked Ginny in a whisper.

"You're already in trouble, Harry Potter. Best not aggravate me even more."

Harry shut up.

I may continue this in future.

*** I get homophobia was big in the 90s/00s, but Eh. I don't really like seeing the protagonist as a bigot. I see this in some fics and it makes me want to kindly strangle the author and jump ship.
