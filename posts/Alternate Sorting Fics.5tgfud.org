Looking for fics where students are sorted into a different house. Not fics where just one sutdent is in a different house, but where most, if not all, of the class is sorted differently, perhaps due to the Sorting Hat changing the way it sorts. Either with Harry's year or the Marauder's year.

Edit: Sorry, forgot to mention this, but preferably chaptered fics, not one-shots. Thanks anyways for the one-shots that were already recommended though.


** [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html][Switch]] - A prank by Fred and George confuses the Sorting Hat, resulting in house mismatches. It's a series that only goes up to part of 3rd year, but it's worth a read.

** Here is a one shot that is complete crack: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7050721/1/The-Sorting-That-Never-Happened]]

There is also a great series on Livejournal that I lost the link, but maybe someone has? Fred and George Confund the hat something fierce and it goes nuts. Ron and Pansy in Ravenclaw, Neville and Hermione in Slytherin, Crabbe and Goyle in Gryffindor, and Harry and Draco in Hufflepuff. I remember it being a lot of fun and sticking to the main story points pretty well!

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.
