  "Wow, so that vial right there holds enough to either give the strength of a giant or kill me, with no way to tell which in advance for only 32 galleons, but it's illegal to sell?"

  "You've got it kid," the clerk, Stanley Price said amused and wondered if the kid was brave enough to break the law and buy it; not to mention crazy enough to drink it. Not that he'd let him of course. He'd bought the vial to be considered enough in the trade for the locals to trust him.

  Harry counted out 35 galleons into a small pouch and tied it closed before flinging it behind the counter and yelling, "Spider!"

  When Stanley turned back around he found that Harry had already snatched up the vial. "I'm sorry for killing what was doubtlessly a valuable pet, keep the gold as compensation. I'm taking this, if you don't mind, because you know how tempting money can be and I don't want such a nice man as yourself to get arrested for selling it. In fact I better dispose of it before the temptation to sell it hits me too."

  Stanley watched in shock as Harry downed the entire vial in one shot.

  "Damn, that was salty!" he said making a face and scraping his tongue against his teeth.

  Stanley pulled up his sleeve and looked at his watch and then back at Harry.

  "What are you doing?" Harry asked curiously.

  "Seeing if you die or not, the longer you last the more likely you are to live," Stanley explained, trying to cover his shock and keep his tough as nails rep intact, while inwardly praying the boy would be okay.

  "Cool!" Harry said with an easy smile; he was sure being in the center of a fairy tale meant he wouldn't die unless it was in the middle of a battle with whoever the bad guy in his story was.

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

** Yes, I'm making two posts. That lets me put a quote from each story in my recommendation. :)

This one is for Adventures in Magick by Pseudonymous Entity. Also unfinished (all my favorites are. *Sigh*) linkffn(11671069)

  Harry stopped trying to get back to the unknown Muggle-born when he saw the moving carriages drawn by nothing. Unfortunately he was three steps that way when a twin scooped him up again and pointed him in the other direction.

  “Boats, Harry.”

  A sign said Forbidden Forest. Harry made for it.

  A twin once again picked him up. “Harry, you're never going to make it to class if you don't get to school. You need to get in the boats so you can---”

  “Aw Fred,” Harry whined, “I just want to have a look! There are so many interesting things; I can't help it.” The arms around Harry stiffened. Harry squirmed around in Fred's grasp to look up at him. The boy examined Harry without blinking. “Um, George I think I broke your... brother.” He trailed off. To the left George stood, examining Harry in much the same way. The little wizard squirmed and turned around entirely, wrapping his legs around the taller boy as he did. Fred was frozen at the moment and Harry didn't fancy falling and tumbling down the hill into the lake below. He couldn't swim. Harry reached out a finger and poked the boy's cheek. “Fred?”

  And then he was suddenly squeezed tightly. George joined in from behind after a moment. Harry squeaked in surprise. A few minutes later he said. “Oh look. Remember those boats you were talking about? They're leaving without me.” And they were. “Bye, boats.” He waved.
