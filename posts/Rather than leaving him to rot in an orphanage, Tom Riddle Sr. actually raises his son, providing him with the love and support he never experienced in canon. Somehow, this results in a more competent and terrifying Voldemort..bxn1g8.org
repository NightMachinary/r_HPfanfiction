** lol, seeing how cartoonishly overplayed Voldemort is in canon and fanon - always with a hairtrigger temper, sending people on murder sprees and torturing whoever catches his fancy - an actually scary Voldemort would be one that's not like anything we've seen so far.

I imagine a charming and intelligent guy, like he was in school, who has no trouble rising in politics and other areas of society to consolidate his power and control. He probably wouldn't even bother with the blood purity thing, although he would likely appeal to those (and other traditionalist) sentiments more strongly.

Essentially, a kind of wizard version of Moriarty, an unscrupulous and amoral individual keeping his darker activities and psychopathy in the shadows.

I can actually see a cool story, where Aberforth ends up as the Sherlock to Voldemort's Moriarty ;)

Although, on second thought, the age difference might still be a bit tough to work with, and I think the personality of Remus is a better analogue to that of Dr. Watson; perhaps Remus was actually allowed to join the Auror Corp with his friends, and went the route of healer in the hopes of curing lycanthropy, up until friends died in some battle.

This would scratch off the boxes of him being a combat veteran and a medic quite nicely, while also having him revolve around the (presumably) strong personality and character of Aberforth.

  Andromeda or Tonks maybe?
#+end_quote

I suppose it depends if we're sticking closer to the Sherlock books, or the modern series/movies:

If it's the first, Tonks would be a decent choice;

#+begin_quote
  . . . describes her as "a well-known adventuress" (a term widely used at the time in ambiguous association with "[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesan][courtesan]]"[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Adler#cite_note-2][[2]]][[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Adler#cite_note-bed-3][[3]]]) and also says that she had "the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men". She also claims to have been trained as an actress and "often" disguised herself as a man to "take advantage of the freedom which it gives".
#+end_quote

This would fit neatly with her metamorph ability and personality, however, using her metamorph ability to replace skill in disguise might be seen as a cop out.

If we're talking about the series or movies, however - and I feel her character is similar enough in both - I'll have to voice a different opinion here. I think neither would work as an Irene Adler if the other is alive. Remember, Irene Adler was an opportunistic criminal, without mother or significant other, a woman that used her feminine wiles and sexual prowess to gain advantage.

I think, in this case, Bellatrix would be perfect, and could be woven into a story where she is blackmailed and threatened into the service of Voldemort (Moriarty)! Just like in the movies and the series.

******** I didn't even think of Bellatrix. We can assume in setting what with Tom bring raised by a Muggle the Death Eaters wouldn't appear, or at least not in a blood purist form. With Bellatrix being a traditional Black it was probably the blood purism that drew her in, even if not directly, so she probably wouldn't have joined Tom early, allowing for time to build up into an Adler figure.

In terms of Tonk's metamorphagus ability taking from her disguise ability you could probably follow the route of disguise not being a wholly appearance based art. To really Be someone else you'd need to have the appearance yes but also the tone, gait and body language. You'd have to know what they'd know and not know what they wouldn't. You'd have filter everything past a veil of them to respond correctly yet still hold firm to your own identity so as not to get lost. I'd say that would be the difference between a skilled impersonator who could last long term, like Barty Crouch Jr, and someone who's just taken a glug of polyjuice.

********* And another thought im favor of Aberforth playing Sherlock; with so much of his history unknown (i.e., what did he do before the bar?) there's plenty of room without needing to touch much of canon into giving him the obscure knowledge, perspectives, and vices of Sherlock. And if we say that he ran a bar for some time, that would let him make his own contacts with those of the "lower class" like classic Sherlock did, where he had a network of beggar informants, in addition to encountering curious cases :)

On that note, who would be a good Inspector Lestrade?

I'm thinking Rufus Scrimgour, perhaps? He'd fit the persona of a formal, dutiful Auror in some position of authority with ambition to climb higher, but who is nonetheless a two-dimensional thinker unable to solve truly complex cases and must involve Aberforth (Sherlock) despite his distaste.

The bar would certainly be good way to explain the baker Street irregulars and a sort of message board case delivery system would work too.

On Mrs Hudson my mind automatically jumps to the motherly Molly Weasley but other than that trait nothing else about her really seems to fit. I suppose Pomona sprout also has a chance but I'm really drawn to the idea of Mrs Hudson being a matronly and slightly overbearing house-elf.

The best I could think of is Bathilda Bagshot, but I feel like what we know of her as an accomplished historian probably wouldn't fit unassuming character of Mrs. Hudson.

Molly would work well, but then there'd be the greater problem of her family.

Perhaps, some sluething could be done, and she could be an older Molly Prewitt, which would come at the cost of removing the other canon Weasley character (except for Arthur). If she's left, but they're alive, it's too confusing and cluttered no matter how you slice it.

I expect that instead of Death Eaters, you would have a wide network of those cajoled, threatened, and bribed by Voldemort (Moriarty) into following his bidding. This would include people of influence and heritage, as well as common people, and even beggars and common street thugs like Mundugus.

The fic above sort of touches on something like it but without a foil in the form of a Sherlock and with the sort of Gary Stu-esque nature of it it kind of veers off a bit. Still the closest I've seen written.

I can really see Tom building up his web slowly, beginning to take in consulting work even through school before spreading out after. Maybe he has Muggle experience, it never really says where the Riddle fortune comes from. I can certainly see him taking up the defence professorship or something similar in a mirror to Moriarty's role as a Mathematics Professor.

The idea of Tom taking up a professorship is perfect, actually! Maybe he was sorted into Ravenclaw (if you subscribe to the idea that real Slytherins aren't sorted into Slytherin), and instead took professorship of ancient runes.

In this case, though, having Albus be in such close proximity might be a bit problematic; perhaps some more tweaking would serve purpose, if we make Albus' domain be solely that of the Wizengamot and ICW. Which would rather better suit canon Mycroft, I think...

Adding in magic, or moving the time, doesn't change anything about what made the characters and adventures appealing, so long as they stay true to form and are put in the same situations.

Randomly gender-bending someone for absolutely no reason serves no purpose, and takes away from what we've tried to do in these threads; find analogue character and see how they would fit in the Sherlock formula.

By your logic, why not make Sherlock and Moriarty women, and make Adler a man as well? Sherlock can be Daphne! Moriarty can be McGonagall! Nothing would change!

The dynamics of two women interacting are for sure the same as two men! And everyone knows that women have the same cognitive structure - motivations, desires, aspirations - and physical capabilities as men!

I mean, what we do know about Aberforth?

- He's not as brilliant as his brother(which doesn't mean necessarily that he's not intelligent, just that he's not a genius like Albus).
- His sister Ariana got along with him better than with Albus
- He is */incredibly/* resentful towards Albus because of what happened with Ariana(and justifiably so, IMHO)
- He's the barman at the Hog's Head.
- He has a certain fondness for goats.

That's literally it. We know so little about him that with could fill it in easily with almost anything you wanted even within canon, much less in an AU like this.

Sherlock himself once admitted to Watson that his own deductive and analytical abilities, incredibly developed as they are, pale in comparison to Mycroft's. However, Sherlock is a very active individual when he's on a case, whereas Mycroft has a much more passive disposition.

I could easily see a scenario work in which both brothers are highly intelligent, with Albus being moreso than Aberforth, but whereas Albus channels his talents into politics and the training of young minds, Aberforth decides to go into criminal justice as a more directly-active Sherlock Holmes type, or perhaps as an Auror.
