Does anyone remember the fan fiction where Harry grows up in America and forced to return to Britain because of the triwizard tournament?

I think one of the opening scenes is Harry landing in the middle of the great hall with a motorcycle?

Thanks!

"The entire British magical economy."

** There is also definitely one where Harry and a friend get summoned into the great Hall on a pair of motorcycles. Can't remember the name or author though.

**** Pretty sure it was FFN.

Did another look on google, it may have been linkffn(5856625), and I'm mis-remembering the other details...
