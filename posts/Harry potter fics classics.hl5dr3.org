Since it's quarantine, I've been wanting to re-read harry potter fics classics or like the must-reas harry potter fics. Preferably long (100k+) and have good grammar. Slash is ok.

I've re-read basillik born, poison pen, harry potter and the prince of slytherin, harry potter and the methods of rationality, harry crow, harry potter: junior inquisitor, c'est la vie, full circle and prob a lot more.

Tysm!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I absolutely love this series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]]

There are some typos but in general it's brilliantly written and the characters are so vibrant and rich. Fair warning characters are more inspired by cannon then based off them though.

** Wow, that list is pretty hardcore. I'm trying to make myself read all of Harry Crow just so I can say I did and so I can properly evaluate it, but I'm struggling to stay motivated.

The classic Peggy Sue fic that comes to mind is Nightmares of Futures Past, though it's still incomplete (not abandoned!). Best place to read it is the PDF version on [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][GitHub]]; nowhere else has chapter 43. Harry beats Voldemort, but everyone else is dead, so he sends his soul back nineteen years to try again. Features him building up his friends and preparing them, which I always enjoy rereading.

And linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) is definitely a classic, giving the full life and times of Severus Snape, from his mother's pregnancy to his death. His perspective on canon is just a fraction of it. I quite like the alternate ending, too, linkffn(Miles to Go Before I Sleep by rannaro), where he survives and goes on to help round up the remaining Death Eaters and have a chance at a peaceful life.

#+begin_quote
  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  “Your robes are...red,” Hermione finally said, strangely accusing. “Burgundy!” Severus protested. Red was tacky. Burgundy, however, had class.“And what did you do to your hair?” she asked in horrified fascination.Snape's hand rose to his scalp. “Nothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...”“Ah, I see.” She nodded and stepped back. “Alternate dimension. It must be.”

** I you have Wattpad, then Tightly Knit by KMbell92 is really great. Warning: don't read the comments, there are always spoilers for some reason. Also, she has another series set in that AU, you can check out the reading guide on the bio to find out which to read first.

Another good fic is linkao3(be the light in my lantern by starfishstar). It's a Remus/Tonks series, set in OotP I think.
