So let's discuss this shall we? I am very much against making my Harry Potter character obscenely rich, but I do see the logic in it being worth a lot of money.

This is what I am able to gather from canon:

- A basilisk is very rarely killed
- Basilisk venom is highly valuable
- Basilisk hide is spell resistant

This of course means it is worth a lot based on those three facts.

Now what I /assume/ and work with in my story is this:

- Basilisk hide can be sold for armor, etc. because of it's properties. It is however not as valuable as dragon hide/scale because it is much heavier and therefore seen as a cheaper alternative.

- Slytherin's basilisk is worth more because it is associated with a famous wizard. This will greatly increase the price of things, such as bones as they will be made into trophies, cutlery, cups etc.

We are dealing with a snake that is about *60 feet long*. Does anyone know (a logical guess based on other snakes) how much venom such a thing would have in it, and how much hide you would skin of it?


** The intact hide is no doubt worth much more than a shed skin. A molt is the sloughing of dead and broken scales, whereas the living skin is the 'good stuff'.

The venom doesn't have to be voluminous to be deadly. What the story gets wrong is that most venomous snakes only inject with the two hollow fangs- the rest of the teeth are for keeping the prey from slipping away.

As the raising of younger Basilisks is a simple if risky business, the venom probably isn't too valuable. Unicorn blood would be much more valuable. You might suggest in your story that very old Basilisks have much more potent venom, but it isn't like Harry died the second he was poisoned. It took enough time that Fawkes could work up some tears to heal him. What makes Basilisk venom so awesome is that phoenix tears are the ONLY treatment.

Probably the most valuable component of the Basilisk is its eyes, since most breeders would have them removed for safety's sake and adventurers fighting one in the wild wouldn't likely survive if the eyes were still functioning.

I've used the idea that a very old Basilisk's eyelashes would be magical enough to function as a cut-rate wand core. Snakes don't normally have eyelashes, but they don't usually have the power to petrify or kill with a look, either.

King cobra's can grow to 20 feet long, but they're still only as thick as a fat loaf of bread. This is relevant because the amount of harvest-able skin depends on both length and circumference. If you treat the Basilisk like the CoS movie - a monster that can swallow a caribou - the circumference might be 15 feet (diameter of ~ 5 feet; 2 x Pi x Radius, right?). A more reasonable mutated Anaconda size might only have a circumference of 6 feet (diameter of 2 feet). Translate that into sq. yards of 'fabric' and compare to premium leather for value.

Or is this too much math for fanfiction?

*** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanoboa][Titanoboa]] was the largest prehistoric snake, growing to 50 feet length and weighing about 2500 pounds. This might be a better analogue to the CoS Basilisk for your estimates.

Edit: 2500 pounds means around 1.2x10^{6} cm^{3} volume. The length is 1.5x10^{3} cm, so this works out to a snake diameter of about 32 cm, or around 100 cm circumference.

**** By description, the basilisk that Harry killed was 'thick as an oak trunk', so I'd stick with the 2-3 foot diameter (6 - 9 foot girth). The Titanboa is awesome to hear about, though, and I love that there's a group building a mechanical one.

** In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Basilisk is given a "Known Wizard Killer / Impossible to Train or Domesticate" classification by the Ministry of Magic. They are created by hatching a chicken egg beneath a toad, so they are more than likely easy to get, however I would think that the Ministry would definitely ban them. In fact, in the book, "creation of Basilisks has been illegal since medieval times, although the practice is easily concealed by simply removing the chicken egg from beneath the toad when the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures comes to call."

So I would say that a black market trader would definitely require quite an arm and a leg for the thing.

*** As for the skin/hide, the basilisk "may reach up to fifty feet in length. The male has a scarlet plume upon its head. It has exceptionally venomous fangs..."

The book also says that they are believed to live for hundreds of years. That's quite a bit of snake shedding and venom producing. I'm guessing if your character could use the shedded skin and somehow "milk" the snake, you'd be just fine with selling them

** There are some things we can compare it to. For instance, Basilisk venom is pretty similar to a super acid, so look up how much H2F:SbF6 costs for the amount of venom we're considering (the NSA will instantly put you on a watchlist) and convert that into galleons.

For the scales do the same with carbon nanotubes or some other highly resilient substance (you're definately on a watchlist by now, if you weren't from the acid).

For the skeleton, use the going rate for dinosaur fossils and you'll get a pretty good figure for what wizards would pay for the bones of Slytherins basilisk (The NSA is now wondering what the hell you're planning).

For the organs, do this with the price of human organs for transplants of the same total weight as that of the basilisks organs (expect a knock on your door in the next two hours).

All in all, expect it to be worth several billion pounds, so yeah. Harry will probably be obscenely rich if you do this.

EDIT: H2F:SbF6, not HF:SbF6

*** Had a right laugh reading this, thank you. :)

Several billion pounds.. lovely, and here I wanted money to be something he actually have to think about when using. And with all your warnings I really don't want to look the pricings up O.o

** Why are basilisk parts so rare? I mean, sure, its dangerous, but so are dragons. Basilisks can be created almost by anyone (use a sticking charm on the egg and the frog). It could be grown in a cave or a reinforced building, away from people. It can be fed by dropping animals from a door in the ceiling of the cage, with no need to look in. (one can make this extra safe, by using two sets of doors - like an airlock). And at last, it could be killed by having a cock crow, again, with no need for it to be in the same room.

If wizards manage to /farm/ dragon parts (for gloves for goddamned first years) than it should be even easier to farm basilisk parts.

** This is addressed pretty well (IMO) in the fic Harry potter and the nightmares of futures past, as Slughorn helps Harry and friends auction off collected pieces of the basilisk through his many contacts. It does not specify the amount everything sold for, but the bidding war raised enough money to make Harry Ron hermione luna and Neville quite wealthy, even after slughorn's cut
