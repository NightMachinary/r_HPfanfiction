  "Let's cut the bullshit..." interjected Kingsley "You are here representing SHIELD a quasi military intelligence organisation that is so suspect that I wouldn't touch it with a six foot broomstick under normal circumstances..." An international magic/muggle operation sets an unlikely couple on a desperate race to keep an ancient source of terrible power out of the hands of HYDRA.

**** I don't remember there being much of what I'd consider bashing. Nobody is portrayed as stupid for the sole purpose of allowing them to bear the brunt of insults and jokes, at least, although Dumbledore is portrayed as convinced of his own inerrancy and potentially senile. Nothing gratuitous, though, as far as I'm concerned.
