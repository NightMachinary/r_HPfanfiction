The title says it all, I think. What makes a good dueling/fight scene in your opinion? What makes one more interesting than another?

*Spells etc.:* A great variation of spells? Creative use of a few ones? Should there be physical combat? Dodging?

*Dialogue:* Should the opponents talk to each other during the fight? Shout insults?

*Character:* Should the hero/villain (the POV we see) have an obvious weakness? Should he nearly lose before he wins?

*Length:* How long is the ideal dueling scene?

What makes a dueling scene realistic? What more exciting?

Why do you like / dislike reading dueling scenes?

I'm sure I haven't covered everything with my questions, so if you can think of anything else, I'm interested.

Obviously there is no right or wrong, just different opinions.

*** Also your protagonist has to lose at least one if not two battles. Make them retreat in agony. Have them be wiped and saved only because the antagonist was forced to retreat by arrival of reinforcements. Injure them and their friends, Let one or two be killed.

I'm rereading A Black Comedy for the dozenth time and I really like the battle with Voldemort because even though we know Harry's going to win just by the fact that it is more crack than not, it gets really close: both Harry and Sirius have the absolute shit beat out of them, and Harry's wand is exploded. Harry only wins because he had a backup weapon and that almost failed him too. On top of that, they are immediately forced to face an inquiry at the Ministry, a negative consequence of the battle, AND Voldemort wasn't even killed. He was back in action within hours.

** Realism is very important for me. Real fights aren't clean, especially with cutting spells involved, blood, guts, viscera, screaming, panic. If transfiguration is involved not everyone is a master like Dumbledore, half-finished transfigurations should be a thing, a half-lion half-table, dragging itself towards the enemy. Combatants holding in their intestines begging for their mothers, friendly fire from spells cast out of desperation, shrapnel kills more people than direct fire in real combat, would be the same thing especially from /Reducto/ spells.

If you want to get really graphic, use spells that boil the victims blood, melt them like the nazi's from Raiders of the Lost Ark, skeletons ripping themselves out of the victims body, spells that liquefy organs, eyeballs, shrivel skin like a dried fruit.

** Others have already made some excellent points. I would also say to be careful with pacing. Remember that the character is in the moment. This is not the time for an inner monologue, long death scenes, or long descriptions.

People should injure themselves or even die in really unglamorous ways. I don't like it when people come out of fights completely unscathed, they should be a bit banged up and a little dirty.

** To start I would say avoid if possible the wand-gun problem of 'he was running low on energy and every spell his shield took meant another he couldn't cast.' ie. it is guns, ammo, cover but magic without the feel of said magic. Physically tiring is good but not magically exhausting.

Having read the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore fight fairly recently I would say this- that the greater the wizard the greater the ingenuity and variance. The most important I think is that each spell/action is accomplishing multiple things. Such as breaking the spell cast on them and turning that into an offensive weapon while moving into their next step. They are always thinking steps ahead but can adapt. This doesn't necessarily mean they know /that/ many more spells (they do but not to the point where all their power comes from having memorized a million), rather it is their use. ex. We don't know if the silver shield conjured is a) a purely magic shield such as protego, b) if it is a purely physical shield and if so whether it is pure silver or alloy etc. c) whether it is a combination- having been conjured and then imbued with protection etc. I think the potency of the masters is getting more out of a simple spell, using it in inventive ways, and knowing it so well and working it until it can do extraordinary things.

Don't go on too long, often the information not said but only hinted at is all the more powerful. Going into blow by blow can just make it a slog to read whether it is knife-stab, knife-stab or amazing ancient sumerian death magic with wand-incantation, wand-incantation. At the same time while I agree realism is good and messy is good I would word it a different way. Consequences are good, even with magic- permanently scarred, sickened, after effects. Or given magics amazing healing possibilities make it matter such that the timing of events means getting injured here, even if mended within hours/days, means for example a critical team member being unavailable just when the info comes in on an important limited time event. Also I would say that describing the effects of the magic in a real way is good (melting flesh etc.) but when writing I think you have to keep a focus so that the reader knows what is happening. ie. in a magic fight a bit here or there to round out and make it feel like so much else is happening, and it is chaos is good. Actually going into detail about every engagement and result is too much imo. Rather keep it on Harry/POV character and then notice bits here and there while having the mass be immediate to him and his situation and goals. Which is another thing- fights for fights sake I wouldn't recommend. Even if a very talented writer the fight should be about more than the fight (it should be hero and goal-preferably as part of their overall goal- and then someone else, with their own goal, in his way). ex. for me at least look at Star Wars IV-VI: choreography not the best but there is so much more going on (father vs son, using anger to wail on vader, realization and seeing his robotic hand etc.) which I find infinitely more riveting than the shallower lengthy pristine choreography found in Episodes I-III.

edit- Also joins with overall writing but keep power balance in check. I heard Jim Butcher say that the protagonist should just have enough to survive- Like if you are a super advanced space marine with amazing tech and then are told that no soldier has all they want but just enough to maybe get by... well the point is no matter how awesome and powerful you get there should be other built up that are opposing him (to offer a real challenge and occasional setback).

PS This got me thinking back about a good write up Taure did on Horcruxes and their invulnerability being due to charms/magic applied and not because of the soul itself/being a horcrux. This leads me to the point that if he can make a muggle paper diary, magic metal receptacles, and (iirc?) a live snake impervious to everything we know about bar Fiendfyre and Basilisk venom then did he do this to his own robe as well? (or himself in the dark rituals) or did Dumbledore to his own wardrobe? is that why Avada Kedavra is used so often and spells of such power that clang and reverberate of the shield Voldemort summoned are required? is this something that's been addressed before? I know it doesn't take much to break the Potter world but even if Voldemort was selfish enough you'd think if this were possible Dumbledore would make up a set of holy underwear for his OotP members :P Could be interesting anyway such that certain spells like the Dark Arts and great ingenuity in spell usage are required.

** Any magical battle outside of Hogwarts shouldn't involve spoken incantations, unless it's an Unforgivable Curse. Even those don't require it, but their use is often a game-changing moment, so speaking the spell is meant to intimidate the victim (and tell the reader 'we've just upped the ante').

Battles with mooks should leverage the spells we've seen- it bugs me sometimes when authors present 'adult' combat as not using the spells taught at Hogwarts. I admit that there must be more out there, but the foundation spells are taught because of their effectiveness- either from speed of casting or overall 'this is the best tool for the job'. Stunners were very effective during the battle in the Department of Mysteries- the mistake Harry and friends made was in not following through with a more permanent defeat for the stunned opponents.

That said, the battles with Big Bads should involve less blasters and more 'warp our local reality', as each of the major combatants attempts to surprise their opponents enough to unsettle them, then finish them off with the usual attack spells: Stun, Bind, Convert/Possess, Incapacitate or Kill.

Pacing is the biggest thing- you can't get wordy with the descriptions. It's better to use short actions during the firefight, followed by slow creeping and sneaking in the lull- that's when you get descriptive, because the viewpoint character has more time to take in these sorts of details.

EDIT: One more thought- any wizard with a wand and reasonable experience will defend against most spells unless they don't realize they're being attacked or the spell is too obscure- in which case their instinct should be to shield and/or shuffle off to a safer cover. A muggle can't resist the effects of spells, but wizards can, and if they're expecting a fight, they'll be ready with pre-made charms and a couple spells they know well.

** Avoid these:

- excessive details about each and every spell cast.
- no longer than one page if you want a longer one have some break in between.
- uncertainty who will win. One sided super duper harry smashing Voldie is boring.
- don't treat unforgivables like throwing candy aroundd.
- spells & magic that are beyond character's abilities

** A sense of being inside your protagonist when they're fighting - a sense of realism with regard to what they're feeling and thinking, and a feeling that you know now exactly what it would be like. That's one of the things that is most important to me in any fic.

** There are several aspects that you have to pay attention to:

The environment they are fighting in. Is it cramped, open, cluttered or clear? Is it outside or inside? Are there spectators, extra participants or is it a one-on-one thing?

The fighting style they employ. Are wands their primary duelling tools? Do they carry or use any other potential weapons? What about their strategy-in close or at range? How does this reflect on the tactics they employ in their chosen environment? What about what spells they use?

Ah yes, the spells. AOE or targeted? Fast or slow? Incantations or silent? Direct or indirect targeting? Defensive or offensive? Accurate or sloppy? Spellchain or individual? Dodging, shielding or taking cover? Honorable or dirty?

Then there's the pacing to consider as well.
