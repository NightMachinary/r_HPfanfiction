The majority of those reading these are aware of the unusually popular Harry x Daphne Greengrass. I want to see if there are any fics that have Harry Potter paired with the other greengrass, Astoria, i am talking about the one who Draco Malfoy married in canon.

Please any fics with Harry x Astoria, only thing is no harem, or threesome, longer the better, thank you!


** ...It kinda makes me want to see a fic where Harry hooks up with a disowned third sister (maybe a squib or werewolf older than Daphne by a year or something).

Hmm...

Queenie Greengrass (to reuse a name from JKR's notes) was Astoria and Daphne's older sister. She was either a squib and disowned/shipped off somewhere or became infected with lycanthropy and disowned.

Harry hooks up with her by chance, not knowing her history. When it comes out they're dating, suddenly the family wants Queenie back for the prestige of the "Boy-Who-Lived" maybe marrying into their family, or they try to pawn Daphne off on him as she's a "younger model" not burdened by being a werewolf or is magical/not a "useless squib".

She tells them to kick rocks, naturally, and Harry supports her.

Astoria would be confused and a little horrified: she never knew she had an older sister.

Daphne could have many routes:

- She could be on board with 'replacing' her older sister for Harry
- She could be against it, and be horrified
- Either way, she may or may not have known about her existence
- Maybe she only had vague memories of her and thought she'd been mistaken
- She could be supportive of Queenie's relationship
- She could be against it, not seeing why Harry would want to date someone like her, but have nothing against her older sister herself
- Envious, as she always had a thing for Harry at a distance

Et cetera.

** These are one-shots but still good!

linkffn(High Hopes by ShayaLonnie)

Summary kinda speaks for itself but you've probably heard of ShayaLonnie. They have many, many highly rated fics for the HPfandom. Sad that this one doesn't get as much love.

linkffn(Heterochromic by Webdog177)

This is NOT a harem! I know it says that but it is NOT. Not conventionally anyway, there aren't any scenes were Daphne and Harry even get along. I assure this is purely just Harry x Astoria... Just read this masterpiece to understand. This is the fix that made me greatly appreciate this pairing even if both Greengrass sisters are blank slates for fanfic writers.

Of Course there's also linkao3(Vow of Control) which just don't. If your in the mood for smut, smut, and more raunchy smut. Then here, but it does bridge into harem-ish (Harry having sex with other females). The idea of it is actually pretty good but the author (I want to say MayorHaggor) clearly just wanted to write a dom Harry. So, um, sorry useless rec. Teehee.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.
