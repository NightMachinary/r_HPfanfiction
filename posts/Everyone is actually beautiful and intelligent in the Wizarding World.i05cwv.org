Because of their incredible advancement in healing and potions, every wizard and witch is unnaturally beautiful and neigh-genius. And such procedures alter their genetic code, where the parents could pass their gifts onto their children.

The muggles are looked down upon because of their unrecognized beauty and lesser intellect, and also obviously because they're muggleborns. And this causes many muggleborn children to get their treatment from a registered establishment later on in life.

Harry, because of his pureblood father with generations of alternations, and a muggleborn mother, allowed for him gain the gifts of both being a genius and androgynously beautiful.


** It could work in an AU if you were to explore it, but I think the canon wizarding world prefers that magical people blend in. There are also many examples in literature and legend of seemingly beautiful things being used as lures by nasty creatures, such that the average wizard is taught to distrust too-attractive people.

** *Everyone who has the skill or the money to produce or buy the potions is beautiful.

Which is why ugly and dumb people are poor or Muggleborns. Most likely both.

Of course lolracist, but I like it. Lots of conflict to explore. Also, obvious mention of Lords of Magic by [[/u/Taure]].

** Obviously it's not the case that everyone in the wizarding world is young and beautiful, even though they have human transfiguration which we know is (i) permanent and (ii) a real physical change and (iii) used by healers to heal people.

It's interesting to explore why this is the case, I think. The go-to explanation in such circumstances is generally the difficulty of the magic concerned, but I don't think that cuts it in this case, because surely those wizards who are sufficiently talented would set-up shop selling their beautification and youthification services to the general public for a healthy fee.

So I think there needs to be a magical reason why it doesn't occur. This is what I went with in VP:

  In the end, it was a good thing that Victoria hadn't tried to attend her classes. Her symptoms only got worse, and Madam Pomfrey was forced to maintain a roaring fire in the hospital wing just to keep her warm. She was on a strict regimen of potions to help manage her symptoms, but as Pomfrey explained, she would have to get better all on her own.

  "Your magic will fight it off, with a bit of rest," she said. "The body of a witch or wizard doesn't much like being transfigured, you see. The disease is trying to turn your bones to stone, but your magic will turn them back faster. When no stone remains, you'll be free to go."

  The days wore on, and Victoria began to worry about all the classes she was missing. She wasn't allowed any visitors, nor would Madam Pomfrey permit homework to be delivered to her. Her wand, finally released by Joseph Deverill, sat unused on her bedside table. She wasn't even allowed to read, except for three all-too-short hours each afternoon.

  Her every moment was spent surrounded by white beds, white ceilings and white walls. Contemplating the nature of her illness was the only thing that kept her occupied: she wondered whether being a metamorphmagus would hasten her recovery, or if she could somehow use her powers to transfigure the disease away.

  One morning, as Madam Pomfrey watched her drink a green potion which tasted like old socks, her curiosity got the better of her.

  "I've been thinking," Victoria said between reluctant sips, "if all it takes to get better is to transfigure away the stone, why can't someone just do it for me?"

  "Oh, a healer could do exactly that," Madam Pomfrey said. "But then your body wouldn't have learnt how to do it, and you could get infected again. No, best to do it properly and never have to worry about it again."

  Victoria took another sip, grimacing at the taste. "But it would work? You said that transfigurations on a witch don't last..."

  Madam Pomfrey smiled, crows feet appearing around her eyes. She was middle aged, in wizarding terms, which meant she was probably around eighty-years-old. "You're a sharp one, aren't you?" she said. "I misspoke. It's more that your magic will always try to return the body to its proper state. A healer can use transfiguration to help that along, and the magic won't resist it. But if you try to use transfiguration to take a witch out of her proper state..."

  "Your magic will reverse it," Victoria said. It made sense. "So that's why beauty spells don't last?"

  "Just so," Pomfrey said.

*** Nah, brah. The only reason something like this never happened in JK Rowling's books is the same reason Dumbledore is 150, and the OWL's tester is the guy who tested Dumbledore when he was a kid in Hogwarts; it's cause Rowling never thought about it.

**** Dumbledore was only 115 when he died, he was meant to be 150 as stated in interview in 2001, but his age was later retconned by her. Since wizards could still live to be 150, as that particular bit wasn't retconned, it is feasable for the OWL's tester to have had the job since Dumbledore graduated.

** I read a story, sadly it didn't seem it was going to be updated, but in this world, Wizards were immortal(as in for age, they had spells for it) and could look young too. For centuries. And had been doing so since Merlin's time(he founded this era and was the first Lord of Magic(super powerful wizards who were above the law and were used by the nations as superweapons).

Harry meets the patriarch of the Potters, an 800-year-old guy, and Merlin had been around not 50 years before Harry was there, along with 3 of the founders(I think Grindelwald killed Godric and Helga), Rowena disappeared, and I don't recall what happened to Salazar.

Almost every woman he meets is beautiful and only some wizards choose to look a bit old.

It was kind of weird imagining a society of immortal wizards, and it was worldwide, they were at war with some country in the east.

I remember Harry thinking, or being told, that all women being beautiful kind of made beauty take a secondary role in dating/marriage and instead they looked at things like power and intelligence or some such.

Oh, and Muggleborns are treated like trash, like real bad, Hermione gets a dressing down in the train, they take her biro and notebooks(muggle implements) and destroy everything, and call her ugly. She's one of the few to go to Hogwarts(there's a very hard test only for muggleborns), the others go to schools who aren't nearly as good and are looked down onto.

I /think/ Harry saw it and decided to try and do something about it in the future, I remember it was implied he had the potential to become a Lord of Magic, and it gave me the impression he was Merlin reincarnated(nothing overly, just one guy commenting something and a moment when Harry was about to instinctively do a spell in a different way)

Anyway this would just create a class system even more clearly defined, the rich and/or from old families are beautiful and the poor/newcomers are "ugly".

**** So, I did a Google search(because it had been years since I read that), and I was surprised by how old that story is(and how well I still remember it).

And discovered that you wrote it. I like it, one of the best pieces of true AU and worldbuilding out there...

Any chance of telling which way it was going to go? I (still) am super curious.

*** It would be more interesting if the wizards treated muggleborns as second class, rather than just outright bullying, because it would be looked down upon.

Complete and outright assult and bullying would mean a lot of muggleborn deaths in a society as hardwired as that.

The other thing is, people like to fuck. Like, a lot. Wizards and witches are no different. So the idea of a wizarding britain population being somewhere around 10k is just... even in canon, it's just downright ridiculous.

Now, imagine a society where the rich and the powerful and the beautiful rule, and the sons and daughters are too many?

***** Any species that are long lived would have multiple children. Assuming a young couple have a child or two, and raise the children for the next 20 years or more, eventually the children would move on.

A wizarding couple lives longer, with better healthcare and prospects. They're alone and bored, so they feel nostalgic. They decide to have another kid.

First it was "Magical people are people, so they love to fuck, so they'd have lots of kids" and now it's about how they'd have one or two kids at a time but they'd have multiple batches over time.
