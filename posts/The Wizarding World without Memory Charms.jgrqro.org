So, I had a thought - *what if Memory Charms were never invented?*

For me, this leads to a few sub-questions I was curious to get the Sub's input on. Because the main thing the Memory Charms allow is maintained secrecy and the initial vanishing of Magical Society. If we never forgot that magic was real, that brings up a whole bunch of really interesting worldbuilding questions as a consequence of that and makes the Statute far harder to implement.

- Would there be alternative magical methods of inducing amnesia in Muggles? How would it change things if that method was more work than just a simple spell? eg. a complex potion or ritual. If there was no method, would they resort to assassination? Using magic to organise accidents for any witnesses? Would they just muscle in and do what they wanted anyway, no subterfuge at all? [Assuming there are no alternative magical methods:]
- Would the Statue still be put into place and the Magical World still retreat into protected and hidden spots like Diagon and Hogwarts? Shroud themselves in mystery rather than magic? Muggles-bugger-off Spells are still a thing, so they can ward off Muggles from their land easily enough.
- If Muggle-Magical encounters can't be obliviated, would Mugglebaiting still be as much of a thing?
- If the Retreat from Muggles was still a thing, what would Muggle perceptions of Magic and Magicals actually be like? Would there be Witchhunters still? Curious nerds on the hunt for the Alley? Would that change if the Statute was or wasn't a thing?
- If the Statute was never a thing and the Magical World never retreated, what would things be like? How would Muggles and Magicals openly living together change things?

Plus, any other considerations you think the idea might have. Not sure if I'll flesh this out into a full story yet or not, for now it's just musing over worldbuilding.


** I think it's important to recall one fact: separation is not secrecy.

From all the evidence we have seen, wizards always lived in separation from Muggles. Hundreds of years before the Statute of Secrecy, Britain's wizard's council was passing laws forbidding playing quidditch close to Muggle settlements. And while there are the occasional tales of wizards interacting with Muggles (Norman Malfoys), there's no evidence that they practised magic openly.

But wizards did not live in secrecy, per se. Although wizards lived separately, Muggles would catch occasional glimpses of magic which fed belief in the supernatural among Muggles and created the (inaccurate) myths and legends which Muggles have passed down to the modern day.

What changes in 1692 is not some grand project to change the way wizards live. Rather, wizards decide to add secrecy to their pre-existing separation. They will continue to live separately from Muggles, as they always have, but now they will prevent those occasional glimpses from happening. And the memory charm is a major part of what makes that possible.

They don't have to eradicate Muggle knowledge of magic, because Muggle awareness of magic is so poor. They just have to stop Muggles receiving regular reminders that the supernatural exists, distant and unknowable but very real. Once those reminders stop, then over time Muggle belief in the supernatural will naturally fall and magic will come to be viewed as superstition.

With no memory charm, the most likely outcome is simply that wizards continue living in separation without secrecy. Muggles would continue getting occasional glimpses of magic, which would continue to feed a general belief in the reality of the supernatural as well as generation further legends about magic. Without secrecy, belief in magic among Muggles never falls away as it did historically, but that doesn't mean that Muggles are strongly aware of the presence of wizards or have accurate knowledge of what magic can do. Rather, they continue to have inaccurate folk beliefs as they always have.

However, there are two other possible scenarios, I think:

1. War. We know from JKR on Pottermore than there was a debate in the 1600s among wizards as to whether they should create wizarding secrecy or instead conquer Muggle society. In the canon timeline they chose secrecy, but if you take that option away, war seems like a likely outcome.

2. Hardcore separation. If secrecy via cover-ups isn't possible, but wizards still want secrecy over war, then the solution would seem to be a more hardcore form of separation rather than the casual quasi-separation + cover up your mistakes approach we see in (magical Britain) canon. We're talking no contact whatsoever between wizards and Muggles. Widespread Fidelius Charms, maybe even appropriating an entire part of the country, making it disappear, and living in an entirely autonomous society there.

Both of these would obviously create significant AUs.

*** I think there are also lesser substitutions for the memory charm. For example, the confundment charm which doesn't seem to be able to remove memories, but can certainly change the interpretation of them. A memory of a giant might become a vivid daydream.

In addition, Hermione's charming of her parents suggests the possibility of another spell that creates false memories, though it might be a confundment.

So I think it is still possible for the separation to be similar to the one in canon, if perhaps a bit heavier on the muggle-related departments in the ministry and a little bit more separation between both worlds.

**** Indeed, but I felt that this was not really engaging in the OP's hypothetical but rather seeking to avoid it - you can of course imagine that wizards would come up with some other piece of magic which is functionally identical or very similar to memory charms, but that just seems to reject the premise of the question.

** magical folk would have to understand the muggle world to a much larger extent so they knew how to blend in. I supposed they'd also have to be good at ensuring the muggles' perceptions were manipulated so it just seems like a minor glitch in the matrix type thing. You know, where you're not sure you just saw what you just saw

** How about Memory charms are made unforgivable?
