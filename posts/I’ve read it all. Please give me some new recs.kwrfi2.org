I've been reading since 2011 and while my main interest is Draco centric I've read a lot of other top fics and I have nothing anymore.

I've read all the Drarry. I've read all the Dramione, the Drinny, the Druna even the Dron

I've read the Ron/Harry/Hermione, Ron/Hermione, Ron/Luna the Haruna, Hapne, Hinny, the Hansy literally every ship I've read.

So yeah anyone have any new/underrated fics. Preferably with Draco as the main character. He's my favorite and I find myself reading those with more interest. If not Draco than some other Slytherin that's not Daphne


** Linkao3(Manacled)

You've probably read it if you've read all the draco fics but this is the only one I've read and it is dark as hell... But I thought Draco was really interesting in it. Lots of plot.

But again , dark as hell. If your not into really gritty, depressing abusive stories don't read this.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

** I don't have any specifics but my favourite Harry/Slytherin fics are Theory (Theo/Harry) and Marry (Marcus/Harry). There's some really good fics on their tags at AO3.
