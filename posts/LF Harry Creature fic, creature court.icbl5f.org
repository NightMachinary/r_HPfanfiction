:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I typically only read on FFN or Ao3, so it will probably be on one of those. Also, the story wasn't finished when I last read it.

What I remember: Harry comes into a creature inheritance at the Dursley's. A passing creature hears HP's change and comes to investigate---Dursley's might have been mistreating HP mid-inheritance?

The said creature takes HP with him back to that creature's fam. The creature is a dom among many dom's to one sub named Izzy?

HP comes into a creature inheritance and is a sub. HP's creature is blind (deaf too?) for the first week or two after the transition. HP's creature might have been a Neko because I think I remember a tail and ears. HP grows his hair out super long, needs to have it braided.

Adding of mates has a colored bracelet system that takes place at “court,” and dates are chaperoned.

HP makes a friend with another sub that is the same kind of creature as HP.

HP ends up with one mate that is a younger brother of his host fam? HP meets another mate at a fruit stand in a creature-market like place. I think HP was considering a mate-ship with either/both Severus Snape and Tom Riddle?

Does anyone know what fic this is?
