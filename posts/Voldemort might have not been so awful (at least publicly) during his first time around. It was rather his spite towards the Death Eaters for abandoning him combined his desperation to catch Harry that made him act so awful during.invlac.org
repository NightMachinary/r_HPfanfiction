#+TITLE: Voldemort might have not been so awful (at least publicly) during his first time around. It was rather his spite towards the Death Eaters for abandoning him combined his desperation to catch Harry that made him act so awful during his second coming.

I can't imagine someone that treats people so shitty gaining as followers some of the most influential people in the wizarding world. No matter how powerful they are. Because throughout the books we see him being more shitty towards the Death Eaters than to his enemies. I think Voldemort would have been quite likable during the First War, at least to his supporters. That's why the only Death Eater who doesn't rejoin him out of fear is more afraid of the fellows he sold rather than Voldemort.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: the title is meant to say "combined with his..."


** The first time around he asked for one of his followers' house elves and tried to kill it.

It's not unusual for powerful men to stay in power despite their horrific actions, even to those who supported them. There are many example throughout history.

  The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.

  They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty.

  Rigidly controlled by Riddle

Voldemort gained supporters because he offered something to them. His supporters delude themselves into thinking that they are the one that he values and that they are the one he cares about. But his actions do not truly reflect it. He controls them and he punishes them. He has the support of other magical species, despite his prejudice against them. He had greyback's support despite his prejudice against werewolves and his refusal to even mark the werewolves' leader with a dark mark. His actions are not kind, but his supporters continue to serve him for their own reasons, whether it be ambition, fear, or protection.

And unlike the numerous examples throughout history of those personally connected to such a man killing the man, magic and its dependence on ability means that Voldemort can survive assassinations.

If he was really likeable, some of the death eaters would have searched for him.

Edit: Where'd you get the idea that Karkaroff feared his fellow death eaters more than Voldemort from? Karkaroff sold out his fellow death eaters and became the headmaster of a school knowing full well his fellow death eaters were out there. Yet, when his mark started to grow in intensity again, he started panicking because it was a sign Voldemort was returning. Sure, Crouch says that "he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them" but that doesn't reflect the underlying reason.

#+begin_quote
  *We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance.* He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.
#+end_quote

The faithful death eaters (the ones in prison or Crouch) would have to be released by Voldemort. The faithful death eaters would be operating under Voldemort's orders. It would be Voldemort's ways of tracking Karkaroff that would get him killed. Karkaroff flees because he knows Voldemort has returned. He fears Voldemort and those who Voldemort would send.

*** Honestly I'm kind of seeing Voldemort like DIO now. He lures people in, either through the seduction of his words, the promise of power, some other kind of payment, or through mind control, and only after he's gained their allegiance does he reveal how cruel he can be. Granted I don't remember DIO being nearly as bad towards his own followers as Voldemort was, but there are definitely some similarities there.

** He was a sociopath all along and a murderer in his teens, but its canon that he was able to act charming and had a certain charisma that allowed him to convince a lot of people to support him early on. However, these qualities deteriorated over time (likely due at least in part to making horcruxes), and by the end of the First War he seems to have been ruling mostly by terror (Sirius tells Harry that a lot of wizards supported Voldemort's blood purity platform until they found out how far he was willing to go to get power).

I doubt spending more than a decade as a disembodied spirit did great things for his sanity either, though.

I'd imagine that the majority of it is just that he probably was not a fan of charming people. The more powerful he became, the more he could replace diplomacy with force.
