By "positive" and "negative" I basically mean things going better or worse for the heroes. Do you prefer fics where every good thing is balanced by a bad thing, where Team Good has it even harder, or where things are easier for them, and to what degree?

For me, I generally prefer fics where things go at least a bit better for the good guys. One of the things that has long appealed to me about HP fics is that it has a lot of room for a better outcome without crossing the line into "too easy" territory. I'll enjoy an occasional fix-fic, but mostly just one-shots because of how hard it is to keep some tension and conflict in such a story, and sometimes a quick tale of how things could have gone horribly wrong. A number of fics have driven me away despite good premise and writing by just making things broadly worse for everyone (the most recent example was a Star Wars crossover in which Harry's absence caused everything to go wrong on Earth but the scarcrux managed to get a physical body of its own, unleashing Voldemort on an unsuspecting galaxy that had more than enough problems already).


** I like following positive changes:

- Good Dursleys, since I'm sick and tired of this abused childhood trope that seems to be prevalent in every children's book
- Competent Dumbledore. I don't necessarily mind him being manipulative and ruthless, but canon Dumbledore only seems to be able to manipulate his (ex) students to do the dirty work for him, while being completely outmanipulated by the likes of Fudge and Malfoy. Then that guys just dumped the hope of his nation into abusive home and hoped for the best, while sitting on his ass doing nothing for 10 years! That's just pathetic.
- More effective Order, not that passive reactive ineffective one in canon. They can suffer big casualties, but at least give their enemies hell in return. Canon OOTP lost like 40% of their people in the first war, while only putting like two named Death Eaters (Rosier, Wilkes) permanently out of business. That's just pathetic!
- More proactive, more ruthless, and smarter Trio. JKR dropped their IQs to room temperature in DH on several occasions (7 Potters, wearing the Locket) to jam her plot through. I hate that. Harry might not be able to match Voldemort, but training hard will definitely improve his chance against rank and file Death Eaters. I want to see the Trio dishing out some serious damages to those Wizard Nazis.

On the other hand, I'd like to see following negative changes:

- Make Voldemort a lot more rational and less arrogant, and he will be not that Avada Kedavra addict. He will always liquidate his political enemies, and not let them get away like after that Wedding attack. His Death Eaters will always strip search their captives and perform thorough Veritaserum and Legilimency interrogations on them, after a significant dose of Cruciatus of course (for the purpose of lowering mental defenses). The Trio would NEVER escape the Malfoy Manor if captured like in canon.
- More malicious and Voldemort sympathetic Ministry. Such a Ministry could explain Dumbledore's apparent 10 years of 'inaction'; the need for OOTP in the first place; why Dumbledore failed to force a trial of Sirius Black; the lack of comprehensive investigations of imprisoned Death Eaters; and Voldemort's quick takeover after the great Dumbledore fell.
- Foreign powers sympathetic to the cause of Blood Purists. Canon already states that Durmstrang does not accept Muggleborns. But what about France, Italy, and Spain? MACUSA seems very hostile to Muggles, so I think it could be quite supportive of Voldemort's cause.

** It's more about 'why' than what, even though i rather prefer more positive and uplifting stories.

What i mean by that, is that having some bad things happen to protagonists way out of the left field, due to someone uncharacteristically holding idiot ball, or some random people acting evil/mean for the sake of it are not something i enjoy.

However, if there was a good reason and story behind it, i'm down for a read. One of the better things i've read was [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/]["There's nothing to fear"]] with a far more scary, competent and succesfull Voldemort - it went far worse than canon, yet it's a great read.

On the other hand, making everything go well just because is rather unsatysfying.

** I do prefer happy endings, and there are limits on how grimdark something can get before I give up (Exhibit A: Divided and Entwined, for all that it's well written). Within reason, though, things can go either better or worse; the key question is, what are the /people/ doing? The characters make the story interesting or boring.

A wisecracking, snarky Harry, who shows compassion to the downtrodden and doesn't just beat his enemies but /humiliates/ them, could make even a straightforward curbstomp with no dramatic tension readable. A group of people with nuanced personalities, who try to work through their differences and challenges but falter sometimes, and make heroic sacrifices to protect each other, could make a compelling narrative even if the world around them is crumbling. Conversely, a cast of flat characters who all speak with the same voice will tend to be boring even if their successes and challenges are well balanced.

** I am 100% here for fix it's and things going better. I‘m all about that comfort fic and wrapping characters in blankets and giving them hot chocolate lmao

obviously comfort does usually come after some hurt though so there should be at least some sort of conflict, but I'm not here for angst porn

** I, for one, enjoy fics where we get a better picture of the dystopia that Voldemort creates during DH. If you read the original books, you don't really get a clear picture since the protagonists are mostly disconnected from it. A world in which you get a better idea of the atrocities going on will make you root even harder for the heroes. In the books, we only see Voldemort punishing Rowle for losing Harry and then throwing a tantrum when he finds out that Harry is hunting Horcruxes.

For example I prefer fics that are sort of in the A Song of Ice and Fire-style where you get to witness first-hand the tension rising as people can no longer stand or lose hope in a world lead by a corrupt and cruel government.

** If an idea comes off worse than it would've been if they'd just stuck to canon, then I don't want to read it. The last thing anyone should want to happen is question why the author chose to do what they did.

** My big thing is don't make it a feel good “the good guys are basically gods who everything goes perfectly for”. I love competent Dumbledore fics as well as fics that make Voldemort be a horrifying person but at the same time, not make him some kind of god essentially. I've read several fics where, for instance, Voldemort got hit with killing curses and fiendfyre and walked out just fine along with being hit by blasting curses for good measure. Like I get wanting to up the ante and all but things like that really do have a big “if you give a character a lightsaber, the enemy needs to have a Death Star” but reversed.

*** The line for me tends to be when there's no longer any real tension. If either side is godlike and invincible, there's no tension because the outcome is obvious. That, and deus ex machina (aside from maybe whatever creates the divergence from canon) or other non-sequitur.

I'll admit that /some/ fics with no tension still work, but those are usually either very short (so the lack of tension doesn't matter) or comedic enough to be entertaining even if the plot is bland.

** As much as I like a Happy Ending, I think I might enjoy fics that have a little bit of struggle before it hits that point.\\
For a positive change:

- I would like good guys struggling with their morality a little, trying to be allied with people who they would normally not talk to, but eventually come out victorious, not because they were "good", but because they were slightly better than the opposition.
- Order of Phoenix being an international underground movement against the forces of Voldemort, with Dumbledore being the head of it all, mostly because people trust that he wouldn't lose the sight of what right and what's not. Either that, or there are other groups like it, that have been formed in response to Voldemort.
- OotP being more competent and having more people who are politically important, or having allies that are more important. Them actually doing something in the political field.
- Slightly more involvement from the Muggles, at least at the higher levels, or from the immediate family members of the muggleborns.
- The Dursleys being good guys. While they don't have to treat Harry as their son, they could treat him like their nephew. Either that, or more nuanced behavior from them instead of them being cartoonishly evil, like them gaslighting Harry because Petunia really disliked her sister.
- Harry Potter having more friends, or at least more interactions with other people. The DA being formed earlier, first as a study group, then may be as something else entirely. The DA (before seventh year) doing something to help the muggleborn students and their family and by the time seventh year rolls around, it is a fully formed resistance group.
- Harry having an international presence, both due to Voldemort having an international presence and because he is the first known person who has escaped the Killing Curse, although during the horcrux hunt he does come across one other similar case.

For negative changes:

- Voldemort being ruthlessly competent. He starts out being this really charismatic person who can easily subvert people to his cause, but over the years as he makes more horcrux, his cruelty is slightly increased. Not enough that people think he is unhinged, but enough that people who decided to help him before think that they chose the wrong option.
- Dursleys not being cartoonishly evil. It would be nice if they were ambitious and more subtle in their attempts to disparage Harry. It is subtle enough that even Harry does not know it is happening, and only when he meets Hagrid for the first time he understands that his relatives were lying. It would make his sorting all the more interesting, the subtle manipulations, being ambitious is what he knows till then, but learning that his parents died protecting him, it lights a fire in his heart, but confuses him. So when he is offered Slytherin first, he knows that being Slytherin is something that he does not want.
- Other countries also being involved in the war. At least till the first war, it would be great if we can see involvement from them, and learning why Voldemort was worse than Grindelwald.
