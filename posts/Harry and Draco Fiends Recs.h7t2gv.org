Hey all,

I'm looking for fics that explore Harry and Draco as friends. I don't want slash, and i'd like if it can be well written and somewhat believable.

Any suggestions? Ive read a lot of the obvious harry in slytherin ones where this seems to come up, but am looking at something new to explore the dynamic. I dont care if its Harry in different houses or not.


** I just read Linkao3(The Devil Went Down To Hogwarts) the Harry/Draco friendship isn't the main focus of the story but it was really funny and overall I thought the story was great.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
