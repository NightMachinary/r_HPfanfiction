Hermione hears Bellatrix's voice inside her head and she gives advice to Hermione. There was a scene where, when boarding the Hogwarts Express for her 8th year, the station is attacked and she manages to cast two spells at once with Bellatrix's assistance. Bellatrix is currently living on an isolated magical island with centaurs.

I believe Bellatrix also had a black cat as her animagus which Hermione took to Hogwarts not realising it was Bellatrix. The “cat” sniffed out poison in someone's meal at dinner.

It ended as a Bellamione - I think they were soulmates?

Thank you for any help!

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, the Golden Trio's messiah-like status changes their lives forever; only Hermione remains skeptical about their new fame. Trapped, she is inexorably is drawn toward the last person expected: Bellatrix Black. Hermione loses her mind, heart, and soul... to the dark mistress. Yet,things have a funny way of working out. Endgame: Bellamione!(beta chrisdenvl)
