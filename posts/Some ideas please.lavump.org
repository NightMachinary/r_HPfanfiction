How would someone with a bad childhood with cruel and abusive parents. React to the blood quill being used on them? Have a Slytherin oc in fifth year that is friends with Harry. So need some help on reactions as they have a dark past. Also how can Harry be protective of a friend if he had one like that as they were friends form childhood in primary school.


** People are different, they react different ways. The only thing you can do is try to temporarily turn your brain into your characters' brain and try to think out what your reactions would be given his experiences.

Personally I think I'd brush it off as no big deal and try to keep quiet about it like Harry does. People adapt to whatever is normal for them and it sounds like this is about what your OC has come to expect from authority figures.

If you're trying to play this for drama, making this evoke a memory of a similar experience of having their hand crushed/burned/whatnot by their parents could result in their breaking down and crying, or in the process of toughing it out reveal a bit too much about their home life causing Harry to start investigating?

** Impossible to say.

Incidentally, it would be impossible to say in /any/ case. Like the other comment said, people are different.

I find questions like these don't help me when writing. I approach this from the other side: What is the story I want to tell? And once I know that, I make a plausible case for it in my story -- "plausible" such that it makes sense within the context of what I've written before. This can be what people IRL do usually, or it can be the outlier of outliers. Because this is the thing: Unless you really write crazy stuff, you'll always find /that one person/ IRL, and you don't need more than that to make your story plausible.

So, I'd say figure out what you want their reaction to be. 99% says you can make it work. Personally, if it was a Slytherin, and if it was me writing, they'd do everything not to end up in the situation (heads down!), and if they did, they'd do anything to get out as quick as possible. Arguing (it's not legal?), bargaining (Anything they can trade? If it's Umbridge: Does she need a personal spy?), threatening (this is not the end of it, they have friends in high places?). After that, there is only glacial coldness. No further word or reaction, just plans for the day the tables are turned and the favour is repaid with interest.

Your story, though, not mine, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
