looking for harry potter fanfics with any one of these categories, super powered harry (can fly, telepathy, just super powerful in general, etc), harem, independent, friends with Malfoy (i have read they shook hands), gun using harry, and lastly magical creatures allies (i read a fanfic a while back where harry set up an ambush for Voldemort in diagon alley, with house elves on the rooftops, goblins on the front lines with axes and swords, and centaurs with bows in the back). i know "google" or "find them yourself" trust me i do that i just wanna hear recommendations from the forum users
