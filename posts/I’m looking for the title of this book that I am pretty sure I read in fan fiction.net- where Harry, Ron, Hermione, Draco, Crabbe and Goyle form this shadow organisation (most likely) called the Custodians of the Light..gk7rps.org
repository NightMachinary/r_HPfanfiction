#+TITLE: I’m looking for the title of this book that I am pretty sure I read in fan fiction.net- where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Crabbe and Goyle form this shadow organisation (most likely) called the Custodians of the Light.

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I also know that Draco's parents were murdered within the first few chapters. They create like a sub-organisation whose many members include Dumbledore, Amelia Bones, Arthur Weasley, Severus Snape, etc; and I know that Hagrid is supposed to be the only proper adult who is a member of the Custodians of the Light.

If any of you know the book I'm thinking about, please tell me...

Thanks:)

** Curious to know what this subs thoughts on this fanfic are personally.

I really enjoyed the fic until they formed the custosae de luxe (I hope I'm remembering that right) but found that 'organisation' and everything thereafter intolerable to the point where I can never finish the fic.

*** I thought so too at first... But a few days after I read a few chapters, I decided to just finish reading the whole book, and somewhere along the way, I found that I actually liked it. Long story short: I binge-read it and my mum scolded me for not understanding the value of sleep.

I like the idea behind the pic, I guess.

There was basically nobody opposing Voldemort properly in the books except the Ministry and the Order of the Phoenix. But the Ministry was in the pockets of the rich purebloods and the OotP -no matter how good their intentions were- didn't actually do anything.

The point that almost nobody knew that the CdL was run by literal children and got duped was just another plus.

It may just be me, but I personally felt that the author of the book has truly understood all the characters and has conveyed the plot to us beautifully.

*** I didn't finish it either - IIRC what made me stop reading was actually the name "Custosae de lux" - that's an even worse translation of "Guardians of light" than what Google Translate would give you.
