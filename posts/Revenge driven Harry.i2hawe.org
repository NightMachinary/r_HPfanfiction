I want to read a story that focuses on Harry getting REVENGE!, I don't particularly care on whom, just that it doesn't end in forgiveness. Not a canon rehash pls, I cannot stand them anymore

Yes I'm in a weird mood


** This may or may not fit your criteria, havent read it for awhile, not sure if it ends in forgiveness or not.

*** Didn't like it, everybody is OOC and not in a creative-innovative way but rather in a forced-nonsensical way, like the author thought out a plot and kinda bullied the characters into it

**** Thats fine, I feel like if you want a revenge driven Harry he is going to be OOC anyway. No worries
