** Cadmean Victory. It was a bitter sweet ending combined with the feeling of finishing a well written story made for a miserable experience.

** There are three fics that made me sad for two different reasons.

Both /Honour Thy Blood/ and /Stepping Back/ by /TheBlack'sResurgence/ were really great and I would have loved if they had been a tad bit longer. Come to think of it, the first-ever long-fic I read, /A Cadmean Victory/ also left me sad after becoming greatly attached to a few of the Characters.

/Antitheses/ is the other kind of making me sad, as it had a really depressing story and end to it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading it, but it was just really dark.

I dread the day when some of the still open-ended one's that I am reading get finished, there is nothing like looking into your inbox to see a notification that a new chapter has been posted.

*** That's how I feel, I have quite a few fics I'm currently waiting on updating and although the wait is annoying at least you still have hopes for where the story will go! Nothing more painful than the last line of a fic you were so invested in!!!

** Well, I remember the story [Unsung Hero]. It made me sad but in a bad way... there was just toooooo much injustice in the story. Could have been good, but the author must have been some masochist and turned it into a soul-wrecking piece of crap towards the end.

Spoiler:

-Hermione gets mind-controlled by Harry's brother at some point because he is jealous, he forced her to be his girlfriend and basically raped her during that period of time. She was rescued by Harry, but their relationship wasn't the same anymore. Harry's borther got away with it... (because he wrongly believed to be the bwl)\\
-In the end, Hermione dies for a very stupid reason (author forces it). Harry gets killed by his brother and... THE END. There was a sequel to the story where harry travels back in time after his death, but the author dropped the story for obvious reasons.\\
>! NO JUSTICE. NO VENGEANCE. wtf. There is more shit, but these two points are the major ones that turn the story into a piece of shit. !<

** I think you'd really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool by The Divine Comedian]] . It's an excellent story that had me hooked the entire time and really got me in my feels.
