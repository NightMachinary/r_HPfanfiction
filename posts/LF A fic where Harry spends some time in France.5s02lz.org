It could just be for a chapter, magical France intrigues me. I tend to prefer the Non-BWL Harry (or WBWL in 'certain' cases) but it's not really a big deal to me.


** I've used Magical France in several of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][my stories]].

In "Patron", Harry and co. spend part of the summer before year 5 in Magical France.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", Harry, the Weasleys and Neville grew up in Magical France, and there are several scenes set in France.

In "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", the Revolutionary Wars involve France.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  An accident at the age of six turned out to be a lucky thing for Harry Potter. It could get him all the things he had ever dreamed about and many things that he could have never imagined; girls, adventure, a home, and love.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
