** Not quite what you ask for, but for a while now I've had this plot bunny simmering in my head of a straight HP reimagining of /Batman/ (specifically the Tim Burton and /BTAS/ version of it), with Harry in Bruce's shoes obviously. I mean, all kinds of things write themselves: the Joker was turned nuts because that vat didn't contain just chemicals, it was an untested dark potion... the Penguin's appearance belies adulteorus half-goblin parentage, so the pureblood Cobblepots threw him out to avoid scandal...
