I'm sticking to oneshots still, but after four months I finally posted another story! I just wanted to share how accomplished I felt by finally finishing something :D

Here's the link. It's a little bit silly, but I couldn't get the idea of it out of my head and just ended up writing it!

** Good job! The ending felt kind of wrong tbh, but other than that good stuff.
