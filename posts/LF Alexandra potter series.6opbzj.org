Hey all! I just read the html that someone had posted of the first of the Alexandra Potter books and I loved it. Does anyone know where I can find the others (are there others?) or others like it?

Help! Thanks!

... keep watching...

... maybe come back in 2035.

*** Lol. Okay, will do. Despite what I have seen/heard from other saying that Alex was unlikable, I found that entirely untrue! She is a kid--of course she is going to make mistakes, and having grown up with the Dursley's it is entirely understandable that her moral compass is a little...skewed.

Hope to see the new one in the next few years!!! :)

** At least it wasn't completely abandoned after a cliffhanger, like The One He Feared.

No offense, I think it's one of the best written fics in the fandom, but abandoning it because of some people complaining on the sub is just mean.

** Are you asking for a copy of "Alexandra Potter", or its (possible) sequels? Cause I canhelp with the first one, second not so much.

I downloaded it as a "read later" but never got around to the "reading" part of that phrase........

***** I've had it on my computer for 2 years now and just read it yesterday. It was pretty good; perhaps not as great as some of the hidden gems I've read but definitely enjoyable. I'm certainly trying to read a sequel!
