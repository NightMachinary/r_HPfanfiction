I recently read Mr. Chaos's linkffn (Harry Potter and the Master's Ball) as well another one with Harry Potter as the avatar. Any other good fanfictions where it's a fusion of the two worlds?


** So do you mean any kind of crossover fic? Or the specific term "Harry potter fusion" where characters from another world are a part of a Harry Potter universe? For example John and Sherlock attending Hogwarts?

*** I would prefer a fusion, if you can recommend one. I also enjoy crossovers so feel free to recommend those too. Not a fan of mpreg/etc. but I can get past slash/femslash if it's not a huge part of the story.

** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is a great crossover. It plays both after the events of the series "Firefly" (that I never watched, but that isn't a problem) and after Hogwarts - so it doesn't follow any script.

True to nonjon, it actually has stuff happening, and Harry is less of an asshole than in the other stories of nonjon. There are plenty of laughs, plenty of suspenseful scenes, and even if Harry is pretty powerful the other characters are important, and Harry wouldn't have solved his problems alone.

The crossover between the two series is masterfully done, he merges the plot of both stories well. At times I felt like the makers of "Firefly" had the story in mind that nonjon told, because it just fit so well.

(You don't need to have watched Firefly or the movie Serenity to follow the plot - but it's not a drawback at all if you have)

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.
