I'm looking for fics that are basically how you imagine canon would have been if it was written for adults instead of middle grade/young adults.


** Hogwarts School of Spellcraft & Sorcery is open to all intelligent magical species. Harry's years of magical schooling aren't just filled with the wonder of magic, but the wonder in cultural differences and commonalities.

The Statute of Secrecy is fragile, and elderly witches & wizards still remember their parents' tales of persecution 300 years ago. Hermione Granger and other muggle-born/raised work on building trust with other magicals and disproving their fears so that they can learn the deepest secrets of magic.

The Ministry of Magic is honest and resilient, but Voldemort is an utterly ruthless master of the mind arts and fighting in the shadows. Even a competent Ministry is little match for a Dark Lord who can turn anyone into his slave or sleeper agent on a whim.

Hmm, I wonder how else the setting could be reconstructed...

*Philosopher's Stone*\\
An attempted robbery at Gringotts, one only thwarted by the targeted object being removed from the bank ahead of time, reveals that Voldemort, somehow, still exists despite his destruction a decade ago.\\
To prevent the Philosopher's Stone from falling into Voldemort's hands, Albus Dumbledore has the Stone brought to Hogwarts, which though it may serve as a school, is still a castle heavily fortified against invaders.\\
But Voldemort is cunning; he's managed to place a bewitched (or brainwashed) agent inside the castle walls. Now Dumbledore and his staff are racing against time, to determine whom of them is an (unwilling?) traitor before he or she can recover the Stone for their master.

***** I read that 5 years ago or so, and if I recall correctly, wasn't it a little bit derivative? I might be thinking of a different story, but I remember extremely long-winded conversations, followed by tangents, followed by more conversations, followed by a bit of action, which would be smothered by even more long conversations and mental tangents.

Actually I just looked it up; nearly 900,000 words, 10k word chapters, and the meat of the story takes place over the course of just between 1994-1995. Yep, I recalled correctly. I put it down before it was complete, so it might get better, but personally, waiting 500k words to get to the really juicy bits is just too long to wait.

****** I read it recently, and personally I found it to be one of the most well-written pieces of fanfic I've read. It's long, yes, however I think that added to it rather than detracting from it. It never felt like it was dragging things out or providing unecessary information, it was just that long because it needed to be in order to get across the plot and developement.

It does world-building and character developement really well, and deals with an OP Harry by keeping him far from perfect, allowing his flaws to make up for his increased power. The adults are major players, rather than relying on contrived bullshit to allow Harry to succeed they have multiple ways of attacking Voldemort. Likewise, the villians are a lot more competant than in canon, so there are still stakes and a sense of danger to the story.

Like I said before, the world-building is fantastic, it goes into detail about politics and branches of magic that both fanfics and canon are lacking. It also plays with fanon tropes and canon, providing unique (and better) spins on things that have already been done. I also felt like the emotional payoffs were done really well.

The characters who are redeemed are also done really well. Dumbledore makes up for his mistakes and is shown to have everyone's best interests at heart, just that he was trying to taje care of everything on his own. Snape and other Death Eaters aren't forgiven, but those that worked with the protagonists were able to move on with their lives.

Overall in the plot there's a lot of cause/effect, setups/payoffs, and consequences to the actions everyone takes. There's also not a lot of contrivances, and no plot holes that I picked up on. It's a pretty solid plot.

  /What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him.

** First of all, age up the cast. Have Hogwarts be more of a university/college town. Make the magical world even more isolationist. Then, strip Harry of his everyman personality and give him an injection of drive, ambition, and intelligence.

Flesh out Ron's character, especially /his/ drive and ambition to do something his brothers haven't. Hermione on the other hand does some very questionable and immoral things in canon. Expand on her borderline sociopathic behavior, and how she fights to control her more violent urges.

Now comes the plot. With a more mature story, the philosopher's stone being kept in a school makes no sense. Unless it's not Flamel's stone. Make it Dumbledore's, since we know he's engaged in alchemy in canon. Have Quirrel be competent, accomplished, and a long term Death Eater trying to steal the stone to resurrect his master.

Dumbledore is off for a summit of the ICW, so Quirrel makes his move. The traps are actually dangerous, and not easily solved riddles. Harry faces a powerful dark wizard in a duel and wins, but at some cost such as losing an eye or some fingers to the dark magic. Not to mention that the result of their duel is Quirrel dead. Explore the effect of him killing a teacher.

Continue expanding from there. Maybe the Chamber of Secrets is host to the malevolent wraith of Salazar Slytherin, awakened by Voldemort's horcrux. Prisoner would focus more heavily on the Dementors and their nature plus how they affect Hermione's sociopathic behavior. The Triwizard Tournament has Ron as the Hogwarts Champion because of his sheer ambition to exceed his family. Etc.

That's my two cents on rewriting the series as more mature.

I honestly can't think of any /good ones/ post Deathly Hallows. It's a very tall order.

  The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before.

** The Many Deaths of Harry Potter

and

The Nightmare Man

are both really dark and realistic, however they are not how cannon would have been, but it is definitely written for adults.

There is no slash and they are both T rated (Have to be 12+ to read)
