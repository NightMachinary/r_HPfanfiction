...And of course, ends up Kissed (along with Dudley) as planned by Dolores Umbridge.

Does anyone know any /short/ stories, or one-shots, which examine the fallout of this scenario? I'm already aware of one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5651585/1/Wizards-are-stupid][the first chapter of the Wizards Are Stupid collection]], are there any others?

To be specific, I want short stories which look at the fallout of Harry and Dudley being soulless, not ones where he's partially-kissed and gains some dark powers of some sort.


** linkffn(the boy who died alone by denuelos, this is your reward by denuelos, your reward is nigh by denuelos)

Series of oneshots/epilogue style stories where harry dies and all the people who died after are judged in the afterlife. Voldemort won, and snapshots of what that was like are included in the newly dead peoples judgments.

Harry died from a dementors kiss, but it was a /everyone betrayed him and he was put in azkaban for being framed/ sort of story and was wildly au. The kiss was legally sanctioned after a farce of a trial.

  Follow up to my one-shot The Boy Who Died Alone, the ultimate "rewards" are handed out as each person passes away. This will include at least the trio, Dumbledore, Fudge, Luna, Sirius and Remus. What will each receive? CharDeath

  Third in the Boy Who Died Alone universe. This continues the Ultimate Rewards in a world where Voldemort wins because of the betrayal of Harry Potter. Suggested that you read The Boy Who Died Alone and This is Your Reward first.

  Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban and died a traitor's death. What happens when the world finds out the truth? Voldemort lets the world know. VERY dark. If you are looking for a happy ending, this story is not for you. One-shot.
