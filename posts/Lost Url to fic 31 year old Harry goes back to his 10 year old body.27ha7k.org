*** Actually I was very specific. He was exactly 31, and in no other fic do he and Remus personally go into Azkaban to retrieve Sirius. Anyone who has read the fic would know precisely what I meant, and one such person has replied. But I appreciate your opinion.

** This sounds a lot like my story, except Harry is 21and Remus doesn't have much to do with Sirius' freedom. Perhaps it is mine.
