** I guess it could be. It could also be a simple diffindo, or a dark curse specifically for slitting throats. IMO you can just pick whatever is creepiest or most heartbreaking for you.

*** In the films his death is so excessive. Voldy slits his throat and then the snake bites him like five times. I refuse to believe that wouldn't kill him instantly

** Unclear he just cuts Snape's throat with a spell.

Could be sectumsempra or the spell Molly uses to cut bread
