Preferably at the end of third year but anytime before the end of ootp is fine. I would prefer no bashing of anyone. I don't mind his influence on Harry leading him to drift away from his friends but they can't be evil. No bashing dumbledore, I don't mind him being a bigger picture kind of guy but he can't be a manipulative bastard or just plain evil. No slash no super harry after a month of training or any lord of a dozen houses- basically no badly written Indy!harry tropes. Harry can be powerful but that should be because he now has someone who is actively involved in his education.


** One of the oldest Harry Potter fanfic series, and one that sadly still isn't complete (6/7 books done, although the author has mentioned on his facebook page that he's been trying to start writing the last book recently) is Dethryl's "They Shook Hands". One of the original slytherin!Harry fics, it's managed to avoid most of the modern cliches due to its sheer age (and it actually spawned a couple of them.) Sirius is exonerated at the end of Harry's third year, and Harry moves in to live with him immediately. Has no Dumbledore bashing, nor any overt Weasley bashing (Harry is best friends with Draco so the relationship with Ron is roughly similar to canon Draco-Ron relations, rest of the Weasleys are friendly). Linking the author's profile since it has both the original version, and the rewritten early books (for stuff like Blaise Zabini being a guy and some other new canon touch-ups as the books came out.) Having read both though, I'd honestly suggest reading the new versions only because the author's writing has improved immensely between 2001 and the rewrites.

*** Actually, you could say that Dumbledore is partially bashed in there. Also, TSH lifts many scenes from canon and just ends up swapping character names. E.g., there might be times when Tracey gets one of canon!Hermione's lines. It tends to go that way across numerous scenes with numerous characters.

Yes, TSH brings its own set of original plot ideas, but the majority of it is canon rehashed to the extreme until about year 5 or so. I.e., when I first read it I was really hoping for a different-ish Triwizard Tournament, but Cedric Diggory, like many other GoF fics, STILL gets chosen as Hogwarts' 'true' champion.

I don't mind stations of canon but not when its railroaded instead of likable.

And another irritating thing is how Draco is basically a nicer, richer version of canon!Ron, while TSH!Ron is basically a poorer version of canon!Draco. Then there's a bit of pro-Neville wank in later years. You know, when authors make Neville have sooooo much potential when he gets his confidence and all.

Overall, I'd give that series a 7/10, especially for Dethryl's dedication to not only posting the originals back in the day, but also revising it with canon names and facts in mind.

**** Oh yeah, it definitely has its fair amount of flaws. Imo it's better then the average slytherin!Harry series, but this might just be my low regard for that trope in general.

But I really wouldn't say that TSH has Draco as a richer version of canon Ron. The Draco there, while defo nicer, is still an asshole - and so is Harry, to some extent. There are plenty of scenes where they outright bully someone, bait Ron into confrontations or have canon Draco-like moment of showing off/'I'm better then everyone'.

** The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga - linkffn(13052940) This fic is a Remus-centric time travel fic, but there are chapters in Sirius's and Harry's viewpoints. I feel like the fic is a lot more complex and interesting than you might assume from the summary.

Innocent by MarauderLover7 - linkffn(9469064) A good Sirius-raises-Harry fic. It might take quite a few chapters, but Sirius does get exonerated. There's also several sequels.

  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.
