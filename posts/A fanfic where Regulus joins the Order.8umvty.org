This has been in my head for the past month now. A fanfic of the Maraduers/war era where Regulus joins the Order on the night that he finds out about the locket. He comes to Sirius, who then tells dumbledore and yadayada. If something like this exists --- please show me. If not, maybe one of you geniuses with writing talent can write it?

No Slash.

Also, if its somehow possible to find this in the world, one like that that has Peter not become a traitor. I always love seeing how authors write him when he's a good guy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world.

It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers. Anyways, Regulus doesn't join the Order till the end and it later goes into a sequel.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under their account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.
