Racism, like many things, is on a spectrum and rarely so black and white.

Are there any fics where some of the less-racist Death Eaters (or sympathizers) are dumbfounded at how far Voldemort is willing to go to terrorize muggleborns?

** This bring sup an interesting argument for sure. In Germany, many people, including soldiers in the army, didn't know about the camps, or at least to the extent to which the Jews, gypsies and other minorities were tortured and exterminated. It's sobering to realise that government censorship can quash any outcry before it reaches a critical mass of rebellion. Equally, I draw parallels of ministry workers to Manstein, who was told by troops that behind the lines SS members were raping, pillaging and murdering innocents, but reportedly asserted that he had no authority behind the front lines, a statement which is dubious at best. To him, perhaps he believed that in the long term, sacrificing these individuals would bring a long term benefit to Eastern Europe when it was developed after the war. Perhaps he might have believed that the short term costs were justifiable for a greater good. Equally, many Germans didn't stand up against the government because of a culture of fear. When the Gestapo is everywhere, most if not all significant resistance is visibly and publicly crushed with little mercy. In such an environment, the general human tendancy for conflict avoidance and self-preservation kicks in. It's not a side we really get to see in the books, I agree, probably because the series plays heavily into tropes, where we're focused more on the hero's journey. Quite sobering thoughts.

*** Well yes, but there would definitely be dementors at muggleborn camps, so actually no. I think muggleborn camps will be Azkaban but way worse.
