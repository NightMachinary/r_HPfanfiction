Okay, let's get this out of the way: I know that King Arthur died about five hundred years before the founding of Hogwarts. But if Merlin can be in Slytherin, then Arthur can be king when the school was founded (or not long after).

Anyway, the actual prompt.

Imagine King Arthur returns (reincarnation, just wanders out of Albion, whatever), and he is not overly impressed with what Hogwarts has become while he was gone.

Keeping dangerous magical artifacts /in/ the school? Hiring a teacher that was possessed by the spirit of a Dark Lord?

Letting a Basilisk wander around for nearly an entire year? Only to be killed by /twelve year old?!/

Letting Dementors loose on the grounds?

Surely, he thinks, I held this place to higher standards. And where's all the other classes? Sword fighting, Thestral riding, law, etc.

And what's this about blood status? All magical people are the same, any idiot knows that. Salazar Slytherin proved that himself with extensive testing.

Basically: King Arthur comes back, and Hogwarts has really gone downhill since he left.


** Hm. He is supposed to return when Brittania's need is greatest.

Also, something to include: Dueling used to be a core class instead of an after school club. King Arthur will not be impressed with the poor ability of the average wizard to defend themselves.

Really bad idea: it's Fate's King Arthur and she takes over DADA because screw your curses these kids need to learn to fight.

*** I could see him being really annoyed that learning proper combat is a /club/.

"We had sword fighting, spear fighting, bows and arrows, knives, hammers, two kinds of mounted combat, unarmed combat, and every student was required to of those /on top of/ fighting with a wand. And where's the physical exercise to keep people fit?"

Something like that at least.

Because really, consider the time period: of course every single student was taught to defend themselves if they couldn't use magic.

**** Also tht apparently dueling is the only type of combat they learn. Which is BS, most enemies won't politely introduce themselves and splitting into neat 1v1 duels is a great way to suffer casualties on both sides. Teamwork and tactics please. Coordinate spells on the same target, curse people in the back, and use some magical synergy.

**** I'd actually imagine /not/: swordfighting wizards are a Tolkien thing, not an Arthurian one. The dedicated spellcasters wouldn't be expected to be knights, they'd be expected to be mages. Knights are for Knightly things.

But the fact that everyone is lazy and their education is about as well rounded as a line segment would definitely be annoying. As would dueling being demoted from core class to mostly abandoned extracurricular.

***** Not strictly to be knights, but I imagine that they'd want the kids to be able to fight without magic, just in case they got into it with some muggle "witch hunters" or the like.

Some of them probably would go on to be knights after Hogwarts, wanting to serve the crown as best they could.

But yeah, swordfighting wizards aren't really Arthurian. I could still see things like "unarmed combat" (IE: self defence), knife fighting (knives are just useful), and what basically amounts to PE being on the docket for all the students and teachers.

Just because they don't want to be knights is no reason for them to rely solely on magic as their only means of defending themselves.

Also yeah: considering the wide range of things that I imagine they would have learned back then (like all the non-magical things), I could easily see Arthur being annoyed at how little they're all taught.

"No one in this damn school can even /hunt a deer!/ It's pathetic!" Is the sort of thing I'd imagine, because learning how to survive in the wild would be one of the big non-magical things I'd imagine.

*** This is where i nitpick to point out that Fate King Arthur was really bad at magic, was fine on the theory(as in could recognize someone else doing magic and how to respond) but as far as using magic she was limited to a few prepackaged tricks(ie blessing from the lady of the lake like her waterwalking and hiding her sword) and yeeting as much prana through her sword as possible. Theres a reason she used mfing Excalibur, its the only thing that could handle her raw output for prana burst.

Personally I think Arturia would just be happy that the wizards a) not perverts like Merlin(may the dick wizard reign eternal) and b) not being creepy stalkers trying to screw her for spite and jealousy like Morgan.

As to "when it faces the greatest danger", that's an easy one. Sure, he'll be back for /that/, but there's no rule saying he can't stop by beforehand, is there?

Actually, that sounds like a great bit of humour for a fic. Everyone thinks that Arthur is there (if they know it's him) because it's the time of England's greatest need or whatever. Nah, that's not for a few more centuries, he just wanted to check out how things had changed while he was gone. This is basically a vacation for him.

Actually, that'd be /hilarious/ (idk why I have crack-like ideas on the brain). King Arthur returns, slays the Basilisk, and saves the school...

...and then he just kind of awkwardly hangs around afterwards. He came back, just like he was supposed to, but he didn't leave when it was over, so now he lives at Hogwarts and tries to get the school back to the standards he left it in..

****** Crack huh... Okay, how about the Basilisk being a guardian beast raised by Merlin for the school's protection? Artoria of course participated in the training as well.

Artoria's dragon blood makes her immune to Basilisk gaze, so she just stares hard at Blinky and makes her stand down.

After she takes care of Tom, she asks around and finds out that literally all of the protective measures that should have been passed down have been forgotten. And since the protective measures are all fortress/ army destruction level (Artoria's Excalibur can blast down fortresses, Basilisk can take care of armies...) she decides to stay around until they all are secured.

Of course, after she realizes that Ravenclaw's Diadem, Slytherin's Locket and Hufflepuff's Cup got trashed by Tom Riddle, she gets really pissed.

Story Premise - Almost all of Hogwarts magical artifacts are passed down from Camelot and are crazy powerful.

The Room of Requirement is a paradise created by Merlin, Ravenclaw's Diadem grants supercomputer level calculation ability and multiplies magical ability to Dragon-level, Hufflepuff's Cup creates a longevity increasing elixir...

Most of these artifacts are restricted to 'chosen ones' (like Caliburn would only be pulled out by the one fated to be King), so Tom Riddle couldn't utilize them and just decided to use them as his Horcruxes.

******* King Arthur, releasing horrible monsters onto the school: "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST!"

In all seriousness: there's a time and place for danger. Hogwarts is supposed to be safe from muggles (it was founded in a time where using magic might get you killed by an angry mob). So I imagine the Founders + Arthur wanted the place to be safe and secure, but to also teach the kids how to handle dangers.

Maybe only /some/ parts of the school have monsters in them? So the students can avoid them? Just make all the shortest paths between classrooms have monsters in them. Your choices are "fight the monster" or "run the long way around".

Actually, that sounds hilarious. Play up some traditional magic "cliches" that would put muggles in danger, and it'd make a lot of sense.

"Today we're learning about Fey bargains." - brings actual fey into the classroom.

Accidental magical vows, random acts of transfiguration, potion mishaps, etc. Really, it's just better to keep the muggles out so none of them get them gets themselves turned into a dog and bought as a pet.

This sounds really fun, making magic more of a big "thing". Give muggleborn a big introductory course on how to avoid stepping in fairy circles, or how to keep your shadow from wandering off and causing mischief.
