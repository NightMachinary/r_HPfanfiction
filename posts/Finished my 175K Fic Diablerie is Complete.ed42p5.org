I finally finished my long work today! I've been working on it for over a year, and It's absolutely amazing to have it completed! Not to mention it's a very unique take on it, one that I've never seen before. It's around 175,000 words and 25 chapters! A Tom Riddle-centric fic with /no romantic pairings/!

I think I just wanted to shout out and celebrate! It's been a labor of love but I'm so proud of myself! I even drew two original drawings just for this story, which really pushed my artistic abilities to the max!

How many of you have things you're really proud of? Things to celebrate! Let's shout! Ahh!!!

** Congratulations!! I was waiting for this to read it; really liked the first few chapters- it's great to see a thoughtful integration of history into the story. eta: It's a great fic, but it would benefit from an edit that focused on punctuation.

*** No offence taken at all! The start of the story was before I asked a professor for help with grammatical and editing fixes with my writing. It improves later on, but I totally know what you mean! Ahh!! I really hope you enjoy !!

** Oh, shit, I think I found this on AO3 before I knew how to set up email notifications for that site. I remember thinking it was a great idea!

See you all in a day or so!
