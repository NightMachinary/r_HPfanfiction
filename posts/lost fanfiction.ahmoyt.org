I've read a good fanfiction some years ago...i believe it was called lithium. it was about Snape's daughter ... who joins the Order and becomes a double agent within Voldemort's ranks alongside Snape. some plot twists happen and she finds out Snape isn't her father at all....and yeah... it used to be posted on [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]]... it was a george/ ofc pairing... i can't find it anymore. i guess the uploader abandoned it and then took it off the site. did anybody read it or find it anywere else?
