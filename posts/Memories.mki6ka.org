I'd like every fanfic where Harry gets memories/is the reincarnation of someone. I've read a few where he was Grindelwald or Dumbledore in a past life or even Salazar Slytherin (oddly enough I've never seen one where he was Godric Griffindor). So basically any and all fanfics where he is either the reincarnation of someone or gets the memories of someone.

Harry is Salazar Slytherin, Cedric is Helga Hufflepuff, Luna is Rowena Ravenclaw, and Neville is Godric Gryffindor
