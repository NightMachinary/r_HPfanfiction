Hey guys, are there any good tom/hermione time travel fics where Hermione travels back in time to stop him from becoming the dark lord? I'm sure that this has been done well, anyone know the best fics?


** Best in what way?

The fics run the gamut from one extreme, where Hermione visits Tom at the orphanage before Dumbledore and simply murders Tom in cold blood; to the other extreme, where she goes back to when he is a 7th-year at Hogwarts and quickly becomes his love-slave.

Which subgenre are you looking for?

**** Well, I deliberately gave two extreme example to show the size of the "gamut". However, the former works as a one-shot, I think.

*** I'm looking for hermione to come back during his 6th or 7th year and falls for him and stops him from becoming evil. It can be dark, but I don't want an evil Tom. I was assuming that this had already been done very well and thought that there might be some consensus on a "best" fic.

**** I think someone recommended a story or two along these lines to me a while ago. I'll try to find them.

Overall, that's hard to pull off, simply because Tom is still a psychopath (i.e., incapable of love), who had, by then, already committed at least one murder (Myrtle) and made a horcrux. That is, he already became evil.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint]] this was linked 2 after yours on Reddit, her's one that MIGHT satisfy what you're looking for but I haven't read them in a while (they're just labeled T/Hr in my folder) I'm pretty sure this was a fairly believable one as well.

** Not a time travel fic but probably my favorite THr, and the author is solid I really like her work. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last]]

This one is time travel and decent enough. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5500156/1/Tempora-Abducto]]
