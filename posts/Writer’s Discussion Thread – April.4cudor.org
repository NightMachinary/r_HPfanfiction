• What stories are you currently developing?

• How is your writing progressing?

• Need some quick feedback on a story you've written? Post a link and get some advice.

• Are you in need of a beta/willing to beta someone else's story?

• Come across a handy piece of advice you'd like to share with other authors?

• If you have other writing-related thoughts, post away!


** Well... I posted the 46th chapter of my fic and have 4 chapters to go til I complete it. It's only taken me 10 years to complete it. :D

I like dark stuff and I could never find a fic that fulfilled what I wanted so I wrote it. Some people like it, some hate it, /cough/DLP/cough/ But I have enjoyed writing it. It feels great that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I like the feeling of finishing a project.

My next fic is a Voldemort won scenario. A very short fic in which after Harry dies and Voldemort takes over, Neville is put in the spotlight. He unwillingly leads a resistance, but a year later Harry is discovered alive. At the moment I thinking of ideas. But I want to focus on Harry and Neville's relationship, friendship, more so than the war part.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

***** Yes! The one bri-anna recommended is great. I also really like linkffn(champion by octaviusowl) and though it hasn't been updated in a while it's worth it for the epic triwizard tasks alone. linkffn(reign of the serpent) is an extremely compelling take on what if Slytherin himself ruled magical Britain, though that also updates very slowly.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** I finally began to pick up my AD/GG fic again, Friend and Foe. I don't write novel-length fanfiction - I save that amount of effort for original stories - but it's my first multi-chapter fic. It's an alternate universe where Hogwarts holds the Triwizard Tournament in their seventh years. I'm almost done with the third chapter, and am really excited for what's coming up. If you're interested, please check it out!

  "Mrs Bagshot," Albus said, carefully, pulling his collar from his neck with a long finger, "please forgive me if this is rude, but - isn't it, well, dangerous? Didn't someone die? If I recall correctly - which I usually do - the contestants in this tournament are terribly prone to dying."It's 1898 and Hogwarts, against all better judgement, is hosting the Triwizard Tournament. Albus is surprised when he meets a Durmstrang student who may not be on par with him in talent, but makes up for it in cleverness, charm, and spirit. Maybe he's met his rival, or maybe - just maybe - he's met his match.

** I'm currently working on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/story/story_edit_property.php?storyid=11690341][The Salem Settlement]], a HP/Fallout crossover. Feedback/Advice/Criticism is always welcome.

My writing is, as always, progressing way too slow. But then again, I am currently working on my Master-degree, so time is a precious ressource of high demand. I found a beta though. She does an amazing job and I can actually see this becoming better than my older stuff now. Its also a great learning experience.

I'm currently experiencing how important it is to connect with other writers, get some peer pressure going if you really want to become productive af. I'm also trying to make my dialogues better by strictly forbidding myself to use adverbs. Every time I have the urge to use them, or write an adverb out of habit, I make myself delete it and write something that shows instead of tells. I have yet to encounter a situation where the adverb would be better (with the exception of some fighting scenes where I forced the wordcount down to speed it up).

Also with the posting of the next chapter I'm going to split my 15.000 word chapters up into more digestable pieces.

I am framing it to how events, including a little help from Luna, could have caused Draco to choose the side of Light rather than return to the Death Eaters after Harry is "killed".

** I seem to have hit a bit of a dry period with my writing the past few months. I have no problem with ideas, but writing just feels so blah at the moment.

I published a new chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11755402/1/Snakes-and-Ladders][Snakes and Ladders]] a few days ago and I've started a one-shot for Draco where someone post-war feels that he escaped justice and takes the matter into their own hands. It's a plunny that wanted its own multi-chapter story, but I tamed it into something more manageable.

I also took on a little bit of beta work, which is great and really inspired me to go back and continue writing my own. I'm pretty picky with what work I'd take on - I hate correcting people's spelling and grammar because that's just tedious and not fun - but I love offering opinions and working with ideas.

I've also been working on a Harry Potter/Warcraft crossover that I haven't published yet. The hardest part is that while I want Harry (and Ginny) involved in some of the major events of the Warcraft universe I also don't want it to be a standard rehashing of story already told but now with Harry as the main character. I'm trying to avoid this by having Harry and Ginny play a background/secondary role where they have their own plot running parallel to the main story and intersecting for major events that might be subtly changed by Harry and Ginny's involvement.

** My story, /The Opposing Movement/, is going very well! I've just finished writing part 1 of 3, and I'm happy with the way it's turned out.

My beta is currently in the process of reading it, and I've discovered that DocX on fanfiction.net is pretty fiddly. I just finished all the bold/italic stuff of the entire story, I come back to it, and it's all plain again! Why?!

Anyway, if all goes well, I'll be able to start posting this a week or so from now. My plan for now is to post two chapters a week: one on Tuesday, one on Friday. I'm super-excited to start posting it after months and months of writing and planning!

I had trouble keeping the characters in-character, but the more scenes I write about them, the more I become used to them, and the easier it becomes writing them.

I'm shocked to find how attached I've become to the characters. I've already started writing part 2, and there are parts and scenes that left me close to crying after writing them. The more I discover about writing, the more I love it. I just can't do without it anymore.

** • What stories are you currently developing?

Currently I am working on completing a first draft of my multi chapter story "Hermione Granger and The Augeretis Fons". Which is a murder mystery set 6 years after the events of Deathly Hallows. I am also developing a second story which will be a follow on, it only has a vague working title at the moment of "Hermione Granger and The Shadows".

• How is your writing progressing?

In fits and starts. I find I'm either writing hot and getting 1000's of words on the page at a time or I'm a cold fish and struggle for a 100 words in a day.

• Need some quick feedback on a story you've written?

No thanks. I've been fortunate enough to find some great people who are helping in that capacity.

• Are you in need of a beta/willing to beta someone else's story?

Extra Betas are always welcome if anyone wants experience or practice, however I am fully committed for at least the next 6 weeks and cannot take on any more stories myself.

• Come across a handy piece of advice you'd like to share with other authors?

Honestly the best advice is to be flexible when taking feedback on board. You may not like it, you may not want to "kill your darlings" but it might be the right thing to do. Though it is equally important to know that you do not have to accept criticism or act on feedback just because someone gives it to you. You can always say "that's an interesting suggestion. No thanks" .

• If you have other writing-related thoughts, post away!

I have begun a HP Fan Fiction Writers discussion board on fictionpad.com Its a new site, there's only a half dozen of us but I'm hoping to grow it into being a permanent writing focused discussion. Feel free to swing on by any time.

** Posted Chapter 48 of HBS after much consternation. Chapters 49, 50, and 51 are written and need to be submitted to my beta. I'm half way through Chapter 52 and it looks like Book 2 will end on Chapter 55.

It's run a little longer than I expected. Book 1 was 24 chapters and ~150k words while Book 2 is going to be clear over 200k words and about 28 chapters. That's to be somewhat expected as the world has expanded in Book 2, but it's still 20k words above my target.

As I come to close Book 2, I realize that it's taken me 4 years to write Book 1 and Book 2 of HBS. That is roughly along the same pace as I wrote OBWL, which was only 251k words. Still, I feel that my writing has slowed. One factor is just the matter of inspiration, but another factor is that as I grow older, I find myself with less and less time to write. Where once I could write until 3 or 4 in the morning, I am exhausted at around 1030.

Book 3 will be about 150k words and I suspect that once I finish HBS, I will be retiring from the fanfic scene and focusing on original works. It has always been a desire of mine to publish and I can not realistically write fanfic and originals simultaneously with the time I have available.

**** The other main inspiration for HBS is the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. I can only hope to emulate a tiny fraction of his skill.

HBS more than anything has been one of my more realized works. I've always known how the story was going to unfold, but there have been little variations and wrinkles along the way. My previous stories have had a very thin outline and it has shown in the plot. Creating a more detailed outline, while seemingly simple, has made me a much more disciplined writer and HBS benefits from that.

Currently trying to get around that by just writing something different (a HP oneshot), and hope that this way I'll get back into the writing flow and also into writing my main fic. The oneshot is tentatively titled "The Lost Son" and is about James Potter meeting his adult son for the first time, and Harry is not quite what he expected. I'm having fun with it, and hope it will just get me back into writing more in general.

** Three stories ideas I was working on pretty much converged into one. Now, I have a post-Hogwarts HP/SW/SG1 crossover where the veil between life and death is pulled aside, and a small army of the dead returns to possess the living. From HP canon, this includes Sirius Black, Salazar Slytherin and Gellert Grindelwald. I've only posted [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11873851/1/Our-Kind-of-Traitor][the prologue]]. I never had a problem with ff.net's system before, but it's irritating right now. I can't pick the third fandom.

I'm mainly struggling with how many people are in this story. I can't remove them. They are necessary. I've tried removing a couple and hit a plot hole. So they all have to be there, and I need a way to switch between them without confusing the reader. Still working on it.

** I finally had an idea which I haven't actually seen in a fic before. It's probably out there already, hidden away somewhere, but that's good enough for me. To sum it up: religious fanatic Harry sets Britain ablaze in second Inquisition.

I'm in a mix of the planning and contemplative stages. Do I really want to try to figure this out and write it?

I'm also having trouble picking where to start, timewise. The point of divergence is pre-Hogwarts, but writing pre-Hogwarts, all seven years of Hogwarts, and the post-Hogwarts conclusion is quite daunting. The real meat of the story will be post-Hogwarts, but I'm not sure how to get the characterization and such of Harry's previous ~11 years of life in there. I could do flashbacks, but that feels a bit clunky. I could do veiled references and such to previous events, which feels a more elegant solution, but then I have trouble picking a place to start.

I've written a prologue (~1k words), which is heavily dependent on when I decide to start the story. I'll likely keep it anyways, since it contains the POD, but it will need some tweaking and definitely some literary editing when I get more of the outline hammered out.

However, as I'm working full time, looking for work on my days off, along with all of life's other joys, I'm not quite sure if starting a project in which I'm a relative novice (no literary experience here, just technical writing) is something I really want to do.

** I posted Chapter 24 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10210053/24/Harry-Potter-and-the-Untitled-Tome][Untitled Tome]] a few days ago, much to my own disbelief. The help that I've received in the WbA threads over at DLP has been invariably useful to tightening the many loose bolts plaguing the whole machine... the pacing in almost every subplot, essentially.

I wouldn't say no to more feedback of course, hehe.

Now that the ostensibly filler-y but "completely necessary" fluff is out of the way, I'm facing the feat of writing a series of seemingly disconnected but equally pivotal moments for number 25. I don't wanna be Peter Molyneux up in this witch, so I'll keep my mouth shut from here on: especially because the proverbial scaffolding might crumble to ash if I handle this improperly.

No pressure, me. No pressure.

I'm not sure why, but some people are picky just for the sake of being edgelords. You don't have any forgettable stock phrases. While you /do/ have some !tags, it's not overdone and they're unique enough to grab the reader's attention.

** I have several plot ideas in mind, but I'm looking to start a long-haul series AU, beginning from /Chamber of Secrets/.

I can't decide whether or not Hermione gets the Diary instead of Ginny to begin with, or if Hermione never gets Petrified. The events of /Chamber of Secrets/ happen, but Harry and his friends end up finding a new way to defeat Tom Riddle's memory. Instead of Harry using a basilisk fang, not knowing the object is a Horcrux at the time, he finds a way to permanently 'seal' that piece of soul to its container. [As in, the memory can no longer feed off the life of others, or use others' magic.]

In essence, the Diary becomes harmless. My current outline is that Harry & Co manage to seal Riddle's memory inside the Diary, making it harmless, but the memory inside is too enraged at his defeat, and refuses to respond for quite a while to anyone writing in said Diary. Differences in plot involve Harry & Co using the Diary to try and defeat Voldemort.

I'm a Tomione fan, so I was hoping to focus on Hermione slowly forming a friendship over the years with the Diary Riddle. Friendship, as I don't plan on writing anything remotely romantic for her in nature until the AU of /Half-Blood Prince/ or /Deathly Hallows/. Also because it's hilarious for me to imagine their interactions.

Feel free to offer suggestions and advice!

Assuming Fawkes never intervened but Harry was able to convince the Basilisk to obey the winner of the duel between the two parselmouths, Harry might make his way out of the Chamber with nothing to report except that they were too late.

He refused to let Ginny die in the book, and he's still a second year in my story. He doesn't know what the Killing Curse is until his fourth year, in /Goblet of Fire/. In this story, he's still his canon self, and canon events don't diverge until /Chamber of Secrets/. Everything after that, depending on when the Trio attempts to use the Diary, is up for fair game.
