** i don't know, was he?

i think he definitely Could have pulled someone but i am a believer that his obsesion with lilly wasn't really sexual, it was manifestation of him having an unhealthy attachment style due to daddy (and mummy) issues

he probably has fucked, but he doesn't seem like a relationship type of person in canon so...

****** First of all, it doesn't require a hair, just "a bit of whoever [you] want to turn into." From the fact that Barty kept Moody alive, it's assumed that the part must be taken from a living person, but that is never actually stated. Voldemort was shown to be fond of keeping prisoners, after all.

In any case, they were friends as children. If she ever wrote him a letter, he'd have her saliva. He could potentially have multiple items with her skin cells on it. Heck, she had long hair: if she's like the rest of us humans, she would have occasionally lost several hairs when pulling out a hair tie.

Obviously, with her being dead (and assuming the "must be live when taken" rule is true), he'd have a limited supply. Even if he had a lock of her hair from a childhood haircut (or swiped her hairbrush when he arrived too late to Godric's Hollow), it's a finite---but not non-existent---supply.
