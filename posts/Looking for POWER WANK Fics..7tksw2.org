** I'm assuming OP means fics where characters are ludicrously overpowered and it basically takes over the plot, right?

My question would have been characters powerfully wanking? Or makes you want to wank powerfully.

Alas, didn't turn out to be.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper?

*** Think about it this way:

Q:Is Harry the most powerful character?

If the answer is no, you make him the most powerful character, be it making every one else stupid, giving Harry 13 titles, all the money in the world, a magical penis that grants wishes, or just having him be the edgiest edge lord 'who Give A F***!', Harry must be stupid powerful, and there doesn't need to be a lot of logic behind it.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
