Harry gets killed by Voldemort like in the 7th book, but he meets Lily instead of Dumbledore. She tells him to act smarter, that Dumbledore was manipulating him and then she sent him back in time to restart. She said that James was pretending to be him to distract Dumbledore.

That's all I remember

Thanks
