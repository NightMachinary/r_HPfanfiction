** Interesting question! You're going to get a very particular slice of stories by asking here, because we represent a very particular slice of the fandom; If I were to make a caricature, I would probably say that your typical reader on [[/r/HPff]]:

- Is a dude
- Reads all or most of their fanfiction on fanfiction.net
- Prefers action, adventure, and comedy over romance
- Has only started reading fanfiction since DH was published
- Doesn't like slash

Note that none of these things are necessarily typical of the fandom as a whole. The oldest, most influential fics (though not necessarily the most well-known today) were originally published on Yahoo mailing groups and on livejournal. FF.net, while the largest site for Harry Potter fanfiction, is one of at least thirty or so different sites that were out there, many of which were dedicated to a single concept or ship. It's also worth noting that fics with ships are massively more common than genfic, though most people here probably don't have an OTP (this is probably on account of reading fanfiction after all the pairings have been sorted out). You're also going to see a lot more frustration with common tropes here than exists in the wild, due to it having been almost a decade since the last book was published.

That being said! Here's my shot at listing the most well-known fics and authors out there. (Keeping in mind that I'm certainly affected by some of those same biases) (And also keeping in mind that none of these are necessarily recommendations).

Tier I: Most well-known fics ever published (influential/known outside the fandom):

- [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/1][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Less Wrong]] (What if Harry had been raised by scientists?)
- [[http://myimmortalrehost.webs.com/chapters122.htm][My Immortal by tara gilesbie]] (Infamous for the inability to tell whether it is a horribly crafted genuine fic or a beautifully crafted trollfic.)

Annnd that's pretty much it, I think, as far as known-outside-of-fandom goes.

Tier II: Most influential inside the fandom (creators/codifiers of inescapable tropes):

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheDracoTrilogy][The Draco Trilogy by Cassandra Clare]] (first fic to have Draco as an anti-villain than a bad guy. First well-known fic to have ambiguous sexuality rather than just slash or het. Creator of LeatherPants!Draco, though it was a joke. Infamous for a plagiarism scandal. The author is now a best-selling novelist.)
- [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Maya_(fan_writer)][The Complete Works of Maya]] (along with Cassandra Clare, codified fanon Draco. Notable for having this characterization be compatible with canon. Wrote primarily Harry/Draco slash. Again, is now a published novelist)
- Severitus (No links because I don't know any of his stories off the top of my head. Invented the Snape-as-Harry's Father genre, which, together with Snape-as-Harry's-Mentor, is called severitus)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][The Sacrifices arc, by Lightning on the Wave]] (Creator of the wildly popular Wrong Boy Who Lived (WBWL) genre)

.

Anyway, that's my best attempt at helping you out! I've tried to give you a different cross-section of stories than others probably will, especially in aiming at influential rather than well-known fics. So I hope that's helpful.

As a parting bit of introduction, you should know that the four most popular characters within the fandom are, by far, Harry, Draco, Hermione, and Snape. Thus, the most popular ships are pairings between those four (with the least popular being Draco/Snape and the others being inescapably popular). However, for good any of those, you'll probably have to venture further afield than fanfiction.net.

Cheers!

*** Yeah, I think this sub has a very different cross section of fandom than what I grew up in.

Big fics I remember were the Psychic Serpent series (finished) and Paradigm of Uncertainty series (unfinished but with notes on how it would have ended). I never see either of those mentioned here, but they're very old at this point. But I remember them being HUGE.

** The first thing you got to know is that popularity does not correlate to how good a story is. If you look at the 25 most popular fics in the fandom, you can be certain that almost all of them are bad. That being said, "A Black Comedy" is on that list, and it is the story I will always recommend to people just getting into the fandom - linkffn(3401052). The author (Nonjon) has other great works as well.

On the Way to Greatness and DrizzleWizzle's series are popular Slytherin!Harry fics. Both are great, but unfinished. Backwards with Purpose and Nightmares of Futures Past are popular "serious" time travel fics. Methods of Rationality and Year of Darkness are both popular, but controversial. Boy Who Lived is dearly beloved, but it's unfortunately unfinished and abandoned.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The best-known story is probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) which can also be found at [[http://www.hpmor.com/][hpmor.com]]. It has a subreddit dedicated to it that's bigger than this one at [[/r/hpmor]] (although you shouldn't visit it if you plan to read the story, as there are a lot of spoilers).

However, a lot of people on this subreddit don't like the story, for a number of reasons. I recommend trying it out yourself. It's a lot easier to enjoy, in my opinion, before you've read a lot of other stories. It was iirc the second fanfiction story I ever read, and I liked it a lot back then, although I'm less enamoured now.

More generally, to find well-known and popular fanfiction stories you can visit the Harry Potter section of fanfiction.net and sort by favourites/follows/reviews. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&s=2][Here's a link]] to all complete stories in English, with ratings from K to M, sorted by favourites. Use the 'Filters' button to change the sort criteria. Many of these are considered to be less than amazing by this subreddit, but they're a good place to start. The most popular stories are those that appeal to a wide range of readers, but as a trade-off don't appeal as strongly to any individual group. Nevertheless, it's a good place to get your feet wet, so to speak.

**** A lot of people joined purely for the 'Final Exam' - basically, the author set a challenge where the readers had to come up with a solution for the protagonist's situation in order for the story to have a positive ending - failure would result in the protagonist's death. A bunch of readers used the sub to co-ordinate a solution, which ended up being the correct one. It was really fun and I wish more authors did it, but I can see why it's hard to pull off - you need a lot of Chekhov's guns, as well as a complicated situation with a findable solution, and enough readers with enough investment to try to find that solution.

** Nnnnope. Not enough grittiness in this thread. Linkffn(Circular Reasoning; Renegade Cause). Those two are not as popular as some others, but they're still fairly well-known and absolutely worth the time to read them.

Also this: linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). It's biggest flaw imo is that it's abandoned (and I keep hoping someday I'll eat those words), but what's there is still pretty great. And it has the best Voldemort in the fandom.

Finally, linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) is old and maybe a little forgotten, but it's a classic. It hasn't aged as well as some other old fics (like Circular Reasoning, for example) and it has a rocky start, but once it gets going, it keeps going until the end.
