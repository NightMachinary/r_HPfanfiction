** Harry, who's been cursed by Voldemort and Bellatrix at this point, fights though it and casts /sectumsempra/. His hands, shaking under the curse, make the spell slash more wildly and Draco gets his throat cut. He bleeds out before Snape can arrive and use the counter curse; /priori incantatem/ on Draco's wand, the Cruciatus damage on Harry, and the Dark Mark on Draco's arm make for an excellent argument for self-defense.

Snape has to let the Death Eaters in and kill Dumbledore himself.

*** /Is/ there any way to even fight through it? If Harry had cast Crucio on Voldemort himself in the graveyard as an unexpected attack, and it landed, wouldn't he be just as disabled and floundering in agony as anyone else? It doesn't seem to matter who you are, it's not like a taser - it's torture. It'll put you down.

And on that note, simple two step plan to kill Voldemort if you were realistic: Cast crucio to disable him, then hit him with a killing curse while he's still on the ground. Boom, dead.

Like Thor just killing Thanos in Endgame. No plot armor.

**** If you can hit him with the Cruciatus, you might as well hit him with the Killing Curse and have a one-step plan instead.

Hitting Voldemort with a spell in the first place is the difficult bit.

***** Do any of the good guys ever use the Killing Curse? Does anyone light, other than Harry, ever use /any/ of the Unforgiveables?

The "good guys" go through the way with both arms tied behind their back and weights around their ankles. It's like trying to fight terrorists when they've got guns and you only use TASERs.

#+end_quote

McGonagall uses the Imperius Curse and Barty gave his aurors leave to do so in the first war. Also, Dumbledore, when he picks Harry up in HBP, encourages Harry to use any spell he knows if they're attacked. We don't really see the adults fight and, from what I can see, killed off before they could do what they did the 1st go round.

****** Yes, we know that in the first war the Aurors were authorised to use the Unforgiveables.

We also know from Lupin in DH that the Order fights to kill. It's really just Harry who objects to it.

That does not mean that they are throwing killing curses around like they are going out of fashion. Otherwise, the Death Eater charge would have never reached the walls of Hogwarts.

****** Just because you're fighting for your life, and the life of others, and you've possibly even accepted that you'll likely kill someone with a lethal spell during the fight doesn't mean you're able to muster up the extreme urge to /actually kill someone/ that's required to cast a killing curse. That's why it's an unforgivable spell. Because the ability to successfully cast it means you /want/ to kill someone. Not just needing to because you're fighting for your life, but genuinely desiring their death. This is further harder when you aren't casting it at a specific person, but rather into a crowd. At that point you don't need a desire to kill the person you're casting at, but rather the desire to kill someone at all.\\
The very fact they're not using that spell is the same reason they're on the defensive side of the war.

Additionally, it's a spell with a very long incantation, and likely quite hard, if not impossible to cast it silently. You'd be better suited casting several silent spells in the time it takes to cast a killing curse

**** Depends on your head canon, I suppose, I've seen a couple fics where Harry and Ron took turns /crucio/ing each other to build up immunity, like with the Imperius.

Also, I'd misremembered; Bella tried to /crucio/ Harry in return in the Atrium, but missed.

**** It'd probably be very difficult to fight through it while the curse is held, but I imagine a scenario similar to Harry cursing Bellatrix. Draco probably lacks the pure hatred and '...you have to /mean/ it...' making for a relatively weak /Cruciatus/. Harry is able to recover quickly and retaliate.

**** Even better: If you can "stun" him with the Cruciatus then blow his head off with a (sawed-off-)shotgun :) (you would have to lift the Cruciatus to fire the Avada and that gives Voldemort time to either retreat or fight back!), which is:

a) Badass and b) Poetic justice, the muggle-hating Dark-Lord killed by "a muggle contraption" :D

*** Hmm, I believe Snape dies with Draco due to his unbreakable vow.

Sidenote: "Harry kills Draco" stories always irk me bc they're always a "punish Harry" fest full of a bunch of preachy people and a crying Harry. Dumbledore is disappointed for sure, but if Snape is dead he has far more pressing matters. Harry should be horrified at taking a life, but he definitely moves on to feeling justified. Narcissa might die as well.

**** Snape takes a vow to: "...watch over... Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes... to the best of (his) ability, protect him from harm... and should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform."

Draco clearly fails, so Snape has to kill Dumbledore or die. His /other/ failures (in watching out and protecting) don't cause his death, provided he did attempt to compete them to the best of his abilities.
