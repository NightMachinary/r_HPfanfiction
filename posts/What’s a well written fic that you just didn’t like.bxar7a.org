** It gets rec'd left and right on this sub, but I genuinely can't stand The Arithmancer (& sequel). The premise is cool, and I /love/ a strong Hermione (or any strong female lead), but Hermione's characterization is flat-out sociopathic and nobody seems to notice or care?

I generally dislike the "rationalist" style in HP fanfic, but it's the sheer emotional disconnect in The Arithmancer that makes me hate it in specific.

*** Hermione might be somewhat sociopathic in the Arithmancer, but I think the problem is worse in that the world is too.

Let me explain what I mean by that trite cliche. There's no real emotional connection to the story for me, and my reaction to it ended up being, 'oh boy. look how the author cleverly anticipated and subverted canon events. so clever'. The characters who die in the Battle of Hogwarts are presented as a /list/. Dumbledore's death (not really spoilers, as the fic follows stations so strongly that you're basically just waiting for it) has no fanfare at all. And finally, it doesn't even do the one thing HPMOR did right: making the villain as competent as the protagonist. For some time it seems like Rookwood might rise to be an actual challenge for Hermione, before he gets offed and Hermione goes back to steamrolling the Death Eaters using proprietary spells and nanotechnology.

*** I actually don't mind Hermione's characterisation, though you are right that no one addresses it or sees it. Additionally, her character dwarfs Harry's, a person she is supposed to be friends with and is committed to helping. He is so underdeveloped, that I find it frustrating. I do love the relationship between Hermione and Sinistra, and really appreciated her existential crisis about Dementors/Souls (seriously, magical people should have more issues with this). The writing is good and I enjoy the exploration of arithmacy, but good lord, sticking that close to canon makes it tedious (it's why I haven't read the Accidental Animagus). I found myself skimming large sections of the story. Hermione does go to Beaubatons, which is a break from canon, but it read like another place for people to be impressed by her skills.

*** Fundamentally, I can get behind Starfox's mission to depict:

1. A grittier, more detailed vision of wizarding warfare, and

2. A Game of Thrones/House of Cards-type approach to magical politics (multi-polar, lots of wheeling and dealing, everyone has to get their hands dirty, "good guys" don't always win).

However, Starfox's particular execution tends to put me off due to the other common themes he has in all his works:

A. Nerfed magic/Muggleification of magic.

B. Super Hermione/Hermione PoV.

C. Revolutionary themes rather than a more realistic approach of reformists becoming absorbed into the establishment and only able to achieve partial reform.

D. An exaggerated political set-up, particularly around pure-blood/Muggleborn dynamics.

I feel like C and D especially undermine "mission 2" as they reduce the scope for shades of grey/political themes which are analogous to real-world political problems. I much prefer an approach based on a fleshed out canon than a complete AU political set-up.

Frankly I just prefer stories that are mainly focused on Harry. This is also why I don't read a lot of Maurader's-era fics, or slice of life fics that aren't about Harry...Harry is the anchor in this fandom, for me.

I enjoy the H/Hr ship when the mood strikes, I enjoy fics with Hermione as a major character...I just prefer it to be locked in with Harry for most of the time (like Canon).

Obviously this is all about personal preference, but I figured I'd offer up a reason why I personally am not chomping at the bit to read stories that are otherwise well-written, well plotted, and complete(!)

I remember one Naruto fanfic where an adult Kakashi gets sent back in time to his childhood before his dad died. He still had all of his skills, all of his jutsus, but he still couldn't stop his dad from committing suicide; he walks away from his house, leaving his father alone, and doesn't even bother to leave a shadow clone.

******* Eh, while i am not a fan of downer endings, I understand how they fit some stories. They are certainly in a different category from the "I am just using this as an excuse to rehash Canon scenes with my new character".

The one that comes to mind was that one where Hermione/Snape got caught in an infinite time loop at Hogwarts and it was unbreakable so they we're doomed to repeat the same day till they wore through time itself and the color/structure of the universe fades away. While I am not a fan of doomed endings, I can respect the writing and the story.

Personally I prefer stories that put the MC's through the ringer but end on a positive (or at least hopeful) note. I enjoy my characters overcoming the odds

I love tech uplift, ISOT's, and elf meet tank works.

I would put a distinction on futility as a story and futility as an ending. Futility as a story works pretty good.you can still make progress toward overcoming a hopelessly futile situation. Best examples of this that come to mind are the TV Series Daybreak, which has the MC trying to overcome an ending that seems inevitable as the main plot. The other one was the time loop Jofferey fanfic that redeems the character by having him travel back each time he dies.

Maybe that if a story is character centric it should have a character arc? And the best way to show that is through their actions? I'm speaking very generally now. I just like talking about what I think makes a good story.

Take that movie groundhog day. Even though everything seemed hopeless the main character still acted. He tried to kill himself. He tried to help people. He learned to play the piano. In short the character acted. Not only that but if I remember correctly the timeloop even ended at the end. Making those actions worthwile.

Edit: Just want to say: I strongly recommend this fic. Like sfinebyme said, it's a great character study with complex emotions and internal conflict. I also think one reason for writing time travel without trying to change things is the fact that their very presence DOES change things. Because the traveler was always there, it gives an entirely different perspective on the characters and events. Also, I am a sucker for themes of endurance and humanity, which I think can be explored really well in these types of stories.

*** It's such a strange beast. On the one hand, the sentences are grammatically correct, the paragraphs comprehensible, and the chapters push the plot along. Effect follows from cause, and the story is sort of reasonable, and it's actually complete.

In that regard, HP:MOR is better than 99% of the shitpiles of words in fanfic.

But it's just so hard to read. The MC is a contemptible little asshole, the characters all feel flat, and the plot while occasionally entertaining ultimately fails because the person at the center of all of it is such a grating fuckwad that it's hard to care what happens to or around him.

I've also found that any time some strongly recs HP:MOR or thinks it's the most awesome thing ever, they're an obnoxious child (literally or metaphorically).

I tend to skip a lot of stories due to pairings or premises that I just can't get behind, so I usually have advance warning when I won't like a story and generally only drop fics because they're poorly written in one way or another. That said, there are different ways a fic can be well written, so:

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is /very/ well plotted in the second year. The author knows that we're all familiar with canon and with stories that mindlessly rehash it to hide a mystery within a mystery, and when all the pieces fall into place, it's truly great. That said, the storytelling in general is quite bad, being full of extraneous characters that add nothing (I enjoy the added depth given to the Weasley family, but that doesn't make it any less tangential to the narrative, which is why I say it's bad storytelling and not bad writing), hypercompetent​ non-characters (Hermione's crush on Lockhart was taken out because she's Too Sensible For A Thing Like That, and she, along with every Slytherin in the story, is less of a realistically flawed person and more of a high tech SolutionBot), and /genuinely terrible/ worldbuilding (having details is good; an apparent fundamental incapability to organically work them into the narrative is not).

** Methods of rationality - I know it's good, I just don't like Harry. Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path - again, just don't like Harry in it.

** I mean, the question is rather malformed, since of course you wouldn't /not/ like a well-written fic; if you don't, it means it's not really well-written in your eyes!

But if you mean from just a purely grammatical perspective, it'd have to be Methods of Rationality.

I've never been as bored as I was when trying to drudge through that sludge. Near a million words, I think, and still in Year 1 if I'm not mistaken. Absolutely ridiculous; the author has no sense of pacing and couldn't string together a compelling plot to save their life, but somehow it's the most reviewed and popular fic, as I keep hearing (to my chagrin).

The initial premise is somewhat interesting for a couple chapters, but it quickly starts dragging on, becoming really overplayed, falling victim to an author that just can't get a bloody move on.

If i was to describe HPMOR in two words, it'd be "tedious, overrated".
