I remember reading the summary of a Harry Potter fanfic on fanfiction.net 2 years ago, and I felt the sudden urge to read it. The summary basically said that in this fic, Harry was sorted into Slytherin, and that the first 4 events in the Harry Potter novels were mashed into one year, i.e, the stone was placed in Hogwarts, the basilisk was unleashed, a prisoner of Azkaban escaped and the triwizard tournament was reenacted, all during Harry's first year. If any of you know what the title is, please do notify me.


** I've seen this before. I believe it's a Harry/Daphne story, and IIRC, it was as much of a mess as the summary makes it sound.

  There are poisons that blind you, and poisons that open your eyes. The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. At Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns to value pride, loyalty, and poison over mercy. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, assorted ships later. No Horcruxes. Cross-posted (with extra content) to Ao3.
