Oc and tom riddle pairing but also a time travel fic. Preferrably modern age OC. Any recommendations?


** Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

Tom and Jerry take over the world. Jerry is an OC time traveler with an odd sense of humor.

**** Jerry's true name is unknown, he chose this one as a reference to the Tom & Jerry cartoons which hasn't even started when he first introduces himself.
