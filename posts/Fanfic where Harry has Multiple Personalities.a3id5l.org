I'm a psych major, and we just learned about Dissociative Identity Disorder, and it reminded me of a fanfic I read a while back. It's either on Archive of Our Own or Fanfic.net, probably decent length, and has Harry creating multiple personalities to deal with the Dursleys, including one who comes out when abuse happens, normal Harry, one who is super powerful and dangerous, and maybe a few others. If anyone knows it, let me know! Thanks!


** There are two that I know of, but I haven't read either, so I can't comment on quality. /Broken Mind, Fractured Soul/ linkffn(2529586) and /Me, Myself, and I/ linkffn(2266187).

There's also a C2 on FFN that might interest you: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Troubled-Psychology/24454/]]

  Harry Potter is a wizard, which surprises him. But Harry Potter is also a Multiple, which surprises everyone. But that's not the end of the surprises. Note: Trans!Harry eventually. This part is complete. The story will continue as "The Many Faces Go To War." Check my profile or subscribe to my author page for updates.

  It seems that Harry has Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder). To him, this is nothing new. He's known of his alters for as long as he can remember. Magic, however, is a different story entirely. When he finds himself sorted into Slytherin, he learns that the choices he must make are more important than he ever imagined. ((Currently in Book 3))

*** This was good. The DID is explored perfectly by an author who has it themselves. But, I was heartbroken to read the last A/N about her experiences with another writer Lillielle who wrote Shattered. It's likely abandoned now too :(

  Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Harry Potter.A/U. Voldy won't really be a problem, although he's still alive, just greatly weakened. (And only a few Horcruxes).Harry has Dissociative Identity Disorder. When he was a child, he was aware of his alters, but as the trauma continued, his dissociation grew until he blocked them out. Essentially.MIght have still worked out just fine until he was Sorted into Slytherin...where a certain Potions Professor ends up eventually taking him under his wing and discovering his little...secret. :3

** im reading a fanfic right now called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/][Moratorium]] , it has a f!harry who refers to herself as ”Moratorium”, but “acts” like Harry. it's a bit confusing, but it is a double personality. although, im only chapter 3, and the author has yet to call it a personality disorder.
