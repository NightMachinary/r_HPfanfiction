I am looking for fics that have as central characters Slytherins but they are regular people not part of some sort of elite where they are competing for the top of the social ladder. Also it would be great if they didn't all act aloof and superior. It's fine if some of them are brutish violent bullies and it's fine if the canonically established people come from actual influential families (the Malfoys, the Blacks) but they are still a rarity. Thank you!


** Well, spiteful sorting hat is practically on the nose here. Even Blaise's mom is pretty chill. No super political kids, no lordships... it's quite boring actually. I still like the fic.

EDIT: Also props to the fic for utilising Millicent, she's the least used Slytherin first year.

  "Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice with a touch of malicious glee. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that..."

  There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad that wasn't in Slytherin... well at least according to Hagrid. A chance meeting with Professor Slughorn changes Harry's outlook just in time for the sorting.

** Most of these have Harry in Slytherin, because I'm not sure if the other ones I like where he's not a Slytherin have enough Slytherin content to recommend, if that makes sense.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. He is put into Slytherin. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It is complete and has a sequel
- This isn't Harry-centric. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.
- One of my favorite one-shots is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him. All the one-shots in this series are great, but this is the most Slytherin-focused.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Definitely recommend this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] is post-Hogwarts, but deals a lot with the relationships between Griffs and Slytherins. Everyone acts like a real human, not an edge lord.

Happy reading!

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

** If you don't mind self recs and female Harry, Millicent Bulstrode and Theo Nott are both regular people in my fic. Draco is around some of the time and he's a bit of a brat still. Pansy and Daphne appear occasionally, but are also just regular people.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

Leo Inter Serpentes also has some pretty regular Slytherin kids. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin][Better be Slytherin]] this is only first year and is Severitus but not the whole “Harry is a poor defenceless baby who Snape will protect”. Snape and Harry don't get off on the right foot but after Harry had a breakdown during Quiditch(Sp?) Flint confronts Snape. The first years are all just 11 year olds and not mini adults. Which is nice. Harry is mostly friends Theodore Nott and Millicent.

Slight trigger warning: there is some sexual harassment from an older Slytherin and rape threats from him. He is expelled though.
