It's that time of year again where I start to read through my favorite fics with really well done Christmas scenes. Vox Corporis' tree decorating was particularly great, but I know I've read others.

What are your favorite fics that either orient around or include a Christmas scene?

Cheers!


** Linkffn( the serpents gaze). I really liked the firs year Christmas scene

  There are poisons that blind you, and poisons that open your eyes. The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. At Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns to value pride, loyalty, and poison over mercy. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, assorted ships later. Previously called A More Ambitious Boy.
