  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** It is an element of several time travel fics, most notably Delenda Est. However, keep in mind that there is a sharp decline in quality around the halfway mark when one of the authors dropped the project and the remaining one drove it into a wall.

**** You might want to look through: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Potter-Professor/76802/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]

It has all Potters as professors there though, so Lily and James as well. And slash. Lots of slash. But glancing over the stories there, a few ones should fit your request.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
