Any good fanfics Harry Potter/ Witcher? A really good one I came across is the swallow and the dragon.


** Why is it that everytime these crossovers happen, Harry always ends up using Witcher magic? They're fucking useless compared to wizarding world magic. It's like comparing a monkey using a stone to crack a walnut, to a... Well, you know what I mean.

*** Yeah but being a Witcher is so much cooler than being a wizard. Where have you seen these fics?

**** Why the hell would I want to be a witcher? Stupefy would down a witcher faster than he could swing a sword.

*** Not sure which HP/Witcher crossovers you have read that makes you say "everytime", but in every single one I have read (the most popular ones) it is shown that wizards are far superior to witchers and Harry learns not even one bit of Witcher magic.

** There aren't many sadly. The best in my opinion is "The Swallow and the Dragon" by Flameraiser. There are only a few chapters left and I've enjoyed rereading it multiple times since I found it. linkffn(12343855)

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.
