Rather it's Hogwarts magic itself doing it, some Aurors, or an outside force.

With so much craziness happening, even if parents don't really believe the kids, there should be some concern with some of the rumors that are at least flying around.

Something like Pertrification Proliferation by White Squirrel; doesn't have to be exactly like that, mind you.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can be any warnings, can be on any site.

No Weasley Bashing.

No OP Harry, no Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is okay, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** "Professor Flitwick? I keep developing thick fur...I mean, I've seen Madam Pomfrey and she fixed it a few times but it keeps coming back. Do you know what it might be?"

"Well, let me see...hmm...oh my, with this and the wings some of the other students sprouted..."

"Professor?"

"If my suspicions are correct, it looks like Helga Hufflepuff completed her work after all. This appears to be the work of a highly modified, sophisticated Environmental Adaption spell enveloping Hogwarts and its grounds."

"Oh...so I'm getting thick fur because the castle decided that the weather's too cold?"

"Hmm...no, I'd say it's because of the disasters that keep hitting the school. That business with Quirrell, and then the basilisk, and then those dementors and then...well, it's a defensive spell, which must have triggered with the castle coming under attack so many times, designed to give the castle's defenders adaptive protection to anything they face. Incidentally, I suspect that thick fur will defend you against a lot of spells."

"So, if more trouble comes along, I might transform more? Me and the other students?"

"Frankly, Mr. Potter, at the rate you get into trouble I suspect you'll be a bipedal nundu/phoenix hybrid by the end of this year."

*** Sounds like Crawler from Worm. Also sounds like the perfect send-up of the whole trope "Harry Potter, but Harry gets a power-up" that comprises like 60% of the fandom.

** Petrification Proliferation : linkffn(11265467)

Already mentioned in the OP, but I thought it'd be nice to have the link up for those who haven't read it.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Crossover with 40k, not quite sure if it is what you want, but is pretty similar in vein.

linkffn(8400788)

He is quite OP but in other ways, he's completely clueless.

** These are the ones I know of where Hogwarts itself takes action:

linkffn(Hogwarts Protection System by kb0). Not so much horrible stuff, as a critical mass of dark items.

linkffn(The Headmaster by Chris Robins). When Umbridge casts the Cruciatus, Hogwarts takes action.

linkffn(Watch What You Say by Manchester). Hogwarts can only take action against those things it's been made to watch for.

I remember a couple of others where outside forces cause changes at Hogwarts and/or Wizarding Britain, but can't come up with the titles at the moment.

  If there are intent-based protective wards such as Albus erected around the Dursleys, how would Hogwarts be if it had some?

  Harry and Co. are caught just as they're trying to floo to the DoM and rescue Sirius. Harry doesn't give into Umbridge's demands and in her rage, she curses him. Unwittingly, she sets something much larger into motion [rev3].

  Hermione has had enough. More than enough. Light years beyond enough. Don't ever make a very intelligent witch furious and not expect her to retaliate as nastily as possible with the most powerful magic closest at hand.
