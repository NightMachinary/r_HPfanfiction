Does anyone have some other ways to destroy Horcruxes? Especially a way that could possibly happen accidentally if the, um, horcrux destroyer wasn't crazy enough to use fiendfyre.

** Any extremely destructive substance would likely do. Like, a Horcrux isn't specifically weak to Basilisk Venom, it's just that Basilisk Venom falls under a very small category of substances. There are probably some extremely caustic muggle acids that would do the job.

Alternatively, you could bring the horcrux to Mount Doom and pitch it into the lava.

*** My head cannon has always been that a Horcrux is essentially immune to all conventional mundane forces. Basilisk Venom is /magical/, it has, as a base property, an inimical effect on all living things, including, apparently, Horcruxes. If vold was smart he would have chucked his Horcruxes into the sun; it wouldn't have bothered them.

**** That's fine, but my head canon is that I dislike the idea of a magical thing automatically being immune to everything that is muggle. Like, wizards never getting cancer, or never catching mundane diseases, that doesn't make sense to me. The same would be said of chucking a horcrux into the sun - it should absolutely disintegrate a horcrux into oblivion, considering it likely a thousand times hotter than fiendfyre. Being a part of a nature should not preclude something to having no effect. It should not be as simple as merely filling out a checkbox.

***** Ehh, I dont think everything magical is orthogonal to the mundane, but at least some forms of magic are likely to be more /conceptual/ than physical. For instance, a basic shield charm might just do something like 'absorb 1000 N of energy in the form of heat, kinetic, or magic radiation' where as a much more advanced spell would be along the lines of 'create a small inconsistency in space time such that the reality on side A of the shield is not contiguous with reality on side B of the shield'. If i was Vold, i wouldn't just make my Horcrux 'as hard as diamond', i would make it 'a fixed point in space time'. One allows mundane effects to work, the other does not; at least not until you hit frankly preposterous energy levels like a black hole by which point things have just gotten silly.

Fiendfyre is not destructive because it is particularly hot: it is a form of magic that erodes all physical matter, somewhat like a strong acid or base but more so because it is always operating at maximum potency and doesn't care for chemical properties. Magical Antimatter, if you will. Magic /is/ sometimes just 'thing A+1' but sometimes it is 'thing B', and thus not really comporable.

** Xenomorph blood--damn that would be a helluva crossover! Harry, Hermione, and Neville trained by Yautjas to be the greatest predators of all hunt xenomorphs so they can use their blood to destroy their enemy.

Hydrofluoric acid.

A really nice balsamic vinaigrette for a crack fic.

The exact opposite of fiendfyre, the fires of heaven which only harm evil.

Trump showing compassion for someone that can't help him.

A patch for Just Cause 3 that makes it playable.

Don't destroy them, just bind them and riddle in a massive cell designed to keep him in it then drop it into the marianas trench.

Use a magical cannon to launch the fuckers into the sun. It'll take a while for them to get their once they leave atmo but it would be a pretty awesome idea.

** Unlike many other people in this thread, I don't think that horcruxes are /inherently/ immune or even resistant to damage. Harry certainly wasn't.

Rather, the resistance is the result of additional spells which are layered on top of the horcrux during and after its creation, and which could presumably be applied to other objects if necessary.

So then the question becomes about what oversights the person creating the horcrux made. It is possible to make objects resistant to fiendfyre (some parts of Hogwarts appear to be) or to basilisk venom (although goblins probably try to keep how to do that secret). There's probably even a way to make an object resistant to the killing curse - surrounding it with a shell of dead matter or a field that saps the power from spells or massively slows them down.

There will always be oversights or work-arounds for whatever precautions are taken. Voldemort's strategy was mostly about preventing people from finding his horcruxes and building in active defenses to prevent cooperation around them or subvert/kill his enemies, with a bare minimum of effort put into passive defense. This was probably the right strategy.

** Well, conceptually, a horcrux is taking someone else's life and using it for yourself. Ending a life selfishly. The opposite of that might be giving birth, or getting pregnant. Beginning a life unselfishly.

I would expect the killing curse to work.

Something religious, especially major religious artifacts, such as the possessions of a saint or similar.

As horcruxs are meant to be like the darkest most foul thing ever you could justify something like Phoenix tears, unicorn blood, etc destroying them.

Personally I like the idea that the sun damages them over time, especially a sunrise.

** I always thought that a neat concept would be since a Murder helped create it, saving someones life (It would have to be without planning or foreknowledge) while in close proximity to a Horcrux would destroy it.

Also I always thought that since they are still pieces of soul and technically alive in some way, tossing them through the veil should work to uh.... destroy them? This of course depends on what you view the veil as or how you think it works.

*** Hmm, that could be a little scary actually. What if you're wrong about the way the way the veil works? What if (for example) you think the Veil sends things to death but it actually . . . vanishes them? Could you unvanish them? Would they still work? What would you do with Voldemort if you vanished one of his horcruxes? Maybe something like they do in The Black Comedy.

**** Yea the veil has always intrigued me because you simply never know whats beyond it. Its implied to be some sort or realm of souls where the dead go, but that's just it, its only implied. I am honestly kinda surprised at how few FF stories seem to really explore the veil itself or at least utilize it as a plot starter. The Black Comedy is one of the few (decent stories) that does so and even then its only used as a plot starter.

*** The fact is, we know so little about the Veil it might not even be real. I have mused about the fact that it would be ridiculously easy for any wizard to build an archway, hang a curtain on it, and enchant it so that it ripples and produces whispers (the enchantments on a Howler would do it!). Plus, of course, vanishing whatever goes through it.
