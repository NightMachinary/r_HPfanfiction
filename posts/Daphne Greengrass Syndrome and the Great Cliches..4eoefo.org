** cliche questions asking about cliche tropes?

The trope I most hate is the Extremely Evil Character. Could be Dumbledore, could be Molly, could be Snape. Doesn't matter, it's still an indication of laziness or utterly horrible characterization. I despise reading about a complete caricature of a character when I have better things I could be doing.

** - Weasley bashing

- Canon events must happen regardless of changes in characters and other circumstances

- Voldemort always gets resurrected in the graveyard

- Wormtail always stuns Harry, regardless how powerful or smart he gets

- Heroes who defeated Voldemort willingly subject themselves to a marriage law

- Next-gen time travel cliche: broken time turner -> surprise meeting -> lots of laughs and tears -> some pranks with marauders -> adult version arrives -> obliviates people in the past -> return home

** Honestly, I feel that Daphne Greengrass is used as a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn][OCStandIn]] far more than an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar][AuthorAvatar]] and to be fair, she really doesn't have much (or any really) characterization in canon so its not like people can just use a canon personality.

** Seeing as all the common cliches have been stated, I'm gonna go for one that doesn't get complained about enough. When a fic pairs off most of the characters, a lot of the time, assuming Ron doesn't get paired with Hermione, he'll instead get paired off with Lavender.

Of all the fucking characters to pair Ron off with, you pick the character that he already tried out and couldn't stand a moment with after a week. Literally any other character would be a better choice and you go with her. I don't see anyone shipping Hermione with Cormac, it's like another piece of hypocrisy from the HP Fanfiction community.

*** That is only a valid (somewhat) complaint if the story uses canon Lavender and doesn't change her, or lets her change in the story.

*** Oh my god, the "boys are afraid of the girls, no matter how strong the boys are" trope is so terrible. And it's directly lifted from anime. I can't stand seeing Harry quivering in fear of upsetting Hermione just because she'll hex him or something, and the same for the Marauders and Lily. I know it's supposed to be funny, but it's not. It just makes the characters look pathetic anywhere outside of Chinese cartoons. And it inadvertently paints the girls as dumb bullies who can't stand hearing an opinion they don't like without resorting to violence.

**** I'm not sure I entirely agree, because Harry backing up, scared of Hermione in Deathly Hallows was really funny, if only because of the context of years and year of being friends.

But of course, anything that's done or mentioned once in the book needs to be in every single chapter in fan fiction.

I don't recall that part. Care to remind me when it happened?

I do, however, remember this part:

  'Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears,she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm.'

** I hate fics where Harry is treated as though he is really dumb. Everyone is better than him and he needs help for the simplest of tasks. Oh and it's not manipulation we just want the best for you from potential love interests.

*** I want to say that the movies are responsible for this, because it's literally written in black-and-whte that Harry is plenty independent. He talks back to pretty much everyone who wants a go, and he's up for a fight even when he's outclassed (which, in terms of sheer number, actually isn't often at all). All of this hand-holding rubbish - especially in H/Hr Abused!"Indy!"Harry fics - has been done to death.

** - Harry suddenly decides to be a super-genius.
- Ridiculously evil/incompetent characters. If they were so obviously evil/prone to failure, SOMEONE would have noticed by now!
- Bashing of any kind. (Usually involves the above.)
- Anything that even HINTS of self-insertion. I'm definitely way over-sensitized to this to the point where OCs in general will get the stink-eye.
- Mpreg. I'm not particularly interested in reading m/m fanfics anyway, but mpreg is just... too much. It expects way more willing suspension of disbelief than I'm willing to give.

There's plenty more, but these are the most irritating ones I can think of. Finding Scryer ([[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]) has helped me avoid some of these, but not all of them.
