** Idk, it doesn't seem to add too much to the story? Most writers like to stick to book canon unless the movie version provides something really powerful like Lily's goldfish or Hermione's Mudblood scar

*** That scar is so widespread in fanfics that I was slightly confused upon a reread of the book. "Where did it go? Oh.... Oh right." It really is a powerful message. I saw fanart once that had it incorporated. Harry's scar, Ron's burns from the brain room, and Hermione's mudblood scar. Here it is, I'm on mobile: [[https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdp0b2ZT6D1qenixho1_r1_1280.jpg]]

**** I personally felt it was a nice gesture. It is kinda poetic, but it just fails to me. Similar to kindergarten philosophy where it is seemingly deep, but it just kinda misses the point.

Not to say it has no depth. It definitely is a very memorable thing, yet it just feels lacking to me in that Harry's scar is made in entirely different circumstances which causes the "Scarred Trio" to fail. Like a War Veteran, a General, and a Baseball Champion. The thing is there, but one of them is just too different to make it stand out as anything more than a vague connection.

Also, what stories have it? I actually have only encountered it maybe once at best.

***** I don't think it's all that out of place. It's not like he got those scars from playing quidditch.

Umbridge was dangerously bigoted, tried to have Harry not just assassinated but his very soul devoured, suppressed education/knowledge, worked to suppress information critical to national security, dosed students with restricted truth serum, expressed a willingness and desire to inflict the worlds most horrific torture on Harry, and was responsible for Albus Dumbledore himself becoming a fugitive.

She managed to force Harry into carving words into his own hand that mocked his efforts and sacrifices against Voldemort, in Hogwarts itself.

******** I'm being serious. My original line of thinking was that Harry's Scar given to him by the love magic of his mother's sacrifice was a bit different than Ron and Hermy's battle scars. It had slipped my mind that Harry received a scar from Umbridge.

********* Even without the Umbridge scar, I think Harry's lightning bolt still fits. He scarred, not died, because of Lily's love buts its not like the scar showed up from a kiss. It's from experiencing significant violence and hate (even if he doesn't remember it) similar to Hermione and Ron's experience.

**** I didn't remember Ron got scars from that!! Can you confirm that? If so, it seems like such an impactful thing that fanfics never point out. Brutally reminds me how underrepresented Ron really is.

**** If I'm not mistaken, the goldfish thing is from an anecdote Slughron tells Harry in the movie /Half-Blood Prince/. It's quite a touching moment, and one of the most emotionally impactful scenes in that film IMO.

I was actually surprised when I recently re-read the books (cuncurrently with a rewatch of the films) and found that bit was absent in the novel, actually.
