You know oddly enough the rules don't actually specify "only talk about HP fanfiction", so given how long we've been in quarantine I thought it prudent to put up another thread to find new stuff for people. Previously I'd asked what people were REREADING during quarantine and that found some pretty good stuff.

This time's different, I'm looking to expand my horizons. Give me your best fanfiction that is from a different universe. No crossover with HP, something completely different.


** linkffn(7406866) Not even sure how I found this fic, since I hadn't watched the show, but it turned out to be really good. If you can get past the fact that it's a fanfic of a magical girl anime, it's a great hard sci-fi story about an alien war a thousand years in the future.

But it tugs at her with every pulse, every drawn, minute oscillation drawing its grip tighter. A calling. Come home. Soon it's an insect against her ear. Shrill, sharp buzzing.

It's a crossover between two rather different anime: Oregairu and DanMachi. I didn't care at all for the latter but love the combination of the cynical and jaded Hachiman taking on what is essentially a harem fantasy world.

** I never participated in them, but back in high school I read a good share of Hunger Games submit-your-own-tribute stories; linkffn(kill or be killed: the 202nd hunger games) and its sequels were by far the best ones in the business.

It doesn't try to replicate the Hunger Games. The writing is good, the story moves along fairly fast, but the world is completely different. It's more developed and diverse, the arenas are straight up over the top mockery, the important characters are really memorable. That doesn't change the fact that 23 kids die every story, and he does a better job with emotional impact than Suzanne Collins did.

Unfortunately the series has pretty much been abandoned. But there are 3 complete books and I thought they were all fantastic when I read them.

** To start off, the ONLY non -hp (not including crossover) fic i've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12339320/1/Long-Black-Road][Long Black Road]] by FrankLeroux, and it's just flat out my favorite of all time. I actually first saw it recommended on this sub, it's a cross between John Wick and Mass Effect, and it's frankly just increadible how naturally the 2 worlds sync up. It actually explores the character of John (at least with what was canon through the first movie) in interesting ways, it's way more than a "shooty action" fic and it doesn't fall too far onto the fun swashbuckling side that wouldn't really fit John, while going far enough to keep things fun. An absolute masterpiece, highly recommend even if you aren't super familiar with either world (although google what aliens look like when the species is mentioned if you're not sure).

Also writing for any existing characters who pop up is spot on.

** I love this Portal 2 fanfic I read years ago. I haven't read it in a while (maybe it's finally time again lol) but it's called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7434133/1/Blue-Sky][Blue Sky]], and it follows directly after the events of the game. In particular, it's well-written, with very likeable but flawed main characters. There's a romance, but it's more subplot -- The actual themes of learning empathy & overcoming fear are just... /chef kiss/. I come back to this one every once in a while and always enjoy reading.

Heavy spoilers for the game, but if you've never played it, there's definitely a video game movie of it somewhere to catch you up to speed.

** So you want to expand your horizons? Alright, let me introduce you to some very well done fics.

Dining with Divinity - linkffn(13446830) - Naruto/Percy Jackson Crossover that is amazingly well done and super entertaining and unique. Strongly recommend.

One Punch Man: Hero's Harem - linkffn(12978919) - A enjoyable story with a unique take on OPM.

The Villain Wrangler - linkffn(12304924) - A wholesome story that is very sweet. One that anyone can enjoy even if you are not all that familiar with the DC Comics universe.

A New World - linkffn(10712061) - A Sword Art Online story that is completely wholesome and I strongly recommend it and its sequel.

Jurassic Park: Ranger of Isla Sorna - linkffn(4891096) - An amazing story and its super unique.

Sea Glass - linkffn(11758964) - One of my favorite Percy Jackson stories because of how unique it is and how well done.

I hope at least one of these appealed to you, have fun reading.

I find crossover fics to be some of the most interesting stories and often the most well done. Most authors that do a crossover really think out how they want to do it. Naruto crossovers in particular have a lot of really well done stories, something I am happy about.
