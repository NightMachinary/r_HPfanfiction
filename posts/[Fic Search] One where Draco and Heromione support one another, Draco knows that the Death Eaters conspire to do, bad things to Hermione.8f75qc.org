So I read this fic a few years ago but only got a bit in it. I lost what it was called and I kinda want to read it again but google is being no help. Here are some of the things I remember:

Hermione and Draco are both back attending Hogwarts in their 7th year and are both prefects.

Harry and Ron don't go back to Hogwarts, but the remaining Death Eaters want to get revenge on Harry and conspire to go after Hermoine to do it, and enlist Draco as a reluctance spy.

Hermione is raped by someone (I personally remember suspecting it was somehow Lucius because she describes his touch as "nothing like him" )

Draco and Hermione become, friends? and he starts to comfort her and they support each other as Draco is ostracized by the rest of the Slytherns.

Pansy Parkinson(?) is planning on running away with a Gryffindor boy and getting married.

If anyone can remember it I'd really apperceate it!
