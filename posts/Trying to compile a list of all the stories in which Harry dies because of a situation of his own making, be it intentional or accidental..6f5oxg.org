** Do fics with time travel count?

linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter) Harry time travels back every time he dies where he gets to redo parts of his life. He ends up way ahead of his classmates as he keeps having to go through his classes and various life events again and again.

linkao3(The Boy Who Died a Lot) After Harry dies in his first year, Dumbledore gives Snape a time turner to go back and prevent it from happening. Since fate seems to want Harry to die, Snape ends up having to go back in time very often to save him (while not letting anyone know what he is doing) again and again from both ridiculous and not so ridiculous situations. Surprisingly manages to be somewhat canon compliant. Has a terrible pairing in the end, but more than half of the fic has no mention of slash and is very entertaining.

  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

*** You are talking about time travel fic and you don't mention linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) ? Where he literally dies around 20,000 times offscreen, and at least once on screen?

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** lunkffn(The Unforgiving Minute)

Harry agrees to travel back in time on a to kill Voldemort. The only issue is that he's only got 24 hours until the instability/time kills him.

linkffn(Ressurexit)

Someone's stealing Deathly Hallows. Someone just murdered Luna. Someone's going on a rampage murdering purebloods. Harry and Neville feel that all 3 are connected and set out to figure out who's behind all of it. A great thriller, with twists for days.
