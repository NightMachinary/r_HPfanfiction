We often see Harry become a Auror, Professional Quidditch Player, or Professor after Hogwarts, in fanfiction.

Well... it's also often said that Harry has a "saving people thing" What if he becomes a Healer? Are there any really good stories where he is one?

Het/Slash/Femslash is perfectly okay with me.

No Lord/Heir to x amount of whatever from Harry

No Harem Harry

No unGodly Powerful Harry

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Little to no character bashing; if you have to have character bashing don't let one of them be the Weasley's, as I just really love the family.

Other than that; go for it.


** The Foundations!verse has healer Drarry and it's really good

  Harry is about to discover that the steepest learning curve comes after Healer training, and that second chances can be found in unexpected places.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
