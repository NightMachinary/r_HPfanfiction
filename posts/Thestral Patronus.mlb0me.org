So one of the many things that a Patronus can be is a Thestral, and my question is this: can you still see the Patronus if you haven't witnessed death? Is this a way to view what a Thestral looks like without seeing death? Are people baffled by dementors fleeing from an invisible something?


** I guess since it's not a real thestral it wouldn't have the magic of one?? So that would mean that people who haven't seen death would be able to see the patronus

** It's not a real thestral, just the image of one. If you had a painting or model of a basilisk, would it's eyes be deadly?

*** But it's a magical interpretation of a Thestral, just as a painting can move and talk just like a real person. I wasn't expecting the answer to be yes, just wondering what people thought.

**** But a magical painting still isn't the real thing, that's made clear in the books.

**** It's not a magical interpretation of a Thestral at all though, it's a magic spell with the shape of a Thestral. And Thestral can be seen because of inbuilt magic, not some kind of memetic effect caused by their shape.

** A Patronus of a magical animal, afaik, doesn't have the magical properties of that animal, for example, Dumbledore has a Phoenix Patronus, but the only magical property it has is inherent to the properties of a Patronus itself.

This means that any corporeal Patronus that is of an otherwise invisible magical creature should be visible.
