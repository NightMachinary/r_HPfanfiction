*** I would also recommend his other one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802). It's not as hilarious as RRR, but nevertheless very good too.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  ...and finally it was done! But what the public saw as the glorious day of Britain's liberation from the yoke of the Dark Lord turned out to be nothing more than one more funeral for Harry -- a few more friends he had to lay to rest. This time, however, there weren't any left to accompany him. Just where had he gone wrong...? Tragedy, Hurt, Romance...Time-Travel? OneShot

**** It's really great! I especially love the characters and their development. It's got a kind of a happy ending, too (at least the way I read it). Give it a shot!
