I've been reading other fandoms recently and I'm switching back to Harry Potter for a bit. Could you recommend some good, recent Harry/Ginny fics in the last 12-18 months or so?


** Wood for the Trees by FloreatCastellum, story is centred around James Sirius but Harry features prominently (James is an Auror like his father). Currrently a WIP. Kindle by itsblissfuloblivion is a Muggle AU. The Armistice series by Annerb (sequels to the Changeling). A Second Chance by Breanie (Hogwarts re-do where Sirius raises Harry) Over 200 chapters, updated weekly.
