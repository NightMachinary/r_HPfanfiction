** Since you've asked about the meanest character, rather than the most evil, I'd say that Filch and Petunia/Vernon rank pretty high.

** 1.  Umbridge
2.  Bellatrix
3.  Voldemort
4.  The rest of the death eaters
5.  The Dursleys
6.  Snape
7.  Draco
8.  Hermione
9.  Rita Skeeter
10. McLaggen

My top ten. The top ones are kind of given, so if I just mentioned them, it'd be repetitive and boring.

*** I think that Voldemort is more evil, but Umbridge is meaner in the sense that she is more petty in her cruelness.

**** Well there is an argument to be made that Voldemort is meaner: "Oh this child that literally only drooled while i tried to kill it survived. Let's have a grudge against him forever and try to kill him every year..."
