If you like Bill mentors Harry stories, this story is NOT for you. Bill abducts Harry from Privet Drive.

Not a happy ending.

**** I've avoided that fic because it's in 2nd person. I just can't get into 2nd person narratives. Thanks for the suggestion though.

***** Try linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer]]) then. Although jbern's is probably better. This one has an abadonned sequel.

***** Even if you can stomach the 2nd person narrative, as I finally forced myself to do, the story just isn't /that/ good. The cassanova!Harry that jbern writes is utterly unbelievable and jarringly OOC. The bashing that sets off the entire plot has not aged well. And all jbern's female characters are poorly written satellites that orbit Harry.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

**** It wasn't a big theory, no, just my personal one. I had a whole lot of tinfoil written up for it and an unfinished story about it too.

I thought Bill would be the DADA teacher in book five or six, and that he'd also turn out to be a death eater spy. Given the format of the four previous books- it's always the DADA teacher- I thought JKR would really need to up the stakes to have us fall for the same trick again. And Bill Weasley was tailor-made for the role.

He'd be hired because of his curse-breaking abilities, as they translate perfectly to teaching DADA, and he could also try to break the curse on the position while he was there.

No one would suspect a Weasley, and he'd be friends with the trio already. His betrayal would deeply hurt them and drive home the real darkness of war and all that.

He'd go dark for pretty much the same reasons as Percy split from the family: bitterness from being so poor when he was young, thinking his family members were fools for sticking with the losing side when they were purebloods and could easily be accepted by Voldemort. There might also be a large dose of Wormtail pragmatism- that is, thinking there was no way anyone could win against Voldemort and what was the use in trying? If you think about it, Bill's whole childhood took place in the darkest of times when everything looked the worst for the Light side, so that constant fear probably made a deep impression on him.

I thought things like his rebellious clothes and (snake?) fang earring pointed towards his resentment of his parents, along with saying "damn" to Molly and resisting getting a haircut or whatever. I thought JKR describing him as "cool" was setting the stage for all the kids to really love having him as a teacher and trustingly include him in all their plans, the better for him to betray them.

In those days everyone knew there were Too Many Weasleys and one of them was going to end up dead or evil or both, it was just a matter of who it was.

***** I like this idea a lot. Bill and Charlie both seem like characters with a lot of hooks that JKR didn't end up using---which is not a knock on JKR at all, because their existence in a way that isn't totally contingent on the plot makes the world feel bigger---so I always enjoy it when authors use them in pre-DH or pre-HBP fanfic.
