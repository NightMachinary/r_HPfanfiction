Anything and everything would be great! (But I am a fan of non-slash romance!). ;D

Edit: Thanks guys for all the recs ill check them out :D, keep em coming!


** I've been keeping a list of recommended fics for my friends. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzpk1P1KwneO7OfZyf5jMZyGyCx5mDqutsZ37z25cRs/edit?usp=sharing][Feel free to have a look.]]

Each story has my reasons for recommending it. Also has word counts. The fics aren't in any particular order, just in the order I thought of them. A warning, some might have minor spoilers, but I tried to keep those to a minimum.

Also contains a couple original fics and non-HP fanfics in the list.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/copacetic-worm-thread-4.310722/][Copacetic]] by Materia-Blade: Post-epilogue continuation that is just excellent.

You can also just check out the [[/r/WormFanfic]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/wiki/index][Wiki]]. Most of the fics listed there are high quality.

*** A bit late but I would suggest that you add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10091335/1/Weary-Sovereigns][weary sovereigns]] in the ATLA section. It's still in its infancy with 10 chapters but its a nice concept.

Also I think I got [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door][An Unfound Door]] from your list too, but its not there. So I included a link for you to add :D

** My favourite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. "Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies." Very well written and laugh out loud funny.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] seems to be back from the dead. Not complete but I think it's worth it.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night]] Draco/Hermione This story is poignant and beautiful. After the war convicted death eaters are re-homed by the ministry, their minds erased, and given new identities and new lives as muggles. Drake (formerly Draco) struggles to find meaning in a life where he can't remember anything, he doesn't fit in, and he doesn't know why. Hermione is assigned as his case worker, essentially, to make sure that his memories do not come back and that he is adapting well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][The Bracelet]] Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. This story has one of the most realistic takes on Draco I have ever seen, he's petty, he's an asshole, he hurts the people around him, and Hermione's hatred runs very deep.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385/chapters/3134746][47 Days to Change]] This story says slash but there isn't any. There was supposed to be some ~eventually~ but it never got that far and it was discontinued at a decent ending point. Harry goes back in time with the hopes that changing Tom Riddle's childhood will make him not turn to dark magic. Unfortunately, the evil in Tom Riddle goes far deeper than Harry realizes. This is the only story I have read where Tom Riddle is characterized accurately. He is brilliant, deceptive, charming, and straight up evil. It also has time travel explained in a really unique and fascinating way.
