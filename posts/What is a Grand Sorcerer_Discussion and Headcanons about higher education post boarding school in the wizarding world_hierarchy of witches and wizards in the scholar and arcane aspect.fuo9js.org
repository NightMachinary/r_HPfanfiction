I saw someone on another post ask what was the title of Grand Sorcerer we see attributed to Albus Dumbledore in the acceptance letters sent by Hogwarts. I personally think it is something akin but inferior to an Archmage, but what do you guys and gals think it is. Then I thought what would be the options for higher education in the wizarding world, Apprenticeships/Masteries and the Auror academy immediately popping in my mind. But would it really stop at that?

I really liked the idea of White Squirrel that after the Mastery one could complete a Doctor like someone would do a doctorate in the Muggle world, and this really allows us to distinguish more young and relatively inexperienced scholars like Lupin, Snape, Lily (if she had had the chance), Bill, and Charlie than the older and wiser ones like Bathilda Bagshot, Griselda Marchbanks, Filius Flitwick, Horace Slughorn, and Cuthbert Binns.

But, despite protests, the wizarding world is truly antiquated in a certain sense concerning its intellectual elite. From my point of view, the way the wizarding world works allows people like Voltair, Descartes, DaVinci, and other multitalented and multitasking to still be a thing. Today, our world is so modernised and precise and liberated that you can't have people be artists, scientists, teachers, and philosophers at the same time except if you were rich like Bill Gates, and even he's too preoccupied with his company (I really hope I'm not mixing him with the other one). We must remember that the wizarding world as an entire species dedicated to service and another to managing the economy and finances.

So, I think it could be possible for a witch or wizard like Albus Dumbledore to be able to the extra ten miles and focus on multiple aspects of magic at a higher level than Mastery and Doctorate and achieve the rank of Grand Sorcerer. Now, I don't have a very well-detailed idea of how one would go to acquire the title, but I imagine it would be some sort of qualification to make one an authentic and official generalist about magic like we see Dumbledore is by the time Harry gets to Hogwarts. O.W.L.s, N.E.W.T.s, Masteries, and Doctors were in different ways making witches and wizards focus more and more on a single aspect and becoming specialists, but the Grand Sorcerer would broaden again the horizons and knowledge of the witch or wizard.

But I also think there would be something above Grand Sorcerers; Archmages. The Archmages would be more on the specialist side of things while still being a generalist, but of course, if someone had the accesses to Archmages they wouldn't contact an Alchemy Archmage to inquire about Runes. This position requires so much work and time to possibly get that no one under a century of experience could think of becoming Archmage. At this point, I don't why, but I imagine the European Council of Archmages be something akin to the Council of Cardinal Advisers who could vote for a Pope-like supra Archmage. There is no religious connotation per se, it's just that being this deep in the study of magic seems almost cult and religion-like. Although, that may be caused by my headcanon of a city-academy in the real Mount Olympus (the one known by Muggles not being the real one) and the Platonian and Oligarchic aesthetics such a concept has. Also, you would almost feel you deserve actual political power after all the time you spent studying and advancing the subject of magic and the mysteries that surrounds it.

But what are you guys and gals headcanons about the higher education in the wizarding world and what do you think being Grand Sorcerer actually implies? Also, did any of what I wrote made sense to you or did I really just rambled?


** I've seen Archmage in a few fics, with different definitions. Grand Sorcerer just seems like some archaic and fairly meaningless international title, like something bestowed by a well-known foundation. Something Hogwarts would write on an admission letter to look good.

In my headcanon there is no official center of tertiary studies in Britain after secondary school, and masteries can be undertaken through residencies or independent study. This is partially because of Dumbledore's efforts (still in headcanon) to preserve traditional British wizarding culture while still enabling non-purebloods to reach the highest levels of achievement. We are never given any information about the rest of the wizarding schools other than Hogwarts so we don't know if there are even enough wizards per year to have a wizarding university be viable. My headcanon is that the British magical population is much larger than it is perceived by the upper echelons of society in the books, and that both the First and Second Wars are largely fought in these high reaches.

I thus have the postwar consolidation of wizarding education under a committee of the Ministry for Magic, which enables more advancement and regulation than in the wartime period. Regardless of the British situation, in my headcanon America (non FB compliant) several colleges, including some state schools and Ivies, have concealed magic schools offering masteries in magic; there are also several solely magical universities of varying sizes. In America (and worldwide) magic plays a much lesser role in wizarding life in general, and wizarding culture is diluted and Muggle culture is assimilated, although the Statute still holds. I'm working on a document on how this works out in book-canon in preparation for maybe writing a fic, but we'll have to see if that happens.

As for your idea of an archmage council, I see this serving in a similar capacity to the ICW, which in my headcanon has a bit less power than it's presented in a lot of fics. I see it as sort of a UN, but with a bit less oversight and maybe tilted more toward the academic than the political.

*** Oh, I didn't meant to say there were magical colleges/universities in Britain. Masteries and Doctors would be done either individually as a project or with a tutor/professor and the quality and acquiring of the Mastery or Doctor would be noted by the Wizarding Examinations Authority like for OWLs and NEWTs (for Britain and Ireland that is). Grand Sorcerer and Archmage would be supervised and centred at the Academy of the Mystic Arts and the Occult of Mysteries of Mount Olympus, though.

As for your last paragraph, I think the English languages fails yet again with its pronouns.

Did you mean the ICW itself or a potential Archmage Council?

That's nice, but what the hell's an Archmage? You can't just say it's 'like' something found in dozens of other settings where that word has a different meaning every time, and then give your own definition different from all of those.

Also, there's no such thing as masteries in canon, that entire concept was invented by people who don't know what a schoolmaster is.

Nitpicking aside, I feel like apprenticeships would be the most likely form of post-Hogwarts education, but we never hear about anything of the sort. The only such example we ever get is the auror training (there is no academy in canon, presumably on the grounds that the aurors canonically very rarely take on new trainees, McGongagall mention's them not having taken anybody on in the past three years). Besides aurors, the only jobs we hear about in OotP (the ones that are recruiting Hogwarts graduates based on their test scores) are other civil servant jobs (Muggle Relations and the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes are both mentioned), healers at St. Mungo's, curse breakers for Gringott's, security troll training, and cultivated fungus trading.

I suddenly really want to see a fic about Harry taking that last one seriously.

Really, the Wizarding world seems to me to be set in the age where post-secondary education was entirely the realm of the rich, something people with money did to better themselves (or make themselves look better to their peers), the age of the gentleman scientist or gentleman archaelologist or 'gentleman' whatever-else-may-require-further-education. Jekylls and Frankensteins and the like (and countless real people, naturally). It fits in with the otherwise vaguely Victorian veneer the world possesses. Everybody else gets on the job training at best.
