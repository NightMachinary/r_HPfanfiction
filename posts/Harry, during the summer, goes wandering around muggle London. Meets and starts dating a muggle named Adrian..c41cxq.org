:END:
He holds two birthdays --- one that Adrian can attend due to the Statute. After the summer, Harry returns to Hogwarts and I don't think Adrian played a role in the fic again.

I know this sounds like fluff and slash, but it was just one small part of a bigger fic, which I remember enjoying. Adrian is for some reason the only part I can remember.

#+begin_quote
  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, assorted ships. Heavy violence. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no bashing - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, no manipulative!Dumbledore, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted to Ao3. POV between HP and SS.
