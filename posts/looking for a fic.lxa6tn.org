:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hi! i read a fremione fic a while ago on (i think) ffn, it was a time travel fic where hermione travels back to the end of ootp from after the war

details i remember are:

hermione travels back because of a time-turner bracelet that activates when she's injured in an avalanche

the writer used the phrase “quaffle in the stomach” a lot??

fred gave hermione what is essentially a password journal

the build up to hermione going to malfoy manor is heartbreaking because she KNEW what was gonna happen

fred is there for gringotts and he rides the dragon to azkaban before the battle of hogwarts

#+begin_quote
  In what was supposed to be her first ski trip since the war, Hermione wakes up from an avalanche to find herself back in time. Despite her search to return home to her time, she is forced to relive her last years at Hogwarts and the War that she knows will claim the faces that now haunt her. In Particular, the face of a certain Weasley that she finds herself slowly falling for.If you were forced back in time, would you try to save him?
