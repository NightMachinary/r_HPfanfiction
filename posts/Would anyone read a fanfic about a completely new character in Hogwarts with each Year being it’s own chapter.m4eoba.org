I wasn't to write a fanfic about a unique new character, but would anyone actually be interested? (Note: It would probably be a year bellow the golden trio)


** Everything depends on the plot and the story, characters are secondary.

** It depends on how well the OC is executed, like if they are compeling then hell yea, but if the story is only carried by the concept of them being a new character and never really lets the character walk or run on their own feet then I would probably drop it.

** At first I ininterpreted your proposal as each chapter is a new year, with a new OC's first year.
