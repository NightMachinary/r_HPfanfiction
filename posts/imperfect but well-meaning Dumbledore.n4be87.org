All the bashing gets exhausting for me but I legitimately do want to see him get called out for a few things. Eg, being frustratingly cryptic for no discernable reason sometimes, questionable decisions about school safety, etc.

It's so easy to go too far into this, making him some evil mastermind who manipulates children just because, or a bumbling fool who doesn't know right from left (or sometimes confusingly both). But to me he's not a bad or stupid person, just misinterprets situations or under/overestimates people to his detriment. He doesn't and can't know every variable but he makes does with what he has.

So yeah, please recommend any fics where Dumbledore isn't infallible or all-knowing but his intentions are good and result in a net positive.


** The best explanation I've found for his behaviour is that he's aware he's got a bad habit of meddling too much, so he made a conscious decision to leave Harry and his relatives alone and not interfere, which turned out to be the totally wrong decision but at least it makes sense. As seen here:

** Two very different, yet fantastic fics:

linkffn(10639968): A WBWL one-shot with two sequels on the author's page. Voldemort is permanently dead, and Harry suffered from significant neglect. Dumbledore, whose only involvement in the Potter family was a warning that Death Eaters might come after the other son, is absolutely horrified. He takes on a role as a mentor figure to help Harry achieve his dreams. It's my absolute favorite fic of the WBWL genre because it really isn't part of the genre. There's no revenge, or major bashing, or weird lordship wankery. Just a neglected kid learning to be okay and trusting his found family.

linkao3(18608212) is a rather cracky fic. Dumbledore's primary goal is for everyone to do their own work without handholding so he can pursue his real goal: using his connection to the wards to randomly appear next to troublemakers and dispense koans. The 3rd floor corridor has absolutely nothing to do with the Philosopher's Stone. It's actually a way to provide reality warping children a way to think they're being dangerous and breaking the rules in a more structured manner.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

*** I really loved Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting, Dumbledore is really well written in there. The author often starts a situation similarly to canon and/or fanon, you think you know exactly what's coming and how Dumbledore is going to be bashed, but suddenly he offers a perfect explanation of his thought process, or the situation was actually different all along, and everything makes a lot of sense. The example you gave with the Philosopher's stone is exactly that : you spend a lot of time thinking it's the same as canon, only for him to end up explaining that he needed a way to canalize young wizard's energy, and that he's been doing it for a while now, and that no one was really at risk.\\
I'm eagerly awaiting for the sequel.

** From what I've read of the Accidental Animagus series it does this pretty well. Wind Shear also to an extent like this but probably accentuates his flaws beyond their canon selves, ending with a antagonistic relationship between him and !FutureHarry, not quite to a bashing extent, but probably tows the line a bit too much for what you want. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12498125/1/Umino-Iruka-and-the-Will-of-Fire][U]]mino Iruka and the Will of Fire (Naruto cross) calls out his manipulative tendencies but not for long and he is pretty much universally a positive influence throughout the fic.
