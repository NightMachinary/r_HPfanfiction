Im aware, that not all of my next points wont fit or even exist in the Harry/Fleur Fics out there. If i remember right, someone told me that most Fics out there are smut fics or with a Powerful or Godlike Harry. I still give it a try here.

Firstly i have to mention, that while im looking for Harry/Fleur it doesnt have to be them as a Pair, atleast not entirely romantically involved. Friends with Benefits or something in that Direction would be more what i intend to.

​

1- Harry catches accidently a glimpse of a naked Fleur (in the best case both of them accidently walk into each other) and cant get it out of his Head. I would even like this to happen in Canon. Maybe he even has erotic Dreams from it. A possible chat with them both to clean things is also ok.

​

1. Fleur uses her Allure to charm someone. It wouldnt be Harry, but since he is resistant to Veela allure (or atleast to a certain degree), he gets overwhelmed by her Power (because her target is also a resistant type) and do fall/lusting for her like her Target. Maybe he would also just standing dare with a "drunken" look and Fleur has to awake him.

​

1. Fleur and Harry perform on a Ritual that includes them having Sex.

​

1. Both of them are on Vacation or working on a Project and over time (well during Vacation because of the Hot themes, it would happen very fast) some sort of attraction or sexual Tension would develop between them. But it wouldnt be anything serious, they get intim for the Fun and to get it out of the System. Here i would also accept infidelity Fics.

​

1. Fleur never meets Harry during Canon, but after the War and decides to have a little Fun with him (because he is the Famous BWL and might grown more attractive) by seducing and teasing him, no matter if he is with Ginny or any other Partner.

I will ad this as a subpoint. I can imagine Harry never experienced a Veela before and meets Fleur....lets say in a Bar and he is totally charmed by her Beauty and "Aura". She of course, knows who he is and also recognize, that he is captured by her and teases and seduce him.

​

1. They are both working for a Company or in Political Positions and when they meet the tension would be there. Possible that she uses her lookings and allure to get advantages on him. I leave it to the Fic, if he falls easy for her or stays solid, but they would have still have their way at the end.

​

I would make a subpoint to this for a "criminal" Fleur (or both) that wants to get information from Harry and would gladly "pay" him for that.

​

1. Harry/Fleur and a third Person. I know there is "Harry Potter and the Veela Sister", but both of them with Ginny or other Females are also ok.

​

1. If Harry has siblings (no matter the Gender), both of them would have a Crush on her. I leave it to the Author if she has her way with both of them.

​

1. Fleur performs as some sort of Model...not necessary Fashion style but more Model for Paintings or other stuff that possibly has her being nude. Harry can either be her Artist or he sees these Pictures.

​

Ok, i think thas all, that i can think of. If you dont know Fics that contain one or multiple of this Points, but are eager to write, feel free to use this inspiration.


** Linkffn(the lie i've lived) is great for Harry/Fleur, although fair warning, it was meant to get a sequel that never happened.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
