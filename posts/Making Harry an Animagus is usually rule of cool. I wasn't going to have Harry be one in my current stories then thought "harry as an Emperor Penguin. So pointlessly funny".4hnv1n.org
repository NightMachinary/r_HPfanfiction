Any good stories where Harry is an animagus and he completely avoids the ability due to uselessness of his form?


** Useless animagus forms is my headcanon for why more wizards and witches --- even ambitious ones --- don't do it.

Imagine, you are young Tom Riddle, having clawed your way up to dominating your fellow Slytherins both socially and magically. In yet another feat of advanced magic, you work hard to develop an animagus form... and it's a kangaroo. You'd never live that down, so it's better to just claim that you have better things to do.

*** That's my idea. For darkness!harry, he'll go throigh this convoluted process to learn his ability, find it(emperor penguin) out, then tell sirius he doesn't have one and never mention it again. Edit: maybe have it be a running joke that sirius wants ro help him develop the skill since everyone has the potential and harry runs away.

In star trek he's alone on a planet for three centuries so finalizing the skill is done because he's using it to stave off boredom.

In cookbook of doom, still not sure, but rule of funny there. Like it autopopped while he was hunting a wizard who was a seal animagus hiding in antarctica or something. Or maybe north pole since they don't actually exist there and harry's the one being hunted.

*** Yes, that was my point. Most people do it because rule of cool, just more 'awesome' things that Harry can do as he steamrolls over his opposition. Good stories have his ability be useful, such as his animagus form in linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon). What I was looking for was more crackfic where his ability is lamented.

edit: this also dovetails with my "Story is a rucksack" rule. It can only hold enough elements to fill the story, anything beyond it should be left behind.
