We all have a weird aunt (and if you don't then congrats you're the weird aunt), and humanized villains are hilarious.


** Omg, I believe I have the weirdest aunt out there. The first time I met her (she's my uncles second wife) was about ten years ago give or take and she showed up in a see through top and a neon pink bra. Her fashion just got weirder from there.

*** My mom's sister was apparently certified bonkers, but I never really knew her since she died when I was young and the only memory I have of her is her getting really mad at me for mistaking her for my mom at a wedding when I was three (they looked very much alike even though she was wayyy older than my mom).
