** There's one I read years ago that I can't remember the name of. I'm pretty sure it was taken off the net, but someone might recognise it and have a copy. (I might even, but I've got nearly 2,000 fanfics sitting on my comp, most of them unread, and I'll never find it without an idea of the title or author.)

If I remember rightly, Harry left Privet Drive at 5yrs, ended up working at a construction site or something by the time he's 15/16, at which point Tonks and Kingsley find him. He goes to Hogwarts, possibly gets sorted into Hufflepuff and ends up in a prank against the Weasley twins. He had a Muggle girlfriend/fuck-buddy who he finds out got pregnant, but she dies shortly after giving birth (possibly during childbirth) and he takes the kid. I distinctly recall him attending the mother's funeral and meeting her parents there and them wanting the baby to be Christened but Harry refusing. He then takes the baby off to Hogwarts. I think he has a brief relationship with Hermione (or possibly just thinks pervy things about her), but in the end he gets in a relationship with a vampire (or possibly half-vampire) woman. Also, Snape was a vampire (or possibly half-vampire).

Unfortunately abandoned after 17 chapters but well worth reading anyway.

I have not read it. Not sure if it's any good.
