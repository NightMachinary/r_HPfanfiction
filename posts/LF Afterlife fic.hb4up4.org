:END:
Hello all! I'm looking for an after life fix that I read a while ago. I know that it followed Fred Weasley but also had Lily and James, Sirius, and so on. I also remember there was a contest where if they won they could go back for a day?? Then George and Fred would go back and forth. I think there was a clock tower or clock something that when it rang there was someone new in the after life. I hope it's not too vague for someone to help me!
