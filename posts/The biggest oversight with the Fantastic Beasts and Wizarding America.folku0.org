Due to the piecemeal development of the United States and how old-timey the wizarding world is, J.K. Rowling could have doe the world a favor and given us magical cowboys. But she didn't.


** The man standing in front of him cut a strange if impressive figure. He wore billowing robes, a wide brimmed hat unlike any he had seen. He had high heeled boots made from what appeared to be snake leather. He was smoking a cigarette and looking at him with piercing eyes.

He blew smoke out and said in a gravelly voice, "Grindelwald, eh? What do you want?"

As confident as he was of his abilities it would not do to underestimate the wizard in front of him. One does not become the Head of DMLE without being skilled.

"Your body, would you be kind enough to cooperate?"

He took another drag of his cigarette before putting it away. He blew the smoke out before he replied, "How about no."

And then one of the greatest duels in history started. Pity no one was there to see it.

** Everything about Magical America in the HP verse just stinks of colonialism.

*** I mean, either it is the offspring of some colony or it is, at best, a union of tribes. Because if European wizards did not colonise the Americas, there is little incentive for the various natives to unite into one or a few nations. Because from what we see in canon, the magical governments have very little international agendas or the like. Certainly no Bismarck-esque schemes or Wilson-like visions.

Also, given the separation of magical and muggle, the US wizards would have no Monroe doctrine and therefore probably a very different outlook on their neighbours and their role in the world.

**** I mean, it's more that Rowling has a lamentable lack of knowledge of American cultural norms or its history (you can extend it to North America as a whole, really). The entire concept of Ilvermorny is just insulting, both due to the appropriation of Native American myths for its four house mascots, and the fact that oh no, of course a British witch had to introduce the concept of wands and magical education and make a ripoff of Hogwarts. It's not like the indigenous populations don't have their own mystical traditions that, in universe, would likely be grounded in actual magic.

Also, the US and Canada don't really have the same sort of tradition regarding boarding schools as the UK, so Ilvermorny's entire setup is just freaking wonky. Especially as boarding school is often portrayed in fiction in NA as somewhere you dump unruly children or somewhere you're sent by asshole parents. It's generally portrayed as a punishment, not prestegious (though their are some prestegious boarding schools, though I can't name any off the top of my head).

Everything she's written about the magical US is disturbingly Euro centric and colonialist.

Also, don't get me started on her bit of Wendigo idiocy.

***** Euro centric? Her idea for magical Europe stops working outside of the UK and the Spanish peninsula. France for the most part as well, but it already raises the question of who owns Alsace Lorraine and which of the developments after 1692 applied to Muggles. Silesia, in recent history contested between Poland and Germany/Prussia would actually belong to Bohemia or the Archduke of Austria, depending on whether the dynastic Union of Bohemia and Austria was continued after the SoS or not. And don't get me started on the Balkans or anything even further east.

****** Ha! Good point well made. I should have said Anglocentric. Especially as her construction of the magical world doesn't even account Ireland.

*** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Scourers]] for the lazy.

I saw that first picture and thought Hey, those aren't cowboys, those are Pilgrims... and then I saw the bottom picture. Yep, those are cowboys.

** Heh. One of my favourite factoids about Victorian England is that Cowboys would've been around at the same time as all the well-to-do steampunk-inspiring stuff. But yeah. To paraphrase an old meme, Harry Potter definitely needs more cowboys. :)

*** One of my favorite factoids about victorian england is that, for a while, nipple piercing were /incredibly/ fashionable, for both men and women. So dapper men and corseted women both would likely have rings of gold, possibly with chains, in their nipples.

**** That is a good factoid.

Definitely something that more of those 'Harry Potter society is basically Victorian England Etiquette with Noble Houses and Lordships and Medieval Inheritances' fics need to include. :D
