As my humongous title says, are there fics that take on that moment in any shape or form? That was actually one of the very few positives in that play because imagining it...it's adorable and I would have loved for it to be in the books, but alas...

If you guys know of any fics, one-shot or nah, that would be great.

Thanks in advance!


** Wow...just reread that part and you are right...that is a really great idea for at least a one-shot. Particularly from Ginny's perspective.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2788096/1/If-You-Can-Help-Her]["If you can help her"]] is a Hinny fic that starts off after the CoS. I don't know if there's an explicit game of Exploding Snap though.

** Is it somewhere in linkffn(7460529) or linkffn(7685065)? There are so few good summer-post-CoS stories.

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

  The Weasleys' trip to Egypt after CoS. No one will tell Bill anything, and Ginny isn't talking at all. And if navigating the relationships with his six siblings isn't enough, Bill has one more. But he and Amy Green are just friends, right?

I so agree! It really bothers me that by far most Hinny fics are OotP or later. :/

**** And yes, I agree. It doesn't have to be dating from then on forever, just a good experience which makes them good friends, but there is so little.
