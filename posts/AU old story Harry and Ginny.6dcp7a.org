Looking for a story I read a long time ago. Ginny was a Healer (or maybe Healer in training). Arthur Weasley was the Minister of Magic. Harry was an Auror I think. Ginny was dating a Quidditch player and was pregnant with his child but he left her. At the end of the story she and Harry get together.
