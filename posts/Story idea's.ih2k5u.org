Hey I'm a fanfic writer and I came across a idea for a story and wanted to know what people thought so basically in the story the Dursleys are evil bastards like usual and injures Harrys head luckly magic is able to repair it but theirs some side effects Harry can now see things that weren't there before. Basically Harry can see emotions, magic all of it given its own form like magic for him is a little mysterious girl following him around and healing him, while fear is another girl constantly around him and the Dursleys telling him who fears what, darkness is a black mass that likes to hide Harry from view protecting him, but also while thinking this story through I had a dark realization the first sign of happiness he would meet would be Dudleys. Dudleys happiness getting ice cream, Dudleys happiness of being with his parents, Dudleys HAPPINESS at hurting Harry. Until now I never realized how Evil Happiness could be.


** Please do a spell check. Your idea might be interesting, but if you checked your grammar and spelling, and structurise your idea, it will appear much more thought through rather than an idea you just had to write down before you forgot it.

Readers might often be deterred by spelling just as much as plot.
