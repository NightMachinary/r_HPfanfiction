:END:
I've been trying to find a certain dramione fic I read a few years ago that I remember was pretty well written aside for a few choice portions. I remember that the main issue at the start was that Hermione found out that Ron has been obliviating her for the longest time through Draco, and I can't seem to find it. This all happens post-hogwarts, with Harry being an auror, etc... I remember it being on FF.net... this is a kind of vague and obscure question but I hope someone here knows what I'm talking about. Thanks in advance.
