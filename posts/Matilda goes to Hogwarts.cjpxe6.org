Looking for any fic where Matilda from Roald Dahl goes to Hogwarts, preferably full length but I'll take whatever I can get tbh

Thanks!


** I'd love to see a fic like that! Given the time the publish date and her age she'd be a few years younger than the trio and she'd probably come in with a significantly higher muggle education than the average muggleborn student. I'd really like to see if she'd get along with Hermione though.

*** Totally! Image how she would act when Hogwarts is being run by death eaters, considering her past actions against terrible teachers

**** She'd be a muggleborn and wouldn't be allowed to return to Hogwarts

** There was a one shot where McGonagall goes to give Matilda her letter. Unfortunately, I can't recall the name, and my googlefu was not able to return anything either

  It was the summer of 1994 when Professor McGonagall found herself standing outside the handsome red-brick house at the edge of town, letter addressed to Miss Matilda Wormwood in hand.
