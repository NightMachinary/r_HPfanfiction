Has anyone ever done a story where Tom has a little girl that doesn't seem to care that he is.. .. well.. him..

The thought of a little pre-hogwarts girl with a bow in her hair skips into the room where Voldie is torturing faceless goon #27 while everyone watches, says Hi Daddy, kisses his cheek and skips back out again after having waved to everyone there is hillarious to me..


** (Not a story, but...)

  [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/dungeon_a.html][Evil Overlord List]] #142: If I have children and subsequently grandchildren, I will keep my three-year-old granddaughter near me at all times. When the hero enters to kill me, I will ask him to first explain to her why it is necessary to kill her beloved grandpa. When the hero launches into an explanation of morality way over her head, that will be her cue to pull the lever and send him into the pit of crocodiles. After all, small children like crocodiles almost as much as Evil Overlords and it's important to spend quality time with the grandkids.

  A prophecy, a lie, and a bond unlike any known. Hermione's life will forever change when she learns of her parentage and the bond that will leave the entire wizarding world shaking. Will she stay for the light or follow in her father's footsteps?

  Unforseen circumstances force Voldemort to bring Harry back to Riddle Manor with him on the night of October 31, 1981, after trying to kill him. How are our favourite Dark Lord and his followers going to deal with taking care of a baby?
