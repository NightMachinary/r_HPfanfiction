Okay, so I reread linkao3(Cambiare Podentes:Invocare by JordanGrant) and its sequel the other day, and I was wondering if there's an SSHG fic that's sort of like that.

I'm not entirely sure how to explain what I like about it. I like the prophecy-bound thing, so any fics with that would be nice, but I think my favourite thing is the way that the author built the erotic tension throughout the story.

I mean in many fics, even slow-burn fics, the characters go from first kiss to shagging in only a few chapters. Even things like Pet Project, which takes /ages/ to get to the point, rush almost immediately from accepting that sex is going to happen, to sex having happened.

I'd like to see a Snape/Hermione fic with an initially reluctant Hermione who is slowly seduced, act by act, by Snape. One where they both know early on that sex is eventually going to happen, but take the scenic route getting there, if that makes sense? Bonus points if they're bound by a prophecy or something.

I don't even know if there's a fic like that out there, but I thought I'd ask anyway.


** -Augury and Ardor, -Transcendent Quality of Remembrance, -The Love You Take

All of them are from Subversa, I've read them on [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com]]

They all have some kind of prophecy or an obligatory bounding situation. I mean they start the action really early but most of the time Hermione is kind of seduced and confused about her feelings, the relationship and her obligations in the situation. I strongly recommend them and the writer Subversa.

Also if you have suggestions other than what you mentioned, I would be thrilled. Because it is really hard to find nice SSHG with not OCC Snape and Hermione.

*** Of the three, The Love You Take is probably closest to what I'm looking for. TQoR is a lovely story as well (I'm a massive Subversa fan, she's absolutely glorious) and quite close also, but...

The problem with Augury and Ardor is that while it's a good story, I feel like Snape forced her. Which he /did/ and I felt uncomfortably as though she had a touch of Stockholm by the end there. I enjoyed reading it when I read it, but I feel like it left a bad taste in my mouth.

On the other hand, I know not everyone who reads SSHG reads SSHP, so. The thing about Cambiare Podentes is that they are inevitably going to have to have sex. Harry knows they're going to have sex, and Snape knows they're going to have sex. That's sort of the point of the story. But instead of seducing Harry in one night (which wouldn't work, because CP Harry starts out as a bit homophobic tbh) or forcing him, Snape seduces him over the course of hundreds of thousands of words.

I mean, they start out with just bloody backrubs ffs. So I guess what I'm looking for is a really super slow seduction? I don't know.

OKAY so on to the fun part, which is recs for you. I don't know how much SSHG you've read so I'll give you a rundown of the classics, and if you've read them you can tell me what you liked and I can rec more things, and if you haven't read them you've got at least a few days' worth of reading material.

Have you discovered the glory that is Aurette yet? Her writing is funny as hell, but she also writes angst that rips your heart out, so there's that.

I recommend linkffn(Of Muggles and Magic) to absolutely everyone, because it's the best SSHG fic ever written in my opinion.

Linkffn(Care of Magical Creatures by Mia-madwyn) is a Marriage Law fic that I really rather enjoyed. I mean, it's really good and it is a fandom classic, and if you're looking for a Snape who'd really like to be truly horrible but keeps having these inconvenient moments of conscience, this is the Snape for you. I find the Hermione both in and out of character, depending on my mood. She's quite meek at times, but then she's in a very weird situation and feels very guilty, so...

How do you feel about BDSM? Because depending on what flavour you like I could have a couple of recs for you:

linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger by OracleObscured) is a very long, incredibly smutty fic with a Snape that's very much in character. He's harsh and cruel and demanding and while I find the fic very hot and very, very well-written (OO could make a fortune writing smut for Amazon) I find that the Snape is just...I mean I personally wouldn't kick him out of bed, but I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with him either.

I much prefer the Snape in linkao3(Getting Personal by OracleObscured) who I feel is very much in-character for what he is - a Snape that survived Nagini, has had a few years to get over himself, and is now looking for some kind of human connection. The Hermione in this fic though, is an absolute fucking gem. Her emotions are so...and the burden of guilt she carries, and the way she overworks and...she's just so very /Hermione/ that is actually hurts.

These two OO fics are very different beasts. TMG is quite kinky, with a lot of S&M like canings and clamps and such things, and not a lot of affection, while GP is a much more affectionate story, with a lot of cuddles. The Snape in GP is there to /help/ Hermione, not just use her for his own pleasure, and he's very affectionate with her right from the start because that's what she needs.

People are always reccing linkffn(For the Potions Master's Amusement by snape-submiss) and I suppose I'll really have to finish reading it someday, although I'm not a big fan of the Snape in that story.

I'd like to recommend linkao3(The Return by CeleryThesis) to you as a really well-done SSHG fic. I was fortunate enough to discover this fic when it was about ten chapters in and it was...I mean, it absolutely consumed my life for the weeks until it was finished. The characters are beautiful and complex and /painfully/ flawed, and it's all just so...I don't really have words to explain how much I love that fic. The summary of the fic is pretty accurate - Lily Potter isn't dead after all, and what does that mean for Snape and Hermione (the answer is nothing good)

In fact, you should read everything by CeleryThesis. The Post-Burrow World is not my favourite, but even so it's still better than most other things.

Let me know if you need more!

**** Merlin's most baggy Y-fronts! You are amazing! I supposed to help you with my comment but you did. You did not only made my day but probably made my month or something because I have all these loong and nice fics that I had no idea they even existed. I must admit that I am really lazy about looking for new fics as I am really sick of reading OOC Snape's in my own language. I've read all the Subversa SSHG fics so many times that I nearly memorised them. I don't really like hard BDSM and rape stuff. I really like when there is romance and fluff kinda stuff but also angst comes from nowhere and mixes up stuff, turns sulky, dramaqueen like Snape into a caring sweetheart. I am going to save you comment and not all the names of the writers and their fanfics. Oh Merlin, I am so excited! Thank you so much!

***** Oh if you like slightly angsty fluff, you should also check out linkffn(A Sprinkle of Latin by Ishouldbewritingsomethingelse). Well, actually that was just a handy fic to hang the author on - you should check out all her fics. Unless you like Ron. Probably best if you avoid her fics if you like Ron.

Her Snape might seem slightly OOC, but he's very like Subversa's in my opinion.

Ohh if you like /very angsty/ fluff with a truly spectacular warplot, try linkao3(Lay Me Low by Teddyradiator) which is /long as balls/ but so, so good. I know the summary is kind of stupid but if you give this a chance I think you'll like it. It parallels canon a lot but with a twist. The scene that equates to the escape from Malfoy Manor in Book 7 made me cry so hard I had to take a break because I literally couldn't even /see/ anymore.

Have you read linkffn(Bound to Him)? It's not complete but the author is still working on it.

And if you like Asshole!Snape, you should give Beaweasley2's work a go. This one fic, the Plight-Trothed Bride - right up to the end I wasn't entirely sure whether Snape actually loved Hermione or was just saying that to get back into her knickers. Such a jerk. So very in-character.

If you're looking for more, hit me up - I'm basically one of Nature's librarians, and I love reccing things for people to read.

I found a lot of excellent fics using sshgreview's reviews. She's pretty trustworthy in my opinion, since I liked most of the things she liked. The only one where I disagreed was Heart Over Mind and that was probably me, since everybody /else/ seemed to like it.

****** Oh my God, you are on fire! Also you got my type so on the spot. I really enjoy angsty fluffs with lots of drama and a happy ending. And I really don't like Ron anywhere near Hermione so I will check those fics too for sure! I am so excited about reading them all. Also saved your comments for easier access. Thank you so so much! SSHG is the only pair that I actually enjoy. Every other pair is okay to me as long as there is SSHG in a fic. So it is sometimes hard for me to find new fics and I feel picky because of that.
