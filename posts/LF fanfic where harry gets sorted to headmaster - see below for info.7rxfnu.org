(might have been oneshot or very very short) and preceeds to fix it all - think it had dumbledore either dying in his sleep or choking on sherbet lemon as a very brief aside

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

**** This fanfic is retarded. Dumbledore stealing money from Harry's vault is retarded as fuck. Why would he do that, when Dumbles is basically one of the richest blokes in the Wizarding Britain? You don't get to be a Headmaster of one of the most prestigious schools in the world, AND attain a high position in the government and earn pennies to shit after really a century of his lifetime.

***** Government positions could be unpaid and running a vigilante group isn't cheap either. Don't get me wrong, I don't like the trope either but I can certainly see Dumbledore needing cash.

****** A huge leap to consider. Otherwise, it's a tired old cliche where fanfic writers try to make Dumbledore the bad guy by getting him to steal money from the Potter vault. And I seriously doubt Harry's vault has enough money to fund an organization as the Order. Besides, if he's going to steal and be evil, he might as well take it from the bad guys. Or a hundred other ways of making money. If he can't find a way to make with the coin after more than a century, he really isn't as brilliant as the book would make him out to be.

It's poor writing and a lazy writing at worst.

******* Dumbledore, in the books, is an failure of epic proportions, who makes Neville Chamberlain look like a competent diplomat. He got nothing done and his plans boiled down to using child soldiers because he wouldn't give up the moral high ground while hundreds, if not thousands, died.

******** .... that's fanon speaking. The only child soldier he used was Harry, and he was part of a prophecy. Voldermort was all but unstoppable so long as a piece of his soul was inside him.

Furthermore, he didn't "use" any other children. I don't even know where you got this idea. And what moral high ground? Refused to act while hundreds and thousands died? lolwut? Dumbledore was there in every action, trying to save as many as he could while stopping the death eaters. The battle at the ministry at the end of the fifth book is a good example.

You seriously need to go back to reading the harry potter books instead of relying on fanfics.

And furthermore, what does this have to do with anything regardless stealing money from the potter vault? Stop shifting the argument to something so baseless.

********* But the Death Eaters were not invincible and he didn't deal with them at all. He distrusted the dementors and knew Voldemort would return and yet let the DE in the care of the Dementors. The war would have been much easier if the Death Eaters were dealt with permanently after the first war.

********** Except, you know, it would be murder and he would be tried and sent to Azakaban. You've this assumption that Dumbledore could do whatever he wants without consequences. The wizarding world is set in a modern world which has political and economic and cultural setting similar to that of the muggle world. He's a vigilante, not an assassin.

*********** The Death Penalty was part of British law until the 7th book and the Dementors Kiss was a thing in the magical world.

And the Soviet Union didn't win the Easter Front with stun batons, nor was the Battle of Britain fought with Tasers.
