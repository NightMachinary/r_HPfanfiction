Just kind of thought this would be a fun idea.


** I'm at work so I just kind of threw together some ideas on break.

Year 1: A brand new world to live in with a whole family, and Harry has to learn it all to be the best that he can be. Harry becomes a history nerd learning all he can about his family and the wizarding war that took them and the greater wizarding world as he becomes friends with all of hogwarts ghosts asking them about their time alive and what they have seen since death. Professor Binns becomes his mentor.

Year 2. Harry goes to Nick's deathday party and stays late into the night conversing about history with all the ghosts. Knowing about myrtle the chamber is found but that isn't stopping the heir's attempts at revenge.

Year 3: harry is jealous that Ron got to see the pyramids. Harry is not allowed to leave England. Harry finds out about lupin and learns history from a non wizard perspective.

Year 4: Harry knows the full history of the tournament and is horrified when his name comes out. He remembers a case where one of the champions had to be reselected and recreates the situation so he does not need to compete.

Year 5: professor Binns having received too many complaints is replaced by Delores umbridge who has a unique outlook on magical history.

Year 6: professor bins is back and Harry has joined his class as a TA.

Year 7. While researching the hogwarts founders Harry comes across the horcruxes and sets out on a quest to destroy them before Voldemort can return.

*** I'm all about it. I think this is a great angle to explore the castle, include cool worldbuilding by having conversations with the paintings, and finding forgotten places that have been lost due to the study of history falling out of fashion.

If you extend it to post-Hogwarts it would be a great basis for him to get into Curse Breaking, possibly even including an arc where he spends time learning under Bill at some point. There are only a few fics where we get to see a curse breaking expedition but I'm eager for more.

*** I don't really see seventh year happening that way, though. What sort of historian would willingly destroy a valuable (in both monetary as well as in a historic sense) artifact just like that? I'm thinking he gets into history from a gobblin standpoint and finds a way to exorcise Voldemort from the most important artifacts (the snake can just fuck off because she was complicit on Voldemort's shenanigary with said valuable artifacts).

With his newfound knowledge on gobblin culture and history, things go far differently regarding Hufflepuff's cup

** I was always wanted to read something similar about Tom because it does take a lot of perseverance to go through all the books to track down your heritage. Unfortunately most of these scenes are either mentioned off page or Tom already knows about his past by the time he's introduced. However probably it's hard for most people to detail a personal research (considering that many fans even mistake canon for popular fan theories so they don't even get a lot of things right) and it's even more boring to write about it. I know I did a lot of research for a rather obscure topic in my thesis and I was at least able to use the internet so only a click away... but going from book to book and highlighting all the relevant parts would have been a nightmare. I spent almost a year doing that and at the time I wasn't a very interesting person except if you wanted to hear little known fun facts about the topic I was researching.

** I've read a bunch of fics that are post-war and involve Harry trying to learn more about his family, and they're always super interesting to me. But I'd love to see Harry dig into his history while he is at Hogwarts! I think it would have made his walk into the woods even more poignant, since I recall feeling like James and Lily were basically strangers to me even at the end of the series.
