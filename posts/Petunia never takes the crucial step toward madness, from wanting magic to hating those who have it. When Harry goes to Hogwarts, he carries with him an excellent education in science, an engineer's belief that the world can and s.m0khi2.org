A sane woman who envies her sister's toaster ownership doesn't lock her nephew in a cupboard and call him a freak. She tries to procure a toaster for herself. Why should magic be so different?

If Petunia wishes she had magic, the obvious next step is to arrange for someone in the magical world to want her to have magic and believe that can be achieved. And then she's given control of the childhood of someone who's going to go into the magical world. How dumb is she in canon to waste that opportunity on petty revenge?

This could be written as things just turning out different, or the moment when Petunia actively chooses sanity and ambition over petty revenge could be explicitly shown: "What the fuck was I about to do? How would that get me anything I want?"


** Love it. I could see Petunia trying to become as knowledgeable about magic as she can, even if she can't yet use it. Maybe she befriends Mrs Figg and convinces her to go into Diagon and buy her books or she bargains with Dumbledore to get an owl subscription to the Hogwarts library in exchange for taking care of Harry. Harry grows up with a better than average magical education and when he comes to Hogwarts, no one's the wiser that he was raised by Muggles unless they actually ask him. Would make for a great scene where Malfoy or another Slytherin is hating on Muggleborns and holds up Harry as an example of being raised in the wizarding world, only for Harry to point out that no, he was raised by Muggles.

Imagine him cultivating his own following of muggleborns in school as he gently tries to pry from them how they got their magic. Imagine Dumbledore seeing Harry growing his circle as a charismatic figure that draws the disenfranchised and disgruntled to him, and imagine him remembering how Voldemort and Grindelwald got their starts. Imagine Harry joining up with Voldemort to capture the muggleborns, try to learn their secrets, and break them out again to add them to his own cabal.

**** I don't really see MOR's deconstructions in /bad/ faith though. Sure, the author doesn't take the extra step to assume Rowling's world is well-constructed and fill in the gaps---but that those gaps /are there/ to be exploited in the first place is on Rowling. Never in the original series did Rowling say that, for example, goblin gold can't be melted down. In fact, she implied the exact opposite given that Hermione was easily able to apply enchantments to galleons in canon. HPMOR actually does go that extra step once, at the end of the book, with the Sirius/Pettigrew thing.

The most salient criticisms of HPMOR are, in my mind, that Harry doesn't learn all the lessons he should have even when he says he has (see when he says all life is valuable after literally saying there's no point in Ron's existence earlier in the story), and the incomplete/fringe science presented as solid fact.

***** Bear in mind, the fact that Harry is wrong about a lot of things is /intentional/. Step back and consider the narrative carefully, and you'll see that his mistakes repeatedly bite him in the backside.

He dismisses Ron, as you say, and then Ron becomes one of Hermione's sub-commanders and helps to orchestrate Harry's defeat in their first battle.

The author's community calls itself "Less Wrong". As in, you learn all these lessons and then you go out and keep getting almost everything wrong, but maybe you get 99 things wrong instead of a hundred, so that's a win.

****** There are plenty of lessons he does learn, yes. The one where he realized what he did about Dumbledore was one. The thing with Ron, however, was particularly egregious because he never explicitly acknowledged it afterward. In fact, the narrative still portrays him as kind of an idiot and thus pretty worthless even after that point, from what I recall. I will say this part is more subjective, though.

What /isn't/ subjective is HPMOR's promotion of incomplete and fringe science as if it's settled fact. It even gets the details of certain studies wrong---it brings up the one where there are two groups, and they're separated and give themselves different names, and that they then immediately start up a rivarly. In the actual study, that's not what happens. It takes actual competitive tasks and rewards for the groups to actually hold any enmity toward each other. And then the story uses this flawed premise to construct an argument, and it fell so very flat because the entire time I was just thinking /wrong, wrong, wrong/.

HPMOR is a good, enjoyable read. If you're actually going along and looking up every study or bit of science it mentions, you might actually learn a lot. If you don't, you'll probably be misled on several topics.

Adding to this:

It purports to exemplify the scientific method, but the author apparently has no idea what that is - because at no point does Harry /actually/ use it. The Scientific Method is a means to discover information in a logical manner, based on evidence. It begins with a hypothesis - say, 'water is wet'. To support or disprove this hypothesis, you gather data; you touch water and find that it sticks to your fingers. You drop a sponge into it and find that the sponge comes away wet. You let it flow over a surface, the surface becomes wet. This way, you support your hypothesis enough times that it becomes too likely to deny, and science has been achieved. HPMOR doesn't do this - Harry's worship of "science" isn't rational. When Harry sees something that contradicts what he knows, he doesn't say "oh that's interesting, I wonder how it does that". He says "That's impossible, I hate it." As seen with how he reacts to McGonnagal's demonstrations. An actual scientist would be /fucking thrilled/ with magic's capabilities, and they wouldn't be trying to fit it into a system that it obviously breaks many times over.

I think you're missing parts of his reactions here. Yes, he does flip out a bit, because it's turned his entire world upside down. But he does become extremely interested in learning more.

And how would you react to finding out that, let's say, all your family are actually robots and your entire life is part of a social experiment? I think it would be closer to Harry's "Wait, WHAT?!" reaction than it would to mere curiosity.

#+begin_quote

But they would still try to understand how the previous set of observations can be explained. If what we thought were the laws of physics actually aren't correct, then what /are/ the laws, and how did they lead us to our previous guesses? That's what he wants to know. Such as his experimentation on the mokeskin pouch. He's open to the idea that it can do remarkable things, like reading his mind to understand his intention, or somehow accessing all the information in the world to understand all languages. What he struggles with is the inconsistency. "It can /count/ but it can't /add/?"

He's okay with throwing away the old system, if only he could piece together a new one, but three quarters of the jigsaw is missing, half of what's left is all one colour, and there aren't any edge pieces.

********* The issue is still that he never actually updates his knowledge. He never formulates new theories or ways to explain magic in a greater theory, he just fudges variables into impossibility until it somehow makes sense. For example: Does he ever actually figure out how the Animagus Transformation violates conservation of mass (disregarding that it could just make McGonnagal's matter denser), or does he just eventually squeeze it into what we know, breaking everything else in the process?

Does he ever actually gain respect for what magic is, and cease to explain it using science he already knows? Does he ever actually come up with something new, or is it all "just" something else in disguise? Because if he never actually puts words to this, then the fic shits on the concept of magic itself. Magic can be done with science in mind, yes, but it can't just be normal science. Because it's a fantasy concept. You need to expand "normal" science to be compatible with magic, which most of these fics never do. They instead make magic non-magical.

Neither. He isn't able to explain it. Recognising his own foolishness and just how much he doesn't know and how little he's actually achieved (and how much damage he's very nearly caused) is pretty much the climax of the story. Things work out okay, but more or less in spite of him. The plans of people much older and wiser than an eleven-year-old carried the day.

The key element of what I find acceptable is that the story doesn't belittle either, and doesn't make either "just" anything of the other (i.e. magic is "just" a kind of science, or science is "just" structured magic too obvious to conceal). A story that approaches this in good faith needs to respect both and bring them together as equals, not have one area dominate the other.
