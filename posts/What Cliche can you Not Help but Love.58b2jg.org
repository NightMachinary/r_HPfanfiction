Fanon Draco, fanon Pansy and fanon Daphne are very similar characters. As OP said, they are based on the same concept, except with differing gender roles. They appeal to their fans for the exact same reasons.

Draco and Pansy, yes. Daphne? Not sure, since she's pretty much an OC and I've seen her taken in all kinds of directions. I'm probably just not much of a fan of all the apologetics involved for Draco or Pansy (or even worse just ignoring their issues).

****** That's because tea leaf reading is A Thing. You don't actually drink that tea. For tea reading to work, you have to use leaves cut small. It doesn't work with proper tea, which is sold loose, with large leaves. Even an Assam, which you're meant to boil fiercely, will be too large a leaf for tea reading.

- Harry being adopted by someone else (after 1991, so we don't get an OC "Harry Potter"), bonus points if Dumbledore isn't actually evil when he fights it.

- Marauders' era time travel - as long as Harry doesn't address his future parents as "mum" and "dad". Bonus points if he's with someone else (like Tonks in Mishap and an Opportunity) or if it isn't Harry who's doing the time travelling.
