** linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen) might qualify - though the two Voldemorts are not on the same world.

Robst also wrote one story where the horcruxes activate at once and all try to possess others.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** Hmmmmm well that happened in the very last chapter that was posted of Magical Relations! Not sure where the author is going with that idea yet but it's bound to be awesome based on how great the rest of the fic has been up to this point. And if you like comedy, Seventh Horcrux totally counts!

** This one too

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum]]) due to multiple dimensions, but it's a sequel

There's also linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) where eventually Tom basically splits off to do his own thing and even go against Voldemort on his own, but I think it's Voldemort's only shown horcrux.

  In which Tom Riddle devises a diabolical plot to usurp the main soul piece, Lord Voldemort, and the Boy-Who-Lived mysteriously vanishes on his eleventh birthday. Or, where Tom hates everything but tolerates his fellow horcruxes plus his arch-nemesis in order to take over the world... if things would only go his way.A drabble series told in snippets of 100, because nothing else properly conveys the absurdity of this situation.This work now has a guide with extra information and explanations. Check the last chapter to read it!

          Dear new readers, and even those who aren't new:I have updated this story to have a guide \(on background information\) that is handy, that you might like to know, that answers questions, and in general provides details you cannot fully get from the drabbles \(as they are only 100 words\)\! You can find this guide as the last chapter of this story, and will be continuously moved back to not only keep out of the way of the drabbles, but also to be easily found :\) I highly recommend you reading it, though it is best read once you get past drabble 100 \(to try and keep spoilers to a minimum\.\.\.\)However\! We do have a spoiler line to hide you away from the most grievous of it\! So if you really want to go check it out, go on right ahead\!Thanks :\)
