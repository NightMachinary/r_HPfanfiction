I'd like to give The Denarian Renegade a try, but I'm only on the beginning of the fifth book of the Dresden Files and I don't want any real spoilers.

*** Do I need to worry about the mechanics that will be spoiled? Will it actually spoil the real books for me?

**** Nah, not at all, if you haven't gotten to the Denarians yet you'll still be fine. No major plot points (of the Dresden files) are even mentioned in Renegade I believe. You'll just be confused every now and then if they mention characters, like other Denarians that are actually in the Dresden Files.

It's badass as fuck though, you should totally read it. It's one of my favorite crossovers.

** There are some modest spoilers for events in the series, but nothing that should wreck anything for you.

** I got into Dresden thanks to this fanfic. I don't recall being overly spoiled.

** No spoilers. This trilogy is actually what got me into Dresden Files.

** It won't spoil you, and you don't need to read Dresden Files to understand it. BUT, you should definitely read Dresden Files.

** I read it without any knowledge of the Dresden series, and never was I confused or in need of looking up something from the Dresden wiki, everything that needed to be explained was by the author. :)
