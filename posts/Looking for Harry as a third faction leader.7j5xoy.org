I'm looking for stories where Harry ends up not really siding with Dumbledore or Voldemort but stands on his own, with his own followers. This can be Dark, Grey, or Light Harry, grown or still in school. Members of his followers can be his friends and/or defectors from the Death Eaters/Order. Please only include overpower Harry if his enemies are similarly overpowered.

******* This and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) get compared a lot as fics that take on every single cliche in HP fanfiction. It always interesting to see how people perceive each of them, as usually they love one and hate the other.

I'm on your side in this case: I've tried to read DPaSW multiple times and never made it more than a few chapters in. Meanwhile, I've read HPPoS in it's entirety multiple times and never skipped a chapter. I think it all comes down to taste in the end :\

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

****** Yeah that's a bit creepy but it's more that he convices them to join his team because of their political/magical power. I don't think the author is going down the pairing route anytime soon. And he also got chucked in Azkaban at 12 and left for dead so he won't have matured as much as his age should suggest (like Sirius in canon).
