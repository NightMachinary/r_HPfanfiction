Hey I found the story "to reach without" by accident and I liked the style and theme. I also found and read the fics "Season of Change and Son of Potter, Daughter of Black". Which are booth very similar but great. Unfortunately none of them is complete. Now I ask you if you can recommend similar stories to me that deal with the topic genderbend or swap.


** I really liked the genderswapping in “To Reach Without”, just that if the story didn't slide into that weird male-veela or whatever junk there is with Blaise Zabini. Like if the author was trying to write four stories at once and he really couldn't decide which one he writes.

** Try linkffn(Pranking the Tournament by Gardevoir687). Harry finds out that he was entered into the Tournament under the aegis of the Salem Witches' Academy and decides to run with it. Complete.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descendant Covenant by Jim-ruggeri). I lost interest about a dozen chapters in. Harry gets gender swapped in 7th year by an artifact in DADA class. It looked to me as though it was heading towards a fem!Harry/Draco pairing.

linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter). Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but I certainly enjoyed it. Multicross with Sailor Moon and Ranma 1/2. Harry apparates to Jusenkyou by accident and falls in the Pool of Drowned Sailor Moon. Has a completed sequel.

Most of the others I'm aware of, I don't consider to be very good. I will mention these two, though:

linkffn(2 Girls, 1 Cup by Luan Mao). Crack. The Goblet turn Harry female because of a misspelling. Complete.

linkffn(Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived by Lord Jeram). Harry is male, but everyone sees him as the Girl Who Lived. Incomplete.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?

*** Almost forgot this one: linkffn(To Walk A Mile in someone else's shoes by IamMegumi). Harry doesn't like being the famous Harry Potter. Luna doesn't like being female. She has a proposal for Harry. Not a bad story, but the grammar deteriorates around chapter 8.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.
