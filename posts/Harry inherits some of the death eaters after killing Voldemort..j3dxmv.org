:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am searching for a fic I read a while back. I remember bits and pieces but not the name. -Harry became the master of Severus, Draco, Pansy, Crabe and Goyle also Blaise. Not sure if there is more. -Blaise mum convinced him he is a fool being a slave to Harry I think. So he ask to be let go? -Either Crabe or Goyle was pretty happy with that. -Harry was trying to keep them all out of Azkaban. -Blaise tried to get Harry to take him back as he was facing high Azkaban charges.

I am not sure on some of them but that is what I recall. Help will be highly appreciated

  A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about his accounts. It turns out that he just inherited a lot from Voldemort! Who knew that the Right of Conquest was still a thing? Now, Harry doesn't just have property and money but ownership of lives as well. Will they accept his offer of redemption? Will they ever heal from the horrors of war? HIATUS
