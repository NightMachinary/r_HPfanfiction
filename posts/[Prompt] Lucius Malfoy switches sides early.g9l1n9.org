Lucius's face paled as he looked at the destroyed diary sitting on the desk. Never before had a decision he'd made backfired so badly. He was dead. No, he was worse than dead if the Dark Lord ever returned. Maybe it would be time to follow the lead of Severus and join the other side.

​

Now, first step: better get his son to back off from the confrontations. Can't let the next generation ruin his hard work before it's had time to get off the ground.

​

Later...

​

Sirius Black had escaped. Well wasn't this an interesting development. And such an opportunity as well. Now just a few subtle words in Fudge's ear about righting the wrongs of a previous administration and being seen as doing something to stamp out corruption and suddenly Black goes from being a criminal with a kiss on sight order to a wronged man denied his rightful justice by an administration that was cutting corners.

​

Of course, getting Crouch Sr. imprisoned is just a happy byproduct. Asshole threw random people in jail without trials just for belonging to the wrong families. Probably pushed more people towards 'Tom' than almost any others.

​

Tom. Such a boring, /muggle/ name. But powerful all the same, and a half blood to boot. Lucius saw through the blood purity facade now. Dozens of familys ruined by inbreeding. All the most powerful mages, every single one in recent memory has been a halfblood or muggleborn. Draco was somewhat of an exception, but then again, the blacks had never joined with the malfoy line.

​

Oh merlin, he was turning into a muggle lover. He was going to have to give an order to the house elves that if he started giving out lemon drops and /shudder/ twinkling, he was to be sent to St. Mungos.


** This could make a really good fic.

I think it'd be quite funny to have a Snape that's fence-sitting and waiting to see who's winning before committing fully to a side, but a Lucius that does a full 180 and is firmly on the good side. You could then have the two of them think that the other was doing the same as them, to increasing comedic effect.

For best results, is on the side of the angels but still the massive suppurating arsehole he was in the books.

"Headmaster, why are we trusting Lucius Malfoy of all people?"

"Bluntly, Harry, we aren't. We're working with him because, to borrow the rather crude muggle phrase, I would far rather have him on the inside pissing out than on the outside pissing in."

** "Make friends?" Draco hissed out, "With /Potter?!"/

"This is just about you, Draco," His father said down to him. "You need to start looking at the bigger picture. You need to learn to weigh the pros and cons of every situation before throwing yourself in. Take my word for it, jumping in blindly will put you in a place of danger."

It was true. After seeing that destroyed diary, he knew he was on the wrong side. Not just because he suddenly had a change of heart, but because of what lay on the mahogany desk of Dumbledore.

A Horcrux.

His grandmother had spoken of those at one time when he hit his teenage years. She was an advocate for dark magic. She claimed that magic should be treated equally, that it was intent that made magic dangerous or not. Then she told him of the expectations.

There weren't many and most practices that thankfully had been forgotten through the years. She claimed that any type of magic that broke the rules of nature were to be avoided. Necromancy, for example, reanimated the dead as saves for a person's bidding. It was vile and unfathomable. She spoke of how those who practice the unholy magics, the magics shunned by Lady magic herself, would fall and fall hard.

His Grandmother Manette told him how Lady magic watched over us, she spoke about the parallels of our Lady and the Christ and father of Christianity. She praised how the Lady was forgiving and understanding.

Unless it came to the forbidden magic. Manette cautioned that those who meddle in the magics of the damned will be damned themselves. How they always fell and fell hard. She was adamant that those who broke the Lady's wishes, broke their soul, and that you should never align with them for they take those around them down when they fall.

Though he didn't believe everything she taught him, he did believe that opposing Lady Magic and practicing forbidden magics would bring her wrath. He knew the moment he saw the cursed diary with its waterlogged pages and torn pages that it was a Horcrux.

He had grabbed the shoulder of the last living Potter and looked into his eyes. Looking past the confused expression he could see the truth behind the child. He was the punishment for his old master. He was touched not just by his mother's protective magic but by the Lady herself. She had sent him to bring Voldemort's downfall. Just as she had sent all her previous champions.

He had warned the child that he must be careful. That he was lucky that he was able to defeat such a vile object without the proper training. He assigned Dobby to watch over the boy and keep him protective. Harry had spluttered and tried to form words but his confusion led him to drawing blanks.

"Once the summer starts Dobby will be bringing you to the manor to make sure your next battle is won with skill and not luck," he had proclaimed before turning and leaving the bewildered child behind. He vowed he would prove to the Lady that he wasn't deserving of the coming punishment of his old master.

"I still don't see why Potter has to come here! I don't want him here," Draco's outrage had morphed into a whiny complaint. He shot a disgusted look at the tone and Draco stood straighter.

"He is coming here to train and help us rid of that vile creature that I had previously aligned myself with. That man has meddled with magic that will bring our Lady's wrath and I will not be on her bad side," Lucius placed his teacup back on the saucer with a soft /clink./ "We will not work against her."

"But what does that have to do with Potter?"

"I believe she has sent him to punish those who try to defy her. He is one of her many champions, and we will not bring her anger down on this house."

"Dear," Narcissa called from the doorway. Harry was in front of her with her hands resting on his shoulders. "Our guest has arrived."

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** That's a really interesting idea. Seeing how Severus and Lucius react to each other, not trusting the other, Severus assuming that Lucius will betray them all, Lucius being unsure of just what to say to Severus.

Both of them still being complete assholes to not only each other, but other people. Seeing Draco confused and outraged over the idea of "playing nice" with Potter and his friends, et cetra.

Having a "positive" (so to speak) role model, trying to prepare Harry for the war to come.

So many ideas could come with this. Though I can understand why it's not done, very difficult to write it in a way while making Lucius at least anywhere close to his canon self without it seeming as complete crack-ish.
