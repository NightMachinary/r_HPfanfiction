I just figured out why filtch is named argus filch.

It's after a many eyed giant in greek mythology said to be sort of all seeing.\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Panoptes]]

Another name for me to add to rowling refrence names. Thought i would share for those that havent dicoverd it either :)


** Amazing :)
