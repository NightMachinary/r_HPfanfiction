I'm looking for good Severitus fics that aren't on archive of our own (I've read most of the ones on there). I'll also accept Snape adopts Harry or becomes his guardian fics.


** Have you ever looked at [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/][Potions an Snitches]]? It's a site dedicated to stories that are focused on gen Severus and Harry. With a lot being mentor/adopt/guardian/Severitus fics.

*** A minor clarification -- it's not strictly gen, however it /does/ forbid Snarry in particular. It has nothing against shipping Harry or Severus with other people.
