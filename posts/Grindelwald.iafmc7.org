I'm looking for a fic where Harry is raised by Grindelwald. His upbringing should be pretty significant for how the story develops and it would be great if Harry with the help of Hermione changes to better. I'm looking forward to a well written fic with Harmony involving Grindelwald-style upbringing. It should be Harry/Hermione. Thanks for the help :)


** There are a couple Harry raised/trained by Grindelwald fics, but they are both Harry/Ginny, do you want them?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore. He and Harry join forces and chaos soon follow. Hermione is very enthusiastic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): You probably won't like it because this fic bashes almost everyone in Wizarding Britain into oblivion, including Hermione. But it also has some really juice scenes and cool moments.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]], linkffn(12740667): This fic has some good ideas, but is on the verge of being abandoned. A/N in the last chapter is not promising.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
