I have recently been reading stories that Harry has a family, but not a lot of them had him having more siblings. So, with that said, I am looking for a completed story that Harry has younger sisters. The sisters can be twins, triplets, etc. But I would like Harry to have someone. They would of been born before that Halloween day. Anyone know something like this? Pls let me know if you have read something like this. Thanks üôè


** :o This is a really nice idea Brookesy! :)

** Unfortunately, the kids in here aren't Harry's siblings but I hope that this somehow scratches the itch:

  What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children

** In the Potters against the world Harry is saved by his sister because he saved her countless times and she was repaying the favour by restoring his memories after he was obliviated. He's also fucking her but that's okay, because they're in love.
