I'm writing a new HP fanfic and I know that I'm in no way a good writer, but everyone needs to start somewhere. Hopefully, I won't make my (hopefully) future readers tear their hair out due to all the grammar error and bad wording. So if someone could lend a helping hand, that would be appreciated. I won't demand any consistency at coming to my help, as this is all for fun, at least for me. Contact: [[mailto:newnutaku1@gmail.com][newnutaku1@gmail.com]]


** I don't have the time to beta myself, but I would suggest you also partake in the Fanfiction reddit's weekly beta swap, check the Ffnet beta function (in the top bar on the main page), or post to the Dark Lord Potter forums for review if you have a thick skin to take their bluntly-phrased yet useful advice.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/authorbeta][Here]] is a list of betas. I'd also check out the subreddit discord for more feedback for your work.

** To add to what has been already offered, [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] has a weekly Beta Bartering Thread every Thursday -- which is today -- where people can ask for betas and where betas offer their services.
