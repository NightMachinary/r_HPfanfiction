His first book that I was able to find dates back to 2008, called Aspirations. It's very clearly one of if not his first foray into writing fiction. It's a !Dark Ginny x Harry GoF fanfic. It's not very good. In fact it's mostly terrible. The author seems to have recognized this as well.

The way it is written leads me to believe that it was written by well read young teenager. I don't mean this as an insult, I mean it literally. This gives us a fairly good idea if correct at the age of the author when he wrote this and helps us path his progress as a writer with an improving cognitive ability.

The book looks to have taken him 4 months to write and clocks in at 372k words.

Now I'm not here to bash this book, as I said, the author was most likely a child when he wrote it and for what it is, it's better than most children could ever hope to write, at least vocabulary wise, which is limited but still better than most of a similar age.

As the title of this post suggests, I'm looking at the the peculiar case of this authors steady improvement over 1.8 million words over a period of 4 years. During this he wrote 5 books, but followed up with 15.58 million words of absolutely zero improvement over a 7 and a half year period.

After finishing Aspirations, megamatt09 posted his first chapter of his next story just 2 weeks later, titled Inverted.

There isn't a significant jump in writing quality from Chapters 1 of Aspirations and Inverted. Nevertheless there are signs of improvement. The prose flows better and the dialogue isn't as clunky. The author still has issues with run-on sentences with virtually every second sentence though. The writing isn't great or anything write home about, but it is easy to follow and not a pain to read.

Perhaps the most significant thing about his second book however is that megamatt09 actually included a decent story in this one, showing that he is capable of being original and having good ideas.

Inverted is 84k words and it took him 1 month to write.

Megamatt09's third book, Spider-Man Chronicles 1: Origins, wouldn't have its first chapter published until 3 months later. It is here we start to see the author spread out into other franchises. Although I cannot vouche for the quality of this book as I found it rather dull when compared to Inverted. Also spiders aren't insects!

About 3 weeks after he started posting Spider-Man Origins, megamatt09 posted the first chapter for his next book, and it is this book that would ultimately set the stage for what he would write about for the next 8 years; Emerald Flight Book One: Union.

This book is a crossover with the DC animated series and Harry Potter, something that would become this authors main focus in his future works. It is a Harry x Kara fic.

It is also here that we would see megamatt09 start writing his plot along the same beats of the animated shows episodes, only with Harry! being in them.

For all I've said so far about this book, I strongly stand by my statement that book 1 of this trilogy was by far megamatt09's best work then and it remains his best work as of now. It's all downhill after this one. As such I won't spoil this book for anyone and I can recommend reading book 2 if for at least closure, although book 2 is also where megamatt09 would begin introducing harems that progressively grow large enough to begin harming character development.

In short, this book was well written and has an interesting, if not all too serious premise. The book does suffer from megamatt09's habit of never using words consistently though, sometimes with words that simply do not mean what the author thinks they mean. But this is an issue that in all these years megamatt09 still has and I don't see him fixing it anytime soon.

He wrote this book along side Spider-Man Origins and Herald of Death Book One: Countday to Doomsday, a Harry Potter Smallville crossover, which he started 2 months after starting Emerald Flight.

For the most part his writing wasn't affected in Emerald Flight by splitting his focus but Herald of Death clearly suffered from it. I can't speak for Spider-Man Origins though.

Emerald Flight Book One is 247k words, Spider-Man Chronicles Book One is 630k words and Herald of Death Book One is 478k words.

He finished Emerald Flight first, Herald of Death second and Spider-Man Chronicles last so I would expect the last half of Spider-Man Chronicles to be better than what I read of it. Herald of Death though is just trash from start to finish.

Over the next 8 years megamatt09 would continue to write Harry x DC crossovers and Harry x Marvel crossovers, and write the sequels for these 3 books. This is an 8 year period in which his writing remains of the same quality. His dialogue remains the same, his prose remains the same. His syntax, punctuation and grammar quality remains the same. And even his plots remain the same with just little changes here and there.

All of his stories from this point forward are full to the brim with harems where only the 1st and 2nd women have character development and the remainder end up having none. He fills these stories that have good premises with mostly poorly written smutt with these oversized harems. In one duology his harem is literally large enough to run multiple companies for him across the planet.

How is it that this writer would spend 8 years never improving? Maybe it was puberty, maybe it was college. It could be anything. But what it illustrates is that you can write 15.5 million words over 8 years and not improve along any metric at all.

Don't turn out like megamatt09. Keep improving yourselves.

Sometimes I think megamatt09 is just a really sophisticated AI that is stuck in a loop of writing the same plots over and over.

** I think the early improvement is a common symptom of many people who start doing something new. Beginner gains is the example that is most prominent in my head right now, but it's essentially the same thing. If you do something enough, generally you'll get better at it from the simple act of intuitive learning and adaptation.

It's relatively easy to go from a complete amateur with no experience to a complete amateur with enough experience to do better than you were. That's the first plateau in the pattern. Improving past that base level is a little about intentionally learning and practicing specific things, and a lot about doing it in general. Each plateau requires more intentional thought and work than just doing, and spending more time just doing can't substitute for structured, specific development of smaller parts of the whole.

Like you've said, megamatt improved his story between works and demonstrated originality. That's a relatively easy improvement to make and will often come naturally as a writer gains self confidence in their work. Something like the run-on sentences is more difficult because it won't happen by itself. Improving technical skills requires less time writing and more time thinking about writing.

Consciously working on improving your writing just isn't as much fun for some people, especially those for whom writing fanfics, or anything really, is a hobby done for pleasure. If someone has an hour of free time for writing, spending that hour on something else isn't very appealing.

*** It seems so strange to not seek to improve yourself when you spend so much time dedicated to a subject.

I mean if you're not going to try and get better or try something different, why keep writing after you finished the first story? I can see merit in redoing a plot premise once you've gotten better, but to just write the same plot at the same quality again is so weird lol.

**** I believe that most people are simply too lazy to improve in something if they're not passionate enough about it (myself included). I admire and envy people who try to be best in everything as opposed to one thing at one point in their lives.

Also, there's a large group of people that simply read, for instance, megamatt09's work for the 'smut' and not for any desire to read a decent story with an interesting plot & characters.

This large group of people are also quite vocal in expressing their appreciation for the stories with likes, kudos, comments, ... Which in turn probably gives the author a great sense of gratification.

Combine that gratification with a lack of passion and probably time (since writing fanfiction is a hobby and not a job) and well... you'll get these writers stuck in an endless loop of writing the same thing and not improving.

That's just my take on it. I don't have any scientific evidence to back this up just some logical thinking on my part.

** I think the best thing I ever did for my writing was taking two creative writing classes as electives during undergrad. What we mostly did? Wrote stories and talked about them. Having feedback on my stories, critiquing other people's writing and seeing the feedback to their stuff was very helpful.

Also, I think writing original fiction is important as well. You almost need to put more effort into the setting, characters, etc., and then you can use those tools to enhance your fanfic writing. Unfortunately, there aren't nearly as many communities for original fiction, which can make it difficult for fanfic writers who like getting views, kudos, comments, etc, but they do exist. Obviously there's tons of places for erotica, but if you want to share some (primarily sci-fi) original fiction I recommend [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]]. I'm sure there are other communities

Sorry, kinda rambling.

*** I would agree with that. But you'd think that after 12 years of writing stories totalling 17.391 million words that you'd progress even just slightly purely from brute force.

The guy still makes the same grammatical and word misplacement errors today that he was making 17.391 million words ago.

But then I guess that requires actually wanting to fix your errors.

** Oh god, I ran across him on Ao3 when I decided to go there for a reading binge. With a kindle that had a cracked screen, so touch sensitivity was really bad. TL;DR: The wrong fic was clicked.

What was it called... My Name is Harry Potter? Something on that line. The idea of a grand conspiracy behind the scenes causing the rise and falls of Dark Lords globally? That was a great idea. Hermione was secretly part of said conspiracy? Nice. The fact that there was muggles involved? Holy crap, that is amazing. Execution? Terrible. Right after the prologue it left Britain to go do crossover stuff. That was a nail in the coffin. The fact it became a pokemon harem (Gotta catch'em all!) sealed the final nail in the coffin.

I tried reading another of his fics, to see if there were more ideas that actually had good implementation. There wasn't. There are authors that have great ideas, and then flounder with the execution.

My new kindle ended up arriving the next day, so I didn't get too badly hurt by missclicks.

** I think its got to do with the feedback. In the reviews, maybe people mention that the writing sucks. For me, If I get three or four reviews like that in couple of chapters I seriously try to address valid points made. It could be that people have different threshold of "constructive" reviews for them to provoke reflection about their writing.

Also, favorites, follows play a big role. If you write garbage and still get them, there is a lack of incentive to improve. Perhaps this was the case with the author in discussion. Generally stories with Harems usually get a lot of favs/follows.

** I'm of two minds about megamatt. On one hand his earlier works like emerald flight herald of death and from that point of his writing'career' r quite good with almost the right plot vs smut ratio. (Despite his dislike of Hermione😉)

On the other hand his newer works, breeding ground or sticky situation for example feel like copy paste with some slight changes. It becomes.. well, boring.

I occasional check on his works in the hope for some improvement but alas...

** I kind of think he's bored with writing smut, but is a bit addicted to the page views. His Young Justice story had a good premise (The late HP's DNA is part of Superboy, and he has flashbacks/dreams about the Wizarding War), the recently returned from the dead Superwoman's ex-boyfriend is Lex Luthor, and there's a lot of conflict around how Superwoman isn't dealing with own death. If it weren't a megaharem it would be an entertaining story, maybe even a really good one.

But the sex scenes get monotonous in a hurry. A lot of the comments, even deep in the story, are about skimming for lines of dialogue and otherwise skipping them. Unless it involves Miss Martian. Then he's suddenly able to write something that doesn't feel like a cut and paste.
