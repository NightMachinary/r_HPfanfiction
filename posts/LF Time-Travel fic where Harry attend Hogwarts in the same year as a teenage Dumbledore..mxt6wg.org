I was reading through the posts on this subreddit when the idea suddenly came to me. As the title say, I'm wondering if there is a fic where Harry was sent back in time during his Hogwarts years to the 1890s and attend Hogwarts the same year as a young Albus Dumbledore.

If it doesn't exist, then it's a nice prompt to remember for later. It certainly interest me to write something like that. :)


** linkffn(Weeping Angel) has exactly this! it also has a really cool interpretation of divination going on throughout, expect slow updates though

  It's said that a woman with hair of gold in a blue dress came to this world many years ago. She watched as the ones she loved died while she stayed 20. She ran from Torchwood to the beach she came from. Few have seen her but all hear her sorrowful tune and weeps for a man that can't come back. She has many names: Weeping Angel, Angel of Gold, and the Bad Wolf Angel. -Eleven/Rose-
