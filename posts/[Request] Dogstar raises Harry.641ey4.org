Pls suggest your favorite complete, well-written fic(s) where because reasons Sirius is able to have custody of Harry from a relatively young age (would prefer getting him initially before Hogwarts, but would happily read later too if it's good!)

Longer is always better, but one shots are welcome too

Would prefer something that isn't overly lemony, has more plot or substance than just PWOP

I'm not a huge fan of true bash fics or Evil![Anyone Who Isn't Actually Canon Evil]

TIA :)


** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels (Initiate, Identity, and now Impose which is ongoing) have Sirius escape from Azkaban two years before Harry goes to Hogwarts, and Harry leaves the Dursleys to live with him while he's still a fugitive. Lupin's involved too, but there's no shipping between them.

The series is long, well written, and avoids cannon-rehashing, although some of the minor arcs can be a tad dull.

You gotta be kidding me!

Year 1 was PS, and Year 2 was CoS all over again. The plot almost follows canon rail exactly.

**** Uhh... no? /Innocent/ happens entirely before Hogwarts. In /Initiate/ the Philosopher's Stone is just one of many plot threads, and the events and consequences thereof are completely different. I will admit that /Identity/ concludes in the same way as CoS (i.e. diary, basilisk), but with a lot of differences in how they end up there. /Impose/ is going in a completely novel direction because of all changes.

And woven throughout are all the subplots with Remus and the werewolves, Marlene, Draco and his family, etc.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** I like this fic a lot. It has Sirius raising Harry, but it doesn't go much into how he raised Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Many Order members evacuated to France, including Sirius, the Longbottoms, and the Weasleys. Harry, Neville, and Weasley kids all went to Beauxbaton. After Ginny graduated, Dumbledore decided it was time to strike back. [[/spoiler][He instructed Snape to resurrect Voldemort, who promptly went after that traitor Malfoy]]. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione in a battle against Voldemort's forces. Later, Harry, Ginny, and Sirius would all play important roles.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Thanks y'all.

...also I know it's Wolfstar, but I had one of those fingers operating independently of brain moments...
