so in this fanfic harry essentially makes a pact with all magical creatures and their leaders, centaurs, goblins, elves, etc. there is a moment where an attack is launched on gringotts and harry fights by the goblins side, and one strange thing i remember is house elves on the roofs of other buildings assisting from above. another thing i remember is harry making a version of the marauders map that could change locations, so instead of only seeing hogwarts it could switch between hogwarts, diagon alley, etc.
