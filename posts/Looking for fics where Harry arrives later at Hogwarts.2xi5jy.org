Like 4th year or later. I know about Echoes Of Power and Hail Odysseus but that's all. Do you know other good ones?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]] - he ends up going in as a 3rd year, I believe. The Dursleys are psychotically abusive in this one and the beginning is over-the-top, but I like where it ends up. Abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One trilogy]] - Sirius breaks out of Azkaban early, absconds with Harry, raises him all over the world. I can't quite remember when he ends up going to Hogwarts, but I'm pretty sure it's VERY late - like, 5th year?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For]]. Dumbledore, Sirius and the others hid Harry from the world and turned him into a soldier. When they notice that that is all they've turned him into, they send him on a special mission: Go to Hogwarts, make friends. Sixth year onwards.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/][Gabriel]] is good if you don't mind OCs. Harry is adopted by a family in the US [they live in the US and the mum works at Salem Institute but the family is actually Indian] and attends Beuxbatons (I just know I fucked that up) off and on until he goes to Hogwarts 6th year in an exchange program thing. Features soldier! Harry, Hindu culture, culture clashes, HarryxOFC [non-romantic though] and no character bashing, surprisingly.

Edit: link and clean up
