** That Which Holds the Image

â€‹

Little Harry had a run-in with the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who... He survived, but they became his greatest fear. Which proves a bit inconvenient in a universe with Boggarts.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
