Sirius decides to stick around in dog form and gets adopted by all of Gryffindor


** I started this a while ago, but haven't fleshed it out into a full story yet. I wonder if I can post something this long.

“Where'd you get the owl?” said Ginny, eyeing Pigwidgeon, zooming around his cage.

Ron froze. “Um,” he cleverly said to Harry.

Explaining the sudden appearance of the owl was Harry's job? Should he say he bought it for Ron? That wouldn't say much for his taste in owls. Besides, she already knew Ron was too proud to accept gifts from Harry. “Ron has a secret admirer,” he said, smirking. That would show Ron to put Harry on the spot like that.

Ginny turned back to Ron. “Really?” she squealed. Ron's face turned pink, clashing horribly with his orange hair.

Safe. She was unlikely to guess that Ron's admirer was the infamous escaped convict, Sirius Black, who had first expressed his admiration of Ron by breaking his leg and attempting to kill his pet rat.

Ginny failed to extract any more details about Ron's secret admirer, but she could tell it was true by how strongly Ron was denying it. Once that topic of conversation had run its course, she sighed.

“Don't tell me you wish you had a secret admirer too,” said Ron. “You're too young.”

“No,” she replied. “I just wish I had a pet. You and Harry have owls, and Hermione has a cat, and Neville has a toad---“

“Crabbe and Goyle have that ferret,” interjected Fred.

“Snape has whatever's living in his hair,” added George.

“Dumbledore has Harry,” continued Fred.

“But I don't have anything,” continued Ginny as if her brothers hadn't interrupted her.

“You can use my owl to send letters if you want,” said Ron.

“Mine too,” said Harry.

“Thanks, but that's not the same as having my own pet,” said Ginny.

-------

“I think I'll name him Shadow, because he's so thin and black,” said Ginny. “Isn't he adorable?”

As much as Harry loved his godfather, “adorable” wasn't a word he'd have used to describe the starved-looking stray at the center of the crowd in the Gryffindor common room. He had the bone structure of a very large dog, clearly visible as there was very little fur or flesh to obscure the view. Despite his clearly neglected state, he looked very happy, wagging his tail with surprising energy.

“Professor McGonagall said I could keep him only if everyone here agrees, and he gets along with all the other pets. She said a big dog might be a problem. He's not a problem for anyone here, is he? He's a real sweetheart. I asked around in Hogsmeade, and people said the only animals they've seen him attack have been rats.”

Sirius, or rather Shadow, was sniffing the air and looking around the common room with great interest. He suddenly bolted for an armchair by the fire, where Crookshanks was sleeping, curled up to look just like an orange cushion. Lavender screamed, but Shadow gave Crookshanks an enthusiastic lick. Crookshanks opened his eyes and started purring, then closed them again. Shadow rested his head on the chair next to Crookshanks.

“A dog that likes cats?” said Lavender.

“An obviously hungry dog that likes cats?” said Parvati.

“I fed him in Hogsmeade,” said Ginny. “But he was nice even before that. He needs fattening up, and I'll ask Hagrid to check if he's sick or anything. This poor thing has obviously had a tough time recently, but he's still such a darling. I'm sure his original family must have been really good to him, for him to still be so friendly like this. I wonder what happened.”

Harry saw Sirius raise his head and take a breath almost as if he were about to say something, but of course he didn't. He put his head back down next to Crookshanks. Ginny joined the snuggle party on the chair.

“He probably has fleas,” said Ron. Harry and Hermione were impressed that he was able to talk at all.

“Probably,” agreed Ginny, still hugging Shadow and resting her head on his side, blazing orange hair against dull black. “I'll ask Hagrid about that. So, everyone's in agreement? I can keep him?”

A general cheer of asset roared through the common room. The three Gryffindor voices that could only manage an “Um,” an “Er,” and a voiceless gulp had no chance of being heard.

“Ginny,” said Ron. “We need to talk about this.”

“I know what you're going to say, Ron,” said Ginny.

In that case, Ron hoped she could tell him, since he didn't.

“You're going to say we need to ask our parents before getting a dog, since it's a big commitment.”

“Um.”

“You're right. Could I borrow your owl? I'll write to them right now. I'm sure they'll love Shadow as much as I do. He's so good at hunting rats, and maybe he'll even scare the gnomes out of the garden.”

*** As soon as he got a chance, Harry dragged him into the boys' dormitory and locked the door with his wand. “I'm so glad to see you, Sirius,” he whispered. “Everyone else should be at breakfast, and I locked the door just in case. You can drop the disguise.” It was awkward to hug a dog who was in the process of transforming into a man. Harry stepped back.

Transforming from a dog to a human is, of course, impressive, but Harry was also amazed at how different Sirius's human form could look. The young man his parents had chosen to be his godfather, Harry knew only from pictures. He'd probably acquired his aristocratic pureblood mannerisms before he'd learned to walk, or perhaps children of his class had tutors for that sort of thing. In the old photos, Sirius's glossy black hair hung casually over his grey eyes, which twinkled enough to let people know that his upper-class sneer was meant ironically.

The Sirius Black Harry eventually met in person looked quite different. Twelve years in prison changes people, particularly if the prison is Azkaban, from which no one but Sirius had ever escaped with their life, and no one at all had escaped with their sanity. Harry had been shocked that someone could be so gaunt, yet still alive. His clothes had been elegant thirteen years ago when he'd been arrested. He'd been wearing them ever since. His hair was matted. His pale skin was filthy. The former twinkle in his eyes had been replaced by a murderous glare. He seemed to have mellowed over the summer though. The starved-looking dog frenetically wagging its tail transformed into a starved-looking man grinning like a skull. He crushed Harry in a hug with his finally human arms, which were surprisingly strong. His dog form had smelled better.

Sirius finally loosened his grip and held Harry at arms' length to take a good look at him with eyes welling with tears. “I'm sure you're tired of people telling you you look just like your father,” he said.

“Are you tired of people telling you to take a shower? Because just in case you aren't, I'll say it.”

Sirius gave his barking laugh. “Your father was an arse too. Always knew how to ruin an emotional moment. You're right of course. Can I borrow a towel?” As Harry threw one at him, he added, “Seems pointless to sneak into a dorm shower without, say, someone else's girlfriend for company to justify the sneakiness.”

“The fact that you're running from the law isn't exciting enough?” Harry called through the bathroom door.

“You're no fun,” complained Sirius. “Poor child, with no one to corrupt you all these years. I pray I have not arrived too late.” He turned on the water and had to be told not to sing so loudly.

Harry would have to get to class soon, and still knew nothing about why Sirius had turned up. He was understandably taking his time in the shower. Harry stood there listening to Sirius sing Italian opera. “Padfoot?” Harry called, using his godfather's nickname, which hadn't been on the wanted posters, and so should be safer to say aloud. No answer. He probably hadn't heard him. He walked into the bathroom, where he found a pile of filthy clothes on the floor. “Scourgify,” he waved his wand at them, although he wasn't sure if there would be anything left once the dirt was gone.

“Thanks,” called Sirius from the shower. “Any ideas how I can replace my wand? I can give you access to my Gringots vault, and perhaps you could commission Olivander to make a copy of my old one? I'll need a legitimate address for him to send it to, not, ‘cold muddy cave in the wilderness where obviously only criminals dwell' or he might get suspicious.”

“He'll get suspicious anyway,” said Harry. “You know he remembers every wand he's ever sold. And you'll be quite fresh in his memory, with the news.”

“Damn. I need scissors.”

“What?” said Harry, who didn't see the connection.

“This hair is beyond help of either spells or conditioner, I fear. And could I borrow your toothbrush?”

“Um, I'll get you a new one. Look, we have a lot to discuss, but I have to get to class. And you'll have to change back and get back to the common room before anyone notices you.”

“Yes master.”

“Padfoot! I'm so glad to see you, but I'm also afraid you'll be caught! You know what that would mean! No cushy cell in Azkaban for you this time.”

“I know, I know, I'm supposed to hide in a dark cave, trying to subsist off rats, until the Ministry of Magic comes to their senses and give me a proper trial, or Atlantis rises from the depths, whichever comes first. I'm not supposed to see my godson, I'm just supposed to be patient and let him grow up without me. I've heard the speech from Dumbledore already, there's no need to repeat it. Damn it Harry, your parents chose me, not Dumbledore, as your godfather. I'm honor-bound to fulfill my promise to them, and my obligation to you.”

“You're risking your life coming here.”

“I have every right to.”

“Sirius, if I lost you...”

“Give a man some privacy to step out of the shower, would you? This is not a physique I wish to display. Once I scrubbed off the dirt there was virtually nothing left.”

Harry stepped out. He looked at his watch. “You need to be back in the common room, looking like a dog, in five minutes.”

Sirius stepped out shortly, in his clean rags, looking clean and smelling considerably better, and shaking. “Mirrors are evil,” he said. “It's a wonder they didn't include them in the cells to add that extra touch of misery. They saved that torture for anyone who escaped, to suffer afterwards.”

“Come on, we have to hurry.”

Without further ado, Sirius transformed into a starved, trembling, but clean dog. Harry removed his locking spell from the door to the boys' dormitory, and they headed downstairs to the common room.

Ginny was waiting for them, looking annoyed, but she smiled when she saw Shadow bounding her way. “The house elves said they'd save a dish of scraps from every meal,” she said to Shadow, who hadn't asked for an explanation of the eggs and bacon he was gulping down.

She turned to Harry. “What were you doing with my dog?” she demanded.

“Cleaning him off,” said Harry.

“He's MY dog.”

“He was lying on MY favorite chair. Scourgify,” he added, waving his wand at it.

She wanted to say more, but just said, “I'm taking him down to see Hagrid during my Care of Magical Creatures class. Come on Shadow.” Shadow followed her through the portrait hole without a look back.

**** “We were wondering, Harry,” said Fred.

“About that map we gave you,” said George.

“We know you might need it to protect yourself from Sirius Black,”

“Notorious criminal”

“Murderer of muggles and wizards alike,”

“Only person ever to escape from Azkaban,”

“Probably kicks kittens,”

“But we were thinking maybe asking you to track him all by yourself like that was rather rude.”

“We mean, you're younger than us,”

“Less experienced,”

“Naive,”

“So we're volunteering to track him for you.”

“Just give us back the map,”

“And we promise to scrutinize it every day,”

“Multiple times a day,”

“Searching for Sirius Black for you.”

“We know he betrayed your parents.”

“We know he's out to kill you next.”

“Wouldn't four eyes be better than two?”

Harry looked at their matching faces, their innocent eyes that worked on anyone once. “You're doing this for the reward, aren't you?”

Free and George looked at each other. “We do plan to give you a cut of course,” said Fred.

“Bait is an indispensable part of the trap.”

“Twenty percent?”

“No,” said Harry.

“Twenty five.”

“No.”

“A simple three-way split. We expect you to do some of the work of course, parade around in public advertising your convenient murderability.”

“No. I don't want you two hunting down Sirius Black.” Harry walked away.

“That ungrateful prat,” remarked Fred.

“Wants the whole reward himself,” added George.

--------------

Under Ginny's care, Shadow filled out with muscle and a thick coat of glossy black fur. He obviously enjoyed all the attention he got in the Gryffindor common room, and the girls' dormitory.

-------

“Harry, we have to tell her he's an animagus,” said Ron.

“Are you insane?” asked Harry. You know if anyone finds out---“

“We don't have to tell her which human he is, when he's in human form. Just a human, a grown man, she should not be petting like that.”

“No.”

“Yes. I know he's your godfather, but she's my sister.” And just like that, Ron walked away from Harry, across the Gryffindor common room, to where Ginny was brushing Shadow's gleaming black coat. Harry chased after him desperately, wondering if anything less than a stunning spell would do.

“Ginny,” said Ron. “About your dog. How do you know he's a real dog?”

Ginny looked up at him, quite startled. Sirius, Harry was amazed, showed no change of expression. After a moment, he nudged the brush in Ginny's hand to remind her to keep brushing. She obliged.

“What do you mean?” she asked. “How could he possibly not be a real dog?”

“He certainly smells like a dog, said Harry, supporting Ginny. “He acts like a dog. He looks like a dog. He's obviously a dog.”

“How do you know he's not an animagus in his animal form?” demanded Ron.

Ginny laughed. “That's ridiculous, Ron,” she said. “He's a dog all the time. Animagi can't stay in animal form all the time. They'd lose their minds. They have to turn back to humans frequently or they lose the ability. Ask professor McGonagall, she'll tell you all about animagi.”

------- Ron's hands were shaking as he held the map.

“What is it?” asked Harry.

Ron couldn't speak, just point. There, in the Gryffindor girls' dormitory, on Ginny's bed, was a dot labeled Ginny Weasley. Like the rest of the map, it was written in Sirius Black's beautiful handwriting, the product of penmanship tutors In his very early childhood. His parents hadn't expected him to use his magical and penmanship abilities to create the Mauraders' Map, and no doubt wouldn't have approved of the purposes to which he put it, but had they ever seen it, they would at least have recognized that they got their money's worth from those tutors.

Next to the dot labeled Ginny Weasley, in fact partly overlapping it, was a dot labeled Sirius Black. Both dots were moving slightly, in a rocking sort of motion.

“Your godfather is in bed with my little sister!” yelled Ron.

“Keep your voice down,” said Harry.

“Aargh!”

“Look, um, I'm sure there's an explanation,” said Harry.

“Well of course there's a bloody explanation,” said Ron. “I know what the explanation is. You put a ladies' man in a dormitory with a bunch of teenage girls, that's the explanation. What did you think would happen?”

“This wasn't my idea,” said Harry.

“But you were happy about it!” said Ron.

“Look, um, let's ask Hermione what's going on in the girls' dormitory, ok? Don't jump to any conclusions until we do that.”

------- “She keeps singing him lullabies.”

“What?”

“She sits on her bed with him on her lap, rocks him, and sings him lullabies. It's like he's her babydoll. She's having a great time.”

“Is he?”

Hermione was silent.

“What?” said Harry.

“I got most of this information from Luna Lovegood. She's in Ginny's year, so they spend more time together. I asked Luna if anything struck her as odd about Shadow.”

“Damn it, Hermione, I thought we agreed not to do anything that might make people suspect Sirius! Don't plant ideas in people's heads!”

“I wouldn't have said this to anyone but Luna,” said Hermione. “She believes so many ridiculous things anyway, I knew no one would believe it even if I told her the whole truth and her dad printed it in his magazine. Not that I'm going to do that,” she added in response to Harry's look.

“Well, does she suspect anything?” asked Harry, still annoyed.

“No,” said Hermione. “She said that Shadow bears some superficial resemblance to the Grim, but is obviously just a dog, not any sort of magical creature.”

***** “Look, it's just not appropriate, all right? I mean Ginny's thirteen, and you're, what, in your thirties at least? You're old enough to be her father.”

Sirius was silent for a while. Then, “What?”

“What do you mean, ‘What'?” demanded Ron. “I mean it's not appropriate. You're much too old for her.”

There was an even longer pause at this. Then Sirius said, “What year is it?”

When Ron had been rehearsing this confrontation in his mind, this was not a response he'd prepared for.

Harry, though initially taken aback, quickly realized that his godfather's difficult life had not featured access to luxuries like calendars recently. “1995,” he said gently.

Sirius started at this. “Really?”

Harry and Ron nodded.

“And I was born in---“ Sirius paused briefly. “1959!” he said triumphantly. “So that makes me... Aargh, why can't I do simple arithmetic in my head? Get me scrap parchment and a quill.”

Harry said, “So that makes you---“

“Shut up Harry, I should be able to do this myself.” He grabbed a scratch pad and quill off the nightstand. After some difficulty holding the quill, he slowly wrote the two numbers down and stared at them. He tried to scratch his head, which resulted in him falling off the bed because he used his foot to do it.

Harry and Ron offered him their hands to help him up, but he didn't take them, just stared at the ceiling. “This is why the books said not to stay in your animal form too long,” he said. He eventually got up and carefully sat on the edge of the bed again.

Harry's heart was pounding. Danger in the form of basilisks or giant spiders he was used to, but how was he to fight the slow disintegration of a human mind?

“Books!” said Ron with relief. “We'll just ask Hermione. She'll soon sort all this out.”

Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.

-------

Sirius smashed the mirror, and looked in horror at the shards, with much the same expression with which Harry and Ron were looking at him. “My father's after me,” he said. “That wasn't a common mirror, that was one of those communication mirrors. I recognized his face. Why would he be trying to contact me now? We haven't spoken since he disowned me when I was sixteen.” He turned to Harry, looked him in the eyes, and put his hand on his shoulder, all completely human gestures much like he used to have. Harry felt a wave of relief. “James,” he said, “I need your help,” and Harry felt a chill. “My parents must have seen the wanted posters. They think I've brought shame upon the ancient and noble house of Black. They'll do anything to try to maintain their reputation as purebloods. They don't like all this bad publicity. They'll try to drown me like a squib!”

There was a knock at the door. Sirius, although they wouldn't have believed it possible, looked even more horrified than before. He quickly turned into a dog and hid under the bed.

“Reparo,” said Harry, waving his wand at the broken glass. The shards danced around on the floor trying to assemble themselves, but seemed to be having difficulty. Harry left them to it and opened the door.

“What are you doing to my dog?” demanded Ginny. “I thought I heard him whimper.”

Shadow bolted out from under the bed and tackled Ginny. He put his front paws on her shoulders and licked her face, his tail wagging so vigorously it almost knocked them both down.

“Down, boy!” laughed Ginny. Shadow immediately got down and pranced at her feet. “Sit,” she said. He sat, gazing up at her, his tail thumping the floor. “Good boy,” she said, patting his head. “I brought you a treat from dinner, look, part of a chop.” She took a greasy paper napkin out of her pocket. “Leave it. Do a trick for me first. Roll over. Good boy! Oh, you're such a good dog. Here's your treat.” Shadow gulped it down and pranced with joy again.

“Leave my dog alone,” said Ginny. She walked out in a huff, her dog at her heels.

They were silent for a while. “She's really good at the imperius curse,” said Ron.

Harry looked at the broken glass on the floor, shards tumbling over each other in confusion, trying and failing to reassemble. “Scourgify,” he said, and the shards flew to the wastebasket.

----

“You've deceived this poor child long enough,” said Snape. “It's time for the truth to finally be revealed. Pay attention students, and you'll learn the spell for revealing the true form of an animagus.” He waved his wand at Shadow, who was paying him no attention. “Homomorphous!”

Shadow lifted his leg and piddled on Snape's shoe.

“Stick to potions, Snape.”

-------

Harry searched the map. There was the girls' dormitory, there was Ginny, and there, right next to her on the bed, clearly labeled in Sirius's beautiful handwriting, was Shadow.

****** You know, the direction I thought that would go would be 'Peter Pettigrew's been a rat for so long that he's forgotten to be human, hence the Map only showing Scabbers', and the Homorphus Charm (assuming that doubles as the animagus-reversal spell) can be used to restore an animagus who's forgotten their identity.

******* That works too. My only justification for the homomorphus spell working on Peter, but not Sirius, is that Sirius had twelve years of damage to his humanity in Azkaban, while we don't really know what Peter got up to when no one was looking. He may have gone to Hogsmeade for a drink occasionally in his human form for all we know.

The best explanation I've seen for no one noticing Peter on the map is that the Marauders designed it so that only people who've seen animagi transform can see them by their human names on the map when they're in their animal form. So if the twins saw anyone sleeping with Ron, they just saw Scabbers and thought nothing of it. Professor Lupin saw Peter's human name on the map because he'd seen him transform when they were students.
