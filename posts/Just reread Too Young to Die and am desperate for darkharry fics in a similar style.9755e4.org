I'm not talking, "ah, look at me I'm sorted in Slytjerin! I kicked a dog I'm evil!"

I mean genuinely dark, a character who like in Too Young to Die does whatever and whom ever he wants, as long as its not obnoxious in that regard. Two fics I've read and enjoy that were similar were:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise) linkffn(Harry Potter, the Forgotten Son)

Thanks.

linkffn(Too Young to Die)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** Harry could cast his own brand of Fiendfyre without a wand, alongside other curses and magic of pure Death. He was undoubtedly immune to Dementors and his body was far above most Wizards. Despite the authors comments I can't imagine this Harry wouldn't eventually escape Azkaban. xD And even if he didn't escape, let's at least acknowledge that Voldemort would 100% break him out alongside his followers. Even if it's just long enough to question him, he would do it. Harry would be in Azkaban for a few years at most.
