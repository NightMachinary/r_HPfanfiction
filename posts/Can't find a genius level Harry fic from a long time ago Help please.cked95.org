This is a long shoot, but here I go!

There was a recent post about looking for genius level Harry fics and it jogged a memory I had of reading a short unfinished fic years ago. I can't find it and I suspect it might have been taken down, but on the off chance it isn't or if someone remembers it:

Think the summary had something about it being a gentle friendship between Harry and Snape and how it was like a slow easy plot without a lot of action. Harry gets picked up by the government/organization for being extremely intelligent at a young age. Nothing bad happens to him there, they just let him do what he wants and they profit off of his work. He has a photographic memory. Snape is the one that has to hand deliver the Hogwarts letter to Harry. Snape of course complains a lot. Harry decides to go to Hogwarts cause he's bored, and magic gives him something new to learn.

I remember very clearly one chapter where Harry was in the library reading stacks of books. Snape enters and see the books and makes a comment on how Harry couldn't have possibly read them all. Harry says he can prove it and asks Snape to choose a random book from the stack and choose a random page. Harry is able to recite word for word what's on that page. It freaks Snape out.

Annnnd that's all I remember. It was all very cliche, but I remember really liking it and I just want to reread it to get it out of my system.
