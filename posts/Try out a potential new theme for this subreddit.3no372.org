** Hey, all,

Since I'm too lazy to create my own images and CSS, I'm trying the free-to-use and publicly available [[https://www.reddit.com/r/themes/comments/3in1u1/slique_a_clean_and_soothing_theme_with/][Slique theme]].

Unfortunately, we were denied permission to use the [[/r/harrypotter]] theme, but I was thinking a makeover might not be a bad idea for us, either.

If you guys like it, we'll be switching soon!

Why wouldn't they want another HP related sub to use their theme?

**** Good question!

As it stands, [[/r/harrypotter]] does not own the theme; it was created by [[/u/dagrock]] out of generosity. [[/u/dagrock]] even offered to help me out with CSS for this sub - unfortunately, CSS is very far down the list of priorities for me, even in programming, and I will not have time to do my own. That she offered to help out in the first place was /pretty cool/, I think. The style sheet certainly is a work of art, and I think I can understand why she would be uncomfortable with spreading it.

For example, while I have a bot on this sub, and it's open source (so anyone can use it), there's something quite personal about /creating/ something. If someone asked if they could use it - I would allow them, I think, because it's less of a work of art and more of a tool - but still, I would feel just a tad bit uncomfortable, because it is a lot of effort put into one creation, and to have it spread seems to dilute the effort. I can imagine it applies much more so to something like [[/u/dagrock]]'s stylesheet.

And it's super-cool that [[/u/TreeTwo]] has thrown up the Silque theme for anyone to use on GitHub! I think it looks phenomenal.

*** Hmm. Reddit Mobile was never good in the first place, and many Reddit apps exist for virtually every major phone OS - regardless, if you don't want to use an app, you should consider using the mobile version of Reddit.com as opposed to the desktop version on your phone.
