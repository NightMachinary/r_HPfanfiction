Can you drop some of your favorite angst fics. Long, well-written, slash or gen, Harry-centric fics are preferable. Thanks!

PS. Unhappy endings are also preferred. üòä

  ‚ÄúIt's always been the three of us, Harry,‚Äù Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.‚ÄúWe've dealt with enough strange things mate,‚Äù Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. ‚ÄúLet this be a good thing.‚ÄùWith the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

  Harry and Hermione grew closer after Ron left. And then...that day at Malfoy Manor, Hermione was tortured into a coma. When she wakes, she cannot remember beyond the Horcrux Hunt. Now it's her thirtieth birthday, and Harry visits. Harry, who is married with three children and who cannot forget the seventeen-year-old girl he loved. Dark AU. Tragic Harmony.

Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
