Several characters have pretty standard bashing mechanisms:Dumbledore: Manipulating Harry

Ginny/Molly: Love Potion / Gold Digging

Ron: Disloyalty

Hermione: Scheming/Grand Plan/Hero Worship

​

I'm looking for any fics where the thing these characters are commonly bashed for happens, and they are Harry's #1 defender:

- Harry love potioned to Ginny, she finds out and goes on a rampage
- Dumbledore, trying to protect Harry and give him what little bit of childhood he can afford, finds out the Order / Weaslesys are trying to manipulate him
- Ron going off on Hermione/Ginny for the type of disloyalty he is normally portrayed as.

Basically, a reversal of the normal bashing :P.

​

BONUS POINTS: If I rated the characters by their level of 'sympatheticness', I'd say it would be Hermione/Ginny/Ron/Molly/Dumbledore. That is, Dumbledore is generally bashed more than Molly, who is bashed more than Ron, who is bashed more than Ginny, etc. Bonus points of the fic has the more bashed character correcting the less bashed character. That is, Dumbledore going on a rampage for Harry to correct Ginny doing evil stuff is better than Ginny going on a rampage for Harry to correct Dumbledore Stuff.

​

Bring on the fics!

The only thing I would ask is if the character is correcting some bad behavior, that doesn't somehow get them the reward they would have gotten if they participated. For example, If Ginny goes on a rampage for someone love potioning Harry to her, to do a Harry/Ginny story at that point... undermines the value. Or if Dumbledore goes on a quest against people manipulating Harry, having Harry follow all his complex plans to the letter after as if he had manipulated him... it just reduces the payoff. It is much better if Dumbledore doing this means he has to accept that his plans have to change for Harry, or if Ginny finding out about the love potion means she has to accept his feelings were false. Loss makes good character development!


** Off the top of my head,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/5/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][/An Incomplete Potter Collection/ by Racke, Chapter 5, "Ambitiously Ron"]]: Manipulative!Dumbledore sends Ron to befriend Harry on Hogwarts Express in order to get Harry under his thumb. Ron has other ideas.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/79/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual][/Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual/ by Clell65619, Chapter 79, "The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic"]]: two bash-subversions for the price of one: Ron is a loyal friend to Harry and Hermione despite being pressured by the whole Wizengamot (including, unfortunately, Dumbledore), and of Harry and Hermione, Hermione is portrayed as the more dangerous one.

**** That said, how often /does/ Hermione get bashed for scheming? I know that a fair number of people around here have a problem with that aspect of her character, but I don't know many fics where she's bashed for it. Usually, it's stuff like,

1. authority-worship, book-worship, and generally being Lawful Stupid;
2. siding with Manipulative!Dumbledore over Harry;
3. being overly morally inflexible, haranguing the Gray!Edgy!Protagonist about doing grey, edgy things.

***** I was referring in the traditional "side with Dumbledore" (or sometimes Molly) thing, after all, you generally don't generally have 11 year olds be the mastermind of plots.

​

Both Ron and Hermione's biggest bashing can be played solo (Ron is jealousy, and Hermione's is being inflexible and authority worship). When they are played as part of a more elaborate plot though, they tend to follow both of those patterns.

However, with Ron, following Dumbledore's evil plot for jealous reasons is usually "I was promised fame/fortune/whatever to pretend to be his friend etc", and Hermione is usually "I'm a true believer / I do as the authority says". This makes Ron more miniony somehow (Because he isn't usually portrayed as a conspirator, just a tool), while Hermione is usually displayed as... being a more active part in the plot? Actively taking initiative to see the goals through rather than just doing what is told.

That makes sense. However, I think it's an easy mistake with Hermione in particular: she was 13 when she produced and executed a plan to secretly brew a semi-legal potion from stolen ingredients, kidnap and impersonate three of her classmates, sneak into their dorm, and interrogate a fourth one; 15 when she kidnapped and blackmailed a reporter; and 16 when she organised a militia in a school. So, you might want to edit the OP to clarify. :D
