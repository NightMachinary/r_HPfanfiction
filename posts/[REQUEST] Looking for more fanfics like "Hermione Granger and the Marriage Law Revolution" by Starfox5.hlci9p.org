I'm looking for more Harry/Hermione fanfictions where they are badass and smart. Also where there is a lot of action, political maneuvering, fixing the bigotry and flaws in the ministry of magic, and battles. Also has scenes that show the badassery of Harry and Hermione. The fanfic is really realllllyyyyy great and I'm looking for more like it but I hope you guys know some. Thank you! :D


** Then I recommend reading his others fics, including Romione ones:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676/chapters/26197056][Divided and Entwined]], linkao3(11645676), is especially heavy in wars and politics. I'm actually rereading it right now.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16521608/chapters/38699969][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkao3(16521608), is less violent, but features a different kind of badass Harry/Hermione.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15793902/chapters/36753675][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkao3(15793902), has Grindelwald leading them to victory!

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this..

*** Yeah, I'm reading "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" right now and it's going great so far. I'm thinking don't think I would be reading "Divided and Entwined" anytime soon because I'm just a diehard Harmony guy. Are there any pairings in "Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying"? I'm thinking of reading it next since the premise is so intriguing

**** If you insist on Harmony, his "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" and "HP and the Secret of Atlantis" are better picks.

"Spygirl" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy" are also surprisingly entertaining.

Finally, "HP and the Girl Who Walked on Water" is one very unlikely crossover. Can you imagine Voldemort returning as zombie battleship Bismarck?

** I couldn't get into this one because the plot seemed so farfetched and got hammered in really quickly. It felt like I was being quickly told "What if this happened because of this" and then the story begins in earnest.
