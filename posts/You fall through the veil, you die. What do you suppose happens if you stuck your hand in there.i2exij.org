If you just happened to touch it with your palm, are you dead, or will you become an interesting merge of ghost and man? Is a toe going through the curtain enough to cause you death or are you in safe territory? If you don't die, then where is the line /drawn/, if I stuck my lower half in there, am I as good as dead? Is my ear brushing the curtain going to guarantee my death?


** Iirc Harry heard voices, beckoning him closer to it? Perhaps if you get so close that you can put your hand through it, either the temptation to cross all the way through is impossible to resist or... something grabs you and pulls you through

***** A more morbid thought is Quirrell pulling him in since Harry 'killed' him. So if Voldemort ever steps through there, I think the physics of magic will overturn with the sheer force of people pulling him in.

****** I really like the thought of you getting pulled through. How could the living rationalize with the thoughts of the dead? Maybe Harry's parents would be the one to pull him through, with their opinions being how existence is pain. To the dead, maybe life is only full of misery. They say that only the dead know an end to war, maybe that's more true than poetic words.

** Take a leaf from Horcruxes. As long as there is something anchoring you in the real world, you can't die. So even a single toe on this side would do it.

You /probably/ could take a full peek if someone held your hand. No Unspeakable nowadays tries, though, ever since some three hundred years ago one of them went insane after researching the veil. Alive =/= mentally sound.

** You ever see someone cut by a Shardblade?

Y'see, Shards don't really interact with flesh at all, just passes right through. The /soul/, however is cut apart. A man can survive having a limb 'cut off', but any serious torso wounds are usually fatal.

Folks who lose a limb to those cursed things never regain its' use, it is limp, numb and useless. Like an inverted phantom limb. The hand is right there, it looks fine but it is not your hand anymore.

It is just a hand that happens to be attached to your body.

** The veil is criminally under-utilized in canon. It is a bridge to the underworld. It has bearing in ancient mythology.

I use it as a portal. In my world, it is a path to afterlife, but it can be reversed. I feel like this is the only way to properly address the veil. It's /cool/. I want to be cool.
