Ie that Lupin and James Potter had switched places before James' death. Or the theory that Ron was actually Dumbledore.


** I favorite theory in that the whole of canon after first year is just one big accident, and that the reason Dumbledore never went after the crux's is because he fully intended to entrap Voldie forever in the Mirror; and then a few stupid kids F'd it up.

** My favorite is how Dumbledore made Fawkes his horcrux, making him essentially immortal. With the amount of Dumbledore bashing out there, I'm surprised I haven't found one.

** My favourite is that Ron is actually a seventh son of Arthur's, and hence he's a seer, doesn't know it. The theory also breaks down that Arthur killed his oldest while under imperious curse and that's why he acts real weird concerning Veela and he knows Moody so well

** I've always believed that the prophecy meant that Harry will become Immortal. Since only LV may kill him and thus be forever be barred from eternal rest. This also increased the tension that if LV kills him LV will truly be Immortal.

Where the person who wishes for immortality dies and the one who only wishes to reunite with his family doesn't.
