** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]]-the first one is just about the romance (mostly) but the sequels from what I have read have an interesting plot.

Edit: Would you enjoy a story where they are just friends?

#+begin_quote
  Albus and Scorpius aren't sure what they're doing when their relationship starts to change, and they discover the complexities of balancing a relationship and keeping secrets while immersed in Hogwarts where nothing stays quiet for long. As they find their footing in uncharted territory, Scorpius finds out he bears a heavier burden than just the Malfoy name, and Albus realizes some things are more important than his life.

*** Probably because you mentioned the Play-Which-Shall-Not-Be-Named. It's kind of a Taboo around here. Also there are people who downvote if the title mentions /anything/ they don't like. Sad, but true.

That said, I second the vote on It's Tea Time. It's the only time I've liked a story based on CC. I can't say anything about the sequels, though, as I haven't read them.

** Sadly don't have any fics to recommend (other than the novelization of the cursed child that someone wrote), just wanted to upvote and lurk. But I'm glad someone else loves goofy and lovely Scorpius.

​

He's probably one of the biggest reasons it upsets me how much people on reddit seem to hate CC. How can you hate the lovely Scorpius? In my opinion, there's no way that Draco would raise a son to be cold and mean. There are certain things you can kinda tell JK had more input on (even if you choose to reject the other stuff as canon), and I think Scorpius and Albus are definitely two of those things (from their sorting, their personalities, etc..)

Also. If people liked CC more, maybe we'd get more fanfics :(

*** The problem is that, while Scorpius in CC is pretty great, he's pretty much the ONLY THING that's even decent in that story. Everything else is pretty awful. (Well, okay, there's some argument to be made for it being nice to get a couple new (short) Harry/Ginny scenes, but still).

​

And okay, I guess I don't really have a problem with Albus either. He doesn't really seem Slytherin to me, but that might not be a bad thing. And neither does Scorpius, anyway.

**** Eh, to be honest, people don't see any slytherin that does any mildly good deed as being a slytherin. I feel the most strongly about them being slytherin because I believe it's one of the things JKR had a lot of input on. I think many (I know I did) assumed Albus would be in slytherin before CC was even thought of. Also, I'm a slytherin, so it's nice to have some representation! Albus is definitely a slytherin in my mind and while I imagined Scorpius as a ravenclaw in my head canon pre-cc (and quite honestly he fits the bill in cc as well), I could see him in slytherin and accept it. He definitely could fit in ravenclaw but Neville could fit and hufflepuff and he wasn't in that. I would use the hermione and ravenclaw argument but I actually can't see her in ravenclaw, so I won't haha

As for the play itself, I don't agree. I actually think the Albus and harry arc was done beautifully but I also have a theatre background so maybe that helps. Even if you don't, I think seeing it on stage would make it a lot better than it comes across on the page. I also love Draco's redemption arc. I think it was lazily overlooked in the last few hp books because it definitely was hinted at and then just went.. nowhere. I think Albus and Scorpius friendship is beautiful but I will admit the queerbaiting is one of the things that did kind of ruin CC for me. I know I'm the minority, but I actually liked the time travel. I think people look way too far into it to try and make it non-canon compliant. But it's even addressed in the play.

Overall, I think people try very hard to dislike it. I'm not saying it's perfect because it's not. Or that it's the 8th Harry Potter book because it's not. It was never trying to be. It's just a fun little extension of the story and when taken with a grain of salt it's a nice one. It gives us a nice little insight on the character's lives. Harry was never going to be a perfect father. Draco was obviously going to change.I know Jkr did not write it but she is not a playwright. I find it hard to believe she would let someone butcher her idea of where her characters ended up and she herself said she had input.

I do want to thank you for being kind and civil tho. Most people are just like, lol cc sucks. And they've never even seen or read it

***** Neither Scorpius or Albus seem cunning or ambitious to me. Although I get it, they are just kids, so it might not be an awful thing that they're not the typical fanfic Slytherin. OTOH, they do seem to value friendship and be prone to ridiculous, foolish heroics, which makes them seem more like Hufflepuffs or Gryffindors to me. Still, it's not like we see all of their lives, so maybe they do fit in Slytherin. The problem I had is that it seemed more like a plot device to get people to hate them than something that actually fit their character.

I can't comment on how well-done the Albus and Harry arc was, since it's been too long for me to remember anything but my poor impression. I don't think that was a part I specifically hated, so maybe you're right. And I could definitely believe that seeing it on stage would make me like it better, but that doesn't change how bad it is in written form.

Draco's redemption arc was another thing I liked, I'll give you that. And the way he seemed to be friends with the Potters without any shipping was nice. There's very little Draco redemption in fanfic without shipping him with someone.

I have very strong opinions about time travel. I've read a ridiculous amount of time travel stories of varying quality, and this was definitely one of my least favorite ones. I've since accepted that this is apparently how time travel works in Harry Potter, but it seems really over-complicated and annoying with the varying timelines that don't change the characters doing the time travel somehow. It actually seems a bit similar to Back to the Future's time travel, except those were excellent enough movies that I didn't even notice the plot inconsistencies until several viewings. (I don't mean to say you shouldn't enjoy it, though.)

I do agree that Harry not being a perfect father and Draco changing were good things to have. So were Scorpius being his awesome self, Albus and Scorpius being friends, Albus having trouble living in his father's shadow, and a couple other things. But overall, the execution was terrible. None of the character voices sounded right. Ron's character was skewered. Ginny and Harry switched lines (and other things were changed) in the epilogue for pretty much no reason. Ginny was strangely absent. And I'm pretty sure there were other things I didn't like, but it's been too long since I read it.

I feel like you gave me too much credit, but I'm still glad you found my comments kind and civil. Again, feel free to like what you like; there's just lots of legitimate reasons a lot of us don't like it.
