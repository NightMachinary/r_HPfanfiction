Linkffn(7871351)

I really enjoyed this story and I want MOAR! I just want something that is similar. I would prefer it to be complete.

Thank you.

  After the Second Wizard War, the Veil turned inward and spat out a few familiar faces-as children! Severus, Sirius, and Lily get a second chance to live their lives over again. What things will change, and what will stay the same? With Harry as Sev's guardian, Remus as Sirius', & Lily has a surprise new family. AU!

** "Backwards" linkffn(7281096) which follows the same premise as the story you read, though, it's incomplete and is likely abandoned at this point. Then there's "Raising Snape" linkffn(12550041) is incomplete, but it's been updated quite recently and the author appears to be quite good at finishing what they start. Then I'd recommend "Do Not Pass Go" linkffn(10867243). It's a complete one-shot that follows a vaguely similar idea, but Harry raises Voldemort post-war from a baby.

  Return to the start. Do not pass Go. Do not collect 200 dollars. Harry and pals' ultimate spell goes awry, and Voldemort is reverted to a baby, brain and all. Everyone deserves a second chance, and this time, Harry's making sure Voldemort gets it. one shot with a twist, no pairings beside some canon, father/son!HPLV, teetering on the edge of a crack!fic
