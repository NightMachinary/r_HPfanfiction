As there is a prophecy, have him defeat an already beaten bound gagged armless legless etc Voldemort or something at the end (After either not including, or finding some way to remove his Horcrux) and have the adults fight the war, handle all the stuff at school... you could make Voldemort more competent to make up for it, but a 17 year old shouldn't beat a 70 year old Dark Lord with 53 years of experience on him, and a lot more skill because of a Deus Ex Machina. The adults should have won in a long and bloody battle leading to a lot of deaths on Voldemort's side (There were already a lot of deaths on the "Light" side but a few more would amke sense) as I can't remember who the "Light" actually killed except Bellatrix, and Voldemort himself. Voldemort killed Snape, and Pettigrew was killed by his own hand. I want to see an actual war, where if the children are brought in, it's not til post 7th year where things are militarised.


** 'Good guys' won without Harry's involvement in the one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]], linkffn(4269983), but you wouldn't necessarily like them.

A competent Dumbledore did a great job in another dimension in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure-Part-1][Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1]], linkffn(9824342), and has begun cleaning up things in canon world.

Harry and his friends haven't seen much action in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12769659/1/Nymphadora-Tonks-The-Last-Auror][Nymphodora Tonks: the Last Auror]], linkffn(12212363;12769659). The UK military, its allied wizards, and Goblins were duking it out with Voldemort and his minions, while Dumbledore and his followers fled into basically another dimension.

Dumbledore, India Cohen, and Watcher's Council did most of the work in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515), although the Trio had major contributions too.

After Harry, Hermione, the Grangers, and Sirius fled magical Britain in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558), Dumbledore was forced to get his hands dirty with the help from Amelia Bones. Surprisingly, they did a pretty good job.

Harry was cunning, but it's Lockhart who shined in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363). [[/spoiler][They even managed to fully wipe Voldemort's memory at the end of Year 1, neutralizing him and saving Quirrell]].

You have a very strange understanding of competence. In “Patron” Dumbledore knew about Riddle's preparations through Harry's visions and still was totally unprepared for the final attack.

That he wasn't completely successful at that is something to be expected when going up against Voldemort, even with some (limited) intel thanks to Harry's Visions.
