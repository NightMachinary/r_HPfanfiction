** I've never liked it when Harry smokes cigs. I could honestly see him smoking weed after the end of his fourth or fifth year, but cigs just feels off for some reason.

** I love the premise of this story and love everything the author did with the plot. I just hate the dialogue. Almost whenever they talk about getting high or smoking it sounds like what you would think stoners talk like, not what they actually talk like.

** I liked the starting, but it went a bit repetitive and over the top once the gang reaches Hogwarts..
