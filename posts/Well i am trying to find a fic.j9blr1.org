:END:
It was like in the summer after Sirius died harry awakens a demon and he progessivly becomes more dark and at some point he becomes a demon and eventually destroys Hogwarts along with draco who is also a demon and they open a portal to hell so all the demons can invade the world.

I think somewhere in the did he needs to destroy his soul to fully become a demon so he rapes a unicorn turned human bc she is the purest that can be so yeah.

Honestly I expect nothing from this but if you do find something thanks.

Sorry for well the text was made in a moment of desperation and I am also not a native English speaker .thanks for anything really
