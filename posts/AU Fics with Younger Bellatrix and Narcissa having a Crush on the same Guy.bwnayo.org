It can happen in Canon (ignoring Bellatrix death, but i think her persona is to messed up for this). To make it easy, i name the Guy Harry. I thought about him time - or dimension travel to a place that have Bellatrix and Narcissa younger. Maybe at their Late School years or later, but definetely younger, than at the Canonpoint. Narcissa having a Crush on him, but also Bellatrix shows interest in him....whether this is because she has the same likings as her Sister or to make her Jealous, doesnt matter. Anyway, i thought about while Narcissa is more of a mature Character, Bellatrix would be more of a alluring/seductive type.

​

There is no need for Time travel, but the whole AU thing would be enough. Its what i had in mind, though

​

Although its not necessary, but if Harry shares his Bed with them, it would be both. Whether its mutual or cheating.

​

Oh, yeah, that Guy please shouldnt be Lucius.
