Tonks has canonically made herself taller which suggests she has the ability to extend her bones and organs to fit a differently sized body. Would she never die of old age if she continued to reproduce her bones and organs and prevent the body's natural decline? Obviously she would die if she was struck by the killing curse or otherwise killed in battle, but like a lobster, if she wasn't murdered, could she have lived forever?


** AFAIK, cells mostly age and eventually die because the ends of chromosomes, the so-called telomeres, become shorter every time the cell divides. Given that growing requires some cell division, changing her appearance a lot would cause rapid cell division, making her cells actually age /faster/ and therefore, make it probable for her to die at a /younger/ age than the average wizard.

Also, lots of cell division in a short time makes it more probable for her to develop tumors.

So much for the nerdy side of things. But then again, it's magic, so who knows!

*** Organisms such as lobsters have telomerase which allows them to rebuild telomeres. So they only die when they either get bacterial infection when moulting their exoskeleton, are eaten or if they grow to large to effectively build exoskeleton

**** That's an interesting addition, thanks! I wonder if wizards know about gene therapy, haha. If they do, they could add some naked mole rat to their genome to make sure they don't get tumors.

But given that the wizarding world is stuck in the 19th century, they might not even know that DNA is a thing XD

*** Permanent transfiguration isnt common or easy. So not a good idea to seal an artery and watch it revert a few hours later. And a transfigured, permanently unchanging body part will definitely cause problems with the natural bodily functions. Stuff that makes large changes to the body, like polyjuice, is also difficult and expensive to create for a temporary effect.

** Just like transfiguration doesn't change the fundamental nature of an object, I doubt that Tonks' metamorphmagi powers changes her fundamental nature. While she can change how she appears, she is still fundamentally a 20 something year old witch who is the daughter of Ted Tonks and Andromeda Black. While she can change how old she appears to be, it doesn't change how old she actually is. Also, if metamorphmagi were immortal, it would have certainly come up in the books. Just imagine how desirable they would be to the wizarding world, and Voldemort would almost certainly have at least done serious research on them.
