Check out this one. It's long and is no where close to the end but it's worth it for me. If you're interested in the pairing this might be a good fic.

***** Idk man, DEL used to update every other week. Then he was AWOL for around an year and then updated just one chapter one year ago. My guess is that he probably lost his interest. It's a real shame too though. When he started that premise it felt really original and it was really well written with some clever twists. But I sure as hell wish he would continue even with slow updates.

******* Same with me. Where the story is at right now is so interesting. It answered for a lot of questions in the story, but it created a lot of new questions as well. Hopefully DEL updates the story.

And if you are not following it, check out Fate. It's heavily inspired by Red Knight, but it's still it's own thing with a lot of original ideas.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
