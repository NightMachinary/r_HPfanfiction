To any Muggles in the audience, they may find it easier to understand the nature of Magic itself if likened to a concept many of them were more familoar with: the Force.

In many ways, the two were similar. Magic (like the Force) exists everywhere and anywhere, a binding agent essential to many processes in the universe. Mystical in nature and near impossible to quantify (differing somewhat from the Force here, for no microscopic beings could quantify the magic of things), yet everpresent and observable, for those with an eye out for it.

Everywhere and anywhere. A common theory at least. And a fundamentally flawed one. For Muggles would not exist if that were the case.

A truly stupendous thing, those without magic, the Muggles, No-Maj, Can't-Spells etc. Anomalies in the world in that they hold no magic within them... and in fact can't ever.

It truly makes the concept of Muggleborns very much a mystery, but (like the Force) Magic has always been known to work and function mysteriously. Hence being unquantifiable.

And, like the Force, Magic is very much alive. It has wants, it has needs... in very special cases it can even have 'favourites'.

These favourites, however, are not blessed by the force they wield. They are beholden to it, bound by it. Chosen by Magic not because they have impressed upon it, or have been displayed great prowess or virtue: it is because (in the deepest recesses of their hearts, whether they be aware of it or no) they align with it.

It being Magic. Specifically Magics wants and needs.

Which, when stripped down to their most basic, primitive, ludicrously simple definitions, they are: Assimilate or Destroy.

In the 1800's, a 'favourite' of Magic came close to satisfying these desires. The great Mage Arggedion sought to gift all Muggles with magic, developing a device known now as the Accelerator, in order to grant him the boost in power he needed to grant all Muggles access to that strange force Magic.

He worked off of the work of The Man with Golden Eyes, a mysterious being who managed to make magic present in all non-magical animals on the planet, making magic sing with joy at the assimilation of such a colossal amount of life it had yet to hold close.

Thankfully, for the Statute of Secrecy at least, Arggedion was struck down before his task could be complete. And for almost a century and a half (after millennia of Magic attempting to seek out new favourites to fulfill its designs) silence fell...

Then a prophecy found the ears of an up and coming Dark Lord. A baby boy being born with a great destiny, a terrible destiny. A destiny he could not allow to reach fruition.

A destiny he sealed when he flung that curse to kill at a defenceless, newly orphaned infant...

Albus Dumbledore, in a wisdom that may very well have saved mankind in another time, only compounded the issues when he learned the truth of this child and attempted to seal away the power he would grow into.

At the mercy of the Muggles, weak, powerless and disenfranchised... his heart (deep down, for the briefest of moments) it reached out and found a kindred spirit in that spark. A flame lit as another teacher ignored flagrant neglect and abuse, ignored the crying child desperate for an end to his misery and sent him back to his family after informing him of his tale.

That flame... of course it was the flames of hatred. His kind heart unable to stifle it fully.

After that little boy cried himself to sleep. After centuries of waiting. After countless, fruitless, attempts... Magic no longer seeked to assimilate those not part of the collective.

If you were not part of Magic, then Magic would have you removed. It no longer wanted those who weren't already a part of it alive...

And, in a cupboard under the stairs at Number 4 Privet Drive, a little boy was chosen to put this great undertaking into motion...
