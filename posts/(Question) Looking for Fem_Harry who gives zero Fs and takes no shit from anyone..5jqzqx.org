Just read abit of Holly Polter and I love her attitude.


** Strong, sassy witches as main character can also be found in the following:

- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin) - crossover with Hunger Games where girl!Harry is raised by President Snow. Cracky but fun.

- linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) - First in a 4-part series; Danny Potter is treated as the Boy Who Lived while his sister Jen was basically tossed away for being a suspected squib. Not so: her magic is different, and a West-Indies witch teaches her the really dark stuff like how to summon demons and leverage all the useful parts of a human sacrifice. Even more squicky/gruesome than Spiral in many ways.

- linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) - 1st of planned 7 stories (only 4 released so far); not fem!Harry- this is about a girl in America during the same time period who has her own tragic past and murky destiny to fulfill. Written well before the recent movie, you'll find this version of Magical America a much more nuanced and intriguing world to explore, while still cleaving closely to canon magic and creatures. Would recommend to anyone yearning to recapture the spirit of the books in the new world. Also, unlike the rest, safe for work and family to look over your shoulder.

** Try linkao3(Future's Past by darkseraphina). Time travel to a pre-Marauder era (though Sirius does show up). And a romance with essentially an OC with a canon name. And plenty of femHarry going off on people who think they can control her.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
