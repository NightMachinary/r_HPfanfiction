** Oh, it's easy as hell for any Weasley to turn evil. They're pureblood, so they'd be accepted as a death eater, and all they basically need is a little more of what Percy had: resentment at growing up poor thanks to their parents' ideals. I like to add in a little Peter Pettigrew belief that Voldemort is gonna win and no one can stop him, and fear for their life. This works better on the two older kids who are old enough to remember the absolute terror of growing up during the first war and the deaths of their beloved uncles, Gideon and Fabian. If you need more you can throw in a little self-sacrifice: by joining the DE's the rest of the Weasley family will be spared even though they're blood traitors, provided that they don't get in the way of Voldemort's plans.

As for Tonks, she has Black blood. In canon she didn't get any of that evil insanity that a lot of them had, but, just suppose she did? Wham, evil.

As for why they're together, they actually were in the same year in school, and seem to have a lot of the same carefree, risk-taking attitude towards life. There are plenty of fics where they dated briefly in school, or where they are good friends.

****** I decided to lift your burden... I guess that it may improve given there is a sequel, but a few chapters in I'm struggling from some chronic grammar lapses, [[/spoiler][some under-age sex, Dumbledore bashing (he almost says "bwahahahah"), Molly and Ron bashing]]. The pace is fast though.

*********** So, I am now 2/5 of the way through and a little more invested in the story - it's maybe a 6/10 read. The big news at this point is that [[/spoiler][Charlie and Tonks have turned up and they may not be evil after all]].

************ My name is undyau, I read the whole of The Fallen and survived sanity intact, Ask Me Anything

OK, so to summarise - Tonks and Charlie are [[/spoiler][probably not evil, but are an item]] and they [[/spoiler][are taking instructions from a sinister behind the scenes figure, maybe a goblin]], there is was too much sickly sweet stuff, and I'm not talking Honeydukes, Ginny is [[/spoiler][turned into a deatheater]], Hermione seems to [[/spoiler][kill Dumbledore]] right at the end after [[/spoiler][Molly Weasley]] failed. Nearly everyone is still alive at the end of the book who was alive at the start. The comment that originated the thread is probably among the least of concerns about goings on in this universe.
