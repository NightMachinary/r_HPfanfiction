As the title suggests I feel we should have a fic-discussion thread. Sometimes I read a great fic and want to discuss that with someone but, as no one I know IRL reads fanfiction this would be a great place to do it.

If you think there will be a lot of spam posts in this format maybe we can limit it to a particular day and have a specific format, flair and spoiler tags.


** That's what the 'What are you reading' threads are for - say what you read, give some info, and talk about it. They're pinned at the top when you sort by hot (I think?).
