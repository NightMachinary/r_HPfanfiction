  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

It's abandoned but this is one of my favorite soul bond stories. Harry and Hermione are soul bond and.... everyone is distraught for them. You see, 99% of soul bonds ruin friendships, sometimes driving them to try to kill each other or themselves. Almost no person can stay sane while merging two minds together.

  The "I'm smarter than J.K and can game a fantasy magic system. I'll have Harry Fidelius himself!" Right. You can cast the Fidelius on yourself? I've seen this trope in way too many fics, and I can't help but wonder - are all these authors so stupid? Spend 5 seconds thinking about a Voldemort hidden under a personal Fidelius. That's worst case scenario right there.
#+end_quote

That's because people don't get what Fidelius actually is. It isn't a “hiding” charm or anything but rather a “loyalty” charm (note the similarity to the word “fidelity”, meaning “faithfulness” and created from the same Latin word than the charm's name. As such, it is not a charm that hides but instead a charm that protects something beneath a barrier of loyalty, with the caveat that you need to trust the secret keeper and they have to be loyal towards you (and presumably you towards them too). This is why the house in Godric's Hollow was in plain sight (the spell's hold simply slipped and it stopped being hidden, if it ever was) and why you'd need a really weird character for them to be capable of hiding themselves via Fidelius (if you are willing to hide yourself from sight completely, it implies that you do not trust anyone to protect you normally, and thus you do not really trust anyone, and thus the spell won't take hold no matter whom you choose to be your secret keeper). Likewise, this is why Tom would never be able to use the spell anyway, although I don't expect those who don't get how it works to notice that.

  Magical cores, and more specifically, the measuring of these cores, is just asking for a Caste system. It's pretty much the only logical outcome. Would a system where only the powerful ruled be bad? I mean, you'd probably avoid Fudge and Umbridge, but...
#+end_quote

To be fair, though, a caste system would be a fine thing to start with to write a darker take on the series. It's just that most people don't go for diversity or diversity and power both but instead for only power with some random numbers to show how strengthly their OC-with-Harry's-name is.

In fact, it's sad that instead of going terribly wrong and resulting in a good take on it, the concept usually goes terribly wrong in that the execution is sub-par and it's not really used for anything.

But hey, a nice list.

** Harry inherits all of the four houses of Hogwarts in addition to the Peverells and the Blacks. Unfortunately, all of the houses/families have enormous debts that Harry is unable to pay off and he dies alone in a gutter in Knockturn Alley when a Squib knifes him after he sold his wand in a last-ditch attempt to pay off the debt (it didn't work).

** Hermione Granger is sorted into Slytherin, for some odd reason, and instantly goes to tell the pure-blood bullies off, for being dicks! She walks straight up to Draco Malfoy, uncaring if she's going to royally piss off Draco.

At first the two get a long, especially when Hermione drops some juicy facts about Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Draco listened, waiting for information on the boy who dared turn down a Malfoy. His father, Lucius, said that no one refuses a Malfoy. He swiftly asks the girls name, as she was useful.

Hermione foolishly explains that she's a Muggle-born. She watches as Draco walks away, his parting words saying he'd be right back. She smiled when he returns. That is, of course, until she noticed the group of angry looking fifth-years behind him. She hears a word that she has never heard before and she realised it was a slur against her blood. The angry looking group got more riled up and started advancing on her.

The last thing she heard and saw was the group lifting their wands, a mixture of various profanity spewing out of their lips.

The Mudblood, Hermione Granger, never stood a chance in Slytherin and she was never seen again.

Or maybe when the mail gets x-rayed Harry dies from over exposure to radiation due to the magical area being scanned being concentrated into the opening or something.
