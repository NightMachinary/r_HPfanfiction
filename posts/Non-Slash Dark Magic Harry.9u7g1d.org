I found it uncomfortable to read in the first half because of Harry's perspective and thought process but it's gripping and one of my faves.

Also dark transfiguration. It's a thing in this. Don't see that often.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I am a great fan of linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress) and the WiP sequel linkffn(Ascended Vices by ScottPress). There's a level of sophistication to what it means to be a dark wizard that no other fic I've read has. Not perfect, but damn good anyways.
