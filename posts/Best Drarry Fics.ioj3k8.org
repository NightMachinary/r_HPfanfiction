This is solely your opinion on what you think is best. I would like it to be either 50k or over words and completed or just on-going with regular updates with no sign if stopping. The one I have read is Evitative.

Thank you so much in advance!!


** Endrina has great Drarry fics. My favorite are linkao3(The secret language of plants) and linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum). I also loved linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run). I haven't reread this one in a while, so I don't know if it aged well, but I really enjoyed linkffn(Smoke and Mirrors by pcp). Finally, this one was an old fave of mine about post-Hogwarts life. It was written in early 2005 so before Half-Blood Prince was released. Linkffn(And So Life Goes On).

I hope you enjoy!

Edited to add: these fics are all complete.

  (COMPLETE) One day, everything changes. All it takes is for Harry to bump into an unexpected person from his past... who tells him all the lies his friends and lover have been keeping from him. What then does Harry do but live life as best he can?
