Looking for fanfics that deliberately eschew common fanfic conventions. Eg:

Harry accuses Mrs Weasley of dosing him with love potion, is entirely wring and destroys his positive relationship with the family because of it.

The Goblins inform Harry that someone (Dumbledore) has been siphoning money from his account, and offer an audit for a fee. The fee being more money than his vault contains.

Harry tries to claim the titles of Lord for houses Potter, Black, Gryffindor, etc, only to be denied because the wizengamot just choose not to allow it.

Harry finds a bunch of marriage contracts that absolutely must all be honoured, he expects to just be given a harem of pretty witches, but turns out Fred & George faked them as retaliation for getting Ron expelled.

Harry has a crush on an older witch, instead of being charmed by this literal child they do the decent thing and rebuff his advances.

Dumbledore actually does have Harry's best interests in mind, and death eaters attack him when he doesn't go back to the Dursley's one summer.

Harry rocks up to Azkaban, master of all 3 hallows, about to send the dementors across the country after Voldie's 6000 horcruxes, only to realise that's all folklore and the hallows don't make the grim reaper his servant.

“The Black family laws state that-“ and Sirius chucks them into a fire pit, Harry never meets Andromeda; Narcissa and Bellatrix's marriages aren't annulled, and they don't magically become good.

In fourth year, Harry is told about soul bonds, and realises he must have one with Gabriel because he saved her life. Turns out the one who told him was an overzealous Cedric fan who wanted to cause drama.

You get the idea


** Death's laugh carried across the study, his deep voice echoing with amusement, as if it had been decades since the being had had a chance to laugh like that.

And, perhaps it had been.

"Mister Potter-Black," Death said, once he had himself under control. "You mean to tell me that you are the Master of Death, simply because you control three items of great power?"

Harry simply nodded. "That is what I was told, yes."

Death turned his black eyes toward Harry, and for a moment the being seemed to be peering into his soul. It did not help that Death continued to wear an unnerving grin.

It was all Death could do to suppress another fit of laughter. "My apologies, Mister Potter, but you may have gotten one detail wrong." With a snap of his fingers, a stack of ancient-looking parchment appeared on the desk.

Harry peered at the documents, unfamiliar with the language. The only thing that he knew for certain was that the parchments appeared to be written in blood. He very pointedly ignored the black quill that had appeared alongside the documents.

"You are not the Master of Death, sir, but the Manager of Death."

Harry looked back up at Death, who was still grinning at him. "What difference does that make?"

"The pay is better, certainly," Death said, pleasantly. Then he gestured at the parchment. "Unfortunately, the paperwork is a nightmare."

*** Death's ancient skeletal finger tapped one small passage on top of the first document, which was annotated with a red wax seal bearing the hallow symbol.

"However, you got one thing right. The position comes with some perks! immortality," the entity's finger tapped another segment of the runic text, "The power to shift between your office beyond the veil and the waking world, with restrictions of course," another segment was highlighted, "And right here is the clause that clearly states that the Hallows serve as your badge of office. A master stroke, if I do say so myself. Since you bear the Hallows, you must be the Office."

Lord Potter-Black sat stunned, while Death scattered dust over his manor's expensive carpet.

"There's no way I can refuse this? What if I destroy the wand, or throw away the stone?"

"You think I haven't thought of that? No, this contract is binding, the same way that goblet at your whatsitcalled was. No way out, not even death. Heh."

"How much are we talking, here? Is it at least manageable?"

"Well, seeing as how you're the first manager since Tel'amun of the triangulum galaxy from about... give or take two billion years ago, I'd say it's pretty overwhelming. A lot of people have died since then, Mister Potter-Black."

Harry sighed a bone-deep sigh.

"Fuck."

I would like to see this one. Also, I still know only about one story (and that's even just a plot-bunny) where those wards are actually in action: linkffn(6739500), chapter 2.

  You know those stories where Harry discovers he's super rich, super powerful, and all the good guys are evil and the bad guys are good and he's related Merlin? This story is nothing like that.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
