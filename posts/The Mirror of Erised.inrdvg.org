So many fanfictions talk about various magical artefacts, like the Philosopher's Stone, Harry's Invisibility Cloak, time-turners, etc. But never, not in /one/ fanfic, have I seen anyone so much as mention the Mirror of Erised.

I mean, there are so many plot possibilities, so many questions to ask! When and by whom was it created? For what purpose? What are its functions and properties? How was it created? Why the 'heart's desire', and not your worst enemy or the person you'd be most compatible with or something like that? Why would you want to know someone's heart's desire, anyway, especially since each person can only see their own? How did Dumbledore come in possession of it? How did he get it to conceal the Stone like it did? Would it still work if it was smashed? How does it see someone's heart's desire even if they don't know it themselves (because, let's face it, not everyone knows what they want most)? Is it a form of Legilimency? If so, what would happen if an Occlumens faced it? What would happen if a Muggle faced it? Or a creature of near-human intelligence? How would it show less tangible desires, like wanting to love yourself or a deaf person wanting to hear? Or would it just show you with a paper that says that you have what you want? How did it show Harry's x-times-great grandparents, when he had never seen them? Is the mirror's knowledge stored somewhere, or does it just come and go? How did everyone find out what it does, or did the creator just tell them? How easy is it to destroy it? Dumbledore said that many students had found it before Harry, so why was it kept at Hogwarts? Can it lie or malfunction? How much does it cost and is there a license for owning it? Is it one of a kind, or are there more?

It's a truly amazing magical artefact, yet so many people just overlook it. I demand that someone does it justice.


** linkffn(10541297) has the mirror as a pretty large plot device, but that's also heavily AU.

** Just read *The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks.* Don't want to spoil anything.

The mirror's properties are explored in (I think the fourth book of) NoahPhantom's *Albus Potter series.*

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518). Unfinished. Harry follows Voldemort through the mirror.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb). Unfinished. Harry only sees blurs in the mirror.

linkffn(A Little Knowledge by Nia River). Complete. Harry makes use of the mirror to learn things. This one I really liked.

linkffn(Equal and Opposite by Amerision) has Harry run across a different mirror.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
