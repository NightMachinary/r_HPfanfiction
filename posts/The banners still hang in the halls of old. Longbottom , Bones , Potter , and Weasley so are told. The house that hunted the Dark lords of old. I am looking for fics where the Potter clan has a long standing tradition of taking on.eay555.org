** It'd be a nice addition. Seconded.

Hopefully it is set up in distant future. Generations ahead of Harry. Even though each generation of Potter may not be as able to defeat the dark lords but they hold the archives and skill which are necessary to train future leaders.

Seen it averted in one of Star Wars crossovers. Where Harry goes a bit immortal, gets his cred by battling all darklords to come for centuries, then goes into hibernation of some sort - only to wake up in a world where two reigning dark lords are his last family alive. And then he goes away through veil only to get himself into rescuing Sirius from sith lord conspiracy

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

****** "Canon" is a term that comes from religion, especially Christianity - the set of scriptures for a particular faith is its canon. We have special words for people who stick to religious canon. "Fanatic" and "Fundamentalist" are, in case you hadn't noticed, only compliments when used by fanatical fundamentalists.

Sensible people take religious canon and mix it with reason, evidence, and tradition.

Reason and evidence tells us that "Fleamont", to take just one dubious bit of Rowling's work, is a fucking stupid name and that she was probably drunk when she wrote it. It also tells us that "Charlus" was a spelling error. Tradition tells us that, given that we have determined that Fleamont is obviously bollocks, it's OK to assume that Charles was Harry's grandfather.

We're talking about the statements of one person - the author - concerning her intellectual creation. You can have your fanons and headcanons; they're yours and always will be, but don't supercede the author's own statements with them.

I don't have a problem with that, provided the story is good enough. But even in good fanfics I've read, there's almost always been that eyerolling moment when the boss of Gringotts sends a house elf to inform Harry that his emancipation means he is thus to be known as Lord Potter, and will be coming in to the full Potter estate, which is equal in value to the GDP of a small country. I mean, there's fanservice, and then there's /gimme a fucking break/. I'm a reader. I like to enjoy stories. Harry being a bajillionaire and married at thirteen is just instant gratification.

As the Deathly Hallows are believed to be inventions of the tree Peverell brothers it can be argued that both Cadmus and Ignotus has to be necromancers as a Cloak that can mask completely their occupant has to function with the veil between life and death, necromancy is not only the art of summoning (the resurrection stone of Cadmus). Antioch had to be an exceptional in wand lore and craft of said lore.
2. What I call canon is information that is only in the books. Charlus Potter appeared on the Black Family tree in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as married to Dorea Black. Sirius Orion Black was chosen to be Harry Godfather by James Potter. It is expected in a small reclusive society as Wizarding Britain to choose the Godfather in closely related cousins. It was a reasonable deduction that Charlus and Dorea were Harry grandfather or grandmother and Siruis second cousin (same Level to the tree Black sisters). It is only after the books were published that Rowling extended Canon by developing Fleamont Potter and Euphemia no name on Pottermore. The term *expanded universe*, sometimes called an *extended universe*, is generally used to denote the "extension" of a fiction with other media, generally comics and original novels, or more recently in a official website. It is part of the official universe as apocrypha but not the canon.

***** Charlus and Dorea Potter are not in any of the books. The only place they've appeared is in a family tree J.K. Rowling created for the film designers and then auctioned off to raise money for charity. It's as much expanded universe as the Pottermore writing.

***** 1. The cloak can't completely mask their occupant. It doesn't the human revealing spell and it didn't prevent Moody from seeing through it. Like the other Hallows, despite their grandiose names, it's a flawed item which clearly has nothing to with mastery of Death.

2. And yet Dorea Black was not burnt off the Black family tree for taking in Sirius (as Alphard was just for giving Sirius money) and Sirius did not see fit to mention that he and Harry were second cousins. It's not a reasonable deduction at all.

****** 1. The Homenum Revelio spell in order to reveal uniquely Human presence must be a derivative of soul magic, a branch of magic that is closely related to necromancy. If the legend is true, the Cloak is supposed to hide effectively from Death eyes only, eyes from beyond the veil between the worlds. Moody as living would no be included under that clause. For the living the Cloak acts as any other Univisibility Cloak, only being more permanent that others. If the Legend is only that, the Cloak was created not to have powers on death eyes but in order to be permanent through time, it is mine hypothesis that was achieved by linking the magic of the cloak to something as much permanent like the veil between the worlds.
2. Dorea Black was not burnt from having weed Charlus Potter, so we can deduce that Charlus and the Potter to that point were a respectable pureblood family maybe even in the pureblood registry of the sacred Twenty-Eight. The Potters were purebloods only until the birth of Harry Potter, it has tarnished even further the Potters, even if their egalitarian views and name have already assured their exclusion from the Pureblood Registry.
