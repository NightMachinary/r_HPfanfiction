** I think we're going to need more details about the plot of the fic. Can you provide any more info?

*** Yeah, sorry! It's told from the girl's point of view (I don't remember her name...I think it started with an A?) and her and Draco's parents arrange for them to get married. She's incredibly shy and nervous, and Draco is on-and-off annoyed and patient with her. I remember one part where his parents brought them baby clothes and the girl about had a heart attack and got really upset about it. Sorry I can't give much more; I haven't read this since I was about 14 haha. If I think of anything else about it I'll add it!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&r=103&c1=6&c2=3221&pm=1][There are 188 stories on FFN with a Draco/OC pairing]]. I bet you'll find what you're looking for somewhere in there.
