I came across a good Tom Harry fic, sadly I can't find it anymore! :( been browsing ao3 and ffn for ages for this fic

Here's what I remember from the Story is:

- more than 15 chapters
- Harry gets transported in baby Tom's time as a baby too
- Harry and Tom grew up believing that they were twins (harry being the youngest) later on on his 2nd?1st? year in hogwarts Tom finds that Harry isn't his twin but keeps it a secret.
- abraxas is a veela -tom is starting to dwell into politics even if he is still in hogwarts
- if i remember correctly harry can see the aura of magic?
- harry and tom are slytherins
- harry has a slytherin best friend who has a big crush on harry. Later on the 2 of them secretly train to be animagi
- there's a portion of the story wherein harry and tom is stuck in the ww2 warzone and they come across this cabin to seek refuge but the cabin is occupied with soldiers and a woman. The woman was raped by the soldiers and soldiers wants to have a go at Harry too. Tom went berserk and started hacking the soldiers with an axe. (no magic allowed outside of hogwarts rule) -tom also has a crush on harry but hasn't told him yet. -i think there's this mystical guy/ being that's guiding harry (and its hinted that person is either death or future harry)

I read this fic 2 or 3 years ago so I'm not sure if the fic haa already been deleted. Hope you know what this fic is!


** This fic sounds interesting and I would like to give it a read. Since you already found it, can you please provide a link? Also, I would like to point out

#+begin_quote
  dwell into politics
#+end_quote

The word you're looking for here should be "delve". Not trying to be rude, just trying to help out; similar sounding words can be a pain.
