Bonus points if it's Harry/Hermione as well :P


** I can't think of any that I would wholeheartedly recommend, though I guess Kwan Li's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived]]) isn't too bad.

All that said, /are/ there fics where Neville is the "chosen one", and the story /is/ centered around Neville? Most of the BWL!Neville fics I've seen tend to be about how Powerful!Badass!Gray!Independent!Harry is, once allowed to make his own way, rather than being shepherded by Manipulative!Dumbledore, or what have you.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

*** I haven't read the fic, but I can almost imagine the following exchange:

*Neville:* You know, Harry, if /you/ were Boy-Who-Lived, I know /I/ wouldn't hook up with your worst enemy even if my life depended on it.

*Harry:* How do you know? Can you deny that Tom is hot?

*Neville:* I don't know how I know. I just do, somehow.

**** Lol, that reminds me of the dialogue in Black Comedy. After Sirius and Harry capture Bellatrix in the new dimension they have a talk that goes like this:

*Sirius*: God I hate this bitch.

*Harry*: I'm with you.

*Sirius*: She looks damn good though.

*Harry*: /Sirius/. She's your /cousin/.

*Sirius*: So? It's not like I'll make a three headed cyclops heir with her. She's a cruel bitch and she's hot. Those two characteristics go together an awful lot.

*Harry*: And what would the two /aunt-mums/ have to say about this?

*Sirius*: You and your silly muggle-raised ideas.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] - Non-BWL Harry who specialises in transfiguration and wants to heal his parents. I like some of things it does with magic, don't like some others, but all in all it's interesting read and update often.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8541055/1/][No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne]]

Harry doesn't get the red carpet treatment and so he has to start off with nothing. Very hard working Harry, short years, 2-3 chapters is a year, mostly because it is VERU AU. My only complaint is how the Potter Family and Family Magic in general is portrayed, as it suddenly ruins any reason why Purist would exist rather than evil assholes trying to form harems of Muggleborns.

  Harry is 2 years older, Neville is BWL and things are way more interesting. Follow Harry as he rises to a prominent place in the wizarding world. Full of humor and of course a badass Harry this story is bound be thrilling. Disclaimer: Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling and will never be mine. This is for the whole fanfiction.
