** Ooh, interesting. Do you intend to continue the story, or are you providing something of a springboard so that others can write on the possibility of an innocent dementor?

*** I like the idea of a dementor like this one feeling guilt at being sent to attack Harry, an innocent young human, as opposed to the guilty Death Eaters and murderers they usually fed on.

Hm. There's an idea. Dementers just stopping by to break up the fight between Harry and Dudley, and then getting the blame for trying to Kiss Dudley.

**** Well, that has potential, doesn't it? It probably couldn't fit canon, since one's described as having its fingers around Harry's throat and the other pulling Dudley's hands away from his face, but imagine a scenario where the dementors were good guys instead.

"There was a human at the Ministry, some obnoxious female, who told us to attack you, but Bob and I, we like totally know you're the good guy. If this Voldy-dude guy won, there'd be, like, no happiness anywhere."

...Makes you wonder why dementors are villainous, really. Couldn't they work to make humans happy and then eat their share of the joy?

...Maybe it's something to do with their creation? They might be artificial rather than natural, if the wiki description of their first appearance is any indication.

***** "Well, Steve was holding him back by his collarbones, not his throat, for a start. The kid was trying to cast a Patronus, can you blame him for trying to stop him? I mean, once you cast a Patronus the friendly talk is over, that's just hostile aggression. I just wanted to pull the Muggle onto his feet and get his hands off his face so we could talk proper-like! I mean, you can't scold a kid when he's curled up in the feet-us position. They just ignore you! Humming a tune, la-la-la, I can't hear you. He punched the other kid in the head, you gotta tell kids off for that, that can make kids go deaf, that can. It ain't right, bullying other kids. Mind you, the skinny one did pull a wand on him. /Everyone/ knows you don't pull a wand on a Muggle. Who knows what would have happened if we hadn't broke that fight up? As it was, I got run right over by a Patronus! Had to call in sick for three weeks after, I did. 'Course, expelling him wasn't right either, poor kid had no parents to raise him right, plus 'e's got old Voldemort after him. Kids act out at that age, he didn't deserve no Kiss nor expulsion for it. With the government the way it is, it's not wonder we've got badly behaved kids. Almost makes one think /we'd/ do a better job! Maybe I'll run one day - Bob for Minister, with Steve as my undersecretary! He'd look pretty good in pink. Heh."

I think Dementors are born out of misery, aren't they? Unfortunately their very aura is depressing, so I guess Dementor entertainment wouldn't be too entertaining.

This idea is used in the fanfiction "Dementors", which I linked to some time ago.

*** I intend to write more, and already have part of Chapter 2 written down. However, I would also love it if others were to pick up on that concept, of course.
