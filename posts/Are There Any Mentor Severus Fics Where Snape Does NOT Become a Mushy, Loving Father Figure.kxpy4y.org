No shade to the usual "Severus learns how to love with all his heart" mentor fics, because lord knows I've read an obscene number of them and enjoyed them. I'm just trying to find something a little different to read, and I realized I've never seen any fics like this before.

I know, I know, how can Snape be Harry's mentor and protector without actually growing a big giant weeping soft spot for the boy, right? Well, I don't know, but it would be really interesting to read if it's done right! Maybe Snape is reluctantly mentoring Harry long term at Dumbledore's insistence but still doesn't really like the kid. Maybe he feels obligated to a higher degree because of the vow than he did in canon. Maybe Harry is just sort of like Snape's unwanted little tag-along and the boy just doesn't seem to catch the social cue that Snape wants him to go implode in space.

I'm rambling a bit, sorry. I just really need something new to read ðŸ˜…

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** What about if Snape does develop an attachment to Harry, but doesn't become a father figure because Harry's parents are still alive? But becomes an important mentor because Harry is passionately devoted to brewing potions; James and Lily, while loving and supportive, just don't appreciate the art in the way that Snape and Harry do. So their relationship is more than the usual student-teacher interaction, she eventually becomes his apprentice, but there's no suggestion that Snape should adopt her or anything of the kind, she's very happy with the parents she has. And while he may have emotional investment, he is never mushy. And Harry can't tell him all her secrets, because she isn't supposed to be at Hogwarts at all.
