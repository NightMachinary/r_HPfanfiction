Strange request from me today. I'm looking for something VERY specific. Does anyone have a copy of the epilogue to Hope by Jeconais. Hope is THE fic for everyone that likes the Harry/Gabrielle ship, and Jeconais deleted the epilogue before I could download it a long time ago.


** I have it! Took me a while to track it down back then too... I think he took it down because people didn't like it? Or why? Don't remember.

*** Yup he took it down because he didn't like it. Honestly it doesn't really fit with the rest of the story and I'm not really a fan I want it to say I have it in it original form.

*** He didn't like it. It rubbed readers the wrong way, perhaps because it highlighted the many elements of fridge horror in his story.

  fridge horror in his story

What do you mean? You mean how the forced bond is super creepy/horrific?

***** It's been years since I read the epilogue, but, going from memory:

Edit: screw it, the spoiler tag is not working for some reason. The following is a spoiler, so don't read if you don't want to have the depressing ending spoiled.

[[/spoiler][That she was a slave right up until the end, her very identity defined by her association with Harry. In her final moments, when she finally had her freedom from the bond with his death, she was not even able to control her bodily functions--she was filthy, having pissed all over herself, and was basically slow-walking her way to death because she literally could not live without him--because she was so profoundly dependent on him and his affirmation established her very identity. And then she dies and her "gift" in the afterlife is to basically continue this for eternity.]]

** You should add a comment about it on his site. Feedback is important

*** As far as I know he doesn't actually write anymore... and his website is relatively dead sadly. If you know of somewhere else I could contact him then by all means.

**** Yes, I have been hoping he would some day find the motivation and time to finish "Perfect Slytherins" and "Hogwarts Dawn". Both are easily my most re-read fics of the last 6 years. Apart from all his other great fics, like "Hope" or "Matryoshka Vignettes" or "this Means War" or "White Knight, Grey Queen".

But sadly it looks like he really cut all connections to the scene. Even his twitter account has been dead.

**** I'm pretty sure he still gets messages from his website.

But yes, he hasn't written in a while
