+^{(This is my first post so I hope I don't accidentally break any rules, despite reading them beforehand-})+

So, as you can read in the title I'm looking for a good HP-fanfiction that meets the following requirements:

- the OC needs to be the *main character* and not just someone who doesn't contribute anything to the story
- OC should (preferably) by a *girl*
- should take place in the *Golden Trio Era*
- there should be *differences to the canon* (I think that should be self-explanatory if there's an OC)
- *pairings, romance or genre* in general doesn't matter
- *NSFW* is fine, too
- it's ok if the OC completely *replaces* a character as long as there are major differences
- I don't really like the *twins-trope* / when the OC is the twin of someone else (but if the fic is good I'll accept it)
- There should be *at least 5 chapters* and it shouldn't be discontinued (if it's complete that's a plus)

^{That's all I can think of right now, but I might add more in the future.}

  *For reference:*

  The fanfic [[https://www.quotev.com/story/12310070/Marked-as-an-Equal/1]["Marked as an Equal"]] by RedB4Black on Quotev is a story that I think of as *exquisite.* It exceeds all of my expectations. +(But why does it only have 5 chapters yet o(╥﹏╥)o)+

  Of course, the recommendations can be on a lower level than this one. I just couldn't think of a fanfiction that was just "good" in my eyes.

** Hi there! I actually just started posting my fan fiction which fits all of your descriptors. I have two chapters posted, but more written and will be adding more soon. One of the two main characters is an OC! :) [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/241130917-somebody-to-you-a-draco-malfoy-love-story]]
