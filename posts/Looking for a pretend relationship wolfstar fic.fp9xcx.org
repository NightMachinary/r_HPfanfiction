:END:
I read it on ao3, remus and sirius pretend to date.

Sirius is the baker at a coffee shop Remus frequents.\\
Sirius' mom asks to meet his boyfriend and he convinces Remus to pretend to be so.\\
They go to Sirius' parents (?) some sort of beach house where they share a room.

Wasn't complete when I'd first read it, some 6-7 chapters in.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
