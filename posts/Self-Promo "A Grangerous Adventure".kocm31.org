New year, new me.

In the past I've been very critical of the H/Hr pairing. Most of the fics are full of Ron/Ginny/Molly/Dumbledore bashing, Harry being the Lord of 10,000 houses, Hermione being Harry's overhyped hype woman, and all the secondary characters saying things like "OMG Harry and Hermione are the greatest couple to walk the Earth!!1!1!" There's also the fics where Harry can act like what is considered a "simp" or Hermione is a shadow of her canon personality, running after Harry and following all his demands. However, lately I've been doing some thinking and really thought about the pairing and what hasn't been done already (or at least, what hasn't been done 100,000 times), and I think I've cracked the code.

Presenting "A Grangerous Adventure". Credit goes to the DLP and Fate Discord servers, and ViviTheFolle for looking the first chapter over. Happy New Year!

  Even when you're the brightest witch of your age like Hermione, some things are beyond your control. Keeping Harry alive and away from the Weasleys while maintaining her Prefect status is no easy task. Crack/Parody, H/Hr pairing. 5th-year subplot.
