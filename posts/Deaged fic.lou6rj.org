After the war Harry decides he wants to have the childhood he never got so he stores a copy of all his memories-to be returned when he turns 18 again-and asks Luna-the only one open minded(crazy) enough to help with his plan-to take care of him before simultaneously obliviating himself and taking a deaging potion to make him 4 years old.

Luna in true Luna fashion decides she is too young to be a mommy but not a big sister so she takes a deaging potion too but keeps her memories but signs them up for muggle school first.
