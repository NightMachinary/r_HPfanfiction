:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once read a fanfiction where Ludo Bagman set up a camera on the third task in Goblet of Fire so everyone could see. They end up seeing Voldemort coming back to life.

I was very stupid and did not favourite the fanfic (it was on fanfiction.net) . Does anyone know of it?

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

** Runemaster features a similar idea - Harry uses runes to create a magical recording and tricks Fudge into playing it for the audience.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** The only story I recall that had a screen that the audience watched at the third task where the audience saw what was happening in the graveyard is Reboot by Kallanit

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

*** I remember one just like what OP described, but I also didn't bookmark it. As I recall, it wasn't all that well-written but some elements (such as this one) were good. I haven't read Reboot so I know there are at least two such fics out there.

**** Any chance that you or the OP can remember any other scenes that standout in your minds? I download any fics i read rather than bookmark so I have all the stories I have read (unless they were too horrendously written to keep) so i used doc search app for various word combinations that could be upto 50 words away from each other so camera, graveyard, third task, screen, Bagman, etc and Reboot is the closest to what the OP asked for.
