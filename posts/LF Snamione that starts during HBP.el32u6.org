(Edit:) Honestly as long as it starts somewhere in HBP, I'm okay with it, even if it doesn't really follow canon.

Hello! Just looking for any Snamione fic that starts sometime during HBP. I like the big conflict that happens at the end of the year and how it affects both Hermione and Snape. I'd like the relationship to start as friends and then move to romance, sometime during HBP. I would prefer something that follows canon somewhat, following through DH and after canon as well if possible (with the exception of snape dying at the end.) It doesn't have to be a perfect canon following but something a bit similar. Like Hermione going on the Horcrux hunt preferably. Also would love a good “Severus appears as Hermione's getting tortured by Bellatrix and has to stay undercover scene.”

I definitely need a long fic. Preferably 100k words or more, but I'll also read 30k+.

I'd just love some action/adventure in there if possible. /I loovee fics that have plot!/

I know there aren't many out there and I've read many them, so I don't expect many recs. I very much prefer completed fics or fics that are currently updating.

Thank you!

Fics I've read with this concept: * Camerado * Second Life * The Phoenix Song/Tears/Fire Trilogy * Chasing the Sun * Whiteboards * Heart over Mind * Before the Dawn (can't remember if I finished it)

If I find anymore that I've read, I'll add them above. :)


** Pet project is a good one! There's only a tiny bit of smut really, which is unfortunate but I enjoyed the story anyway! (I just reread it not too long ago so I instantly thought of this one!)

I can't think of many you probably haven't read before but I have a feeling I have more I just can't think of right now...I might be back.

(Also. I know it hits really none of your wants, but I realllllllly have to suggest reading “And They Didn't Live Happily Ever After” because it is probably my favorite snamione fic I've ever read.)

*** Thank you! Please do come back! I've wanted to read Pet Project for a while now, but I know that they don't even kiss until the last couple of chapters, so that kind of sucks. But I'll check both of your recs out!

Honestly as long as it starts somewhere in HBP, I'm okay with it, even if it doesn't follow canon. I just love reading fics that start around then because of the conflict that usually ensues! So recommend away! I'll add that bit into my post because I know I have quite a few wants. :)

**** Oh gosh, I will! I am at work right now so my thoughts are elsewhere but I'll bookmark this post when I do some more thinking.

If you want conflict, the fic I did post doesn't start at HBP it's after the series basically, however, there's a death eater decree and a lot of sneaking/hiding and for sure conflict!

Another one of my favorites is “Doing It For The Order” now it's been a while since I've read this but I did thoroughly enjoy it!

****** If you haven't read it, I highly highly highly recommend Accountable by Dyce. It's set post-war but written before the 7th book came out, I believe. It's like 30 chapters and the writing is at a publishable level, really eloquent and Victorian-esque without being pretentious. (When someone is unsuccessfully trying to sound Victorian...it's cringe.) The characterization is consistent with JKR so I wasn't removed from the story by the characters' implausible behavior. The very last chapter lost me a bit, but chapters 1 through 29 are where. it's. at. No smut, but it's tastefully sexy in a Jane Eyre type of way and I was completely immersed in the romance. I'm spoiled because it's one of the first fanfics I've read and now I can't find anything nearly as good. If you have read it and can recommend a similar story, I'd be very appreciative! :)

I started Doing it for the Order and it made me feel icky, but maybe I'm just oversensitive. Idk, I'm not a huge prude but I can't finish it. Too rapey.
