Not for Smut or anything, rather I'm developing Harry's character to make him Independent and kinda a mini politician. So does it make sense for some 11 year old to take political and plan-breaking decisions. Also, It doesn't make sense to me about a 16 year old tasked with horcrux hunt and something would /not/ go wrong. A 20 year old guy does seem fit for it.

Some reviewer may say that my stripping him off his childhood but I wanna say, /did living with Dursleys kept his childhood intact?/

He's still gonna be awkward around people and will have his childish moments.

Would like some Input on this from you guys.

/Peace!ยก!/


** Indy!Politician!Harry is a terrible trope

*** I'm kinda going for a smart Harry who's not manipulated by Dumbledore. Leaning toward a more Indy! Harry than Politician! Harry.

** I don't usually like it when fanfics change Hogwarts' starting age. It just feels wrong to me.

Honestly, 11 or 14 wouldn't really make much of a difference in his politicking ability anyway. Sure, in early modern history - when the wizarding world seems to diverge from the muggle world - you could get emancipated and become a ruler at 15, but those kids were trained to become rulers from a very young age.

The only way you could really make Harry a convincing politician at ~15 is to have him grow up as the heir of a pureblood family and start learning politics at about 7 years old and be uncommonly talented at it.

*** Guess that's the only viable option.

Anyway, thanks for your input. Appreciate it.

** Would be a bit odd unless you change the whole way hogwarts worked. 7 years at hogwarts would mean he didnt leave till he was 21!
