I hope this is allowed, [[/r/tipofmytongue][r/tipofmytongue]] suggested I try here with my search.

I can't remember the year I read these fics but I know they are very old. I was still in high school so it had to be prior to '06. I know they were very popular on Fictionalley.org and had tons of art work and were novel length in size. There were at least 2 though I believe they were a trilogy. I know for sure that Draco/Ginny as a pairing was featured pretty heavily in it and I feel like Harry/Hermione were paired (which is not my thing but I feel like I dealt with it because I was really into Draco/Ginny. Still am but still prefer The Good Ship to H/H.)

I know that Blaise Zabini was a red head female in this series and I believe she was Draco's cousin... and I also believe that Harry was supposed to be the heir of Gryffindor, Draco the heir of Slytherin, Hermione the heir of Ravenclaw, and Ginny the heir of Hufflepuff. I don't remember Slash being involved but it's been so long I can't exactly rule it out either.

I don't remember any specific happenings in the story but I Do remember there was controversy about the series which is why the left fanfiction.net for fictionalley?

Someone did bring up Draco Veritas series which I totally recognize the name but when I googled it and read the Wikipedia article about it, it just didn't seem right to me. Maybe I'm wrong though but the original poster who suggested that that might be it never came back to confirm some questions about it I had and I don't really want to read it if it isn't the fic series I'm looking for.

Any help would be great!

Edit: I feel like Draco loved Mai Tai's in this but I also see that this seems to be a common thing. I'm pretty sure it was stolen from this particular fan fiction. It's killing me.


** Going by all descriptions you've given, as well as the author's history, it does look like Draco Veritas. The Heirs, Mai Tais, Blaise being a redhead female all match. The Draco Trilogy is also a historically significant series, and Cassandra Claire did have issues on FFN.

*** It sounded right when it was first told to me, but I didn't see Blaise referenced on the page and I didn't remember it being a slash fic! But thank you for confirming and telling me why it was confirmed. Is it available anywhere online anymore do you know?

I still cannot believe it was Cassandra Claire who wrote it but I mean it also makes so much sense haha

Edit: also, do we do the "solved" thing on this page or no?

Nah, we don't.

Also, you can find the fics [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsWUstaDFiN0M5aFE][here]] if the links cacographical gave don't work for you (they don't for me) or if you want in epub/kindle format instead of PDF.

*** I Will look into this for sure. It sounds like it might be possible however it looks like a stand alone and I know that, at least on FictionAlley, the author had a few "books" in the series.

And I totally appreciate you responding!

*** Hmm it doesn't feel right. I think that it was Harry's PoV, with maybe Draco having some parts from his PoV.

And Draco/Ginny wasn't a huge part of it. Maybe even Hermione/Draco kind of had a thing for a little bit. But it ended up with draco/ginny?
