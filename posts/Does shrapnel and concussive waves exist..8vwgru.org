From what we see in canon you can throw up shields and have them blasted apart with no consequences to you. In real situations your body would be shredded by shrapnel. Some larger explosion would also scramble organs and such but we see know of this in canon.

** As far as we know in canon, the Shield Charm simply vanishes into nothing when broken. It doesn't create shrapnel.

** shrapnel isn't a problem unless the author wants it to be. sure the rock that blocked a killing curse exploded 2 inches in front of someones nose. does it get in their eyes? nope. just couch a bit from the dust and they're good.

** Well, I suppose it would depend on what the shield was made up of. From what I recall of Shield Charms, they're invisible, so maybe they're made up of some sort of energy which has no actual physical substance once dispersed? I can see destroying a Shield Charm in a forceful manner causing a concussive wave, tho. Something is there, occupying space and then suddenly it's not, so air rushes in to fill the space, generating the wave. Or, something was there and then is blasted to bits and the residual force of the blast causes the concussive wave. Hard to say since magical Shields are poorly defined in canon.

*** Shields aren't big nor thick enough to displace any noticeable amount of air, I doubt it would be enough to even move a leaf. Apparating displaces hundreds of times more air.

**** That's what I figured. I made up an Auror trick for silent Apparation in my stories that mitigates the air displacement in both places. :D
