So I've started my first fic. It's rather ambitious so for now I'm focusing on Harry's first year. I am aware that people like regular update schedules so I have decided to hold back until I am about halfway before posting my first chapter, but at the same time feel the feedback would be helpful in developing the later writing.

Do you prefer regular, scheduled updates with little chance for feedback? Or irregular, more stretched out updates where your feedback might actually be incorporated into the work?


** I've never felt that sitting on work serves me any purpose. So I'm more the type to post something as soon as I edit it and move on. I tend to find good reviews motivating to write more, too.

But life happens. Sure, I can write a chapter in a couple of days in the right circumstances. I've often said that, depending on content, to plan/write/edit a chapter takes me 30-40 hours. Finding those 30-40 hours can take a week or two months, depending on life.

On a side note. I do not think you should have an 'update schedule' as a way to appease readers. You're already appeasing them by offering free entertainment. Have an update schedule if you want to set realistic deadlines for yourself and use it as a way to improve your ability to write within such deadlines.

*** Thank you! I love your writing and really appreciate your advice! I will probably post my first chapter up in the next few days, along with a promo post here.

** I might get downvoted to hell for this, but I'm going to be honest: I've (sort of) stopped caring about update scheduling.

Why? I've built a sense of obligation to deliver a certain level of quality to the people who read my fic, and those who follow it the closest have given me a valuable piece of feedback. While some stories do carry an episodic tone and structure, mine doesn't. Reading it in larger chunks or in one go (despite its size) allowed for a more immersive experience.

In light of that, and the fact that I'm fastidious as hell concerning sentence structure, my productivity can tend to fluctuate between one paragraph and two scenes a week. That can be aggravating and lead to disinterest for everyone involved, but the reason that I have any readers at all is because of how picky I am.

In summary, find out what attracts people to your fic over time (if that's what motivates you, of course). How much time can you dedicate to polishing said aspect to a standard that satisfies you?

** As a writer, I post a chapter whenever I can get it ready to go. This drives my readership up the wall. I'm fairly certain I'd have twice as many readers interested in my stories if they were posted on a predictable schedule, even if it was bi-monthly.

So to answer your question, it makes sense to set yourself with a lead-time where you're posting chapters when you have 3 or more future chapters close to ready. As each new chapter gets reviews, you can choose to revise the upcoming chapters (or even the recently-posted ones) to correct plot holes, if the change would best be made consistent in both the past and the future.

Depending on your writing speed, you probably don't want to post any more often than weekly, so that you have enough time to consider changes. My experience has been that most of the reviews show up on posting day and the next weekend day.

Your mileage may vary.

*** I have a slight lead in that I have about 10k words so far, with about the first 3k edited. I think after seeing people's advice here I will go for it by the end of the week! It's all very exciting... may I ask what your profile name is on fanfiction.net (assuming that's where you post) so I can take a peek at your work, please?

** Ooh, yeah this is a good question. Right now, I have two fics going, both with irregular update schedules. I have a couple other fics that are in the works that I'm going to write until I have a bunch of chapters pre-written.

I'm not sure which system works better, but I'm planning on trying out both.

From a reader perspective, it's better to have regular updates so you don't forget what the storyline is, but from a writer perspective, getting feedback and reviews is the best feeling ever and helps keep you motivated.

Sorry this rambled a bit, hope it was at least somewhat helpful!

I've got about 10k words so far in various stages of completion. Seeing your advice and those of the other two commenters has given me the confidence to get started with posting by the end of the week x

** It depends.

I think most readers appreciate a regularly updated story. I know that I certainly keep reading if the fic is already complete or if there are regular updates.

But in general, I would prefer regular, scheduled updates. For the vast majority of your work, you really shouldn't incorporate a lot of the non-grammatical feedback. Of course, people are going to have things to say about your characters and your plot, but those are things to review once you finish your story. Trying to follow up on feedback within your story will only further tear it apart.

Whatever you do, do not give them your estimated time until next update!

** The way I do it is that I don't post a chapter unless I have two already prepared by time of posting. I also keep on a schedule of one new chapter every week to two weeks. This allows me to be nimble with feedback. If something is very obviously not going to work out well with the readership, I'm not too far ahead that I can't do some editing and reworking. I also have a large, general outline that allows me to keep my writing schedule and update schedule.

As a brand new writer (in terms of posting stories on this username), having this schedule I feel was highly important towards getting a decent response to my story. Because I have regular updates I feel that those reading know that my story isn't going to abruptly end, and thus they can invest time into it. EDIT: Also, the update schedule is a way of keeping myself honest. It's to give a mental nudge towards continuing to write when I reach a point in a chapter where I'm mentally stuck.

The other thing that I do is that I also schedule in "breaks" in my writing. I write in story arcs, and at the end of every arc I take at least a few days to a week pause so I don't burn out from writing.

*** I'm currently getting back into writing after a long time away, so enforcing a schedule will probably be very good for me. May I ask what your profile is on fanfiction.net is, please? I'm looking for new things to read - and since you are all being so helpful I am very interested in reading some of your stories!

I was in the same boat actually when I started writing again. The last time I had probably reliably written fanfic was close to ten years ago before starting again at the beginning of the year.

** I think having an update schedule is much more popular than just updating whenever you can. Besides, just because you have regular, scheduled updates doesn't mean that you can't get feedback.

** I, of course, prefer regular updates. New fanfiction often works like a series. If you wait too long from one episode to the next, people forget what it was about and re-watching, or rereading is bothersome and tedious.

But on the other side, fanfiction can never be more important than real life issues. I personally was never a regular updater, simply because of a full timetable IRL.

As to the schedules themselves: I don't give advice that could be incorporated, I only want to be told a story, so I rather have short intervals.

** As a reader I will naturally prefer huge amounts of quality content in a short period of time. As a writer, I know thats not possible. It usually seems best when stories are updated with chapter-long updates every two weeks to a month. Some writers take two months or longer but post really long 7-10k chapters.

** I try to keep it regular. It was once a week but that's pretty ambitious with my school schedule lol, so the last one was after 2 weeks.

Then again, I have a slightly different process - I write it out and start typing and posting it when the story is halfway done. So reviews aren't going to change the direction of the story, because I have it planned already.

** I'm not a writer and would probably have a different opinion if I was, but I enjoy fics with some semblance of a schedule. it doesn't have to be strict (once a week or whatever) but when you're following multiple stories and they don't update for months, you completely forget what happened in the last chapter, which I find very annoying.
