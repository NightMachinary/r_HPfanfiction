I find when I'm reading a fic, some authors always strive to make everything sexual.

For instance, it could be a scene where the Order is rescuing Harry from No.4 Privet Drive. The Order burst in to Harry's room where he was systematically abused by Vernon, and Tonks, instead of conjuring up bandages or healing his wounds or whatever, decides to ogle Harry's malnourished, injured, stunted body and his apparently gigantic cock, despite having stunted growth.

Anyone feel in stories the author strives too hard to make it sexual?

** A lot of mediocre fanfics are basically just giant power wank wish fulfilment fics. Fun to read every now and again but hardly literal masterpieces. Since it is wish fulfilment you often get sexual situations inserted that don't really fit the narrative of the story.

** I dunno why... I mean I don't mind a lemon in a story, but I would sure like it if it appeared there because of proper plot development and was actually relevant to the story and was not a situation where the story existed solely for the lemon.

On a related note of “oversexualizing” have you read the one where the giant squid has sex with Hogwarts, though? I nearly died.

***** Well I didn't say it was done well... but it can be kind of interesting. The best-done that I've seen are where the author does a re-write and incorporates the plot and the smut into one another. That said, I'm feeling a bit mentally drained after yesterday, so I don't think I'll be able to find any examples. If you want to read something where a smutty idea became a whole story with plot and smut, then that's what happened with my work, although the change occurred before I started writing, so there's no noticeable difference in the story, I think..

** It's because the original HP was written for children and is very tame, to the point where romantic relationships lacked proper development, or much development at all. In fanfiction, authors often try to overcompensate for what they perceive to be canon's lacking, whether it's cursing, violence, in-depth magical explanations, worldbuilding, and yes, sex and relationships. It kinda makes it awkward (in a bad way) when they try to insert their own preferences when Harry and other characters are underage.

As an example, I thought that Prince of the Dark Kingdom had off-putting writing. I cringed whenever a pre-pubescent girl's attractiveness was mentioned, and I think there were a few instances of a 11-12 year old girl being called a "bombshell". Errrrrrrk.

There was also a weird plot point where a 13-14 year old Luna becomes a werewolf and sleeps naked in bed with Harry (also naked) and the author has to go out of their way to point out several times that "it's a werewolf thing, not a sex thing". I dunno man, if you have to keep saying because the readers take it the wrong way, maybe you should have thought about it before you wrote it.

Just weird and gross. I dropped it before I got to the end. The same for "For the Love of Magic" which was gross in so many other ways...

******* Based on the reader reviews on the story, most people haven't noticed. The author has stepped around the issue and never gone into the dirty bits, or explicitly stated what Harry was doing---and Harry's narration makes him out to be fair-minded and trying to encourage his future wives' independence... but when he's insinuated himself into their families, and approached them and began their personality molding at 9 years old, do they really have much agency of their own?

Nevertheless, this "ambiguity" is enough for the casual follower to not be fully aware of how insidious the story is. It's not that easy to perceive unreliable narration for what it is, especially if the author isn't aware of it either.

******** I mean, doesn't our parents mold our personality the moment when we are born? It just seems like you guys are complaining not because the situation is unrealistic, but because you just don't like it.

It's not like he forced the girls to marry him. Daphne literally begged him to enter a betrothal contract with him despite Harry telling her that he will be having a harem and she will be helping him with his plot.

Luna straight up asked him to be her friend, and then her father out of the blue asked him to enter a consort contract with Harry.

He told Hermione and her family the truth about Wizarding Britain and took her family under his wing to protect them. He encourages Hermione to be skeptical of authority figures, and Daphne even tells Hermione to question Harry motives if she thinks its wrong.

Though I can't argue that the part with Ginny is very manipulative, he's still telling her the truth and let her make the decision to hate John.

Same thing with Alex, manipulative but still truthful.

Honestly I woudn't mind if someone was manipulating me but told me exactly why it was happening. I mean, would you be mad at your parents for raising you to be a good person?

It's the exact situation with For Love of Magic. You guys hate a lot on For Love of Magic but most of everything that happens in the story has a reasonable explanation for it. Although I will admit that NoodleHammer's Islamophobia and hatred for religion did get on my nerves, the overall story was still enjoyable.

Edit: If you guys just don't like it then my whole argument is moot since everyone is entitled to their own opinions.

***** I kind of dig that - well, not necessarily the harem building aspect itself (that's undeniably creepy), but how it's presented.

In most harem fics, Harry is absolved of responsibility and moral qualms by convenient plot devices. Maybe he's soul bound to a bunch of witches, so they all belong together. Maybe there are marriage contracts, or marrying Harry is a better option than some old stuffy pureblood. Maybe a veela bonded to him and if he won't have sex with her she'll die. Either it all falls into his lap, or he does the girls a favor by allowing them to join his harem.

On the other hand, in DP&SW he's a manipulative bastard who steals the witches (it's right there in the title) out of spite against his brother and makes no elaborate justifications about it. It's... refreshingly honest, you could say.

Right, I think people aren't giving the author enough credit. It's abundantly clear that he's cognizant of the moral ambiguity of Harry's actions throughout the story. There's also the instance where Harry rescues a sex slave from terrible circumstances, but still makes use of her (non sexually) and holds power over her.

I remember seeing a post somewhere about how according to some research women in movies often talk to each other only about men. I open a fic, and the main subject Hermione and Ginny discuss is men. We point out the faults in media in this respect, and yet we make the same mistakes ourselves. I remember thinking that fanfic authors were mostly teenagers and that's why everything was oversexualized, but adult women also write these sorts of things, though maybe they approach it differently, I don't kno. I've noticed a couple of times that authors who are religious tend to approach these things more carefully. However, I haven't been in this fandom long enough to be a reliable source on this subject.

Do these girls primarily talk about boys in fanfiction because the authors writing them are just that used to that being the norm for teenage girls? Often unless you're trying to stand out from a norm or trope like that, you're very likely to fall into it, simply because that's the type of thing you expect to read in novels or see on screen.

I am sure that there was a lot of left out to make it a kids book, but in fanfiction, I usually appreciate when the author puts some real sexual tension in. 17-year-olds have sex that's just a fact in this kind of situation.

Now making it highly unrealistic isn't good either. There is a balance.

*** I get the impression that sex is the only way authors try to distinguish romantic relationships from,say, friendship. I mean, it's part of a romantic relationship, but they make it seem like it's the only thing that matters.

***** Yes. I recently read a fic which included a friends to lovers trope in the tags. I barely realised they were friends before they ended up in bed. And even after that, they just continued/started their relationship. Like, what's going on? I understand that younger people have a more relaxed approach to sex and casual dating, but when they build relationship as if in reverse...Well, I guess there's a reason why I love classic novels. Ok, end of rant. But this is such a pet peeve of mine!

******* I have a feeling that you've read most of the classic I was referring to:). I absolutely loved Gonw with the wind, because of 'like must marry like' idea. I also really liked The Tenant of Wildfel Hall by Anne Bronte. The main love story isn't very happy, but it shows what happens when a woman is a bit too naive. I feel I should warn you that author's religious beliefs are reflected in the story, just in case And, of course, There's always Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Oh and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, or any of her other books, since as far as I know, there's always a love story involved there. There's also the book called The touch by Colleen McCullough. It's not exactly a classic, but it has a love love story, which appears rather unexpectedly. This one does have some sexual scenes.When looking at this list, I realised that most stories aren't that immediate happily ever after, but most characters do get their happily ever after in the end. Maybe you have some recommendations as well? I definitely need to return to regular literature instead of reading fanfic!

*** You mean everyone doesn't have multiple orgasms, love oral sex, scream out their lover's names (or scream in general), tell them to go deeper/harder/more ect (especially the first time) and are completely satisified with every encounter.... oh noooo my myth has been shattered. It makes me laugh about the screaming. I live in a 900+ unit apartment building and only once have I heard a couple having sex and it was just moaning and groaning, no screaming.

*** As a 26 year old myself, I don't think people in their teens realize how your perception of teens changes after you're out of your teen years. And that included myself when I was 10 years younger. But now, I wouldn't touch anyone below 20 with a 100 foot pole, and I think I have the right of it.

Also, yes, Harry is under the age of consent, so ew? I'm sure people would argue "he's not prepubescent so it's not that creepy" but... yeah it is? Once he gets to 18, I don't care... but that big of a gap in life experience (in real world work and so on things) is still jarring to overcome for a couple.
