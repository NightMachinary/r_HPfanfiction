** My headcanon is that muggleborns don't have parents that can easily reverse what their kids fuck up so it's easier to just ban them all, especially since even magical born kids aren't going to be responsible enough. BUT once they've passed OWLs, they should be allowed to do magic since they could leave school and not lose their wand, meani they must be considered adults or trained enough by then to be responsible.

** I could invent any number of reasons. Perhaps improperly done spells require special training to undo, and Hogwarts professors get training in that. Perhaps Hogwarts has enchantments on it that help children control their magic with a wand, and it's a lot more dangerous for them to use a wand outside the school. Maybe brooms normally come with anti-Muggle spells on them.

On the other hand, it doesn't need to be consistent, only plausible. Quidditch is a national obsession. Quidditch-related lobbies must be the strongest in the nation. So it makes sense from that perspective that brooms would get special treatment. By comparison, wands are an omnipresent tool, but people only spend a few galleons on wands per lifetime. It's an inelastic good.

** I think the whole underage Magic Prohibition was a plot device so Harry couldn't improve his life by scaring the Dursleys into treating him decently.

** Because realistically nobody sat down and made a comprehensive set of rules to cover all magic a child may use in summers. The rules in place were made to cover specific issues and nobody cared to look further.

** I presume that, the ability to play Quidditch or Quadpot on them and the way they are used for transport aside, it's because brooms as used by children are something in-between a toy and a bike (the one with pedals, not one that uses petrol); in fact, there's probably someone out there who'd already compared Quidditch to weird cricket on bikes with elements from some other sports added in.

Given that, and the fact that there's things like /toy brooms/ so clearly brooms aren't deemed too bad to be used by children (toy brooms are just slowed and have a height limit for flight), and the fact that flying lessons are part of the first year curriculum so kids returning home from Hogwarts are expected to be capable enough to no longer need those precautions, it makes sense for their use not to be banned. Since breaking the stature of secrecy by flying in view of muggles is another thing entirely (because, you know, it's about doing anything clearly magical where and when muggles can see it), I feel that the potential for doing it does not count as a reason enough to ban it wholesale.

As for the wands in that equation, well ... I do agree it is quite likely there just to put a limit on Harry. That said, I think one could justify the existence of that particular ban with the fact that for one, spells can be dangerous in weird ways so it's better for underage wizards not to practice them in places without adult wizards or witches---and I presume parents could ask for an exception to be made due to need to practice, like “on that-and-that day, the magic performed in the vicinity of that underage wizard/witch will be ignored because they need to practice [insert this-or-that spell from Hogwarts curriculum]”, the same way Arthur got permission to use floo on Privet Drive 4 even though it was a muggle place and thus shouldn't have one (I have no doubt that with corrupted enough officials, a lifetime exception for purebloods is a possibility, so yes, unfair it could be)---and then for two, I think it's that people think that underage wizards and witches do not, strictly speaking, need wands to live because they are still in education and thus don't need them for work---and they'd need wands for their work after passing their NEWTs and then getting hired, hence permission, but they don't need wands for word after merely OWLs because they do not yet work /unless/ they've been expelled and thus have to work with whatever skills they have which would give when wand rights but only if they aren't still continuing their education---and finally for three, considering how the kids tend to be behave at Hogwarts I really wouldn't be surprised if the higher-ups just saw them as irresponsible kids, or at least most of them, and thus did not really want to entertain the notion of said kids being free to use magic.

** It's all about secrecy, right? Magic as in spells when botched can have permanent/long-term effects, and are probably harder to cover up. A person flying on a broomstick on the other hand, well, there have been UFO sightings for years, and no actual proof that it ever happened.

** I saw someone share their headcanon over on [[/r/harrypotter]] about this. Their thought was that it was an attempt to prevent more recruitment to the Death Eaters from school kids. Like Regulus. Explained why Lily was able to turn teacups into rats over the summer in front of Petunia. I'm sure I'm not doing the idea justice. Maybe I can dig it up!

** I've always thought of it more as.... doing magic, and being part of magic? So, I guess the way I've always thought of it is that casting a spell is an active act of doing magic. You have to have the intent, the ability, know what you're doing, etc. Doing it in that way is thus illegal for many of the reasons other people have mentioned.

But, for example, small kids who have bursts of accidental magic don't get in trouble, because the intent isn't really the same and they aren't really "doing" the magic, the magic is just breaking through. In a similar, but technically different vein, I've always figured the brooms are already enchanted. I suppose you need some sort of magical "touch" to make them work (actually - I don't know! Could squibs ride magical brooms? Muggles?) so, you're not actually doing magic, you're just a part of magic that's already been done. Same as if your parents are doing magic around you or to you that's not illegal, but you doing magic specifically underage is.

I guess another less complicated way is: the trace is on the wand (is this canon or have I just made that up?) so magic that's done without a wand isn't technically illegal. That doesn't really explain the Dobby thing... But that never made sense to me, unless it's more specifically that it happened in a muggle household. Like, other households have house elves and have no problems. To be honest, I haven't read that book in a loooong time, so I could be forgetting something.

Those are just my two cents!
