I found this wonderful series (not completed unfortunately) called "The Secret Keeper" [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5244652/1/The-Secret-Keeper]] where Bella Swan is MuggleBorn & went to Hogwarts. This randomly comes up while having dinner at the Cullen's house & they all go to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts after Bella is alerted by a Dumbledore's Army coin which she made into a bracelet.

Bella is a Gryffindor & seems to have replaced one of the Gryffindor Chaser girls (she's just made out to have never existed which is strange as Bella is in Harry's year and she isn't made special by being another "youngest Quiditch player")...I think Alicia Spinnet.

I really like that this fic avoids the cliche of being Harry's twin sister /sigh/ or Bellatrix's daughter /double sigh/ or any of those other common tropes that change Bella into a completely different person. Bella is the same person she was in canon with some added characteristics & not "special" by being a part of the prophecy or anything.

The fic also avoided changing the story /too/ much but still added unique things that set it apart from the original & also other fanfics. Bella is special enough to be the protagonist but not so special she takes away from Harry's part of the story. Harry as a supporting character felt natural in a way most Twilight crossovers focused on Bella never have to me.

The Secret Keeper handles grief over Fred's death really well in my opinion. The Cullen's being a part of the battle didn't just /make everything better because/ and Bella is genuinely sad and angry her friend dies--she even contemplates killing the DE that did it even after she makes him defenseless. Jasper being able to help with emotions doesn't just wash away one of her closest friends being murdered either. And as far as I remember the sequels (there's two, the second one is unfinished), they keep this consistent & don't just forget Fred died. (They even foreshadow this a bit by Bella saying that she knew she wouldn't die with seven vampires to protect her but that she had known these people for years & there was no way that not one of them would die.) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5244652/1/The-Secret-Keeper][The Secret Keeper]] I felt near the end it was turning into a bit of a trope because Bella was implied to be the one who was going to destroy the Volturi because they were going to hurt her daughter & a witch turned into a vampire is SuPer PoWErfuL but I like that it stayed away from that for so long. It really built up her character so that in the end I was thinking she would deserve it when it happened. (Bella also becomes an animagus in this series & it's implied she would keep this after becoming a vampire ???)

I really wish the author had finished it because it was the most well written & thought out Bella Swan is a Witch crossovers I had ever read. I've read this story three times now & for me that's saying something because I almost never read multichaptered fic again, especially not on purpose but I go looking for this one, hoping to find more there & also just to reread.

Anyways, if you have any fics similar to this feel free to share, I only put this under Recommendations because I was sharing so much about this fic specifically. I just joined reddit a few weeks ago & I think I might do this for any really good fics I read.
