Hello everyone,

most of the stories that get recommended here are long ones and while I love to really dive into a story as well, I think that only one-shots can get away with "fixing" something, while not creating extra artificial conflict for the sake of the story, which is something I love to read. They are also the medium for extremely strange twists, since they leave a lot to the reader and do not force the author to write down everything that would have changed just to find a satisfying end.

There are many unique beautiful short stories that never get the proper recognition, let us change that.

Two examples:

I recently stumbled over this linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15005165]]) lovely story in which Newt Scamander adopts little Tom Riddle and the idea of it really warmed my heart, but I had no idea where to recommend it.

There is also this timeless classic: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]) - The tale of Luna and Snape's friendship, which is fortunately well known in this subreddit.

And there is of cause Cauterize, which I won't link since it is probably the best known fanfic ever.

Thank you and I hope you are having a good day!


** I think most of these I have actually recced before at some point, but hopefully at least some of them will be new to you. All are gen, though some have background relationships.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]] - an absolutely adorable trio fic that puts a smile on my face every time I read it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] - features an unusual premise (Luna meets young Dumbledore, thanks to a Time Turner) that works brilliantly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5147618][Eleven Up]] - formatted as interviews for sociological research. Heads up, though - it's about as cheerful as Cauterize.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1028945][Roads Not Taken]] - essential reading for anyone who likes McGonagall and/or Molly Weasley.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]] - Lupin-centric, with spot-on characterization

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] - really nice snapshot-style exploration of what happens between the end of the war and the epilogue.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/56192][Immutability]] - I have a soft spot for teacher-student interactions (not the romantic/sexual kind), and this is one of my favorites.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/830036][Sublimation And The Snitch]] - an essay Lupin wrote about how Quidditch is a metaphor for sex, sort of. As hilarious as it sounds.

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot about [[https://femgenficathon.livejournal.com/53437.html][Five Women Who Hate Fleur Delacour]]. Female-centered gen fic at its finest.

*** Read them all! Great recommendations, thanks for sharing!

I'd say my least favorite was 'Eleven Up'. It was choppy, and mostly superficial. The premise was interesting, but I feel like it could have been executed much better.

Lupin's essay was fun, but the references were jarring, as the author seemed like he wanted to force jokes in that didn't fit the scholarly essay form. A different premise could have fixed it (written as a joke during detention, talking with friends while writing it, etc etc) but I can't see Lupin handing in something that unprofessional. I feel the humor of the rediculous essay topic was cheapened by not taking every aspect of it seriously. (Don't get me wrong though - it was still a fun read! I just hate seeing great ideas miss the mark by small margins)

'Roads not taken' was by far the best imo. It was very well done, and I think it deserves to be recommended more often here on the sub. If you only have time to read one, read this one!

** Linkffn(Under the Southern Cross) by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is fantastic and doesn't get enough recognition. It's a really brief intro to Luna/Rolf that seems so believable.

** [[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Faith and Understanding]] is my all-time favorite fanfic.

It chronicles the friendship between Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood and Ginny's musings therein.

Ginny and Luna meet on the train to Hogwarts and...they don't exactly hit it off. But the friendship is stronger for it. They laugh and they fight and nurse hurt feelings and drive each other crazy. Luna sings songs while Ginny flies her broom.

They study together and train in the DA together and share a room at the Burrow one summer and watch the clouds together.

It's quite simply the best platonic love story Harry Potter fan fiction has to offer.

  Newt hadn't talked to the boy, Tom, nearly long enough. His mind worked fast. Later, he would admit that it worked probably too fast. “Confundo!” The woman stumbled and looked terribly confused and a little dizzy- a bit like a drunk person. “Wha?” she slurred. At this point, Newt should have probably said that it was, in fact, visiting hours and that he had every right to be here. What happened instead was: “I'm adopting Tom Marvolo Riddle, don't you remember me?”

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
