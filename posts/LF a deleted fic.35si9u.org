The story title is "How to save Harry," I was going to start reading it but found the story had been removed. It's a Harry/Hermione story set in 7th year during the Horcrux hunt and I don't know who the author is as I only have a link to the story page.

** You're in luck, it's still on a backup site: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7316864]]

*** Thank you, did you have to search from the site because google didn't work for me? I am a fan of your stories btw.

**** Thanks, glad you like them (and I promise I'm working on updates).

Nah I know about that site since I +am a narcist+ found it when I was Googling for my own fics, to see if anyone was discussing them. Fortunately the webmaster there was very accommodating when I asked them to remove my content (I prefer to have my own control over where I host my fics, that's why).

Any author who does not request their stories not to be archived, has their fics mirrored there. You can therefore find almost any story from FFN by just using the same story ID:\\
