Okay, the first one I know the title and the nom du plume of the author -- Playing with Fire by Adrian (Adian?) Lynch. It used to be at the Astronomy Tower. It explained how Harry and Ron got together and I always loved the characterization of Hermione in this one.

The second one may have been written by someone who used the non du plume of "Susan Bones" and I think it was on FictionAlley, but don't quote me on either of those. It was a fix fic that I think started with a new prologue, left the events of Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone alone, but then started a pretty major 'fix fic' effort with a complete redo of the Chamber of Secrets. I believe I was somewhere in this author's version of the Goblet of Fire when I lost track of the fic. Essentially, it sought to make the Dursleys more explicable, tried to make Draco and Harry a GENUINE rivalry, and sort out the awkward "pair the spares" attitude that Rowling had. It also got rid of some of the cringe factor that was played for comedy. A fic aimed at realism, if you will. I do think I remember some specific details:

- The Dursleys were kinder to Harry, but due to a poor understanding of the Wizarding World, they really feared that Harry going to Hogwarts was a prologue to him dying the same way Lily did. Petunia had to be convinced that Hogwarts was really the best place for him. Harry isn't mistreated so much as Petunia holds back because she's so afraid to lose her last scrap of her sister. Dudley isn't a bully so much as he's the dumber, jockier type and his father connects with that. Harry's the odd duck, and Petunia has him word hard, but it's far from abusive. I think he may or may not also be allowed to take care of other yards for pocket change.
- Ginny stays home for a year after the events of the Chamber of secrets, and her crush on Harry cools the heck down in a very natural way.
- This is the part I remember best -- there's a moment where Harry is up in the Mews (Owlrey?) and is either thinking to himself or is musing to another character that he's really not into romance, he's never had a crush, and he just doesn't see how being the Boy Who Lived when Voldemort is alive allows time for that. (This speech may have been made to Cho Chang or Ginny.)

I'm hoping I'm not conflating fics together here -- I'm fairly certain this was one series of fics, not several, but does anyone remember something like that? Or, can you recommend a near whole series redo?
