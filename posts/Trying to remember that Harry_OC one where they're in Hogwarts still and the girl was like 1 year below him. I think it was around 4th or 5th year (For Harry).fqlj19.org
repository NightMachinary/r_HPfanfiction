Its one of those fanfictions to read when you are a bit tired of all the angst cliche kind of fanfics. i remember she got along well with Ron and Hermione and that it was a normal girlfriend/boyfriend relationship with Harry. She was an OC (if I recall) and I think her name starts with an A.


** I think it may be Astoria Greengrass. The description you describe fits her.

*** I think I remember that she got along well with Hermione and Ron, and that it is a really comfortable relationship with Harry. She was i think 3rd or 4th year. I think her name starts with an A.
