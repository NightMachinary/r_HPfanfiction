** I'll add "Accidental Bond" by kb0

linkffn(5604382)

I guess you can say there is "compulsion" because there is a bond that gets created, but it's not really coercion. The bond doesn't create "instant love," it creates a connection and trust, which makes developing a real relationship easier. And that's what happens - a long-term development of multiple relationships. And the /physical/ relationships also proceed very gradually due to their ages.

I used kb0's idea of how such a bond works as a model for my own use of the trope of a soul bond.

Oh, and this story is a wonderful exploration of what can happen if an adult actually stands up in defense of Harry, forcing the school to actually take his welfare seriously. That's one thing canon doesn't have - any adults who put his interests first, above all others.

*** I've already read the accidental bond and liked it. While it violates the "bond" rule above, I do think it's an example of writing a bond story well. I'd definitely read comparable stories if any existed. Thanks!

*** Thanks for the recommendation!

I started reading it last night, and I couldn't really get into it. It seems like at least as far as I read, it definitely has a /lot/ of the overpowered Harry and instant connections (with kids who are way too grown up for 11) thing going on. Does it get better or have other redeeming features? If the characters were 16 I'd think it was plausible how they act around him.

Also, the author has a gofundme page on their FFN profile. Ick.

**** I like a lot of what he does. with the kids being too young i just pretend the characters are around 15 in any fanfic I read. It's almost impossible for any author to get an 11 year old right. He has a lot of novel ideas to the point were I felt like it was a super!harry done differently.

Always and Forever is the best in the genre I've ever read. It has believable characters acting in believable ways and EVERYONE is an asshole but you don't hate them. Well written, hot and structurally sound this fic is awesome.

linkAO3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4730078]])\\
This fic is exactly the same as the above fic except everything turns good and no one is an asshole. The only downside is that the writing is worse, like a lot worse. read this one at your own peril.

  When Frank Longbottom sees two of his friends snogging in a corridor at the Ministry, he's upset for one reason only-- how dare James cheat on Lily, and Remus cheat on Sirius. But unfortunately for Frank, not everything is what it seems.  Remus was the sort who, when he found people who loved him the way James and Sirius did, he would protect it at all costs. Threaten that love and Remus would kill you, without hesitation. With a smile on his face and a flick of his wand. Afterward he would make himself a cup of cocoa and have a biscuit and not lose a minute of sleep.  That was how Remus loved.
