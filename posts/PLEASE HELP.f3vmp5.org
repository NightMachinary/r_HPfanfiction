Hello all, I'm looking for a story where Severus/Hermione are working at the ministry. I remember that Hermione starts a physical only relationship with Snape. He gives her potion ingredients for her birthday in the form of upsideï»¿ down flowers. They share an office, and because Hermione runs from commitment he never tells her he loves her until their last kid goes off to college. He tells her he loves her, after she says she's getting fat and that he won't want her any longer. She doesn't say it back until he has her bent over the couch that he tells her is the right hight to bend her over. Sorry I'm unable to remember more.
