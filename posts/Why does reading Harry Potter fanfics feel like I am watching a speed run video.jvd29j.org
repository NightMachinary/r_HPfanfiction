I've been trying to find original fics for quite some time at this point, but every time I read one I THINK might be different, it is the exact same as some other 3-4 fics I've already read. Most fics change almost nothing about the story, except to add some extra plot line. Does anyone else feel like this, or is it just me?


** I've definitely had this in alot of let's follow the same timeline with different character or Harry sorted into another house or time travel fics.

My suggestion would be try to read like stories that focus on the main trio of characters after they leave school. Or try to read fics bout the Marauders era characters either as adults or when they were in school. Or just straight up whole world aus like Prince of a Dark Kingdom.

Stories about Harry's time at hogwarts can feel different if they come from a character who was having a very different story that wasn't intersecting with Harry as much like say someone from Slytherin. But if you involve them more with the beating Voldemort story its going to hit alot of the same beats to the original unless the main story has been altered significantly imo.

** Not just you, rigid adherence to the stations of canon is far too common.

Try searching for canon divergent or alternate universe fics.

***** Why? There's /lots/ of stuff in the HP universe that aren't touched in the books and merely hinted at, where a good author can go ahead and construct a whole world even while staying compliant to canon and not running into the same plots over and over:

- Adult life: what do wizards actually do for a living? There are some which are extremely rich (Malfoy), some who are poor-ish/lower middle class (Weasley), some who are piss poor (Gaunt). Do they all work? If yes, what? Is there any form of entertainment besides getting wasted at a pub and watching Quidditch games?
- Politics: All we know is that there is the Wizengamot which acts as a legislative body and court, that there's a Minister of Magic and that the Ministry deals with enforcing the laws and regulations and deals with international relationships with other Wizarding communities.
- Life pre-War and post-War in general - the books give us the seven years of Harry at the school, but everything else is fair game.
- early history - how was Hogwarts founded in the first place? What caused the rift between the founders? How did the basilisk survive for hundreds of years? How/why went Wizards into hiding? Were Wizards involved in revolutionary events in the Muggle world (wars, pest outbreaks, revolutions)?

All your examples might result in great stories but they don't actually address the problem the OP had.

** Yeah, I have this feeling a lot, but I think it's because I have my favourite group of characters and usually, I read fics where they are the main focus of the story. I like reading other people interpretations of those characters, especially since in the books, they barely exist, but it's rather hard to find something new and interesting.

But on a more on topic note I think you just have to look for different fics. I pretty much only read big ass AUs at this point outside of a few post canon fics or character pieces that are canon compliant or close to it

** If you are looking for a recommendation I can give you my own story which is Linkffn(A New Better alife by Ulltima101). It is cannon compliant in that the main points of cannon still happen but the circumstances are different.

Edit: if you arent, then in my experience from writing year 1 it is incredibly boring. The story really picks up in different places for different people I think year 2 is where it really starts heavy

** It's pretty common, fact is it's a lot more work to invent an entirely new plot rather than just change a few things and then have most of canon play out as normal, it's even easy to justify as a huge amount of the plot is things happening to Harry and him reacting (along with his friends), at least the first 4 books are going to happen pretty much as canon.
