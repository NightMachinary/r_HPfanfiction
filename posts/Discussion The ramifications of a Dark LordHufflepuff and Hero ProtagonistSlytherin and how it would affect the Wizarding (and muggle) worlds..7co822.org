So, I've been developing some ideas for a fanfic, primarily set about twenty years after the epilogue. I wanted to discuss what you think would happen if such events written below occurred in canon.

 

- 1992: A wizard is born to two muggle-borns, and it is immediately apparent that the wizard is immensely powerful. The child is named John Diggory, distantly related to Cedric Diggory.

 

- 1994: John is capable of advanced magical feats without a wand, though with a lack of control, that a lot of average magical folk would struggle casting with a wand.

 

- 1998: John and his family are attacked at their magically-protected safe house, due to his powerful magic attracting the attention of Death Eaters. Luckily, he is hidden in a safe place. Unfortunately, he hears the murder of his parents and torture (plus eventual murder) of his older siblings, within the darkness of his hiding spot. John moves to NYC to be taken in by his distant squib relatives.

 

- 1998-2003: During the next five years, John grows increasingly more powerful and proficient in magic, as well as other fields of muggle and magical knowledge - quickly becoming a protégé. The prejudice against those not of pureblood - though not as bad as the UK - further sours John to the magical world. Even so, he decides to attend Hogwarts in honour of his family and is sorted into Hufflepuff house. While at Diagon Alley, John tries to get a wand, but every wand explodes when he tried to use one due to his sheer power. Thus, he enters Hogwarts without one.

 

- 2003-2008: Though he thought Wizarding America was bad, John is absolutely disgusted with Wizarding Britain and is aghast at the knowledge that things were /worse/ only less than a decade ago. John becomes friends with the down-trodden students and helps the live up to their potential. His kindness and helpfulness are genuine - as long as you aren't pureblood or a sympathiser. One of his best friends is a Slytherin, Joshua Greengrass, despite being a pureblood. Another is a Gryffindor from the year below, Coleen Creevey. By the time of his fifth-year, the trio (but especially John) are leagues ahead of everyone else in the school. John leaves Hogwarts once he takes his OWLs to travel the world to train and learn.

 

- 2023: John returns even more powerful than ever. Through ancient rituals, he is powerful in all aspects - physically, mentally, and magically. In comparison, John would /utterly/ demolish Voldemort and Dumbledore in their prime simultaneously. An example of his power would be his immunity to the Unforgivables. He gathers his forces and connections - friends, muggle-borns, some half-bloods, and several species who have gotten the short end of the stick. Coleen becomes her second-in-command, like Bellatrix to Voldemort, though it is platonic (and she is sane). During his training, John has managed to successfully integrate magic and technology, along with developing wards like in canon.

- 2023-2038: John and his forces (The Crusaders) fight for equality in the Wizarding World, while taking away the young of purebloods and their sympathisers to be raised in the 'new' ways. Anyone who disagrees is given a warning, before they are "disposed". Joshua refuses to join his side, citing that though his intentions are good, what he is doing is wrong. Over the next fifteen years, John and Joshua fight against each other - with massive losses on both sides - until Joshua manages to imprison his old friend. Whole cities like NYC and Shanghai, while places like Diagon Alley are wiped off the map just by battles between the two old friends a la Man of Steel scale of destruction. This is while both are *holding back*.

Sorry for the long post, but what effects do you think this would have on the Wizarding World?


** I don't think there is need to make your protagonist that powerful. In fact, a far less powerful, but more intelligent and charismatic hero is far more interesting.

** I think you have an interesting concept here, although the protagonist is really OP. Personally, the blowing up of wands and the immunity to Unforgiveables is too over-the-top. Having his magic be volatile is one thing, having it blow out a wand makes it too OP. Being able to fight off the Imperious curse is logical, but being immune to the Cruciatus and the Killing curse is just too much, in my opinion. In order to make your protagonist more believable, readers must be able to relate to him. In terms of the effect on the Wizarding World, it'd definitely be a game changer. John is essentially the inverse of Voldemort in a lot of ways. Idk. I feel like it has a lot of potential but needs refinement.

** As Inquisitor said, there's no need for such overpoweredness. Really, being so overpowered is generally only good when there are frequent enemies that are near similar levels. And that often means that enemies are just going to get stronger as your character encounters them. It's bad to have a fairly high level enemy still be leagues below your character in terms of power. In fact, it's often better to have a large amount of characters at fairly similar power levels, such as in Worm with the more famous heroes or villains, or in Naruto, such as during the war, many of the major participants were pretty damn powerful. Otherwise, relatively god-tier power should be used as a finale, to defeat the big bad, which is basically what happens in Worm, Naruto, and even PMMM.
