Because I'm curious. Did anyone ever write a fic where Ron for whatever reason became the fourth Triwizard champion instead of Harry... and this was NOT just a "Ron sucks, Harry's so much cooler and deserves a better friend than that jealous jealousy-jead jealous loser" story? I'd kind of like to see what might happen in such a story.

Note: No character-bashing. This is a bash-free request.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9476512/23/]]) has Ron substituting himself for Harry to fulfill his life debt. He obviously believed it was an attempt on Harry from the start, and did it to foil the attempt.

  Harry's sent reeling when he learns that Professor Snape is his dad, and if that were all he had to deal with, he'd probably be all right, but he's got werewolves, escaped convicts, a stubborn Dark Lord, and his own inner demons to deal with. Starts third year. Rating mostly for violence. LGBT characters. Story deals with mental health, bigotry and child abuse. More notes inside.

*** That's cool. I don't really like "Snape is Harry's father" fics, but I'll make an exception. ^_^

*** Why not? Unless you hate Ron and think it's impossible to write him in any sort of protagonist role without bashing him (in which case I wouldn't want to read any fics by you anyway), why wouldn't it be possible to write a serious, non-bashy story about him being thrust into the role of Triwizard Tournament Champion and suddenly having to face challenges greater than he has before, and all of a sudden Harry can't be there to be the big hero so Ron has to step up and do right?

It's EASY to write that sort of thing without bashing or taking the crack-route. I'd try it, but I don't have the time to commit to another long fic.

***** That's not a very good argument.

There's an entire WORLD of characterization between "bashing" and "total success." Even if Ron ends up doing badly in the tournament, or even fails, that's very possible, even EASY to write without bashing, The tournament could, probably WOULD, force more development on Ron... just because he never got the opportunity to shine in canon, or didn't get as much development as he should have, doesn't mean you can't do it DIFFERENTLY. Write the story where Ron struggles, where he loses, or NEARLY loses, but learns from it and comes back a stronger and more self-assured person who actually realizes that he has a lot more going for him than anyone (including Ron himself) ever gave him credit for. Or, hell, he loses the tournament but finds something else... say he manages to expose the fake Moody. There are SO MANY POSSIBILITES.

I just have no idea how you can't see that it would be easy to write a story without bashing.

****** Ron might well not pass any info about the dragons to Cedric, meaning that Cedric would be the only one unprepared for the dragon fight. Combine that with some pointers that he remembers from Charlie (or asks Hagrid about), and he could easily do better than Cedric, at the least.

He'd almost definitely do exactly what Harry did and wait for the other Champions to rescue Harry and Hermione in the lake (though without Mad Eye Barty, he'd have to find another way besides gillyweed). This got Harry a significant amount of points.

I seriously doubt he'd be in last place by the time of the final Task.
