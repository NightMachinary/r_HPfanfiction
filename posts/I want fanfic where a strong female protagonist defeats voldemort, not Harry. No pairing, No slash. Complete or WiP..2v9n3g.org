Please! basically looking for an independent, "I don't need a man" vibe from one of the cannon female protagonist, but it can also be a female OC as well. For once, I want a fic that just pukes girl power.


** While I think it might be awesome to have a "no man can kill him" thing going on with an actually empowered female character, asking for fics without any pairings at all is asking a bit much. Even canon had that, shockingly enough.

Maybe a non-romance fic is what you're looking for? Something in the genre of action or non-crotch-based drama? Otherwise, she has to kill him when she's like 12, she needs to be /really/ tortured and introverted, or she is basically asexual for it to never come up. Teens at least /think/ about that sort of thing, you know.

Source: was a (non-magical) teen at one point.

On the other hand, a female MC struggling with focusing on killing Voldemort while being distracted by /n/ hot /x/s (where /n/ > 0, and /x/ /âˆˆ genders/) would be interesting. Kind of distracting being a badass in book six with canon Hermione/Ron antics going on. Just replace mopy uselessness with badassitude, remove the awkward mistake of a budding Ginny relationship, and mix in action to taste.

Not that I /have/ anything like that to link to. But it's good to define exactly what you're looking for while also being realistic.

*** I don't want a romance that distracts her from her main mission or goal, whatever the author makes it. I kind of want her to give up on hoping Harry will defeat Voldemort because, what fucking preparation or training has he ever gotten? I want Hermione to realize that surely she would be more capable in defeating old Voldy and she herself doesn't even believe in divination so why should she believe in the prophecy?

  No pairing. No slash.
#+end_quote

So we're ruling out things like /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ then? WIP because it has sequels by year, very mature, but has some slash, some protagonist/Luna, and some references to paedophilia. There's a few like that - /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans]]/ seems more explicitly "I don't need a man" vibe but completely violates the no-slash and is even more mature.

Or there is /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486108/1/From_the_Flame_to_the_Spark][From the Flame to the Spark]]/ that is a cracky Ginny peggy-sue - but it's Harry/Ginny even if that doesn't really come up much and Ginny pretty much just does everything. Much more lighthearted. Or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]]/ which is a gender-swap cracky peggy sue, but is again slash a bit.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]'s Alexandra Quick novels? It has virtually no canon characters, granted, but it does have a plucky female protag.
