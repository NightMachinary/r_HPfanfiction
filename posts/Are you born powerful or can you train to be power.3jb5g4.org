** Correct me if I'm wrong, but the "magical core" thing is just a fanfiction concept, there's not really a hint of such a thing in the books. I don't really like it, I see magic as something that's just innate in witches and wizards, I don't think there's a special place in your body for it. I think the power of your magic depends on your emotions, your strength of will, and your grasp of the concept of what you are trying to achieve and how to achieve it magically. That last one could improve with a higher intelligence witch or wizard and also through practice. People might have different magical abilities like being a metamorphmagus or a parselmouth, but the strength of their magic starts out the same.

I also like the concept of magic being an outside force that witches and wizards have the power to tap into, rather than something that they generate. The only thing that really points to this in the books is the way prophecies happen.

*** There is some evidence in canon for "magical cores". Well, most people hate the word, so let's just call it innate magic power or mana or whatever. As [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] quoted in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2a0il4/in_defense_of_magical_cores/][this thread]], the bit when Harry and Dumbledore cross the lake of inferi:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake."

  ...

  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

Magical power is an easy way to answer some questions like "why don't wizards use magic /all the time/" or "what determines the maximum weight you can levitate using Wingardium Leviosa".

**** Wow, that's some good evidence! So the strength of one's magic itself can definitely improve and grow stronger. I'm still gonna headcanon that everybody starts out the same, but I reckon that's pretty definitely against them drawing magic from somewhere else out there.

** Canon is not explicit, but what little evidence there is, "power" seems to be produced by reading, education, learning, etc. So power and knowledge are more-or-less the same thing.

Knowledge and skill aren't quite the same thing (knowing how to do something being able to do it well), but I think Starfox5's point is still fair. Separating knowledge of a subject, skill in a subject, and the amount of force that one can bring to bear makes sense.

It's not necessary to use the idea of a "magical core" to achieve that, but it is simple one that most readers will be immediately familiar with. You don't have to spend a lot of time explaining it, you can just use it.

It really comes down to whether or not the "power" in the magic one is writing about is "force" or "ability". In canon, a "powerful" witch or wizard isn't someone who casts an really strong curse, it's someone with a greater knowledge of magic and who can use that magic more creatively. Dumbledore's spells are more esoteric, complex, creative, etc. He doesn't pound away at Riddle with overpowered blasting hexes. Presumably, his stunner isn't stronger than Harry's. It might be more efficient or effective based on his knowledge of it, but not /stronger/ - as in, not having more energy or force behind it.

Most fanfic writers link power with force and knowledge + skill with ability. First, because it's intuitive - it's how pretty much everything else works. This makes it easier to write because you can assume a lot on the part of readers. Second, it's easier to write because trying to explain the power/ability scenario would be pretty hard if you did it with any depth (i.e., beyond saying "she read and studied a lot, thus making her a more powerful witch).

** Please read [[/u/Taure]] [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][HeadCannon]], it goes in debth about the entire magical system recoded from the books, and all of it is based on direct quotes from the book. It debunks various theories such as magical core, and inborne talent. Quite an interesting short read that I will greatly recommend reading since you show intrest in the subject.

** Magical cores are purely fanon, bad fanon at that.

Canon HP magic is about skill, practice, knowledge, and intuition, and (to borrow an apt metaphor from [[/u/Taure]]) is more akin to mastering piano than it is to weightlifting.

** I personally think having "Magical Strength" in addition to "Magical Skill" adds more variety. You can have those who rely on weaker, but perfectly cast spells, and those who have powerful but not quite as well cast spells, and both areas can be trained.

Just like a martial artist can improve both strength and skill.

** There are wizards like Dumbledore or Riddle that are ridiculously more powerful than everybody else. They aren't just slightly better because they trained, they are simply far more powerful the same way Einstein was simply smarter than the average man.

Talent like that can't be achieved by training alone. Talent like that is innate. True, they have trained a lot to perfect it, but training alone can never make a normal wizard turn into a powerhouse like Dumbledore.

Magic is definitely not equally distributed. For the normal wizards/witches the difference in raw power can be compensated by skill and training, but there are certain barriers that training alone cannot overcome.

*** But they aren't rediculously more powerful than everybody else... They are just more knowledgeable about various spells. If you notice nowhere in the entire book series are /any/ wizard or witch refered to as powerful. Great, yes. Greatest, yes. Better, yes. But never more powerful. Only time ever Dumbledore and Voldemort show actual magical superiority ability, is during their duel inside the Ministry of Magic. /Remember it was only the movie where Voldemort toppled the Hogwards wards./ And even during the duel they showed various big spells, but it didn't last all that long, and for all we know could every spell simply be premade spells such and Lumos. Remember, both of them are OLD, so they have had much time collecting magical knowledge and traning skills, and these two thing are what determins magical prowess. Not some imaginar inborne thing that cannon be changed, this is Harry Potter, not Naruto or Bleach.

** I personally do not like the concept of Magical Cores. They're too easily made into anime-like powerlevels. Also, I find them to be a bit of a boring way out.

I personally link my magic systems to the symbolic way magic worked in canon. Love, Hate, Need, Willpower, Inner Peace, Despair, Hope,... are real "things". They're factors, among others, with which (one can only assume) arithmancers would build new spells. Much like Forces or Temperature in Physics, on the most mundane level of magic, these factors work similar. One needs a certain state of mind, a symbolic act (ritual in form of words + wand-movement) to produce magic effects.

So as a first point, I'd make "purpose" a factor that differentiates a normal wizard from legends like Dumbledore or Voldemort. Someone who calls upon these powers for a reason that is more than just simple need, then his magic acts accordingly. Great purpose equals great magical feats.

Second point would be that depending on your inner self, some magic comes easier to you than other. Prime example: Bellatrix Lestrange who casts Crucio like others cast Lumos. So greater wizards and witches will always feel great emotions, worthy of epic tales. Furthermore, both bad and good emotions wield power. Love is not better than Hate, its just different in effect. While Love protects, hate destroys.

Then we have of course the fact that magic is hereditary. That gives us a hint that there is some biological part involved. I personally think that all life in the world of HP has magic in them, even muggles. Yet just very few of Earths children can use magic to its full extent. Those who can are affected by, or open for the force of magic to stream through them. But while wizards and witches can loose their ability, due to great pain or despair, muggles cannot achieve magic. (Or maybe they can, through Love and passion. Then maybe muggleborn children are the manifestation of this love. However, thats neither here nor there.). My examples for this would be 1)Merope Gaunt who fell into deepest despair when Riddle left her and 2) Neville who, away from his life with Augusta Longbottom, achieves normal skills by finding more in life than being compared to a broken father and mother. He finds purpose that doesn't drive him into sadness with the final peak when he stands next to Harry Potter in the Ministry.

So, yea... at least thats what I'm thinking while writing. The greater the purpose, the greater the mage.

** There's probably innate, inborn talent. Compare the childhoods of Tom Riddle and Nevile Longbottom. Riddle did things with magic even trained adults probably couldn't replicate. I don't mean just speaking to snakes, but things like making people hurt or obey without ever using his wand.

*** I don't think anyone disagrees that there are inborn personal attributes that affect ability to do magic, but I think that no "power meter" or "magical talent" distinct from personality and general intelligence are necessary to explain it. Neville, in particular, is an interesting example: he started out as a borderline squib, but through hard work and a change in attitude (and, arguably, a better fitting wand, though his improvement started before he got his wand replaced), worked himself up to the same tier as the proverbial Trio.

** I can see the temptation of "magical cores", in that they make magic behave like real-world resources, with limited storage capacity, discharge rates, and replenishment rates. However, some parts of the "magical core" model are downright inconsistent with canon: in particular, nobody ever, ever runs out of magic or talks about running out of magic or thinks about running out of magic. Magic is not a battery, and there is no chakra in /Harry Potter/.

Beyond that, there's some quantity that Voldemeter in the cave could measure, but it seemed like something that measured the overall "worth" of a wizard, not any underlying capacity for magic.

In the end, though, I think that inborn severe differences in "magical power" tend to, almost universally, degrade the story into which they are introduced. Vast, vast majority of the time, they are simply an unearned powerup orthogonal to the rest of the character.

Other models for why different characters have different magical capabilities --- that depend on general intelligence, personality, study and experience, mental state, all of which we know affect magic --- while partly inborn, have the important property that they integrate with the rest of the character. For example, Bellatrix's sadism gives her a powerful Cruciatus, but it also drives her to torture Hermione for information when the Imperius or Legilimency (which there is some circumstantial evidence she can do) would have worked better, and to mock Molly in the middle of a battle, which costs her her very life. Harry's stubbornness and proverbial wearing of his heart on his sleeve lets him push aside the Dementors' aura and /just think happy thoughts/, giving him an unmatched Patronus and aiding him in resisting Imperius, but it also makes him much more impulsive, easier to manipulate, and cripples his Occlumency.

** I've always thought it's a bit of both. And there's different branches of magic, too.

For an example, I'm rather smart in general (or so I like to think), and my strong subjects are language arts and music. But I suck suck suck suck at math. I can practice math and spend lots of time working on it and get better, but it will never be a subject that I excel at. Similarly, Neville is good at herbology but shitty at transfiguration. Ginny is amazing at charms. Harry rocks at DADA. Hermione isn't as good at DADA as in her other subjects. Tonks sucks at household spells.

Some people are born naturally good at most things (Hermione) or average and work to be good (Harry), and some people are born... not so great but work really really hard and get average or good (Neville).
