Are there any fic where, harry potter , the last wizard fighting against the dark forces due to some unforseen magic, get transported to the future, an apocalyptic future where he is the saviour mentioned in prophecy. A saviour who comes to save the world from all evil.

  Fullerton suddenly gasped and looked at Harry in shock. "Of course! It's the prophecy coming true."
