Or is it like the equivalent to chip tracking where they know you're alive and if you use magic.


** Nice try, Ministry.

** There's nothing in canon that says one way or the other, but I would be personally shocked if the ministry would be incapable of knowing. Whether they do or don't would likely have political reasons because some of that information would be very personal. Then again, looking what the Daily Prophet is allowed to print, I assume the wizarding world doesn't have any kind of privacy laws comparable to the non-magical ones.

In canon we don't learn too much about it except for the fact that Hogwarts sends out letters to magical children, letters which are addressed in great detail.

In subsequent interviews and on Pottermore, Rowling expanded upon that. Basically, the Hogwarts school has two magical artifacts that record every magical birth and it is those that determine which children are sent a Hogwarts admission letter on their 11th birthday. Rowling also said though that the ministry didn't have the same information in the [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm][same interview]] and it can't get any clearer than that:

  The Ministry of Magic doesn't find out which children are magic.

No details on why Hogwarts knows and the ministry doesn't. One immediate thought of mine: it may be worth a try for the pregnant witch to leave the British isles for the birth. I wonder if that could work, or if the information would be recorded anyway once they came back with the child. If not, wizarding families immigrating to Great Britain and Ireland wouldn't be accepted into the school automatically.

The second part of this question is about the ministry finding out if an underage person performs magic. There's an /improper use of magic/ office in the ministry, Harry in the books has frequent interaction with wizards because of them, but there's actually very little in canon known about them except for what they do and who works there.

I guess if you've read plenty of fanfiction, you'll have seen a dozen ideas for the technical details behind this detection. Canon doesn't tell us if any of them is correct or not, so like any author you're free to choose believing in one way over the other and you'd not be wrong.

*** What about foreigners visiting? Especially in places like Amsterdam or Vegas, alcohol and magic are the recipe for disaster (or at least some serious violations of the statute of secrecy).

** There's a bunch of conjecture and holes within the canon.

We know that the Ministry cannot detect all uses of magic. We know that the Trace can only detect spells being cast by or near an under-aged wizard/witch, though it doesn't report anything while in certain locations like Diagon Alley, the Ministry, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts, most wizard homes, and St. Mungos. The Trace also detects but ignores instances of magic happening near the under-aged when they are accompanied by certain adults; Dumbledore for sure, Mr. Weasley is a good candidate, as is Mad-Eye Moody.

I say 'detects but ignores' as the beginning of Book 7 is exactly the sort of situation where Harry's use of magic would be ignored with all those adults in the room, yet Moody is careful only to use pre-arranged magical devices and potions, lest the Ministry detect a spell and use the record of it to indict Harry for breaking the law.

We know through Pottermore that Hogwarts has a magical Quill of Acceptance that detects the birth of magical children within a certain territory, but that it can't write the name and birthdate into the Book of Admittance until they demonstrate accidental magic that would prove they weren't a squib. The Hogwarts leadership reviews the Book of Admittance each summer to send out invitations to those listed in it who would be eleven by the time September of that year began.

From these, I would argue:

1. Wizards born abroad aren't detected by the Quill, but...\\
2. The Book can detect accidental magic
3. The Ministry doesn't know how they do that, but they've set up the Trace to compensate
4. The exemption of wizard homes was probably arranged to allow dark magic to be done by parents without being logged due to the Trace on their children

** Sure you can. If you:\\
1 - were born (and ideally schooled) abroad, and\\
2 - are careful in your magic use for it to never be associated with you by the Ministry.

That means, using magic in highly wizard-contaminated areas so it gets ignored, and, if you are using magic in wizard-free places, buggering off immediately after an leaving nothing behind that can be traced back to you.

** maybe? credence in fantastic beast need a lot of time to be suspected as obscurial by grindelwald and MACUSA, despite supposedly having a lot of magical power. Also, if I remembered right, hagrid says that it is harry's parent who registers him at hogwarts, instead of being automatically registered?
