Abraham Potter went to America a couple hundred years ago so why can't there be other Potters in other countries? They might not be immediate family but they'd still be family.

Basically stories like linkffn(12068079)


** linkffn(Marry you by Dorothea Greengrass)

There's only a bit of interaction, not that big of a deal, its a cousin (i think) of James.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Daphne find themseves trapped in a hasty marriage after a drunken night, and there is no way out. How will they cope with that? Warnings: underage drinking, probably a lemon or two, and Weasley bashing. Also, English is not my first language, so be prepared for strange language quirks or don't read. Chapter 3 partly rewritten.

  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings. Betaed by Marc the Unruly
