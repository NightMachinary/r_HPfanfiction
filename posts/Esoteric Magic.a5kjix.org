I dont recall where exactly i read it, maybe it was HPMOR or The Prince of Slytherin, but the author had this concept of esoteric magic which differs from normal magic in which it has a emotional component to it. The prime example is the Patronus Charm, which requires the focus on a strong enough happy memory to make it work, or the killing curse (and perhaps, even the cruciatus curse) which requires a strong feeling of hate towards the target. Anyone can tell me if I'm right? Or is it from somewhere else? ps: sorry for grammar and spelling, I'm on mobile now.


** That's Prince of Slytherin. It was one of Lockhart's lectures as I recall.
