Yo.

The title nails what I'm looking for clearly, I have something of a hankering for post war fics where Harry takes something of a leading role in rebuilding the wizarding world. Whether in a Sum of their Parts vein or something in a less revolutionary vein like Novocaine linkao3(15537897). Dont care as much about the romantic aspect though I prefer non slash. Anybody able/willing to help a stranger out with some recs?

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.
