smut, but also good writing, please


** Linkffn(The Harem War by Vance McGill) is good. Vance is kind of known for dropping fics though, so if you aren't into abandoned fics, sorry about that.

EDIT: Forgot to add that this is NOT The Harem War by Radaslab. This one does not have the ridiculous rehashing, the idiotic bashing of Ron and Molly to the point of no redemption, or Harry being the ruler of his own island. Also, while the good guys do take on concubines, it is not to the extremes like Radaslab has.
