Please recommend a few fics where Dumbledore adopts and raises Harry instead of sending him to the Dursleys. One where he teaches Harry in the art of obscure magics and so on. At least 100k words, preferably more. And either with regular updates or completed. Thank you! Edit: as there is not much success with Dumbledore, how about harry getting raised by either Sirius, remus or mad eye


** I'd be interested in this too. Don't know if it exists though. Haha

******* Yeah, Ive read this. It's not a slash fic or in any way creepy. The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is familial. Iirc, there's a scene where Harry thinks he might be gay and Albus tells him that he's gay and about Grindelwald, which might be what people are saying is "creepy," but it's not - it's giving advice to a child in his care from an informed perspective. It's not a precursor to some weird Harry/Dumbledore pairing.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

** Well, Dumbledore isn't /raising/ Harry in this one, but linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) is a WIP fic where Harry is expelled from Hogwarts after second year and Dumbledore takes him on as an apprentice. It's pretty good so far.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** The only one I know is where he takes Harry in when he's about fourteen but because he was so abused or some such reason they pass him off as 11 and restarts him in school. It's a strange one. Snape helps to 'raise' him.

** I've got one, although it's extremely short:

linkffn(2631508)

Here's one where Dumbledore adopts Harry later on. Again, very short.

linkffn(1019740)

He doesn't really teach Harry in any of these. The only fic I know where he does is Albus and Harry's World Trip which has already been mentioned.

Edit: Actually, you know what? I found a LiveJournal from 2006 that has a bunch of fics sorta related to what you're looking for:
