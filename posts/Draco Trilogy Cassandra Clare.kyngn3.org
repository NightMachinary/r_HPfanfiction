:END:
I've just recently gotten to know about this Draco and Ginny thing, which apparently was turned into the books Mortal Instruments. So I was wondering where I can read the fanfiction of this. Please drop the link below if you know about it. I don't know much about it other than it was just a cringe-fest apparently and I really want to read it now. Thank you.


** I don't know that 'cringe-fest' is entirely accurate, but it is way too long and lifts a lot of its quippy quotes from TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It gets VERY repetitive-- you can only rehash a Draco/Harry/Hermione love triangle for so long. But I think it sets up a lot of what became fanon tropes. You might be disappointed if you're looking for Draco/Ginny though-- it's mostly unrequited on Ginny's side, Draco's interest in her is sporadic as he's often focused on Hermione.

Anyway the first one is Draco Dormiens, you can find it on a bunch of sites if you google it! Some have some illustrations that are... not top quality haha but you can pick your preferred publication.
