Imagine if you could associate any task you had to do with pleasure. You could train your brain into being as studios as Hermione.


** I feel like overusing the charm could be a mistake. Ron had to be led into a quiet room to recover after Harry cast it on him, and... like, [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sorcellerieinfo/images/8/8f/HP2jeu-F%C3%A9lix_Labeille_-_Chocogrenouille.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120926074822&path-prefix=fr][look at the guy who invented it.]]

It seems more like a drug than anything.

** Cheering charms? There was a fic where a spell had the incantation "orgasmo" or something similar.

*** On the one side, I can guess why. In the other side, that totally misses the opportunity to have characters yell out â€˜CHEERIO' at seemingly random times.

**** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element) which is a bad fic, at least for me, full of shit tropes and its a H/Hr, Harry uses by accident a spell that triggers a massive orgasm on Hermione during Auror Training, in a room full of other people. And they aren't even together by this point.

Later on, he uses it for real on her.

#+begin_quote
  Sixth year fic. Examines H/Hr in context of his unwanted wealth and fame, and her need for independence. H struggles for magical control over a mysterious, powerful fifth element, receives an inheritance and has a dalliance that ends in disaster.

** There was a throwaway line in Harry Potter and the Keystone Council that used a mild cheering charm in the revised wards on Privet Drive to create a Pavlovian response to Harry's presence so the Dursleys wouldn't hate being around him so much.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.
