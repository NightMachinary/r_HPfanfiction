You have spoken, this month's fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. I actually don't think I've read this before, despite its popularity.


** It was actually a fic I was looking forward to re-read. It's one of those stories that never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times I've read it. nonjon has a sort of flair for funny dialogue and comedic timing that manages to make jokes work without needing to tread into crack territory.

What I have mixed feeling about is the way the antagonists are nerfed to lighten the tone of the story. Not only in this fic but the author did it again in his other Firefly xover. While it does work, it just feels sort of cheap but thats just me. Either way this fic is definitely worth reading for anyone looking for a fun read.

** My biggest complaint about the story is that from the day [[/spoiler][Harry]] died to the day [[/spoiler][Neville]] died, Voldemort and the Death Eaters [[/spoiler][accomplished absolutely nothing]] despite the fact that [[/spoiler][That Fucker]] hadn't been interfering by then. We are simultaneously told that Voldemort [[/spoiler][wasnt strong enough to finish taking taking over Britain]] yet he's also [[/spoiler][much stronger and more collected than Harry's Voldemort]] at least if I remember correctly.

The rest of it is hilarious and enjoyable regardless of the few plot holes. [[/spoiler][Hermione's adventure]], the name pun scene in chapter 18, [[/spoiler][Harry and Sirius's sexcapades]], and my second favorite [[/spoiler][Bellatrix Lestrange]] (behind [[/spoiler][Delenda Est]] of course) are all great.

**** It just seemed...pointless? Sirius' characterization annoyed me, Harry wasn't interesting and didn't have interesting problems, [[/spoiler][bog-standard goblin visit, boring Dumbledore, artificial James and Harry conflict]], etc. And then I realized I was staring down the barrel of 230,000 more words and went, "meh." I eat 300k fics for breakfast (or at least finish them during elevenses) but this one was just too much to chew through.

So I stopped. Somewhere before the double-digit chapters. I'd pick it up every few months and have a similar result, until I stopped trying altogether. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] would update and I'd never go back to reading chapter eight, or whatever. I'd rather reread another fic, and I do like original humor fics, than to try again with /A Black Comedy/. For example, the much less skillfully written [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]]. It has life, it has plot hooks, it has hilarious sex magic, it has no ending to speak of. It /breathes/.

At no point did /A Black Comedy/ speak to me, saying why I should read on. And the writing, while competent, wasn't so skillful as to make me read it simply for that. It doesn't help that it is /clearly/ a humor and possibly even a parody fic, and nonjon didn't bother to mark it as such, which surprised me when I first read it. It seems to be the popular source of much that is /blah/ in the Harry and Sirius buddy fic genre, but is not the best or most refined example of that by far.

The dialog is forced, much of the time, and directed at punchy one-liners using a shotgun approach of throwing out all possible jokes, all the time. Which gets old after a while. People who try to do that in real life are annoying, and it is hard to take in large doses, especially when the plot is meant to be happening at the same time. With no let-up, the jokes fall flat and become monotone. There needs to be more to make it work. And there wasn't, that I saw.

So that's why I asked for people's positive opinions. What specifically makes this worth reading two novels worth of words? What gives it distinction, other than it being large, old, and popular? Does it get better half-way through? Like, /a lot better/?

***** It's not to everyone's tastes and people tend to either love the story or hate it. Personally, I've had the same problems you describe trying to get through /Sword of Gryffindor/ (which I find inane) or /Natural 20/ (which is boring), so I guess it's a matter of taste in the end.

/A Black Comedy/ is essentially a buddy-flick (the /Harold & Kumar/ films are the closest analogue I can think of) set in fanfiction form. Either you enjoy the bawdy humor and improbable escapades or you don't.

***** I appreciate your view, but I disagree. I liked the dialog, Sirius's character, Harry's interaction with Sirius, the whole thing. If you found that you couldn't stomach it, and it does seem like you've thought very thoroughly about it, then it's probably just not for you and there's not much I can change about that. Perhaps you might like it better when it gets into the [[/spoiler][Death Eater Bandits]] arc or [[/spoiler][Horcrux]] arc but a lot of it is sort of cracky. I appreciate you taking the time to actually point out the parts that you didn't like though.

I've loved bashy, cracky things before, but not this. It seemed like the most boring possible things to do with the concept. Just a venue for jokes and scenes the author found amusing, without a early, clear, overarching reason to care what was happening to anyone.

He didn't even know it was Harry, and thought he was a jerk, if I remember. I don't think that was Sirus. Anyway, it seemed to harald something that didn't impress me.

But maybe I was wrong about it not being worth reading futher. That's what I'm interested in with the evaluations of readers who've gone further. What happened that stood out to you, in those arcs you mentioned?

--------------

So starting with the interactions between Sirius, James, and Harry, as well as a bit of Remus, I think you have to consider who each of these people are.

Harry is the Man Who Conquered. He's smart, powerful, mature, and confident. He is, in many ways, a Sue, but throughout the story we see several times that he is not a God. He is resourceful, and does win in the end, but there is some struggle. The main thing you have to remember is that he is so lost after defeating his Dark Lord that he essentially waltzes through the Veil chasing his godfather.

Sirius is almost the exact opposite. You have to remember that just after losing his best friends, he is chucked into hell for 12 years. For over a decade he had zero happy thoughts and no human contact. Psychologically he is broken. When he gets out, he reverts to the child he was before the war: capable but immature. After barely two years of watching his godson's life go to hell, and being essentially locked up in his own home, he's sent to a different dimension. In this one, everyone he knows believes him dead, and there's nobody there for him. He's getting mental treatment, but it's probably not effective. He hides the fact that he's a broken man behind miles of goofiness.

James's third best friend betrayed his family causing him to have to bury his son and his best friend, while his remaining one (Remus) suddenly had a child to take care of (Tonks). Both men were forced to mature. They had to grow up, though James to a much greater extent than Remus. James hides the fact that he's a broken man by abandoning the Marauder persona. He becomes a mature, functioning adult parent and second highest official in the police force to block out the grief.

When Sirius first meets Remus, Remus is happy and healthy, but firmly on the fringe of wizarding society. Remus by now has little responsibility, and Tonks has become a capable adultery herself, so he is quickly able to revert to his immature self to be Moony to his best friend's Padfoot. When they meet James, Sirius expects Prongs, but instead he gets Assistant Director Potter. James simply can't be that person anymore, because he has responsibilities. In James' mind, the Marauders are dead, and that sort of immaturity reminds him of what got Sirius and his son killed. While Remus can sort of forget about their world's Harry being dead, James can't. Nothing can ever bring them back, neither his family, nor his humor. James' response is to call Sirius out and shame him, telling his son that this is what you shouldn't be doing.

Further, despite being a pureblood himself, James despises the pureblood politics that have brought about the Voldemort conflict and the deaths of his son and friends. Being the Assistant Director, all he has to deal with the majority of the time is purebloods getting away with crimes or demanding special treatment when they're victims. Remember the imperius defence in canon? Imagine dealing with that for 25 years.

Sirius, in turn, can't come to terms with the fact that James grew up. He wants his old life back, but can't have it. I think deep down, he knows this, but he has no one to force him to change. When Harry shows up, he's had time to grow up himself, yet he completely understands both men. He knows intimately that Sirius can't grow up and James was forced to.

When Harry meets James, Harry was defending himself from a Death Eater, but he probably didn't have the right to damage the man as he did, so Sirius brings up the fact that they're Lords. Bring in James. James right away realizes he's dealing with the fuckup that reminds him of his dead friend and another Lord that wants to use the discriminatory rules for his own benefit. How do you expect James to respond? James doesn't really hate Harry, he very much dislikes Lord Black and Lord Black. Thus his own prejudices make Harry out to be a "stuffy lord" even though we witnessed the action and there was no haughtiness or better-than-thou thrown at James' face.

Nearly everything I've now reiterated was told to you by Chapter 5, including the confrontation with James.

Those three characters, and how the interact with each other are colored by the events of the last 25 years, making them different people completely. At the end of the story, nonjon writes that in most stories, Sirius becomes Harry's James, and so he turned that on it's head by making Harry into Sirius's James. They became brothers instead of father/son.

Throughout the story, that dynamic keeps them going. Also that bog-standard goblin visit? Yeah Harry got what he wanted, which was to be Lord Black, but in fact they were not even remotely rich: 800 galleons plus Harry's roughly 50 galleons is all that's left. But the goblins don't just hand him billions of galleons and a dozen last names and powers.

And Harry doesn't just get his parents back. That's one major thing that sticks out to me, and it's for a very good reason which I will black out regardless of the above spoiler tag, as it's integral to the final arc of the story:

Harry's parents, those of his world, sacrificed themselves for him. Nothing Assistant Director James and Professor Lily Potter, 40+ year old parents of three could ever replace those. But it goes even further than that. [[/spoiler][Harry used his mother's blood protection to sacrifice her everlasting soul to finally defeat Voldemort.]] His AU parents can NEVER be his real parents. And this is horrifying to Harry. It scares him. Towards the end, he tells Lily that she can never tell anyone, and he swears he will go dark and kill everyone if it gets out. And the readers get the feeling he's being completely honest.

The reason Harry does this is to "restore the balance", something that is almost a noodle incident in that how it comes about is not really discussed, but it is said that the hero must sacrifice something to restore the balance. Harry's was a hollow victory, in that his sacrifice was deemed worthy, while Dumbledore sacrificed his ability to love, and the ability to have children was taken from him, as the previous was not worthy enough.

That stood out to me.

The Wizengamot scenes where Harry viciously tears apart the purebloods, espousing his belief that he's there to throw a wrench in everybody's plans, including stabbing a member nearly to death. He specifically says one of my favorite quotes "The short of it is that I consider it my civic duty to piss you all off." to which Sirius adds "So I will simply reiterate the shared opinions of the two Lord Blacks in my own words: Fuck you all very much. Thank you. And your mother twice."

And they proceed to mindfuck, and later, literally fuck, just about everybody.

The Bellatrix arc is incredibly interesting to me because she's obviously twisted, but Harry's (almost canon) desire for a family leads him to decide to agree to her request of sanctuary. That leads into the first conflict with Voldemort, and thus puts them firmly on the dark lord and Dumbledore's radars. That stood out to me, the characterization that Harry would help an undoubtedly evil woman, and Sirius would help the mirror image of his "killer", even if it was begrudgingly.

The revelation of Harry's animagus form, and the discovery of the horcruxes begin the second to last arc where Harry and Sirius seek them out. It took Ron, Hermione, and Harry six years to do what Harry and Sirius did in several weeks. Granted, most of those years were spent learning where each one was and what the traps were like, but still. The defenses of the few we saw were unique to this story, as it was written pre-DH, and quite amazing in my opinion. And then what he does with them: offering up an auction to draw out That Fucker.

The reveal of That Fucker's identity is such a poingnant scene that I really don't want to spoil it, as it's integral to the story, and the most unique portion of the story. People have done time travel, done different traps, had Harry have an au family, etc. etc. But nobody else has ever* [[/spoiler][had a horcrux find a host and become corporeal, which happens when Lucius sends the diary!crux to Neville, who then opposes Voldemort because Voldemort is not achieving their original goals]]. That blew my fucking mind. Gone, poof.

The After Dark Mark also makes me giggle, and I liked the fact that they stole a shit ton of muggle equipment from a bunch of magicals. The Hermione Adventure and what Harry discovers about her at the very end of that adventure is priceless, as is Luna's world-hopping dream.

There's a ton I'm missing I'm sure, and I know my grammar and formatting is atrocious but it's late and I'm going to bed. Hope this helps.

*After thinking about this again later, I realized that a lot of stories have used this, but none have specifically had [[/spoiler][a now-living soul piece oppose the fuller part of himself.]] [[/spoiler][Natural 20]] has something similar occur, as does [[/spoiler][Souls Abound]], but neither do the same thing after.

********** What I'm saying has more to do with a specific technical term about the writing. Its not a putdown. Most stories exist on a plot-driven to character-driven spectrum. Leaning more towards one or the other. These terms are subjective, of course. But this one is pretty straightforward.

Yes, but see how you didn't say much about what /the world/ did or how it changed as a result? Nowhere in here have you talked about the story without mentioning Sirius and Harry's growth as characters. To you, at least, it seems to be a character-driven story.

With a plot, of course, but its not about grand changes in the world. Or, at least that wasn't the greatest impact in your reading of it. As you say, with its characters, that makes the plot developments less interesting to me. I've read some Harry character studies that have been simply /amazing/, so that wasn't my only problem here. But it was a major one for me.

And again, thanks for all the details on your reading experience.

*********** Yeah I guess I didn't understand what you (and probably every literature buff ever) meant by "character driven". You're absolutely correct, it is very much focusing on the characters rather than plot. Hell, [[/spoiler][Harry's not even the 'hero'/'savior' in the end]]. I still think you should read it anyway. It's really not that long, and I know there's not enough good, frequently updating fanfics out there to keep you completely occupied. I'm sure you'd have a lot to legitimately complain about, given your dislike of the early Harry and Sirius, but still, some of the plot points are incredibly original and unique, and despite the fact that you no doubt read the spoilers in my above posts, they deserve to be read in their original format.

If not, well, I can only hope that next month's book club story brings us another good one to debate over =)

Actually, I just remembered something that I should have said in the previous post, but it's short and offers up something different than the other post.

What is the point of the story?

Sirius points this out early on, interestingly enough. They're trying to find their place in the world. It's that simple. Sirius is a convicted killer, Voldemort's right hand man, and Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived, and the Man-Who-Conquered. There's often a theme in fanfictions of Harry wanting to be "Just Harry" and that's present here in a different form.

They really can't go back to their own world, and not just because they don't know how. In their own world, they're essentially dead or too well known to ever have a peaceful life. Granted, in the story, they make their lives interesting anyway, but the point stands. Throughout the story Harry and Sirius are trying to be themselves, and not the hyphenated monikers they were given.

They become a family: first Remus and Tonks, then Bellatrix, then, finally, the Potters too.

Along the way, they become Lords who run roughshod over the Wizengamot, Death Eater Bandits that destroy the purebloods and Death Eaters, and eventually Horcrux Hunters that are critical in the defeat of Voldemort himself. There's a ton of cool magic, cracky humor, and amazing plot, and in the end, they create themselves a home. That's why this story is so great, because at the end, Harry can finally Live, and it's a much better life than Deathly Hallows. (which the author, who wrote this from before DH to after, did not include in the story)

****** The first time I attempted to read Sword of Gryffindor, probably back in 2009 or so, I thought it was simply porn and had +no+ little interest in it, but when I really started getting into fanfics, I read it completely and I do kinda have to agree with Time, at least on the comparison between the two. There is a lot more energy and activity in most of Clonserpents' stories, whereas Nonjon tends to write stories of inertia: something's going on the characters are kinda just going with the flow. In my opinion, though, Black Comedy beats out SoG anyway because it takes itself a little more seriously and isn't porn with plot. I can say, though, that while I find both enjoyable, I fully understand the reasoning behind disliking one over the other, or even hating both.
