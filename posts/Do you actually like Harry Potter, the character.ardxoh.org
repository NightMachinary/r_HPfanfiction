I've been subscribed to this reddit for a year and Harry doesn't seem to get the same reactions that other characters do. In a survey posted on this reddit, people chose Harry as their favorite character in a landslide. I just don't really see that reciprocated in the actual forum.

Harry's partners-in-crime, Ron and Hermione, can receive huge reactions. If you've been on this sub long enough, you could probably name a few people who defend or critique either of them. The same can be said for Snape and Dumbledore. Harry's actions and personality traits are not discussed nearly as much as the four I mentioned.

That doesn't necessarily mean that they're better characters. But, it does mean that they're more interesting or polarizing to discuss.

The closest thread I've seen recently that talked about Harry's traits was on why/if people think *Ron* had a bad influence on Harry or if *Ron and Hermione* were good friends to Harry. It's rare to see it be done the other way around. I've seen a few posts, but nothing major.

Even in fanfics, and even if we account for some of the extreme ways Ron and Hermione are treated, Harry is usually still the character most removed from his canon personality.

So, do you actually like Harry as a character?

How do you think his character compares to others?

** Harry is such a sarcastic little ass, it's hard not to like him. Unfortunately, that's the part of him most people forget when writing him, focusing more on his heroism or angst.

People really do seem to forget that and either focus on angst teenager phase or his heroism as you said.

** Harry has such a wide variety of characterisations in canon, more than any other character. Angry, angsty, determined, smart, happy, confident, etc. I definitely enjoy Harry as a character, but it's because he's without a doubt the character that can produce the most reaction from me. Whether that's happiness, sadness or frustration he evokes something.

** I adore Harry. I think people turn to fanfiction for expansion on secondary characters and themes, so that might be a lot of what you see here. Canon is all about Harry and I think people feel if they want Harry, they can reread the books.

Personally, I enjoy reading and writing stories that are more Harry-centric, but I think some folks have definite Harry fatigue.

So of the people who visit this sub, just 8.1% actively prefer fics which are not focused on Harry. Basically, the moment you choose to write a fic in which Harry is not the main character, you're facing an uphill battle to attract the 54.3% of the fandom who exclusively or actively prefer reading about Harry.

***** I think this sub is pretty representative of the fandom as a whole. If you look at fics sorted by favourites on FF.Net, for example, they are mostly Harry centric. Yes, there are prolific communities of people who are enthusiastic about non-Harry-centric fics. The numbers above don't rule this out: the 45.6% of people who equally or greater prefer non-Harry-centric is still a lot of people. It's just a lot smaller than the mainstream as represented on this sub.

The fact that people with niche interests have their own communities somewhat evidences the point: when exposed to the mainstream, people with niche preferences are overwhelmed by the numbers of people who have no interest in that material, so they seek about specialist communities where their preferences are the sole focus.

** His personality in canon is pretty divided I feel. From him caring about his friends, to being broody and angst-y, to not caring about what blood status you have, to having a sarcastic attitude, to having a saving people complex, to being an orphan to finding out that he was a Wizard.

There's so much that you can do with his character, but too many times I only see people focus on one or two of his traits. (Either the angst or hero saving; is the most often I see).

I was going to say he isn't my favorite character, but after really thinking about it, the other characters, their character development and interactions... yeah; I'd say that Harry is my favorite character. He's so interesting and a pretty complex/difficult character to write well.

** Personally I'm pretty neutral, leaning towards not caring, about Harry.

I didn't identify with any of the characters in canon so that's not the issue. Instead I think it's just that I find Harry incredibly boring, so I rarely have anything to say about him (for or against).

All the characters I have the most to say about are characters I either actively liked or disliked. With Harry I just don't really care.

** I love Harry, I dont think he's very realistic. He should be a barely functioning mess of neglect, ptsd, intimacy problems, Pavlovian bad habits (don't get better grades than your dumb af cousin or you will be punished) terrible stress responses, extreme instability (on account of having a bit of a madman's souls stuck to his face) and general lack of functionality as a member of society. He shouldn't be a decently well adjusted quiet kid who gets into trouble alot and will practically sacrifice his life for the first person he meets that shows an inkling of kindness to him.

Quite literally in spite all that, Harry Potter is one of the best fictional allegories for self determination and not letting your circumstances define you. Which is an incredible message on its own, completely disregarding all the other positive messages in the series. (Love is something that can save you from darkness, even the most twisted villain was once just a child like you and could have been helped, etc.) For this reason and a few others, I love Harry despite how unrealistic he is.

However, that same un-realism also makes it kind of hard to discuss his traits the same way we do the others, as we do that by contrasting their actions with their words, their beliefs with their behaviours, their circumstances with their responses, etc... and Harry doesn't respond like the others do because of how unrealistic he is.

We don't discuss harry like we do with others, because the same type of discussion would be entirely useless to analyze his character.

** I think that he is uninteresting as a protagonist. In canon, Harry was designed to have the setting revolve around him, and without that, he has little to offer. Take away the Prophecy and the destiny (even if he is still an orphan), and Harry would be content to spend his time hanging out with friends, playing Quiddich, and maybe occasionally standing up for someone being bulled: a wholesome character, but a fairly ordinary one. He is Horatio, not Hamlet, in other words. There's a reason why fics that do something non-Voldemort-related with him tend to rewrite his character to the point of being unrecognisable.

** Honestly, I'm ambivalent. I have nothing /against/ Harry, I'm just not particularly interested in reading more about him. He had all of canon, focussed on him. Also, he was not the character I most identified with - the one who was my place marker in the world. Whether that is because I am female, or because I was well into adulthood before reading the books I don't know. All I know is a story featuring Harry would not be a deal breaker but it isn't a drawcard either, there are other characters I would rather read about a lot more.

** Harry is kinda difficult to judge because he has several directions in which he is developed and none bar one are carried out consequently. There are:

- The poor, abused orphan

- The hero who takes up arms when the need arises

- The boy who is thrust into a situation way beyond his abilities

- The born leader

- The broody teen

- The Messiah who lays down his own life without second thought

I like most of these bar the last one. The broody teenager might be annoying to read, but it is believable if not overdone. The Dursley abuse should have some consequences on him, but there is no need to exaggerate the canonical abuse.

If Harry has to die, give him some epic death like Leonidas. Give him a strong position and throw waves after waves of Death Eaters at him. Have him kill Bellatrix and Dolohov before finally going down. Maybe some sacrificial bomb defence like Virmire (ME1).

*** Its been a while since I've read the books, but from what I recall each book effectively had a different Harry. Which does make sense to a degree considering how old he is and that he goes through a lot of stuff, but it doesn't entirely feel like the progression of a single character.

Additionally there are the issues that come from JKR's writing style, and the fact that Harry is somewhat hollow to act as a PoV character.

But Harry in fanfic is tricky... there are many, MANY fics that I've read and enjoyed immensely, but off the top of my head I can't think of even one that perfectly captures Harry, IMO.

** I like Harry's story and potential he had as a character, 'cause he could improve himself and explore the new world around him as he had a great motivation to do so. What I didn't like is he actually did nothing. Voldemort was after him during all Harry's youth, but he didn't study, or do some specific trainings or even explore Voldemort himself as an actual threat. I argue that all success he had was due to his incredible luck and help of other people. How far would he go without Hermione (oh, yes, this is my girl, I absolutely adore her) who really think about the problem and reasonably tries to make Harry and Ron study and be aware of the saspicios items (like the broomstick from Sirius on the third year). Ok, back to the topic, I kinda like Harry, however I'm quite disappointed that he didn't do a lot of things he should have. I mean, you know, even before the prophercy was revealed, that there is a guy who wants to kill you, no matter why - DO SMTH TO PROTECT YOURSELF THEN. Or even earlier then Harry just learnt about the Wizarding world. Why didn't he explore it, just because of simle curiocity, like Hermione did? Why didn't he actually ask anybody abiut his own parents? I din't like how passive and hotheaded he is. Maybe it's just my specific taste and I simply favour another type of characters. But I still love reading the original books and fics about Harry (that's why I'm here, ha). And I love how protective and loyal Harry is) I guess, it sounded like I don't like him at all but I do, just not as much as others. Hah, he is quite a controversial character, isn't he?

** I think Harry is overall the blandest and weakest-characterized character in the series... but I also think that this is by design. Harry doesn't get a very strong personality because he's the reader-insert, the one that the audience is not only meant to identify with, but the one they experience the wizarding world through. He's not QUITE as personality-less as some "reader insert characters," but compared to just about any other character in the franchise he isn't very interesting.

But I think Harry is a very SUCCESSFUL reader-insert. Fans really do identify with him, to the point where they instantly forgive or ignore any of his flaws. I think that's why people are much quicker to condemn Ron and Hermione... and why so few people ever even consider whether Harry is actually a good friend to them or not. I mean, Harry certainly never does... he has a remarkable lack of self-insight in that he in general demands a whole lot more from others than he's willing to give back.

One thing that strikes me as REALLY illustrating this is that... Harry never apologizes for anything. It never even seems to occur to him that maybe he should, even after he's been pretty horrible. Both times when he and Ron reconciliate, Ron is all apologetic and ready to take all the blame, but Harry (who was actually the nastier one in GOF, and in DH did not have the excuse of wearing the Horcrux when he hurled insults at Ron) never even seems to consider that he has anything to apologize for. And the readers, likewise, just hold him completely blameless... probably because when Harry doesn't acknowledge being in the wrong, the readers don't have to either.

*** ... Why should Harry have apologized? In GoF, Ron is the one who instigated the entire conflict because of his jealousy (and IIRC, Harry cuts Ron off and tells him to forget about it before he can get any elaborate apologies in); in DH, likewise, Ron starts shit when the Horcrux gets to him out of nowhere, then abandons his friends to face a dangerous mission alone (and that whole scene where he comes back addresses Ron's insecurities and has Harry specifically reassure him, too.)

I don't want to demonize Ron by any means--- he's a teenage boy, and it'd be pretty boring if his friendship with Harry never had any conflict--- but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say Harry should've had to apologize for... not having saintly patience in the face of Ron's provocation. At other points during the series, like when he's snapping at everyone in OotP, he does get called out for it, so I'm genuinely confused by this--- lucky kid def has the benefit of plot armor at times, but when he's acting like an asshole, the narrative acknowledges it.

**** Why should Harry have apologized? Oh, I don't know... Harry was the one snapping and calling Ron names... Harry was the one who blew up at Ron and threw "POTTER STINKS" badges at him when Ron was obviously showing up because he was worried about Harry, and then telling him "maybe you'll get a scar, that's what you want, isn't it?!" Harry was by far the nastier person. Ron mainly just pulled away and refused to talk to him. At first Ron even tried to pretend he didn't mind, but Harry got pissy because Ron didn't immediately be 100% supportive like he always was. Yeah, can't think of ANY REASON why Harry should apologize for that.

In DH, Harry is the one who tells Ron to leave. Twice. He's the first to hurl insults, and the one who insists that Ron get out, only telling him to leave the Horcrux.

Yes, Harry was under a lot of stress. But saying he has nothing to apologize for is stretching it.
