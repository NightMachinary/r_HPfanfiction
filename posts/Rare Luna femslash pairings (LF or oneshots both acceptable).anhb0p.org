I've exhausted all the well known Luna/Hermione stuff I think, so is there like any Luna/Tonks Luna/Fleur Luna/Pansy or even... Luna/Bellatrix??(pls don't judge me lol :P ) just any rare femslash pairings with Luna you know of will do, LF or oneshots just well written and not completely smut based are fine. will even take Luna with orgional female character if its well written.


** Care to share the Luna/Hermione ones with me? I'm a huge Luna fan

  Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

  While patrolling the castle one evening Hermione runs into a certain someone or rather falls over a certain someone. A rather odd someone in fact, who is in need of a little help.

** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10679768/1/The-Turned-Page][this Luna/Narcissa one]], mostly because Luna is so perfectly Luna in it.

**** Well, it's really rare. That's the only fic I could think of, to be honest, which is sad because I think Luna would be much more likely to be forgiving towards Narcissa than Hermione after the War, but Cissamione is a lot more popular (not that I'm complaining about that, just wish there was more investment in Luna).

***** I've gotten very little response to this thread over all so it looks like Luna has very little femslash parings outside of Ginny :( I think its because Luna is too hard to write for people which is a shame...i just want Luna to have a cute girlfriend is that too much to ask people??? ahaha
