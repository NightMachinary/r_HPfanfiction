** Sometimes it's nice to read some silly, objectively bad stuff either to 'cool off' from intense objectively good novels, or just because 'its so bad it's good'.

Am I always and only reading it? God no. Am I occasionally reading a horribly trope filled illiterate mess for fun? Hell yeah.

All of this. All of HP fanfic or otherwise, is about entertainment. Enjoy it in whatever way entertains you.

** I dislike bashing fics, but I still wanted to comment on this because I used to argue with bashers (bad idea, don't do it). OP, when you write that the bashed character is super exaggerated and doesn't resemble themselves, the bashers don't see it that way. They 100% believe the bashed version IS the character from the books. You can show them all the quotes from the books that support your argument and contradict theirs, but they don't want to change their minds. They'll frequently insult you for bringing up direct quotes. One thing I noticed when getting into these arguments is that we weren't even arguing about the same character: our perspectives on a character were so different that they might as well have been two entirely different characters.

To give an example, Ron is frequently bashed. His abandonment of Harry in GoF and DH is brought up as a reason bashers hate Ron and as proof that Ron is an awful friend/would turn on Harry in an instant. If you try to point out that Ron also defended Harry from a believed mass murderer while his leg was broken in PoA or that he saved Harry's life when Harry almost drowned in DH, they act like it never happened. They want to ignore anything that contradicts their beliefs on purpose (describes people in general).

OP, you answered your own question: they hate x character. That's all there is to it.

â€‹

Edit: I wanted to clarify, I never argued about bashing on a fic that was labelled as a bash fic/bashed character. It was only in stories or posts were the writer was under the impression that they were being 100% true to the books.

*** I guess my frustration with it is often I may dislike a character or certain things they did. So I would assume I'd like a bashing fic. But often the action that I wanted called out or the character gets way too exaggerated. And I can't feel the catharsis I'd want from seeing a certain character "bashed" because the character im seeing bashed doesn't resemble the character i was frustrated at in the first place.

Like for example let's say I want Molly to be called out for the whole argument she had with Sirius. I thought that moment was a bit cruel. I want some other adult to call her out with more force than in canon. Id say the desire for that falls into bashing territory.

But if you characterize her as cartoonishly evil plotting to freeload of Sirius and dose Harry with a love potion I feel like I'm no longer calling out the same character so it doesn't really work as bashing for me .

So I wondered if I was missing something here but I guess we disagree on either characterization or want different intensity of bashing?

**** You probably want different intensity of bashing.

This circles back to what it means to dislike a character or their actions. Does someone who dislikes a character want that character to recognize their wrongdoing, apologize, and promise to do better or do they want that character to suck? Usually, the latter, which is why the bashed characters are given characteristics to make them suck even more.

Let's stick with Molly as an example, but a different scene than yours. Remember when Molly believed Rita Skeeter's cruel libel about 14 year-old Hermione? She was 100% in the wrong. I dislike that. I can make a fic where Molly gets called out, is ashamed, apologizes to Hermione, and then, when she starts to dislike Fleur, is called out again, but this time uses her past experience to change her actions (and convinces Ginny and Hermione to change their actions too). This wouldn't be bashing because it involves character growth, but people who dislike Molly aren't really looking for this sort of fic. On the other hand, I could write a fic where Molly slut shames Ginny (and Lavender and Cho). She never does this in canon, but if I want to emphasize Molly being harsh to a teenage girl for alleged dating habits, I would give her more instances where this happens. The problem is, it would stop feeling like Molly from the books after some point because Molly wasn't that harsh. She'd start to feel "cartoonishly evil," as you put it.

If you really know what you're looking for in a fic, try requesting something super specific here on this sub instead of just a bash fic in general. You might get better results that way.

** I like bashing and redemption arcs a lot. For example think of pretty much any long-running teenage drama such as Gossip Girl or Beverly Hills 90210 (god, I can't believe I'm actually using those examples)... every now and then a character will turn really shitty in one season even if they were beloved in the previous one. And then towards the end they'll realize the error of their ways and become likable again. Or OK, think "A Song of Ice and Fire"/"Game of Thrones"... Theon turns on his protectors, suffers for it but then makes up for it. That's the only trope that I like in bashing fics.

**** Edit (since my edit button doesn't seem to work rn): to clarify, I'm OK with character bashing as long as they learn the error of their ways. After all, we've all been teenagers and therefore bashed characters in the eyes of our parents but we grew out of that. I think it's a character development process that should be more often employed as long as the character learns a lesson from their shitty behavior. If they don't then it means the author really hates that character and I don't really like that. I hate many characters but I love to make it a point from looking at things from their perspective.

*** Ok so question

If the character gets highly exaggerated does it still remain effective for you as a bashing fic? Or is there a point you've noticed where it no longer works as a bashing fic for you because of how much they exaggerate a character?

** I love Harry bashing. He treats almost everyone in the series like shit, and I don't like that. I also hate how almost every story is Harry-centric even when it doesn't need to be. For example, there are a lot of stories where Voldemort doesn't exist and Harry is /still/ the protagonist. Why? What need is there for that? Why can't it be Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Neville, or literally any other character besides him? Why does he have to do literally everything even when it's extremely OOC?

At first, I liked fanfics where he faced consequences and grew as a person, but I hated bashing him. After I read those fanfics and realized that was almost always a set up for OP!Harry, I turned to bashing. I don't really care who's bashed along with him, unless it's all of Gryffindor or something like that.

I rarely read fanfics bashing him now though, since bashing fanfics give me headaches if I read them too much.

*** I don't really hate Harry but I do get tired of the main cast or main character.

Like Harry and Hermione are usually the protagonists or a major friend character in alot of stuff. So I like to see fics where thats not the case.

** Yeah, i have no idea why people like this stuff. It's bad enough when Ron acts like a selfish moron in canon so why would you want him to be worse? Ron can be awesome so why exaggerate his worst traits???

*** I mean I've read many Ron bashing that exaggerated his negative traits and it felt like the author just didn't like the character.

But I've also read some where the bashable version of Ron kinda stops resembling Ron. So if you just hate the character I don't know how cathartic bashing this version of him will be because it doesn't really feel anything like Ron anymore. But this weird Ron does make a effective villain for the fic the author has. So makes me wonder if bashing the character to feel catharsis was really the point at all.
