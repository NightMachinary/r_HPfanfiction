I appreciate the minimalism in [[/r/HPfanfiction]]'s flairs. A lot of subreddits go overboard.

But something I'd like to see more of, and I can't imagine many people will disagree, are reviews. They're refreshing, and go beyond a simple recommendation. Especially those which are negative, which /certainly/ shouldn't be considered as a 'Recommendation', despite the fact that the flair is the most apt choice for such a topic.

It's also distinct enough from the others that it would add no additional confusion (like Fic Search and Reqeust do).

Does anyone have any thoughts that I haven't mentioned? Disagree?


** While we're looking at flairs, there may be an opportunity to reduce confusion for newcomers by renaming Request and Fic Search, to make it clear that the first is looking for recommendations, and the second is looking for a specific fic.

So, maybe something like "Seeking recommendations" or "Search by topic" for the first. And "Specific fic search" or "What's that fic?" for the second. Or if people have better ideas?

To be honest, the only reason that I haven't is that I couldn't think of any alternatives, myself.

** Yes please. This came from my review of A Black Comedy, which was not a positive review, but I didn't have a more appropriate flair to put on it. All the options seemed misleading. I would like to see a flair option for Review.

** Sites that host fanfiction have review systems in place. The reviews are organized and directly linked to the story, down to the chapter. The reddit bot provides direct access to the story. Unsure how much another level of review would improve things beyond saving a few link selections.

As an author, I prefer reviews that are posted on the site hosting the story. Combined with story traffic statistics, it is more evident that the reviewer actually read the entire work. This helps to calibrate review comments with respect to writing improvement.

Maybe the reddit bot could somehow aggregate those reviews?

*** Except, those reviews are mostly not reviews, and when I actually write one (i.e., it contains even some criticism) I get incredibly rude replies like “If you don't like it, don't read it”, “How dare you say something negative about the story”, etc. Usually, it is not even from the authors themselves, but from other readers.

I understand there are plenty of people who make rude and /ad personam/ comments on other peoples' stories (even [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfbw0n/lf_where_harry_has_to_turn_up_to_not_embarrass/eld5hxp/?context=3][here]], and yes somebody stood up for me, thanks), so many authors are easily offended, but it is not helpful.

If there was a forum, where real reviews were welcomed, and commented by other people interested in improving fanfiction stories, it would be awesome. So far, I just write mostly on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/tag/harrypotter.html][my blog]], but of course nobody reads it there.

*** Those reviews are largely useless. The vast majority are along the lines of "great chapter, can't wait for more", and not something actually useful as a review for someone trying to decide if the story is for them.

I have rarely used the reviews on ffn.net, and the few times I did I was burned by reviewers who said things like "great writing," but seemed to miss the glaring grammar, spelling, and other issues the first 3 paragraphs had.

**** Most "reviews" don't help the author either, other than motivation. Don't get me wrong, I love a pat on the back from readers (writers can be vain creatures) but it is even better to get some real feedback from readers. On my current story, maybe 5/25 are substantive replies, and I consider myself lucky having that many.

I love each and every reader who leaves a kind comment, but let's not pretend most of them are reviews. Comments, yes. Reviews, no.

** It would be interesting to have a separate flair for reviews. I do wonder how this would end. Before reading a story, I sometimes check the reviews and get frustrated by 'great chapter' and similar ones. I also wonder how authors would react to criticism. I've seen a popular author making it clear on their profile that they accept only positive reviews. Another author got very upset when a lot of people said that their Mc was out of character. As someone who is sensitive to criticism, I see their point, but the problem is that there will always be people who dislike something in a story and will tell the author so. I try to tell the author what I liked and disliked because 'aww' isn't a review. So I do wonder if this won't turn into some sort of fanfic civil war. I love the idea and am curious to see if it comes to fruition.

** In general yes, but you would need people that can be objective to this. Most of fanfiction you like is because of personal favourites, not how good the story actually is. A reviewer would need to do it the other way, otherwise it would just be recommendations again or reflecting your likes and dislikes and therefore would not give us anything. A good review can and should recommend a trope that I do not like, if the one story is really good and brings quite a bit more that just that trope. For that can make good story. And at the same time they should warn of stories that just fulfill the trope wishes. So might find something you want to read (our guilty pleasures). But the we won't expect more of it.

*** Even professional reviewers are influenced by their personal likes and dislikes, I don't see why that should be any different here.

Way more important is that a review must contain reasons for why the reviewer finds a fic good or bad instead of just saying "this fic is good, read it".

*** While that may be true for the fics that you like, I do feel that one can be rather objective about the ones that you're don't like too, but can objectively reflect that it's not a terrible fic, but you just don't like it /shrugs/
