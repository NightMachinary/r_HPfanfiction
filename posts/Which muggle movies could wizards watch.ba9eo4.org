So, someone getting tech to work at hogwarts and showing movies is a surprisingly common trope that I've found multiple times. But which movies could wizards with almost no knowledge of the muggle world understand and enjoy?

Anything in a normal everyday setting wouldn't be a normal everyday setting for the wizards.

Scifi would be hard to understand if they don't know normal tech.

A historical setting where knowing about it is important to understand the plot might not be ideal either.

Fantasy would cause trouble if the movie magic is totally unlike real magic.

A Disney movie without any humans in it like Lion King would probably require the least explanation.

A movie in a semi-historical setting with little tech and a few fantasy elements like Pirates of the Carribean might work, but that movie wasn't created yet in the 90s when the books happen.

Star Wars? Maybe, a Dark Lord with an evil empire and flying ships throwing killing curses at each other aren't too difficult to wrap your head around.

What other movies do you suggest for hogwarts cinema?


** Ancient history settings would probably do well since they have that in-common. So movies like The Gladiator, Troy, etc. would be good bets.

Modern history, like you said, would probably take too much explaining of the relevant context. War movies might be an exception though since they're generally pretty straightforward. So skip the historical dramas, but show them Saving Private Ryan.

Semi-historical soft-fantasy settings like you said would probably be OK. The less detailed the magic is the better; too much and they'll start nitpicking, so keep it on the mysterious and mystical side. Things like Pirates of the Carribean, The Mummy, Indiana Jones, etc. would be good.

Cultural mainstays like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are must-see if only so they can start getting all the references.

Anything Disney or Shakespearean should be good since they're so universal. Character-driven romance is probably a generally safe bet for the same reason.

I'd probably avoid comedies like the plague since they're hit-or-miss even when you've got the cultural context to enjoy them. Monty Python might be an exception though.

I'd also avoid most plot-oriented action movies since they tend to involve too much modern context for them to make sense to a wizard. Plot-free action like monster-movies might be OK.

Sci-fi is iffy. On the one hand you've got Clarke's Law, on the other, you've got major context issues. I'd be very selective of what sci-fi movies to show them. Some would probably work fine with minimal explanation/contextualizing (War of the Worlds, and other classics since their original audiences weren't so different) while others would be too alien (The Matrix, and basically anything technology- or computer-focused).

This whole endeavor might get easier after showing them more movies for them to build context from, so don't count something out completely as it might be viable for a later showing.

**** Even 25% of the audience thought it was a real event.

The realism of that movie is truly impressive.

** 1939 Wizard of Oz. E.g., Petunia talks post-DH with Potters (H&G) and calls Bellatrix Lestrange (when told the story how Ginny's mum killed her) without much thinking automatically “The Wicked Witch of the West”. Harry (who sneaked in many years ago and watched the movie on TV) gots the reference, Ginny is completely confused and the hilarity ensues (“Of the West? Is she from Ireland? Would Seamus know her?”, “That's a pitty we didn't know it was her, we could just pour a bucket of water on her...”, etc.).

** The Black Cauldron Shrek Shrek 2 Shrek 3: Electric Bugallow Hercules Knights Tale Fifth Element The Twilight Movies, but only if Cedric is in attendence Love Actually, but only with Snape there Rudolph, any of them Frosty the Snowman Neverending Story Any of the British Historical War Movies: Charge of the Light Birgade, Waterloo, the Afganistan one, I think Rouke's drift is one. Merlin Dune The Great Mouse Detective Dead and loving it Airplane!, this is probably the best one to explain the modern world to them.
