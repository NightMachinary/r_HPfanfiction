** My favorite one is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12775205/1/][Final Protocol]], linkffn(12775205). Susan's work ethic and loyalty is very well depicted, even though she's not the smartest and the most powerful person in the room.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12775205/1/][*/Final Protocol/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/116880/Lord-Silvere][/Lord Silvere/]]

#+begin_quote
  Susan Bones, permanent nurse and bodyguard to the comatose Harry Potter, is commanded to execute the Order's final protocol. As hoped, Harry and Susan are transported to the past. But, Harry's recovery is only partial, so Susan must add to her duties the role of foot soldier as the two use their knowledge of the future against Voldemort. H/S. Time Travel. Subtle Soul Bond

*** Note this one is in progress and slow to update, but does update. The author does have a good sense of suspense and pacing.
