It's an awesome fic and definitely a new favourite but it's soooo good that I somehow can't find another fanfiction that grabs my interest.

The fact that I actually liked it is quite surprising to me. Before I discovered ShayaLonnies fanfictions I couldn't stand time travel fics and certain pairings she writes. You now can call me proselytized.

If you happen to know a fanfiction that's able to compete with this one. Please let me know.

Edit: Of course I made a mistake in the title which I can't correct. Should be "The Debt of Time".


** I've been there and I'm here to tell you that there are comparable works! It depends on what you liked about it and you didn't really elaborate on that, so here's some random fics that I really love (and I also loved Debt of Time).

flamethrower's Of a Linear Circle is an epic. And it's so worth it. It's technically still in progress but you could stop at the last installment and feel perfectly content that it's wrapped up.

Endrina's The Language of Flowers series is also so well-done. It's long and totally engrossing.

I love many of Colubrina's fics - they won't link using the bot so some favorites include: Rebuilding, The Muddy Princess, Protective Custody, The Green Girl

I also added some favorites from other authors, ymmv because it depends on what you really like. But if you want to add details I can potentially recommend others. These are just top of my head things you might like if you liked DoT.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.This story was originally posted to Fanfiction.net in 2015 and is complete. It started off non-betaed, picked up FluffPanda, and then The Dragon and the Rose, Dutchgirl01, and Flyby Commander Shepard. It was a labour of love.

** One Hundred and Sixty-Nine is excellent if you're looking for Hermione centric time travel.

For time travel in general, you can't go wrong with Realignment. It's probably not what you're expecting and while I'd love to see a companion fic written from a certain different PoV, it's gaining in popularity for a very good reason.

And, of course, the story that I'm convinced is the best of the bunch: Grey Space. Sorry Flamethrower - I love Nizar to pieces (Of a Linear Circle), but Noaacat wins.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

*** Thanks, I'll look into these.

As for the bot: depending on which site the ficton hosts you just write linkffn or linkao3 and write the title + author in brackets.

Linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger by OracleObscured)

Sometimes the title alone is enough too. (Let's try)

Linkao3(Pride of Time)

There are more ways to link fanfiction. For more information click on "usage" at the end of a post from the bot.

Feel free to try out to link the other ones. If you want to do that in your original comment you can edit it and comment *ffnbot!refresh* so the bot looks for new commands in your edited comment.
