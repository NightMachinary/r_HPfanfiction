:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
trying to find a time travel fic where harry is back in his hogwarts years and he has ptsd from the war. (I think specifically he freezes up when someone touches him? I'm not too sure) he got closer to neville and subconsciously avoids ron because he keeps triggering his ptsd unintentionally.

i think this fic also involved harry getting locked in his gringotts vault for funsies and definitely not so he can swap out the philosopher's stone but I could be mistaken

send help?


** ?

What kind of fics are you looking at?

*** i found it a few days ago! although I realized it wasn't so much as a time travel fic as it was a crossover. it's an atla x hp work that placed zuko as harry potter. its still a good read although the second book is unfinished. here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17369354/chapters/40872911][Zuko and the Philosophical rock]]

Two realities a little to the left of Canon.\\
In one, a hero dies before he has a chance to even play his part.\\
In another, Zuko is struck by his sister's lightening on the Day of Sozin's Comet, and finds himself before the Spirits, who have an offer for him:\\
If he want's to see his own destiny through, first, he'll need to achieve the incomplete destiny of the Boy-Who-Lived.

(Or:\\
Harry gives up on living the day before his Hogwarts Letter arrives, and his magic stops keeping him alive.\\
Scrambling to save the reality he's left behind, Destiny Repair brings in another gloomy 'hero' to play Harry Potter in his stead.\\
Armed with no script and only a vague idea of what's going on, Zuko does his best to not screw up.)
