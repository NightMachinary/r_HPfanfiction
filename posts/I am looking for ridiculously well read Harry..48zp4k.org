** I would be interested to see this as well but I doubt there will be much. The problem presented is that for the characters to be well read the author also needs to be so. You can't have intuitive leaps and references if the person writing doesn't know them.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2918348/Stanrick][Stanrick]] has a Harry who makes several references to works of literature. The author stops short of making him any more academically inclined than his canon counterpart, though.

** Its kind of sad your asking for a well read harry, if you were just asking for a harry that references things, there appears to be a type of story emerging where there set in modern times and harry makes quite a few references to memes and the like. I think part of your problem might be that generally hermione fills the "nose-buried-in-a-book" personality, so people generally don't write harry that way.

*** I'll take well read Hermione as well, I haven't exactly seen that either. The way Hermione is portrayed in the books and in most fanfics is generally nebulously 'smart' without any substance to back it up. We are informed that she is smart, but she doesn't actually act smart most of the time.

Why is it sad that I am asking for well-read Harry anyway? I don't think it's pathetic to want to read a protagonist who is well read, it's usually interesting.

**** I think he's saying sad because your request, while similar to many fics, is different enough of a request that it not nearly so answerable. Not that you are sad/pathetic for requesting what you did.

**** I don't know that Hermione is meant to be smart, per say, I think it's more she had pushy parents who named her because they 'thought it sounded clever', and who worked hard because she hoped being clever would gain other people's approval/friendship. So I agree with you. If she'd grown up like me, not a smart kid, but just a wide reader who liked reading, she'd have known who Flamel was, and the Cerberus thing, and lots of other things we sitting on the other side of the page from her, bouncing up and down, hissed the answers to at her. Her trouble was she didn't read for the love of it, or because she had a thirst for knowledge, but because she wanted to know things that would help other people. If she knew all about Hogwarts, and magic, she could help other new students, and become friends with them, and if situations came up, she could help her new friends, and rescue them. That lie about going after the troll - what kid would think up a lie like that? Why not, I got separated and lost, or I didn't go to the feast, or I had left the hall to go to the bathroom? Because using her knowledge about trolls to save other students is exactly what Hermione /would/ do.

That's why she was Gryffindor, and not Ravenclaw. I think. That's why her grades were so important to her, because without them, her parents were disappointed, and she was just another lonely loser.

***** That actually seems like a pretty accurate summation of Hermione's Character from the books. It explains why she is always the one who owns useful items and knows useful spells but she doesn't make good decisions.

I can't help but feel that her character was meant to be smart and wise and Mary-Sueish by J.K. Rowling. It's hard to tell because most characters in the books don't act how humans would act and they don't have any logical decision making skills, so it seems that she is so much smarter than the rest when she makes a reasonable decision. It's especially noticeable in book three when Hermione treats Harry and Ron as total retards when she deals with the firebolt broom and when they can't figure out what could be wrong with lupin, which is justified only because they act like retards and so she seems smart in contrast.

To be honest I wouldn't be friends with somebody so condescending.

It's really hard figure her out, because she is mostly a plot device to deliver exposition and to solve problems that Harry couldn't solve so she magically either has useful knowledge and rational thought or she doesn't depending on what the plot needs.

****** I don't think J.K worked on expanding and developing her as much as she could have, certainly.

Poor Hermione had no social skills, and I'm not really sure why not. Perhaps her magic created a bridge between her and other children, or perhaps her parents were Katie Hopkins-like. Whatever the case, she ended up always trying to prove herself as superior to the others, thinking that they'd like her because she was clever, or at least admire her. And they didn't, she was just the lonely nerd no one liked, but then she found a purpose - saving the Boy Who Lived. She couldn't just live her life like the boys did, enjoying Quidditch and stuff, because she had to have a purpose, something to offer the wizarding world.

I guess that's why it's Hermione/Ron, and not H/H, because to her, Harry was someone who gave her a purpose, a usefulness, a status. She loved Ron because he made her a person, and nothing more. He didn't need her, he just liked and then loved her.

I think that's the difference between her and Luna. Both were pretty similar - Luna was Ravenclaw, so obviously clever, both were rejected and made fun of for their knowledge. Hermione learned because she needed to be able to help, to save, to protect, to be worth something, whereas Luna just needed people to like her for who she was. I think that's why the Hat chose Gryffindor.

Your last part pretty much sums her up. We wouldn't know half the stuff we did about Hogwarts if we didn't have Hermione quoting Hogwarts: A History in the background.

HPMOR Harry sees quite a few pop culture and literary references. Not to the extreme like you are indicating you want, but a good number anyway.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** I wish people would use the downvote button properly. It means "this post does not belong here as it's not answering the question", not "I don't like this story even though it fits the criteria OP is asking for".

HPMoR has a lot of shout-outs, which are listed [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality][here]], but Harry also explicitly thinks in tropes at several points, directly comparing characters to other fictional characters or tropes.
