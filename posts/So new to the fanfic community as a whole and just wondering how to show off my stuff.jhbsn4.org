I will preface this by saying that I've never really delved into fanfic before. I played a HP themed game of DND and the people I played with seemed to like my character so I started writing about him. soon enough there were some companions and it got a little out of hand. I'm just looking for some place to pass the stories along and hope that people enjoy them but it doesn't seem like ACTUAL fan fic gets posted here so I was wondering where best to post and promote it.


** The two main places are fanfiction.net and archive of our own

**** Yes you can. We even have a flair for it. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/flair#wiki_5._self-promotion]])

As for not getting lost in the shuffle, I'm not really sure what you're looking for. It's the nature of Reddit that posts eventually fall off the front page.

***** Yeah and it's a big big fandom, with a lot of people writing, so everything is lost in the shuffle. The biggest way not to be lost is to not post everything at once, but do so on a regular basis, to build up readership

use your tags well too, so that the people who want tot read something like you're writing will easily be able to find it
