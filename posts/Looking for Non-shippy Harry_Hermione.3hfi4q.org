I'm looking for Harry/Hermione fics that meet the following criteria:

- No early declaration of love. If they do use the words "I love you", it should be near the end of the fic.

- No "justification" of their relationship (i.e. a section where one or more characters go through reasons for why Harry and Hermione are compatible, or effectively present "canon evidence" to the reader to sell the pairing/put down other pairings).

- Harry doesn't dominate Hermione to the point where she's just arm candy. She should have her own ambitions, desires and beliefs, and disagree with Harry on certain things.

- Hermione doesn't dominate Harry to the point where she's more his mother than girlfriend. Harry should be able to tell her "no", to assert himself and his beliefs.

- No "recovering from abuse" Harry, or over-abundance of angst in general.

- Harry should not suddenly be inexplicably timid, nor be obsessed with weird neckbeardy ideas of sexual purity or "girls don't want to be looked at in a sexual way" fedora-tipping. Basically, Harry should not be winning girls' affections by acting like a eunuch around them.

- Harry and Hermione should not get together at the start of the fic and remain together with only token conflict for the rest of the story. Either their getting together should be the climax of the fic, or they should have genuine and significant disagreements which threaten the survival of their relationship. (Note: not romcom-esque miscommunication disagreements but genuine issues of incompatibility that have to be worked through via compromise and serious evaluation of expectations from life and the relationship).

- The fic should have them act like realistic teenagers, i.e. horny and curious about sex, but also nervous about it. Faux sexual innocence and unrealistic sexual prowess are equally off-putting.

- No bashing, and in particular no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. Harry and Hermione should stay friends with Ron.

- Canon-ish characterisations in general.

- Harry-centric.

- It's okay if the relationship doesn't last the entire fic and they break up.

- No conversation where Hermione says she's ugly and Harry convinces her she's beautiful.

- No Muggle-wank.

Bonus points for:

- A canon-compatible, realistically talented Harry.

- If it's a long fic, Harry and/or Hermione having other relationships before they get together.

- Interesting, canon-compatible magic.

- If it's a long fic, good non-romance content (i.e. either a good Voldemort plot or some smaller scale Hogwarts-related plot, maybe even a drama, so long as it's not oriented around Harry and Hermione's relationship).

- Harry and Hermione experimenting physically as friends before they develop romantic feelings (and said romantic feelings being one-sided could be the source of the conflict).

- Accidental nudity/other similar slow UST developments.


** Not being able to find a proper Harry/Hermoine fic made me realize that they're more interesting as rivals. I enjoyed their relationship in Hogwarts Battle School and there's something a bit similar in Serpent's Reign (that Harry needs development though because current Hermoine has too much going for her and they're still TOO antagonistic). I don't really like all romance fics either, I don't mind the romance, but I read long fics and if that's the only thing going on I'm going to get bored.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

** I have fond memories of linkffn(Coming back Late), whose premise is that Harry faked his death during the Battle of Hogwarts to protect the Hallows. There is more focus on the interactions between Harry and Hermione, rather than the romance between them, and they're no longer teenagers, but you might want to check it out.

  No bashing, and in particular no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. Harry and Hermione should stay friends with Ron.
#+end_quote

You probably lost at least 90% of the H/Hr fics there,

#+begin_quote
  over-abundance of angst in general.

  Harry should be able to tell her "no", to assert himself and his beliefs.
#+end_quote

And you lost the remaining 10% there. All but one I've read, anyway.

The only H/Hr story I've enjoyed is Paradigm of Uncertainty. Well written, a H/Hr relationship that isn't unhealthily dominated by either party, an interesting plot and absolutely no bashing means that it is automatically better than almost every other H/Hr story. The story started before GoF was released, so it doesn't have all of those hideous tropes that infest the ship. It does have far more references to muggle stuff than I care for, and Harry pulls out "super-mage" skills out of his ass, but it is still well worth a read.

It has two sequels, but I thought the second one was kinda boring. I certainly did not appreciate the tacked-on Buffy elements.

Also, if the following stories are rec'd, ignore immediately : Coming Back Late, Fifth Element, Temporal Beacon, The Golden Age, anything by Lorien, anything by Chem prof. They contain multiple tropes you mentioned. Anything by Robst too, but that should go without saying.

The [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=24634][DLP thread]] for 'Hermione Granger is stupid' (rec'd in this thread) amused me. The reviews were so unanimously negative that it was moved to the thrash bin in less than two weeks with 1.19 stars from 26 votes. That never happens to even the worst of stories.

DLP threads for [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=23829][Error of the Soul]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=11813][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]].

**** It is more of a problem in shippy stories than non-shippy ones. The tropes have festered and propagated in ship-based communities for so long that any new writer automatically adopts the same tropes, and it is one vicious cycle of shittiness. Harry/Hermione shippers are convinced that H/Hr is the One True Ship, so they don't bother building up their relationship, because /of course/ Harry and Hermione are perfect for each other, and what build-up is required when (trivial arguments aside) their relationship is so perfectly perfect?

New people come in without any particular biases against any particular character, join some community or the other (which is generally ship based) and soon adopt the community's biases. The generally despicable behavior on the part of H/Hr shippers after HBP's release (those days accusing JKR of sabotaging her own characters and calling her a terrible writer, a bitch and a whore was quite commonplace in H/Hr communities, reaching its height when the fallout of the 'delusional' interview hit) mean it is worse for H/Hr than for other ships. They took out their 'righteous' frustrations on the Weasleys, and showing up canon ships became the priority. The same tropes still fester H/Hr stories, and the popularity of 'writers' like Robst mean that they will continue to do so in the near future.

** Yes, please.

I suggest removing the "Harry-centric" proviso. The other criteria are basically good taste in romance fics spelled out, but that one is a personal preference.

Don't worry about the thread being flooded by Hermione-centric fics: very few fics will survive the other criteria in the first place.

--------------

That said, I don't know of any great examples, except for the abandoned linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade): yes, Harry and Hermione get a soul bond; and its nature is such that usually, those affected move to different continents and avoid contact until it breaks.

When it comes to finished ones (and ignoring the "Harry-centric" proviso), there's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] is decent and it fulfills the criteria, though it's been a while since I'd read it, so I could be misremembering; in particular, "Muggle wank" is subverted in that trying to invoke Muggle law to get Hermione out of the Triwizard leads nowhere. On the other hand, the fic could be edited down by about a third because the whole Muggle law thread not working out doesn't prevent it from taking up more space than it deserves; and I thought the ending was very weak: too fixficish, with the bad guys getting an Idiot Ball.

Other than that, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/21/The-random-craziness-file][Darklooshkin's one-shot]] isn't bad, though it's a one-shot.

** I think I might be a bit more generous with two of these criteria when looking for H/Hr fics: I don't mind if the relationship is early in the story so long as it's not oddly early in their /lives/, nor do I need the romance to provide the conflict. I suppose the second is implied by the first.

On the other hand, in my mind a story can deliver on the promise of H/Hr without an acknowledged relationship. Just having the two be well-written characters together sometimes works well for a story.

Sympathetic Properties has many (all?) of the warning signs for being another carbon copy of the independent-Harry family-vault-inheritance waste-of-my-time. Fortunately, it's making the effort to not be that. If you check the author's profile, he demonstrates awareness of the things we're talking about. Set after first year, it runs afoul of #7 and #8 by nature, and probably strays well too far from Harry-centric for your liking. Ginny's character is ... well, without knowing in advance, I suspect the author is trying to write Ginny so that when the original plot tries to happen, it isn't recognized and shut down /immediately/ by Harry. The protagonists are working against Dumbledore, but he's not literally insane or Fawkes-certified evil. At least he's not the only antagonist (which would indicate that the story barely has a conflict /at all/). Updating slowly.

The Mark isn't very long, but again the romance isn't the central conflict. YMMV.

Stanrick's Thresholds and Favorite Things are unapologetically shippy and light, but do steer clear of the more severe failure modes.

** It's been a while, so I can't guarantee there's not a "But Hermione, you're beautiful!" conversation lurking in one of these, but I enjoyed Gabilian's two seventh-year stories, linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) and linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian).

They're probably "younger" than you're looking for---i.e., nothing (sexually or otherwise) happens that would be out of place in OotP, let alone the entire series---but I remember appreciating the relatively slow build and the focus on the plot.

Speaking as someone who just about only reads H/Hr I'm afraid there isn't a lot there. As a reader I'm basically just looking for canon-style fiction with a different pairing, but the incentive for authors is to produce really glurgy romance or "correctives" to canon. I'd imagine you'll have the most luck looking at fanfic that was written before HBP, or at least before DH, so that you'll get a fanbase that's less defensive and weird about the pairing.

** Might try linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid by Ruinus). One of the better HarryxHermione stories in my opinion. Doesn't meet all of your criteria, but definitely a lot of it.
