Harry's jealousy manifests in fifth year and he begins devising a plan to break up Ginny and Michael Corner by making Ginny jealous but is surprised to discover almost every single witch in the castle wants to help. Not because they want to date The Boy Who Lived but because they all have an interest in seeing Michael back on the market .


** Almost every single witch wants to date Michael corner? I might be over-analysing this but most is the majority right?

So as Michael was in Harry's year he'd be 15, and as the majority of Hogwarts is 4 years worth of students, having students that range form 4 years his younger to 2 years his older? Bit of an age gap much?

He's also a half-blood, so I doubt that the pure-blooded families will be happy that their daughters are trying to seduce this boy, though they could make an exception for Harry for the benefits that come with having him as a son-in-law.

it's also stated by Ginny Weasley that "/Not any more. He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead./" Michael comes across as petty and obnoxious, not really boyfriend-material.

Yeah, so this is a really far-fetched idea, but I suppose in fanfiction anything can be come a story, though I doubt they'll be any stories like this, but then again, who knows?

*** I didn't really think about it much, I just thought it could be funny and a change of pace from how most fics of this nature use it as a way to pair Harry up with Hermione or Daphne .

*** And also, Michael was a bit petty about Quidditch but he was also a devoted DA member who saved first years from being tortured and is implied to give Cho the emotional help she needed. He's definitely better boyfriend material than the wizard Nazi in his year .
