Exactly as the title says - what are the best swears/curses that you've heard in fandom? And I mean curses like swearing, not like magical attacks. Though I'd love to hear a character in a fantasy novel go "Oh... Magic Fucking Missile..." once or twice. :D

We've got the generic like Merlin's Bollocks or Rowena's Tits, the swearing by things like 'By the Dagda', the referential like 'bugger you with a centaur and a goblin', or the evocative imagery of 'buggering shitface of a womblefucking buggernugget'.

Any character, of any race or culture, and feel free to invent your own! If you think Goblins might swear in rhyming metaphor or House Elves in pigeon-english imitations of Coldplay lyrics, go right ahead and tell us about it!


** Most of the swearing in HP fics is really tame imo. Usually if Ron says "bloody hell" it's followed by Hermiones indignant screech of "language Ronald." In my teens that would just have made me swear more.

I read a fic were Ron kept saying Merlin's sweaty ball sack, made me laugh more than it should.

*** The bloody hell bit is probably lifted from canon to an extent, I know that Molly seemed somewhat strict on swearing - and I don't remember if Hermione was similar.

In general it's hard to have lots of swearing in a way that feels organic to the setting and not too distracting. I guess I'd probably lean towards the Sanderson route and make up a bunch of cultural swear words to show the evolution of them... So more based on wizarding history/figures and magical creatures/spells and whatnot.

Or it could be fun to pick up on older swear words and extensively use them. Eg, finding common swear words from 1600-1700 (basically, right before the statute of secrecy) and having those be the primary ones used in wizarding society could be funny :P

*** He means in fanfiction. Ya know, the not so tame Harry Potter. Incidentally I saw one fanfic, probably crack, that had Ron called Hermione a book with a worm up her ass. Play on words of book worm in case anyone didn't get that.

**** I gathered that. Still don't see all that much swearing, maybe I'm reading the wrong fics. I take it that Hermione and Ron didn't end up a couple in that fic?

** Olivieblake's Drunken History stories are filled with some of this - especially when the swearing person is a very drunk McGonagall.

"...I know what the fuck I said, Albus, you cunting shit..." And so forth. Truly a delight.

I'll link it. Chapters 65 and 68 are what you want, but everything is good.
