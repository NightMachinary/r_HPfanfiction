Hey!

If you don't know, NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month, and it's basically a challenge where you write the first 50,000 words of a novel. I've always wanted to participate, always wanted to write fanfiction, so here I am. I do plan on uploading my work to all the usual sites but I think I'd want to have most of it done before uploading. I don't think I can write weekly, I like to edit too much.

But I have NO ideas. Or I do, but I don't think I'll be able to execute it properly. SO I've come to the fans. I know they're not everyone's favorite pairing, but I like them sooooo.. What type of Dramione/Snamione fanfics have you been dying to see? Any plots, themes in mind?

​

Anyway, ideas? I love Hermione and have liked her with a lot of different partners so I really am open to anything,any genre, any rating.


** Wow, you managed to pick the two most controversial Hermione pairings on this subreddit...

The general opinion on this subreddit is that Snamione is creepy on many levels, and that Dramione requires you to change one of the characters because they are LITERALLY ideologically opposed on every issue (Draco "as for me I hope it's Granger" Malfoy wants Hermione dead, she would quite like to remain alive if that is fine. Hermione wants to free the house elves, Draco is complicit in abusing them. Draco believes in blood purity, Hermione is proof that it is bogus).

*** I do have some ideas for Harmony fics I don't know If I am going to get back to, so let me know if any of these seem interesting so I can elaborate for you.

Hermione is a Robot. I have two different versions of this with different themes.

Hermione is actually a pair of twins pretending to be one person. I have a challenge I found somewhere and a version that I adjusted a bit.

** I like reading both pairings, with SSHG one of my favorite ships, so I'm happy to share some random ideas! Will update this post if I think of more

SSHG

- Hermione ends up with the Half Blood Prince's potions text. She is very curious about the owner of the book and the actual spells. Either she can turn into a dark-ish Hermione and/or slowly figure out Snape's true loyalties over the course of the school year. She may finally put it all together right when Snape kills Dumbledore.

- Post-DH Voldemort is dead but the Death Eaters have won. Snape is de-facto assumed to be in charge. Hermione wants to infiltrate and topple the existing Death Eaters but realizes something's strange about Snape's loyalties and everything is not what it seems.

- While trying to create a new spell, Hermione accidentally sends herself back in time to the 1970s. She is free to change the past however she likes. Somehow she ends up sorted in Slytherin and befriends Severus and Regulus.

DMHG

- Draco gets some sense knocked into him after Hermione punches him in the face. He slowly looks at her in a new light and helps the right side of the war behind the scenes

- Post DH, the Malfoys must compensate all those tortured in Malfoy Manor during the war in order to repair it. Hermione asks to be inducted into the Order of the Golden Fleece, an ancient society with soft political power and vast magical resources. Draco helps Hermione get in

- Draco and Hermione are running against each other in an election for Minister of Magic. Who will win?

- after OotP, with Lucius in jail, the Ministry finds Narcissa guilty of something and imprisons her too. Draco is sent to live with his Aunt Andromeda for the summer and learns a lot about the Muggle World. The Tonkses live in the same town as the Grangers

- Draco and Hermione are Head Boy and Head Girl. They have their own special dorm and common room. For various reasons unspecified, the whole school is against them individually. Both use the special dorm/common room as a place of respite

** I really like SSHG but only when Hermione is way older (like middle aged) or they are both the same age. Teacher-student makes me feel really icky, so here are some prompts:

Crookshanks' playing with the time Turner in 3rd year causes Hermione to hurtle back to the Marauder's era. Having never learned the truth about Sirius black she immediately sides against him with Lily and Snape. Snape, having another friend, doesn't pin all his happiness on Lily and finds he can be happy with others.

Snape and Hermione are colleagues. Hermione cannot believe the insanity that James Potter gets up to, and Snape asks her what she would think if the boy (*set fire to a teacher/brewed a volatile potion in the girls lavatories, went after a giant snake armed with nothing and then armed with a sword etc)

Hermione is legit born in the late 50s-early 60s and goes to school with Snape. She remains a Griffindor and loathes the Marauder's along with Lily.

Dramione

Draco has been sneaking sweets from the house elves and has several cavities. On hearing that the standard treatment is to make the teeth fall out and the grow in the new ones, Draco throws a tantrum. Snape suggests Muggle dentists as a joke, but Narcissa takes it seriously, she hates seeing her boy cry. Enter the Granger's Dentists with specialised training for children.

Edited for Dramione

There is exactly one way I can see it actually happen without making anyone OOC, one that, as far as I know, has not been written yet.

The basic premise is that Draco, upon being matched or beaten by Hermione at every exam at the end of their first year, decides to investigate why a Mudblood could beat him. He can't find any evidence of cheating and therefore asks his mother once he is home. Narcissa, not really interested in the whole topic, merely says something along the lines of Lucius not always being right with his believes.

So Malfoy decides to observe Hermione, trying to smoke out her secret. So instead of calling her racial slurs and trying to get Buckbeak executed, he observes. He should be antagonistic towards Ron as their beef seems to be class-based rather than racially motivated. Year two passes with not much changed.

Year 3 is where things get interesting. Malfoy is still observing/stalking Hermione, but he notices that there is a rift between her and Ron (due to the Cat/rat fights). So he tries to, well something between gloating and cheering her up by pointing out that she is better off without Ron. Hermione half-heartedly defends Ron, but it gets them talking. This should not become an easy friendship since Malfoy is still a prat, but it is a starting point.

Year 4 is where you can kick off the romance, although waiting for Umbridge in the fifth could do the trick. With, for example, Malfoy giving Hermione inside knowledge so that she can avoid the Inquisitorial Squad. Malfoy in the DA would be a no since no one other than Hermione should trust him at that point.

Through all of this, Harry should stay neutral to Malfoy. He doesn't like Draco much, but because Ron and Hermione are at odds, he doesn't want to pick Ron's side either. If you want to keep Harry's role marginal, have him hang out with Katie Bell rather than bash him. Bashing is the trademark of bad fanfiction, and bashing Harry even more so.

Snape and Lucius should be antagonistic as they were colossal dicks in canon (eg Lucius setting a Basilisk loose in a school or Snape abusing his students). A Draco "redemption" story should redeem him, not whitewash all Death Eaters and Voldemort. Lucius would not like his son to associate with, much less date a Mudblood. And Snape is a dick to everyone. That is also a good avenue for conflict if you feel like it.

There should not be much of a divergence from the stations of canon until year 5/6 since Malfoy's friendship with Hermione wouldn't influence the TWT, Sirius breaking out or Voldemort's return. So spending 100k words on rehashing canon is a bad idea. Write to show changes, show how their "relationship" develops and how Malfoy's thoughts change. Keep this fic centred around the changes Malfoy goes through and not Harry's canon shenanigans.

Tl;dr: Malfoy observes Hermione during years 2-4 rather than antagonise her, slow friendship, Snape and Lucius are still human garbage. Prevent Malfoy from becoming a Death Eater through a long process rather than try to write that away or ignore his countless war crimes from book 6. ​

** I'm a fan of dramione and personally I think the best fics are when draco is forced to have his prejudices challenged, internal battling with these ingrained beliefs, and he slowly changes.

*** No, by the time Malfoy would be forced to challenge his prejudice, there is way too much water under the bridge for a romance. Hermione is vindictive and has a long memory. If you want to sell their relationship, you have to make changes in order to prevent all canon interactions after the first book.

The Buckbeak incident and its aftermath was pure sadism towards Hagrid on Malfoy's side, and just ask Snape what calling someone a mudblood does for a relationship.

And HBP was a long list of outright war crimes.
