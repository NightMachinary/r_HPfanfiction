** Stoner!fun!girl. Friendly and maybe a tad airheaded, smart but doesn't apply herself to studying. Someone who doesn't give a fuck about politics or blood status and is always down to do some partying. And she got into Slytherin because she had to learn how to be sneaky around her disapproving, overbearing parents.

** I'd like her as a Nice, but shy girl who cares little about politics and prefers Arthimancy or Astronomy or Runes or some other 'I don't wanna fight dark lords' subjects.

Probably would be a Dean or Seamus in Malfoy's life: She's there, they usually friendly with each other but aren't friends and probably don't care that much about what the other one does or thinks.

Cunning as a good old Slytherin but she's interested more in academia or people. She'd probably convince Harry to emigrate aftet the war is over.

I'd never seen her portrayed this way, but I'd like a non-ice queen of Slytherin fic for once. (Even my favourite Hapnes suffer this trope)

*** "Flower and Serpent" by BrokenWingsHealed

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12504864/1/Flower-and-Serpent]])

This story might be close to what you're looking for: the Daphne here seeks to distance himself from all the blood prejudice stuff and instead goes to work for the MoM as an Unspeakable (and later, teaches at Beauxbatons).

"Unspeakable Beauty" by QuirksnQuills

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7680982/1/Unspeakable-Beauty]])

Come to think of it, Daphne is also an Unspeakable in this (unfinished) story, and even develops a subplot of her own after the story initially focuses on a Harry/Luna romance. This is probably the story that first got me interested in this character's potential, and she's depicted as very kind here.

"Not Quite So Boring" by danceswithnorhythm

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11816264/1/Not-Quite-So-Boring]])

Daphne is also depicted as kind in this still-ongoing story, and this time she works as a Healer. Also, Draco is paired with Hermione if you're into that sort of thing.

***** "Flower and Serpent" (in the list above) is a post-Hogwarts story with her reminiscing on her days on Hogwarts, so it does have a little bit of what you're looking for. Also, the same author just recently (as in, a week ago) published a nice Hermione/Luna friendship fic where Daphne plays a supporting role. I'll link it below. Sadly, not much else leaps to mind right now, but if I find anything else, I'll be sure and mention it next time this topic comes up in a thread.

  I like the idea of a Daphne who is friendly but also coy: someone who is good at navigating around back-stabbers and avoids being manipulated by anyone who tries to step on her. One of the few things we know about her from canon is that she is from a wealthy and prominent pureblood family. As a result, I imagine that, somewhat like Fleur, she might seem a bit standoffish at first but then you realize that she would 100% step in to support you if she thought you were a nice person.

** Daphne is a canonical blank slate who is predisposed to be interesting, primarily for one reason: She's a member of Slytherin (an unpopular minority), yet we know nothing about her. This is fertile ground to explore which is why she's such a popular character, yet 9 in 10 Daphne fics use her horribly.

My ideal Daphne would have some or all of the following traits, which are amalgamated from the many different stories I've read as well as my own ideas:

- Smarter than average, but not genius level. She shouldn't be in Hermione's lane, and should have weaknesses academically (i.e. practical application of Defense, Charms). Still driven, with a clear set of personal goals that may be interrupted or derailed by war.

- Subtly attractive or maybe even a bit plain. Definitely not "hottest girl in the year" or 10/10 bimbo. Appearance shouldn't be her focal point, but if I was writing it I'd say brunette, pale, somewhat harsh features, slim and average height. She should be well put-together and look slightly better than she would naturally due to family wealth (better clothes and style).

- She should never say the words "marriage contract" and they should not appear anywhere in the story as a plot device (either one between her and Harry or the threat of one from someone undesirable) unless it's something like the following:

  - "I really need your help," Daphne said. Harry frowned. "I'm trying to learn the summoning spell, but I'm pants at Charms. Can you teach me?"
  - "Oh, thank Merlin," Harry laughed. "I thought you were going to say something ridiculous, like you'd been forced into a marriage contract."

- Daphne shouldn't be an ice queen, but she shouldn't be overly friendly either. As in most fanon (and maybe even canon?), she should address people she isn't close with using their last names (i.e. "Potter"), with the transition to first name signaling the growth of the relationship over time (best demonstrated with platonic relationships). She shouldn't be the queen bee or most popular person in her house, but also not an outcast. She should have a small group of close friends from different backgrounds (much like Harry). She should have flaws personality-wise just like everywhere else - maybe too judgmental or a weak sense of humor. If she exhibits any sort of ice queen behavior, that in itself should be looked at as a flaw with an underlying cause (trust issues stemming from _____).

- She does need a personal conflict, and it shouldn't involve the aforementioned marriage contracts or the war itself. Family issues and academic struggles are too small, so I prefer a wartime moral conflict, such as her being coerced into the Inquisitorial Squad or forced to torture her fellow students by Death Eaters during her 7th year to prevent retribution against her family.

- Her friends: Each needs to be well-developed and probably have their own conflicts too. At least one should support blood purity, sympathize with Death Eaters, or eventually join them. At least one should support muggleborn rights (friends on both sides), and at least one should be in another House (not Harry or Hermione). Draco Malfoy should be an acquaintance she's on at least neutral terms with or even better yet a friend initially who drifts apart from Daphne as he becomes more consumed by his Death Eater mission and she becomes more wrapped up in her own conflicts.

- She shouldn't be immune from the effects of wartime, physically or emotionally. At least one of her friends or family members probably needs to die. She shouldn't have plot armor., so should suffer as well. However, she shouldn't play an outsized role in the war as Harry's ride-or-die girlfriend or whatever. A spy, foot soldier, resistance member, or refugee are all compelling storylines.

- The Greengrasses should be wealthy, but not absurdly wealthy. They need a legitimate source of income. No crazy pureblood culture bs either, just typical business interests. Preferably two working parents. No Ancient or Noble House crap. Her parents probably shouldn't have been Death Eaters. Daphne shouldn't support blood purity, but she should offer perspective on the well-connected pureblood side of things (but not overly political).

- She should be close with at least some of her family, and probably have a somewhat typical relationship with her sister (fight about small stuff, united on big stuff). I think she should have a decent or good relationship with her parents because growing up rich in peacetime tends to help with that. I like Astoria for comic relief although she can also be a tragic character herself very easily (close with Draco, loses him to the war, regains him after with significant trauma and issues to work through).

- She should date, like a normal person, and if she dates Harry it shouldn't be her first or only relationship. Early relationships shouldn't be serious, especially if she's younger than 16.

Basically if you are going to use Daphne as a main character she needs to be as complex as Harry and his friends are in the original series (though actually Ron ends up being marginalized but that's another rant). If she's a minor character, she doesn't need to be as well-developed but her moments should hint at a larger personal story. A good Daphne doesn't necessarily have all of the traits I listed above, but she probably has at least a handful of them. The problem with most Daphnes is that they are not fully-developed, they are just caricatures.

** I don't mind her being an Ice Queen (though I will cringe if she is actually referred to as such in the narrative, or even worse, by the characters!). The problem is that most people who write her as such do not do the characterisation justice. It is not enough to just write one scene where she is really aloof and cynically sarcastic, followed by another in which she 'takes off the mask' and cries on Harry's (it's usually him) shoulder. You have to effectively explain (by means of showing rather than telling, though that goes without saying):

1) /why/ would she feel the need to put on such a persona? Is it fear? Guilt? Self-doubt? All of the above in complex, interacting ways? Is it something in her past or related to her family? And don't give me any of that 'it's because she's a pureblood Slytherin and they're all little Moriarties in training' unless you're going to write /all/ of your Slytherins that way;

2) How does her being an aloof 'Ice Queen' affect her intra-house relations? Does she have any confidantes besides her sister (or maybe not even her)?

3) Assuming it's a Daphne-centric fic or a romance, we /need/ to see her internal conflict which will inevitably arise when one puts on a certain 'mask' to most of the world. How much of the /real/ vulnerable Daphne is left in there? Has /pretending/ to be an aloof cynic all the time eventually affected her personality to the point where even she cannot tell if that is the real her? Is she even aware of her feelings anymore?

Finally, the bane of many a fanfic is bad pacing, but it is particularly disastrous in these kinds of stories. If the conflict is resolved too quickly, not only does it destroy a perfectly good plot, but it ultimately reduced the potential richness and depth of her character.

The bottom line is that creating real, fleshed-out, three dimensional characters /ex nihilo/ is difficult, just as drawing the human form is much harder than drawing two-dimensional geometric shapes. Many (myself included) cannot do either very well without sufficient practice, and even more will never be able to do it because they are unwilling or unable to learn how (yet we still have to wade through their work in search of good fanfics).

She starts out by manipulating him into a relationship for her own purposes (maybe she wants to inherit her family fortune but it's going to go to a male relative instead or maybe "pure blood" society also means "women are 2nd class citizens") and craftily pushes him to support her agenda.

Maybe at the end of the story - you still don't know if she loves him or not.
