**** In the Arithmancer one of the towers spirals on forever and things get crazier the higher up you go bc the castle uses random stuff from other places to fill the void. Things like a half a table connected to an armoire and so on. Hermione is determined to find the “end” and ends up in the hospital wing for her troubles. Dumbledore says something to the effect of “even I don't venture up so high” and then I feel like in the Hogwarts battle she leads a bunch of DEs wayyy up and they get trapped or something.

******** Hellsing Abridged is a parody redub of Hellsing Ultimate that makes characters more unhinged and, in my opinion, more fun.

Alexander Anderson is an almost unkillable zealous Catholic priest that, at the end of the show, sacrifices his humanity to take down insane Alucard (the Big Bad Vamp). He loves killing things and quoting Boondock Saints. That said, he is a good person underneath it all.

Anderson Quest takes place after Anderson's death in Hellsing Abridged. So you might miss out on some jokes. But overall it should be fine to read. Though I highly recommend the Abridged show itself since it is hilarious. Even if you have never seen the original.

And he sees it goes on for miles, deep into the planets crust.

** /'I'm going to be late!'/ Hermione thought franctically as she ran through hallways. The sense of wonder from being a magical witch in a magical castle that housed a School For Witchcraft and Wizardry had not quite worn off yet, but she didn't have time for sightseeing just then, because Potions would be starting soon, and Hermione was feeling quite foolish indeed for forgetting the time, immersed in books - Squee! - as she was.

/'Stupid, stupid, stupid!'/ it repeated like a mantra in her head as she ran. After all, did she really need to do all that extra credit, if it would cause her to miss class? It seemed so then, she'd thought she'd have time for one last revision, and that one rare reference book had just become available in the library... Now, tired, sewaty and out of breath, she was rethinking her opinions.

She almost bounced of a wall as she rounded a corner. There was no time, and the walls were covered by soft gobelins, anyway. More importantly, the wall ornaments meant she was nearing the upper level of the dungeons in the east wing of the castle - and her classroom. The corridor ended, and she entered a wide open area that was the Central Staircase.

Multiple flights of stairs were filling the great cylinder before her. Looking up, she could see the main passage to Ravenclaw Roost, the currently unused keep meant to accomodate the House of the Insightful. In the almost bare walls, she could see multiple bright dots signalling corridors leading to various parts of the colossal castle. And below, beyond the narrow ledge she'd found herself on, was Abyss.

It was not an official name, of course, but it might as well have been. Merlin knew no one referred to it by actual name anymore, and with reason too. It was a dark abyss, with occasional flicker of a torch lighting up this, or that corridor entrance... But they were mere sparks, their light brief and insignificant in the end, doing nothing to disperse the looming darkness and the feeling of dread caused by the lower Lower Levels. No one in the living memory had seen the bottom, whether by spell or by actually going down.

With good reason. The castle was alive, after all, in that inexplicable way the most important magical sites developed intelligence, and that was more true in the Abyss than anywhere else. magic there was wild, hard at work expanding the castle as the Founders had bid it, with no sign of stoping, or so the teachers said. Either way, magic didn't quite work right there, and no one wanted to brave the unknown bereft of the safety net that a wand provided.

Above the dark of the Abyss was the reason why Hermione chose that route - if she had more time, she'd have used a longer passage and the series of ladders made available for students to get to class. Slower, but safer path. As is, she watched as floating bricks forming bridges and staircases to multiple levels broke apart and flew towards her, arranging themselves into a new passage.

/'Don't look down, don't look down, don't look down!/' Hermione took a deep breath and stepped onto the new platform. The construct shuddered lightly, then started descending. Young witch standing on it could only watch with dread as it moved down and towards the centre of Staircase, past her destination and ever lower. When it finally stopped near a passage, she immediately jumped off, and ran forward into corridor. If she could find a ladder, she'd be able to return, she thought. Not in time for the lesson, she admitted ruefully, but maybe the same day. That would need to be enough, right?

She thought of her friends, Harry and Ron. She'd have to return - if she didn't they'd try to find her, heedless of the warnings, and the teachers would not be able to stop them, that much she knew...

It took five times to get her Lumos spell right. It came out faint, sickly, but at least it was light. Hermione stared ahead, brought her wand up to a steady position and started walking.

*And thus Hermione Granger had been consigned to the Abyss. I'd wish her good luck, but there's no such thing. Not here... heh heh heh*

Not sure how actual opposition would work, but even the vanilla package of failing magic, darkness and shifting passages would be scary here... Tell me what you think? Too tropey? Too bland? All right?

*** A little tropey but I would definitely read it anyway!

Plot wise, I can see Harry and Ron trying to search for Hermione and undergoing their own trials, eventually meeting up with her. Opposition could come in the shape of magical creatures. Maybe mutated from the dark magic that's formed the abyss or creatures that suck magic ala (i think?) linkffn!(Harry Potter and the Curse of Durand). Or warped architecture like the upper castle levels in linkffn!(The Arithmancer)? Maybe even a gollum-esque wizard who's been lost in the lower levels and succumbed to madness.

I feel like I read an abandoned? Azkaban fic where the prison extends downwards into essentially hell, with dementors breeding/swarming at lower levels and maybe a DOM-esque death portal at the bottom (does this sound familiar to anyone else?) Towards the bottom of your abyss, I'm imagining something similarly sinister. Perhaps some kind of natural feature like a ley line or dimensional portal that the Founders tapped to amplify the castle's magic?

For a happy ending, the trio might discover some kind of curse that's warped the magic to its current state. They undergo a series of trials to unravel the curse and eventually emerge from the Abyss, having defeated the dark influences twisting the castle.

On the other hand, maybe the darkness is connected to the natural balance of magic? For every beneficial spell there's an equal release of negative energy, and the corruption of the abyss is a consequence of Hogwart's longterm growth? The trio might still return to the surface but with the knowledge that their world will continue to degrade? with continued use of magic?

Sorry for the extended response, but I am intrigued by this prompt and really enjoyed your take on it. Let me know if you decide to continue with it!

**** I might try, if people want me to. And I liked the review - it's good to be through.

In my mind, the Abyss is a bit like a magical Paperclip AI. Hogwarts got a command to propagate downward, and just did it, infinitely. That naturally meant a lot of magic being in one place, so the reality there bends, for the lack of better term, the effect being more pronounced the deeper one goes.

Magic not working for example would be because the Prime Directive would pull the magic right out of spells to fuel construction. Mutated creatures, gargoyles, carnivorous plants and incomplete enchantments would probably be staple - with occasional combat golem mixed in, because Godric would want a way to train War Wizards, or something... Still thinking, actually!

But I'd be going for scary because unknown and unpredictable, rather than scary because truly malevolent. After all, not knowing up from down and not being able to rely on anything she might have learned would be terrifying for Hermione.

Harry and Ron would be starting in the inhabited section, so first challenges would be the ones put in place by Profeasors for their own safety, I think...

***** Now this reminds me of Bitterblack Isle from Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. The deeper you go, the more dark and twisted everything gets, alongside stronger monsters. Not to mention that in the darkness below, shining a light is the equivalent of waving a sign that reads "Here I am! Come kill me!"

Come to think of it, the main staircase would be quite similar to the Everfall from the same game. A bottomless pit ringed with corridors that go to interesting and terrifying places. I can imagine all sorts of awful things mutating and multiplying in the dark...

*** "Do settle down, class" drawled Professor Snape as the Griffindor group of students stumbled into the room, picking workstations and noisily dumping books and rolls of parchment on the countertops.

For a moment, he just stood there, at the front of classrom, sweeping his gaze across the room. From Slytherin side, he receieved discreet smirks and respectful nods - students of his House knew better than to make him wait, and he'd shown them the newest route anyway, so they stood collected, focused, and with not a single hair out of place.

Gryffindors, however, were a study in contrasts. Some made sure to arrive early, if for no other reason than to take the workstations furthest from him. Others, however, had just burst in and were shaking from exertion and trying to stay somewhat stll in an effort not to give him excuse... Pitful. If he'd wanted, they'd all already be in detention and not even Minerva McGonagall would save them.

Idly, he noted one of Potter's cohots was missing, the boy himself fidgeting in place. Strange it was the girl absent, he'd sooner suspect the Weasley for skipping. The redhead was almost as big a menace as Longbottom when it came to brewing, no small feat.

Finally deciding to begin, he bid them to sit as he walked up to a station set up in front. As much as he'd prefer to just give them the receipe and set them to brewing, this partcular conoction needed a demonstration.

"Some of you might still remember your first potions lesson. I promised the ability to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper in death.

"Potion you will be learning today falls firmly into the latter category. It will not be of much use for most of you once you leave these halls and get a boring, safe desk job writing reports on biting doorknobs in Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office..." he noticed Weasley turning red. "It will, however, prove essential if you are to continue your education at Hogwarts. I am talking, of course, of the Mojang's Mollyfying Mucus, colloquially known as Awkward Potion."

Muttering, a few scattered laughs. Very well...

"Does anyone know why that is?" - Silence. Without Granger waving her raised hand in front of his eyes, he could easily see the whole room, and all the students that seemed to have shrunk on themselves in a futile effort to avoid notice.

"Weasley? No? Then perhaps Miss Patil? Brown? Finnigan? Thomas? MacDougal?

"And that will be three foot on Awkward potion and its uses, due next week. Greengrass, do you know the answer?"

"It can absorb and contain wild magic, Professor" she replied.

"That is correct, five points to Slytherin. It is also the reason why it is sometimes used as base for certain advanced draughts, as the results are more concentrated and the potion more effective. You, however will simply be carrying bottles of this potion and applying it directly to wild magic phenomena in the lower levels, where your andvanced elective classes will take place. Now..."

"Professor?" came a hesitant question.

"Yes, Mister Potter?" the reply, outwardly calm, radiated danger. Still, the boy pressed on.

"If the potion is so effective against Wild Magic, why are we not using it to reclaim the Abyss?"

Right then and there, Snape's patience evaporated like morning dew in the face of supernova. Gone was the calm, venomous tone. Severus Snape, for the first time in his career as a teacher screamed.

"Because we do not want to DIE, Potter! Were you not listening when Miss Greengrass explained how it worked? It absorbs magic, it doesn't neutralize it! Using more potion just means bigger explosion once the containment inevitably fails! This is why you were supposed to have read about it beforehand!" Calming himself, he spoke in a quieter voice.

"You will now watch. The brewing process is relatively simple, and takes no longer than ten minutes. It is however also remarkably intolerant of errors and can't be vanished or shielded against using magic should your cauldron explode. If you somehow prove to be less incompetent than the usual dunderheads I have to teach, the finished substance will be the color of fresh spring water and the consistence of glue. It will also be smooth, so if your potion has any undissolved parts floating in it, it is in your best interest to alert me and start the next batch.

"I will be inspecting your work and if I tell you to stop, you will do so, and fetch a new cauldron from the back. You will also remain after class to clean the cauldrons you used up. You will have time for approximately five batches... I expect every single one of you to manage at least one by the time this lesson ends.

"Now, pay attention. First step is salamander scales, finely ground. Stir clockwise, and add the powder one pinch at the time..."
