After binging on Bobmin356's Pern crossover (and don't get me started on how sad I am that it'll never finish, though I did see that someone very recently on ff.net had put together what seems to be a maybe approved quick summary of what the end was headed towards?), I'm really wanting more dragon related fics where they play a bigger role than 'hey, here's a five minute encounter with a dragon, now say bye!'

Harry is a dragon. It's acknowledged, it has definite impacts on his daily life and social interactions and such, but everyone mostly takes it in stride. It's silly sometimes, but a fairly strong story nonetheless.

If you aren't familiar with SpaceBattles, when you get to the end of the chapter, look at the bottom right of the post for the threadmarks. You can skip to the next chapter without paging through tons of forum discussion.

** I would recommend [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter The Dragon]] by Dunkelzahn as based on the two-shot of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][same name]] by Doghead13.

In the story, a magical accident at a ring of standing stones turns a young Harry into a Dragon. Taken to Hogwarts, Harry settles into the Forbidden Forest where he gets his first (centaur) Maiden (who ends up acting as his mother/big-sis figure), gets excessively wealthy thanks to Severus Snape figuring out how to replicate aspects of his biology (such as his stomach lining for heat-shields and nervous system for electrical conductors), learns how to turn human-shape (and Centaur-shape) and has a totally angst-free outlook on life which contrasts quite humorously with the borderline-grimdark Wizarding World that he lives in.

The Troll didn't stand a chance.

Neither did the Dark Lord who hit him with eight AK's in a row because he kept popping up to complain that it stung.

*** I knew someone would bring that up! I've already read it, multiple times. That and Bobmin356's work are really my all time favorite Harry Potter with dragons fics.

I've read a lot over the past decade or so, and esama's one of a few that I've followed for a long time. I hate how they drop so many good fics suddenly though, and the lack of HP stuff lately.

I don't really care if it's Pern related or a crossover in general. I just want awesome dragon stuff mixed with the Harry Potter world. Doesn't matter how it's put together.

Full warning it is rated M.

I haven't finished it so can't give a full rec, but I remember enjoying it (it's been a while since I last read it).

I will say, it's probably not for everyone so your milage may vary. Hermione and Voldemort/Tom Riddle are the main characters and it shows.

** In a bit of shameless self-promotion, I offer my Triwizards Tales fic

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7594305/1/Triwizard-Tales]]

​

I know that if I found out I could talk to snakes, I would be trying to talk to ever reptile and reptile-like animal I could find... So, why not Dragons?

​

And If Dragons are more than just mindless beasts, might they be open to a bit of negotiation?

​

Where Bob went for Drama, I went for funny. Oh, and Draco abuse. Many of my reviewers tell me they really found themselves feeling real sympathy for Lucius Malfoy.
