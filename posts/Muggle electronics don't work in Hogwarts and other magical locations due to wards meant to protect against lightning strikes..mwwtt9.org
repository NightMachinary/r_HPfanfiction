Just an idea that popped into my head.


** It doesn't suppress the electric field or anything, it just gets confused, malfunctions and zaps the user with lightening. As the designer of these wards died five centuries ago and his notes are written in an extinct dialect of Welsh in a script that he invented and never taught to anyone else nobody knows why this happens or how to fix it.

** I rather like that.

And since I would imagine that's a fairly common ward (meant to reduce chance of fire), that would mean any magical building, no matter how minor, probably has it. So no electronics at the Burrow, the Rookery, 12 Grimmauld, Malfoy Manor, etc. But still ok at the Grangers, the Thomases, even the Finnegan's, and of course 4 Privet. (Imagine /that/ meltdown if the telly stopped working in 1981!)

** From the fact that the Ford Anglia malfunctioned then gained sentience and ran off to live in the forest, I don't think the "Hogwarts is so magical that Muggle replacements for magic don't work" effect is limited to electronics. Nor would I characterise it as the result of any simple interference with particular physical processes. I think it's a more fundamental effect of magicalness and Muggleness being opposite in nature, and magicalness suppressing Muggleness when the two are brought into conflict.

** I always liked the idea that muggle electronics never worked at magic heavy places like Hogwarts or Diagon Alley because those places were never hooked up to an electrical grid.

Even places like 12 Grimmauld Place and the Burrow lack the necessary wiring, outlets and utility account.

*** You could just bring a generator. Or a bunch of solar panels, powerwall, maybe a starlink dish for internet. Put a glowing enchantment on the panels and you can skip the powerwall.

**** My thinking is that the pure bloods don't even have a power source. Like they might get a light fixture and simply stick to the wall/ceiling with a sticking charm and try to turn it on. When the light doesn't work they assume magic is to blame rather than a lack of juice.
