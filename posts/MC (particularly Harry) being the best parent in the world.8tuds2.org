By "best parent in the world" I don't mean perfect. Show me the lows, as well as the highs, of the main character (e.g. Harry) being a parent. I want stories, where you can see the familial relationship develop and change over the years.

Bonus points to the MC being a single parent of an adopted child or children.


** linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal) is about a non-overpowered (indeed, nearly non-powered) self-insert who, being a legal adult and ending up in the mid-1980's, ends up adopting Harry and raising him /decently/, along with adoptive siblings. It's pretty nice, though maybe kind of slow.

That's what took me out of that story. You can just feel their Southern US roots in the way that SI acts and talks.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
