Hi.\\
Just read linkffa( *Elfish Welfare* *by* *tyrannicpuppy* ) (WIP)\\
This reminded me that there is some good raised by house-elfs fics (have read some before when i was not keeping track of the fics i was reading).\\
Do anyone have any good fics where harry is raised by the potter house-elfs after james and lily dies + for painting of either James and Lily or other dead family members or both.\\
preferably complete fics, as I hate abandoned and/or unfinished story lines it really bothers my ADHD and my OffCenterDisorder (some actively written WIP fics are fine if the author have shown themselves to actually finish what they start otherwise i usually wait for them to finish so i can read it without getting hopping mad when I get to the "sorry my muse is gone or Life happened or what ever." I understand it happens but it still bothers me so i try to stay away from it.)\\
PS: Sorry for the rant/whining about WIP/abandoned I just started writing and when i was finished writing it I was not going to delete it when it fit so well into the post.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to.

** I'm still waiting for a fic where Harry is owned by a house-elf...you know, role reversal.

*** I'm quite certain that I've seen this before in a time travel fic where Dobby doesn't trust Future!Harry or believe that he's Harry, and somehow manages a reversed binding on him.

**** You may be thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-a-Hero]]; A post-war Harry is dragged into an alternate universe 6th year where Iris Potter is the Girl-Who-Lived, and Voldemort revealed the prophecy to all.

In that one, Dobby coerces Harry into an elf-bond, to make him Dobby's slave if he doesn't help and protect Iris Potter.

** Lol, that is a funny concept. I don't think I had ever thought of Harry being raised in that environment before but now I want more. I do like the ones where he is raised be goblins so me liking it makes sense I guess.
