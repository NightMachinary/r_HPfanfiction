So, you know when it's July and you're looking forward to winter or vice-versa? Anyone feeling like that when you're reading long fanfics? Many stories seem to really, /really/ stretch certain years (most of the time CoS, in my experience) and so I'll be, like, can we be in third-year already? I think I've actually developed a hate for spring/summer I didn't have before and started to like autumn even more because of fics stretching the end of school years.

But people do not know how to write 8 years old. They're either too baby-ish, or way too mature. It sucks the fun out of 8 years old to have them super-mature little adults who knows everything.

***** Eh, started reading it yesterday after someone else linked it and it definitely suffers from this in a noticeable way. Linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter) is a prime example of one of the subsets of this (inadvertent) trope, the Hyper-Competent Preteen. The author starts out writing a hurt-comfort fic with a young child (in this case an eight-year old), but then they start to write in situations where the character grows after facing challenges. It's awesome to see character growth, but if it's not believably paced or interspersed with time-skips, you end up with an eight-year old who is combat trained, half-killed one of the most dangerous monsters around, and led a group of young heroes, some nearly twice his age, through a major quest that was supposed to be the rite of passage for the descendants of a god all before his 9th birthday. If the author is planning to reveal that Harry is secretly special compared to other demigods, it would be more believable, but there's no indication of this and it felt to me like the author couldn't figure out how to appropriately pace this growth (maybe because they're still trying to send him to Hogwarts at 11 when the story is rapidly removing any reason for him to need to attend).

****** I do agree that it suffers from this, but it isn't as bad as some and very easy to ignore, I think the reason he is specially gifted is because of two things

1. Hestia, she used and uses almost all the things she can to make Harry's life better, that's why Harry can learn from literal fuckin gods, it's the main reason

2. Harry is a wizard, yeah demigods can do magical things, but only in their single skill tree from their mother or father that was a god, Harry can do his mothers gift thingys AND magic, that makes him a bit above a demigod so, yeah

I think the author said in one of his later chapters that the fic wasn't written with a well thought out plan.

Hope I didn't miss anything

** There's a difference between "a lot of stuff actually /happens/ but it doesn't take long in real-time" and authors just writing self-indulgent purple prose.

I'm okay with the former - I'm used to playing Dungeons and Dragons, where it can take several hours to work through what happens in the span of an in-universe minute especially in combat - but meaningless purple-prose tends to get tedious.

*** I'm on a fanfiction right now, it's a Sirius adopts Harry fanfictions.

And we come to the dreaded part where Sirius and Harry goes shopping for clothes with Harry. This is in chapter 3, so it comes way sooner than usually.

Author was great. I don't know details about what they actually bought, author handwaves it with "they mostly got t-shirts, jeans and somes sweaters".

This was used to shine a light on the fact that Harry never had clothes that fit, and his wonder about shopping and getting stuff just for himself, and some bittersweet confusion he has about sizing and fitting. Also Sirius bitter memories of his mother's clothes choices for him. I don't think there more than 1k words on it

So, far, so good. I'm still at the beginning of the story so I'm not sure I'm ready to recommanded it yet, but to me, we're off to a good start, since what is usually a self-indugent purple prose chapter(s) manage to have some meanings and bring something to the characterizations.

***** The worst things about shopping trips in harry potter fanfictions when Harry is between 6 and 10 is that.....you know it was written by people who never ever shop with a young boy between 6 and 10.

I don't care about how well-behaved and shy Harry is. No boy (or girl for that matter) that age will handle a shopping trip as long as writers make them out to be without getting bored, and then getting into something they shouldn't get. Or wanders far from care takers and causing an heart attack. Especially when shopping for regular clothes that they're not that into to begin with.

So maybe this if it gets finished would be the type of story that seems stretched, I don't know. I'm just thinking that as long as I keep moving the plot along then fair enough. I suppose everyone has to write in their own style. I've read fics that can tell the whole tale of all seven books in a couple of chapters, just touching on the highlights.

** The moment a story starts feeling more like a drag, than an actual story, is the moment you know that the author doesn't know how to entertain their readers.

A story can be 100k or 1000k words long. A good author will keep you hanging on every single word and you will never feel as if the story is bloated.

There's a very delicate balance between action and filler. Too much of the first and the reader will burn out. Too much of the second and the reader will be bored to tears.
