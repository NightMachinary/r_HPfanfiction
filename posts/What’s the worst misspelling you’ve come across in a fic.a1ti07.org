Yup, apparently we do :( I've only read the books in English and French so far, but I went and checked just for you (and because I couldn't believe it myself).

I've just finished the first book in Slovenian, and I've noticed a lot of places where things were either lost in translation or actually said the complete opposite of what the English text had meant :(

******* Thanks for checking. Yeah the german version is pretty conservative in terms of translating names but a lot of jokes get lost too...

***** btw hermine is a pretty outdated but not unusual name where i live, i know some women in their seventies called hermine so it was kinda weird to read about a young girl with that name

** Let's not forget the various amazing spellings:

Griffindor Griffindoor Griffyndor

Slitherin Slitheryn Slithirin

I haven't seen many mutilations of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff (aside from Huffleduff once I think. I was never sure if that was on purpose)

Edit: Huffleduff was on purpose.
