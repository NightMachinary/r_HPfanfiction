Has anyone else noticed that the Game of Thrones/ASoIaF fanficion community has quietly grown into something...magnificent? It feels like every week there are at least a handful of new, innovative fics that are well written and well researched. While this understandably makes me happy, it also makes me a little sad. It feels like the HP fanfictions put out nowadays aren't nearly the same quality as these aforementioned thrones fics. Do you think it is because we have become hyper critical of HP fanfiction from reading it so much? Or is it that GoT fanfics are so new, that tropes and cliches haven't established themselves? Even AU fics and time travel fics are written as completely different stories instead of canon rehash (which is unfortunately very common even amongst the good AU/time travel HP fics). Is it due to an older writer base or perhaps a writer base that attempts to mimic George RR Martin's attention to detail and world building?

Curious to read your thoughts!


** I find it ironic as George R. R. Martin views fanfiction in a negative light, calling it a "bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in world-building and character development." But seriously, will "The Winds of Winter" ever be released?!

*** I agree with this sentiment. Especially because some of the fanfic about his own work is almost if not surpassing his quality of work. For example, "Dragons of Ice and Fire" by serpantguy is one of the best pieces of fanfiction (as a whole not just Thrones) I have ever read period. The world building, characterizations, and tone are so pleasant to read.

**** There are a lot of fics people think are on par or even surpass his quality. To name a few. [[https://telltale.com/community/discussion/89129/forum-of-thrones-an-interactive-story]] Pretty long read though so beware. [[https://telltale.com/community/discussion/105743/interactive-got-story-nymerias-war]] The author happens to friends with the author of the previous story too.

** Yeah, I think it's because of the older audience. HP fandom ranges from like 12 to 40+ year olds. I know authors in the HP fandom who are established authors with published books, and I know authors who haven't read a book in ages. GoT and ASOIAF, because both book and movie are for mature audiences, has older fans. Now, of course, if someone has a college degree and writes a fanfic, it's going to be better quality than someone who has yet to pass middle school.

** Unfortunately, HPFF has been on the decline for years as the source material we have is a decade old (I don't think Fantastic Beasts will do enough to really boost writing) and the most popular ideas have been written to death already. However, the fandom is far from dead. Our 16k subscriber count that posts regularly is proof of that.

ASOIAF and GOT on the other hand, are at peak hype levels with the 6th book and last season on the horizon (hopefully). More and more fans will join the fandom, and with them will come writers with fresh ideas and a vast world to build on.

*** I'm with you! The GoT/ASOIAF fandom feels very similar to how things felt around the time the Half-Blood Prince was coming out. It's really starting to show with the fresh ideas and writing!

** I haven't really seen any truly brilliant GoT fics yet, and I look fairly often. I have a bit of a hair trigger when dropping stories when author does stupid shit, so I might have missed a few gems (like, I have pretty much no tolerance for san/san or arya/anyone).

However, I think I can address this line -

"HP fanfictions put out nowadays aren't nearly the same quality as these aforementioned thrones fics."

I've been saying it for awhile now, but I think the HPFF community has been in a downward slide for years. I usually peg 2012 as being the turning point, as that was the last year where multiple great fics were being written. Like, I look back to 2017 and I can't think of a single long fic that I would consider a masterpiece that was written during that year. Sure, there's a few that have potential (Half-Blood Romantic gets thrown around a lot, but I don't think it's there yet). But, like if you look at all the popular writers of yesteryear, barely any of them write any more. When's the last time a story like Wastelands of Time or Forging the Sword came around? He'll, at this rate I would settle for an update to A Long Journey Home, squandered potential and all.

I think it important for a fandom to have some pillar stories, but they don't write themselves.. That and my reasoning above is why I think the Worm fandom still has a long way to go, but everyone keeps retreading the same few ideas. That fandom doesn't have A Black Comedy or a Skitterleap to point at and say "this is an example of a great story" so that's why there's just miles upon miles of decidedly average-to-mediocre time wasters and very few that I would even call good. If the GoT fandom can bridge that gap, I look forward to it.

*** In regards to the no tolerance for san/san arya/anyone, I'm mostly in the same boat.

Speaking of boats though.... I've found that a critical mass of the Jon/Dany fics end up at the very least being highly entertaining. It helps that they are a canon pairing, and there are a lot of very clever AU fics where they meet much earlier than they did in the series. If you browse Ao3 for fics, I'd highly recommend checking out that tag. In particular, "Her Life and Her Death", a "Song for Dragons," and if you like fluff "Court of Bastards" are all worth a look.

**** I think that Her Life and Her Death took a downward turn when Oberyn showed up and took Jon. Jon was somewhat OOC in that regard.

***** Yeah I agree. I feel like its alright to have Jon and Dany develop into slightly different people in an AU, but Oberyn is just so different than canon!Jon. Hopefully we don't end up with a character is Jon in only name.

I hope it gets back on track, introducing Oberyn to mentor Jon makes about as much sense as a fic where canon!Snape mentors Harry. Theyre just too different.

Yes, absolutely these. I love Harry Potter, but absolutely anyone can read and understand HP. You kind of have to be at a certain level to get into Game of Thrones. I'm not trying to be elitist and indeed, the level isn't super high or anything, but I've seen so many friends tell me they couldn't understand or get into the TV show and not even try to read the books :(

** So a few things:

- As Anarchy mentioned, HPFF has been done /to death/. I've been reading HPFF since at least 2001-2002, and I'm fairly sure I've read every single possible idea that could come out of this fandom.

- I don't actually think GoT FF is all that much better on the whole than HPFF. Sure there's more /shit/ in HPFF, but it's been around longer and is much more popular. I tend to check the new/updated posts on Ao3/FF.net for GoT/ASoIaF, and there's plenty of terrible fics to go around.

- GoT FF is new and full of novelty, so of course we're going to love diving into it.

Don't get me wrong, I love reading GoT fanfiction and have actually stopped reading most HPFF simply because most of the stuff I like is either dead or complete. I just think that on the whole the level of quality is about the same (though I would argue that GoT needs more brilliant fics to rival the top level of quality in HPFF).

The one unfortunate thing about a new fandom (or relatively fresh at least) is that stuff you might really want to read isn't always there. I'm a huge fan of fics where Jon goes to Essos and travels around instead of going to the wall (or even leaving a few years before), but there are only a few fics that really do it. I /really/ want to read a good fic where Jon meets Aegon and works with him, or with Dany and invades Westeros. There just isn't that much out there unfortunately.
