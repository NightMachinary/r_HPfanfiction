By this I don't mean through the scar. I mean something happens because he "defeated" Riddle and as a result he is now officially the heir and magic does stuff or because he is biologically the heir.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]] by Sinyk. Merlin, not happy with how the future unravelled for the life of Harry Potter, intervenes early to set the course of history back on track. Implied Pairing Only. Smart!Harry Bash!AD Idiot!RW

It's a super-ish!Harry and there's certainly a good deal of bashing, which normally I hate, but I found it to be a fairly decent read. More importantly, Harry is the Heir of Slytherin through conquest. (Actually, Lily is, since Lily's magic is what defeated him -- but since she died, Harry inherited it).

** Well, I read a story where Harry IS Slytherin himself (time travel is involved), and Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are the other founders.
