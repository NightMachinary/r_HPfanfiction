Just something I've been wondering about while thinking about Harry and the Triwizard Tournament.

What if Harry didn't come up with his Firebolt plan for the first task and was desperate enough to use some of the only curses powerful enough to work on a dragon, curses he'd recently learnt about in Defense Against the Dark Arts class: the unforgivables. I think it could make for a cool scene, after getting tossed around a bit, and almost burnt to crisp, a desperate Harry yells out /Imperio/ and after wrestling with the dragon's will, he puts it to sleep or orders it to stay put while retrieving the egg.

I don't think there's any repercussions from using the unforgivables on a non wizard entity so he'd probably be fine, and so long as no one heard what spell he used they might just think he used some advanced sleeping spell on it.

Thoughts? Also anyone know of a fic that uses the premise?


** Iirc, it's specifically said that it's "casting an unforgivable on another human" is a life sentence in Azkaban, so that implies that just casting the spells falls into a questionable area, which would likely be case by case. I doubt 'mot would care much if someone used an AK on a vampire, for instance.

Harry using imperious curse on a dragon wouldn't have as much legal repercussions, but there's be fear regardless, because it means Harry can control a dragon, which Other wizards would have a hard time stopping if he's also directing it strategically and such. I doubt that it's an easy task either, or the handlers would just imperio the dragons to get them moved, etc.

*** Yeah I think it would be interesting to see the fallout from Harry successfully subduing a dragon with a curse as dark as the Imperius curse. The inevitable dark wizard drama could be a nice butterfly effect to take the story in exciting new directions.

**** But would it? No one will much care if he tames a dragon (a wild, violent beast) as opposed to other sentient life with high intelligence.

***** This is Wizarding world. It wouldn't surprise me if nobody has ever thought of using imperio on a dragon before.

Why would that be? While wizards don't /like/ them much (but then, they don't like any nonhumans very much at all), what little we see of them in canon seems to portray Vampires as another nonhuman people of the wizarding world, akin to Centaurs and Goblins. There are treaties in place and stuff. Like killing a Goblin, killing a Vampire (with or without AK) would definitely be prosecuted. Of course, it might nonetheless not end with a life-sentence to Azkaban because of the wording of the law --- "another human": vampires are another species, not human, so the fact they're sapient beings means nothing.

*** we have no reason to assume that the usage of the imperius has anything to do with the willpower of the caster. Harry didn't seem to need it when he used it. As far as we know willpower is only necessary to resist the curse.

** One of my Dystopian ideas is for an underground pit fighting league where the wizards use the Imperius or even Possession on a magical creature, forced to fight other creatures. Experienced Imperators would work best with the monsters they've cultivated but might swap out to run a recently captured creature that hasn't been seen yet.
