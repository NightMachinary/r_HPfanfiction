I'm so sad to have finished one hundred and sixty nine ! I loved it and would love any revs for something similar ..

- novel length
- completed
- Sirius pairing would be great
- maurader era was also much enjoyed

Obviously that's a tough wish list so I don't expect to get all those things. I also loved growing up black (although no ending) and Harry Potter and the seventh horcrux!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]] has everything youre looking for. It is a time travel fic where Lily Luna travels back to 1980 for a couple days and has a quick romance with Sirius and then makes it back to 2028. But then Sirius comes into 2028 and hijinks and other interesting stuff ensues. Great time travel fic and not a fix-it fic. It follows pre-CC canon where time travel is a causal loop and you can't fix anything. linkffn(5846417)

If youre cool with slash, there are a few RL/SB fics that would fit your specifications and are really well done. Also, the Drarry fic "the printed press" by the same author as 169 is REALLY great.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
