#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** "Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994): After Year 4, the Ministry decided to sell out Muggleborns to appease Voldemort. One Year later, Hermione formed a guerrilla group of Muggleborns and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and their sympathizers. But Voldemort would not be deterred that easily...

This fic is already 417k words long, and has still a long way to go, [[/spoiler][despite Voldemort being already defeated]]. Combat scenes and political intrigues are very well written.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm not going to recommend too much right now but I will put some advice. Frequently recommended stories like seventh Horcrux, a Black Comedy and a few others are fantastic but the are a whole order of magnitude better when you've read some of the lesser fanfiction out there that they mock. There are some that are considered must reads even if people don't like them. For example Harry Potter and the methods of Rationality is strange so far as its loved and hated in equal measure but its worth trying to read if you're going to be hanging around. Jbern's the lie I've lived is another that is considered a must read even though I personally dislike it.

Onto my recommendations. linkffn(4068153) linkffn(5353809) are both great stories that are well known and well written.

** I was also looking for exclusively >100k words stories not even a year ago, and now when I turn around I realize that I've missed some fantastic fanfictions because of that.

The following fanfictions may not have over 100k words, but they're full of action, humour, entertainment, and you'll most probably read them in one breath.

And also, @DobbyElfLord is one of the best action writers out there, so it'd be a huge mistake to not read those fanfics just because they're 10-30k words each.

Harry Potter Hit Wizard duology

linkffn(4544334)

And it's sequel

linkffn(6568694)

Harry Potter the Sniper duology:

*** They aren't good. The Sniper stories were mediocre, and the Hit Wizard, Mercenary series was unreadable due to terrible cliches.

** If your alright with reading next-gen, my personal favourite action in fanfiction is: linkffn(8255131). It's sequels are even more action oriented.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Hi. Welcome to [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]].

There are usually three categories of fan Fics round here.

You've got the good, of which I would recommend anything by the author Vance McGill, such as linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion;The Vanishing Cabinet of Time) and more...

You've got the bad, which includes stories such as Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, often abbreviated HPMOR...

Finally you've got the ugly, consisting of stories written by myself...

Hope you enjoy your stay

(And yes, parts of this post were in jest)

EDIT: What? Down voted for bashing my own works? What the hell?
