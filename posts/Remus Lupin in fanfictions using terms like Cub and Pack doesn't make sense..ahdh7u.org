I am pretty sure fanon made this up, canon Remus Lupin, who despises/is ashamed of his Werewolf side, would never call kids Cubs or whoever he feels protective over, his Pack. It clashes to much.

What do you think? Does it make sense to you? If it does, please give some reasoning.


** I'm beginning to think that canon Remus and fanon Remus are two completely different characters. Fanfics only describe how sexy it is to be a werewolf, and, judging by these terms, focus on the animalistic side of the condition. Rowling goes out of her way to tell us how Remus craves normality, how he loathes being a werewolf, how painful a transformation is. I've seen a word 'pups' used in a fic. Guess who used it? Greyback, the one who shed his humanity.

**** I was very surprised by this when I started reading fanfic. I have no idea why authors decided that a painful and stigmatized condition is attractive. But then again, the main focus in Remus-centric stories is sexual drive a few days before a full moon. Some people enjoy this, but it's a complete fanon thing which annoys me to no end.

********* I've seen some people saying that lycanthropy doesn't fully equal HIV, so they are unhappy about it. But since it's a metaphor, I never thought it should fully translate to being infected with HIV. And it's pretty hard to find an equivalent of a magical disease. Maybe we sometimes go too far with all those representations. Btw, I know next to nothing about HIV situation in 1990s, but if it's similar to what Remus had to go through, that's a nightmare.

***** I do the same when I actually write something, but I hear a lot of things quoted, and they get stuck in my head. It sure is hard to keep up with, I agree. It's a lot easier to just take my copy of, say, Prisoner of Azkaban off the shelf if I want to reference Sirius, than try to navigate any of JKR's interviews or Pottermore, hoping for a chance to catch anything extra.

Guess that's the difference between an avid fangirl and a fan.

Also: I have a lot of material written up that doesn't make it into the final product. Not word for word, anyway, more like things are heavily implied in the final cut. Backstory, world building, what have you - just to make me comfortable in navigating the current timeline in my story. But if some of it doesn't make it through to the end, then the story took a turn, and I intended for something to happen, but then it didn't, so... maybe I shouldn't confuse my readers with additional stuff that's not necessary?

***** I don't know if there would be an audience for such fics. I mean, the main character's slow downward spiral and deterioration couldn't even be classed as a tragedy in and of itself, if we go by the book. It's just a really depressing story.

Maybe it could be turned into a Jekyll/Hyde kind of story, a horror or a psycho-thriller. Send the message "I'm not the same as my illness" but then it's simultaneously out of their hands, isn't it? Once the full moon comes up, they black out. Resistance is futile. Maybe that's the tragedy? But if we go this far along, the similarities with an STD kind of end, because with that, you always have the conscious control not to infect other people. I don't know. It's a pretty botched up analogy once you think about it for more than 5 minutes. Yes the social stigma is still there, but nothing else really matches up.

****** Well, a werewolf can also avoid infecting anyone if he/she takes proper precautions before the full moon, if not, a tragedy occurs. It's just that I never looked for a metaphor that would be absolutely perfect for this condition, because I don't think there's one. Like I said, I'd much rather read about how he copes with his transformations on his own than about sexual drives and so on, because there, in my opinion, authors completely missed the point. Maybe it's all about people not wanting to see characters who show weakness. Even in this thread, many comment about how in one fic or another Remus isn't as self-pitying as in canon. But people face this, and this is what interests me. Readers are just fair-weather friends lol.

Even with all this, I feel it's kind of a superficial similarity. In canon, nobody really backs werewolves publicly... except for maybe Voldemort, but that's more of a quid pro quo agreement. They don't really get redemption in the end - I don't even remember if Cursed Child discusses the issue?

******** As far as I remember, there's nothing in cc about this, and thank God for that. As for them not getting redemption, that's all Rowling's fault, that's why I have my headcanon. But I think that issue of their bites leaving scars shows why people are so terrified of them. I mean, people constantly say that it's impossible for wizards to fear werewolves so much if they are dangerous only once a month. But maybe this is the reason- maybe people were attacked by werewolves in human form and were scarred like Bill. Thhe only difference I see between this condition and HIV is that a werewolf condition is not passed to a child. But I actually think it's a good thing, because by making the two completely identical, we as if target just one specific group of people. I love when there's room for interpretation. To be honest, this whole bite thing annoyed me, and I have some,erm, concerns about intimacy then, which will surely earn me some silly replies. I've started rambling, sorry.

********* To start off with the end of your comment - to scar/infect someone, you'd have to draw blood so your DNA can freely get into their system. Most intimate situations I think don't involve biting someone so hard they bleed. Scratching risk can be reduced if you file and/or cut your nails short.

An actual HIV infection, if we stay with the analogy, can't (or let's say there's very little chance to) be transferred by saliva. You need other bodily fluids or blood to mix with that of the other person's. So I think werewolf sex is safe. Especially with contraception.

I don't remember if the child not ending up as a werewolf is a 100% thing. In PoA (the movie), Snape I think mentions one can be bitten or cursed to become a werewolf, and you can also be born as one (i might remember incorrectly). Wasn't that the main freak-out over Teddy, and Remus having children/a family on the whole about? I recall that a lot of drama went down over that.

I mostly think the poor situation of werewolves boils down to racism/classism in the end. Sure, the permanent scarring ability doesn't help, but there's this innate exclusionary behaviour in humans to dislike what is not similar to them.

Also, remember Ron's weird far-removed uncle who's and accountant or something? No? Well, no wonder. We don't talk about that.

I think, lycanthropy can infect anyone, obviously, but for an entire collective group of people to be dehumanized, there has to be a pretty powerful mechanism in people to automatically push away the infected. Or cover them up. (Like Crouch did for his mentally deranged son.)

For all the quirkiness going around in the British wizarding community, they sure are weirdly intolerant and elitist.

********** So that's one mystery solved, great. As for Teddy, I personally got the impression that Remus came up with the most horrible scenario, because he tends to do that. I mean, if you could become a werewolf genetically, Greyback wouldn't need to bite children, he could reproduce normally. Besides, this would have been a very serious reason for Tonks not to be with him. But that's just my opinion, because the alternative is too scary for me, and it does put Tonks' willingness to be with him in an interesting light. I agree it's mostly racism, but I also think fear is born of ignorance. It doesn't take a lot to convince people that you can become a werewolf just if you are scratched. Also, you don't have to be dangerous for people to be affraid of you, I'm saying this from personal experience. I think fear isn't always rational.

*********** We agree on this fear of the so called beast being irrational, then. What I don't agree with is the point you make about Greyback. I'm about to go off the deep end here, fair warning.

If the trait could be genetically inherited/passed on, yes, he could reproduce normally. We don't know for sure if he does or not regardless, but he does proposition Hermione in the Forest of Dean, if I recall correctly, and we can read into that as much as we like. Several possible scenarios. He can turn her and rape her. He can not turn her and rape her. If the trait is hereditary, she'd give birth to werewolves regardless.

But! Those are still mostly helpless human infants, and they take 9 months to make EACH. And then several years of nourishment and care for them to be marginally useful (in an army/pack). Now. I don't figure Greyback the romantic fatherly bloke. I see him as a guy who's driven by goals. His goal? His dream? A werewolf dominion. A big pack.

How can he achieve that fast?

Camp out next to an orphanage at night, go through all the rooms once he transforms, then gather up all the bleeding and miserable children aged 0-18 and tell them: "Your parents abandoned you. Now society will shun you. If you join me, you'll live a glorious life, you'll have a place, a purpose, you'll have meaning. Or you can die."

Then, I don't care. Maybe he's a fair leader, maybe he's a lunatic. We never actually see his pack. But he has one, and it's large enough and it's expanding at a speed that Remus is sent to infiltrate the groups and try to sway the masses. So he's probably good to those who join him willingly.

I'm not saying simply making babies by sexual relation is not something he could do, but it's a labour intensive (terrible pun, I know) route which I don't see him taking. Also, I think he enjoys the massacre.

************* Yup. Returning to the point you made about Tonks - she was quite vocal that she didn't care about his condition. At first maybe she didn't want to get serious, but then who knows. She seemed pretty adamant to be with him, and maybe she didn't realise just what that entailed at first? I mean sure, you learn about it in school and I'm sure they cover dealing with werewolves in Auror training, so she could have thought "well I can manage". But theory and practise are two different things. Maybe dating was fun, and she told herself "yeah this is fine", and then they fell in love and married, and nothing spectacularly wrong happened, until they forgot contraception once and concieved, and then it was the old argument again, "I don't care what the baby will be, Remus, I'll love them either way" and Remus saying "It's dangerous and you don't understand".

​

My point being, yeah, Tonks might be totally tolerant of one's lycanthropy but completely overlook what the condition feels like for the other person, because she can't put herself in their shoes. There are some things love just can't fix, and would you wish that upon a child? Even if there's only VERY little chance they'd be born that way?

​

Also, sure as HELL if my partner didn't want childen, and explicitly told me this several times, I wouldn't force the issue/situation on him. Remus seemed pretty freaked out, yes. Regardless if there are any real dangers or not, they felt real to him. So he either has to deal with that and heal, or Tonks has to look for someone else to start a family with? Or they both settle?

But then, if they wanted a family and discussed this, surely the subject of children came up.And here's where I have a problem. Even the most optimistic person thinks of what ifs. I'm sure I already made it clear that I don't want Remus's fears to be founded in reality. I mean, if the condition is herreditory, then Tonks pretty much agreed to carry a werewolf child. Moreover, she might die while carrying it if the unborn child can transform. How mad do you have to be to agree to this? Tonks inability to understand Remus actually annoys me a lot. I mean, what she says is very lovely, but it just seems a bit childish, and I imagine Remus truelly thought she didn't understand. That's why I have problems with this paring in most fics. But it's generally thought that love fixes everything.

I see the first half of this sentence thrown around a lot, and I agree to a point. Yes, only someone way in over their head would be so determined to be with someone so profoundly scarred. Remus doesn't really have a lot of charming qualities going for him in his old(er) age. He's cranky. He has pains. He's passive, a pessimist, and overly cautious. The world made him that way. He'd probably do best in one of those inflatable quarantine bubbles.

But maybe if he met someone (who's not a werewolf) who could relate to him, maybe he could get some form of companionship back. After all, who does he have left who knows him, and just wants to talk to him? I'm not at all hoping to get him a romantic partner at this point, the guy needs to get himself together a bit. But maybe, MAYBE, if some angel woman (or man, if you prefer M/M ships) with a terrible past just sticks around for a while with him, maybe things could happen? The person would have to treat him like a spooked wild animal for a considerably long amount of time, sure, but MAYBE it could work. Because the person could show him they know what it's like to fear the worst coming around to kick you in the face at every turn. They know what it's like to be let down, fired, abandoned. And he'd see they understand, and they want to make sure he sees there's no trick or persuasion here.... only, people are rarely that patient. So the best we can hope is maybe a new friend? Who at least somehow manages to coax him out of his shell a little?

Going in young, naive, and inexperienced is sure to end in tears, I agree with you. I see Tonks as childish, too. On all accounts. Seems she's chewed on Remus' ears until the man gave in. In a lot of later scenes, Tonks seems really content, while Remus is quiet, awkward, and withdrawn.

It's such a shame, too, because I actually like Tonks until this whole relationship drama starts. I think she had great potential as a spitfire secondary character, young and energetic and reckless, but whoop, there she goes into the background to beg for a conventional family life. With a werewolf, because she's reckless.

Common experiences often bring people together, and they even have a romantic relationship. Besides, mutual understanding is essential in any relationship. God I need a story like this. And btw, Remus has several charming qualities, which i'm guessing attracted Tonks to him, like his sense of humour, empathy, ability to remain calm when it's needed, but it's true he isn't anyone's idea of an ideal partner.

***** Carnival of dark and dangerous creatures. It's quite often recommended. Takes place after the first wizarding war but before Harry attends Hogwarts. Remus gets taken captive by a magical circus.

Shades by fernwithy was great im going to re read it some day. It's about what remus was up to during order of the phoenix. It's a really good build up of romance between him and tonks

Sin of lycaos is really good but tricky to find. Youd have to use the way back machine. It's super old but the premise is what if lupin bit a young girl. Extremely dark.

I enjoyed him in the promises series by robin4 but its heavily dated as it was written before even order of the phoenix came out. It's an AU if Sirius had never switched secret keepers. The writing is meh but its fun read. It's like reading age of apocalypse from the xmen fandom. I hate the 90s art but I love the new roles that everyone has.

I quite enjoyed moons of deceit. It covers the marauders, focusing on remus and an OC who I thought was well written. It has 3 sequels which I never fully got into.

Wanderings with werewolves is a fun AU where what if lupin taught dada in year 2. The writing is passable.

Another one goes is remus/ OC and is from the ocs perspective but the writing is good and the OC I thought was interesting

So wait what year is this has the marauders time travel to the trios 5th year. The writing is not great but its long and I thought the premise was interesting.

Let me know if any of these sound interesting

** You're right. Remus is ashamed of being a werewolf, he's not about to call a human child a 'pup' in any context. Just look at his rant in /Deathly Hallows/, when he's freaking out about Tonks' pregnancy and saying that his son will always be ashamed of his father. Having a werewolf cub for a son is his *worst nightmare*!

And unless he adopted Harry as a baby in this fanfiction, it's inappropriate and out-of-character anyway. Remus is /not/ Harry's father or uncle in canon, he's a friend of his dad's who never attempted to contact Harry at all (as far as we know). We know why; he's a werewolf, he's unemployable, he was possibly overwhelmed with grief, etc. But the point is, he didn't step in as a surrogate father, so calling Harry 'cub' is a double wrong--because of the werewolf thing, and because it's like calling him 'son', something Lupin never came close to doing.

**** Well, there's mention in the first chapter, or perhaps the second, of Harry encountering wizards who bowed to him in shops and so on, several of them, though the only one that gets named is Dedalus Diggle. So, Dedalus Diggle, member of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Remus was also a member, met Harry at a shop, and then at the Leaky Cauldron with Hagrid.

/If/ Dedalus Diggle wasn't in touch with Remus, and /if/ the Daily Prophet made no mention of Harry Potter being at Hogwarts, and /if/ Remus was also kept out of the loop by Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid, then no, Remus would have had no way of knowing how to contact him.

Personally, and admittedly flavoured by Remus failing to approach Harry until the Hogsmeade Weekend when they met by chance, and iirc he didn't mention Harry's father until he made a reference by mistake and ended up having to explain it, anyway, personally, I don't buy it that Remus had no way to contact Harry at all.

I think he made a choice to not contact him, although 'blame' doesn't really seem an appropriate use of word to me. I think it's reasonable that he didn't write or seek Harry out. He may never have met Harry as a baby, since there are hints that Remus was estranged from the Marauders as a possible spy, and so Harry is just the orphaned child of a dead schoolfriend who was also in the same war effort. They would have absolutely nothing in common, and, well, Remus in canon doesn't relish parental responsibility. He may have wanted to avoid ending up too close to a child he wasn't ready to be any sort of mentor to.

I sincerely doubt he had any idea that Harry's upbringing was poor until book four.

However, then we also have the fact that Lupin didn't write to Harry, although he was pleasant if they met. Lupin didn't want to be close to Harry in the way Sirius did, but again, fair enough, they have no real relationship and nothing much in common. Harry is a friend's kid, not a friend. It's normal enough to not go out of your way to foster a relationship with a friend's kid - just as it's normal enough to look out for your kid's friend, the way Molly and Arthur do.

***** I also think it's unfair how much of a beating he takes from fandom for not having been there for Harry. Out of universe Rowling probably had not even had a clear picture of him when the first 2 books were written, in universe we see that he despises himself for being a werewolf and strongly believes that he will harm anybody who gets too close to him irrevocably. People say that he was a coward for running away from Tonks and doesn't want children, I don't think that at all. He is traumatized and his fears are not unfounded. There was a 50% chance that his kid could have been a werewolf since nobody knows of any werewolves who procreated with a full human, if Teddy had been a werewolf then his life and all hopes and dreams would have been destroyed the second be was conceived. By marrying Tonks he had exposed her to the stigma of being married to a werewolf, even if they had survived both his child and wife would have had to fight the prejudices, Tonks might have lost her job (see Lyall and his wife whose lives took an downward spiral the moment Remus was bitten), Teddy would have been bullied at school and might not be able to find a job later in life. It was not selfishness that prompted him to leave his family but rather selfishness that allowed him to give in to his love for Tonks and marry her, I think this is the way he sees it and I think he is not wrong, as sad as that is. I do think he liked children a lot because he loved teaching. Didn't Rowling even say that he tried to teach some werewolves? I might have gotten this last part mixed up with fanon...

In the end they must have married because he loved her back after all and his emotions and her suffering got the better of him, he acted irrationally and against his own convictions. Realizing that she was pregnant must have been almost as horrifying to him as if he has woken up after the moon and realized he'd killed or bitten her and reminded him that he had no right to marry anybody much less impregnate her.

My name's not that long (2 syllables) and teacher's regularly shortened it in school. It was a fight just to get them to use the short form I preferred. Mione is a reasonable thing; if used sparingly.

****** "Mia" only makes sense if you mispronounce Hermione. Instead of saying "Her-my-o-knee", if one says it "her-my-ah-knee" (basically skipping the 'i' sound entirely and giving it a shorter o that can sound a lot closer to an 'ah' sound) you can get Mia "my-ah" from the middle. It's so roundabout and confusing, and I'm not the biggest fan of it. Plus, I always read Mia as "mee-uh" in my head, so it's confusing.

And that is the thing, really. Plus, another caveat: Hermione as we know her in canon actually put in effort to be called “Hermione”, which is showed in her interactions with Krum, and in the series proper we don't see anyone using nicknames for her. This means that when somebody gives me a fic in which she's called a nickname by everyone but the adults and there's no explanation of any kind of why that's a thing ... well, I am going to chalk that up to lack of research and lack of care about character accuracy because it would take less than 100 words to do that in a satisfactory way. And with how often people are wont to reference movie stuff specifically when it happens to be something that they changed from the book, it's also easy to assume that this is one more thing of this ilk.

On that note, my name is just a few letters long and I've gotten a lot of nicknames, none of them much shorter than the name itself (like, the shortest ones were one letter shorter). It's definitely a thing. But I also know someone whose name was nine letters long and she didn't like it when people shortened it at all, so I can see the same in Hermione based on her behaviour and thus to me the sudden shift to the opposite with not even an acknowledgement of it by the author is kind of jarring.

In the books NO ONE uses nicknames for any one (other than the marauders, or to tease and bully people)! According to Rowling Percy's name is Percy. The only exceptions I see are possible exceptions (Fred and Katie), that's it. It's not the fanfic writers not 'doing the research' it's Rowling not knowing how to write kids. You've gotten a lot of nicknames, Hermione has zero. Even Ron calling her Mione was just because his mouth was full and not as a nickname. It's jarring when you realize it and not at all realistic.

** I don't mind it so much. But then again, my headcanon is that the werewolf curse actually does mess with the heads of those who get it. The "monster once a month" thing wouldn't make wizards so paranoid about werewolves if that were all that happened. My theory is that there is some sort of mental influence - like, say, having your mind overwritten by that of a hyper-intelligent wolf that has all your memories.

Lupin, being a generally nice guy, became a very friendly wolf in human skin. Greyback, being an utter metaphorical monster, became a literal monster in human skin. And when the full moon occurs, they're in such pain (possibly mixed with hunger) that even the nicest of wolves becomes all bitey-snappy-angry. (Also wolf'sbane potion is just a painkiller/mild-tranquilizer combo).

My point is that if the pack mentality /does/ slip into his subconscious, then pack/cub as something of a Freudian slip isn't unreasonable. Like, I think if Lupin did it /and you pointed it out/, he'd be mortified, but him letting it slip out? Not too unreasonable.

Now, if he does it every damn time he refers to Harry, that's another story entirely.

I think since language is a human part of Remus, he wouldn't unconsciously shift to wolf terms- which are just terms that humans impose upon animals, not things that animals think for themselves- it doesn't make sense for him to start using different language terms for anyone just because he felt possessive or like they were part of his group.

** I always thought it was because of acceptance, his group of friends, James calling it his furry little problem and seeing nothing wrong about it and more.

In a lot of these fics where Lupins speech patterns change he raises a child even his...- if even a child sees nothing wrong with you, badgering you that you're okay, a wife calling him "My manly wolf" or some shit I don't know- I figure he'd get used to it, start to mellow about the whole "woe is me, I bark and bite and piddle on the floor once a month" thing.

In canon, he has no one for a decade, all his friends dead as far as he knows save the traitor. He has nothing but but dead end jobs and discrimination as far as we know, probably fell into the drink too.

So even a single friend that accepts him and stays, you know, alive and around accepting of the wolf might make the difference

Edit: Besides, he was a Marauder, what are they known for again? Ballet? Wait, no, pranks and jokes, isn't it?

I could see him finding it slightly amusing in a depressing sort of way, confusing people by calling someone Cub or alluding to his family as a pack- the secret's usually paper thin or out already anyway, and he's resigned to being an outcast anyway, so freaking people out that later figure out all the strange phrases he used were alluding to it or that he was hinting at it with every sentence and making fools of them...

No we didn't, but it's a possibility- he lost his friends and had issues with finding work- it's a possibility that he found comfort in drink when he had no one and next to nothing. It's also a possibility that it lasted years and he got his act together later- but seeing a castle filled with memories, of the boy that looks so much like James might have sent him right back in the drink.

The Lupin we see is a depressed sad-sack of a man, who was formerly a prankster and joker- the only time we see even a glimmer of that was shooting a bit of gum up Peeves nose or whatever.

More he took ages and ages to start Harry's lessons on the Patronous charm- yet was well enough was able to attend and teach his classes- what was he doing the rest of the time? If his "sickness" was really just being a werewolf and it took him /that/ long to recover how the hell did he manage to graduate much less teach- honestly it doesn't add up. Add in a bit of the bubbly and it comes together as a plausible explanation if one unproven.

It was only the fact that he gave in to his emotions instead of exerting iron self control and married Tonks that threw him, in fact I got the feeling that he was somebody who couldn't ever forgive himself for being less than perfect, he basically wanted to die to atone for the sin of having ruined Tonks life by marrying her and making her pregnant.

Far from being depressed and sadsack, I disagree- we first see him sleeping during the day- [[https://www.everydayhealth.com/depression-pictures/depression-symptoms-to-watch-for.aspx#fatigue-or-lack-of-energy][one of the many signs of depression is fatigue/lack of energy, another is sleeping too much]]. Sure it could be his condition but it could be depression.

Looking further on that list, "Social Withdrawal"- it may not be by choice but as far as we know he hadn't kept in touch with much of anyone before book 3. Surely he had more friends than just three or perhaps not- which would be even worse losing them all at once.

On Pottermore- yeah not canon but hey- it says [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin]["Remus, so often melancholy and lonely"]]. Sure, it went on going on to describe his amusement at Tonks inflatuation with him. Before you get excited it follows that "He had never fallen in love before." - the latter isn't proof of anything I admit but it's hardly a happy thing either.

More, he felt he was so unworthy of love, and fearful of his condition that he was prepared to abandon Tonks and Teddy to join Harry on his Hunt- or so Harry himself felt in book 7.

Of course he wouldn't be unaffected by everything that's happened to him, I don't deny that he must have often been sad and melancholic, but I don't see that taking control over him or his life, especially when he's got something to do. I think the sleeping has something to do with his condition, he is continually described as looking tired and sickly, grey hairs and lines in the face despite his overall youthful looks. It could be a sign of depression but that's all there is from how I see it, "could".

Edit as I said below in the other comment his fear and hatred of his condition is extreme but also not unfounded or exaggerated. He must have "let himself go" after much persuasion of Tonks to marry her against his own better judgement because he, too, loved her. The moment be realized that she was pregnant probably reminded him that he's commit a mistake he could never make up for and he tried to get himself killed over it.

** I'm a bit late to the party on this thread, but this is a subject I'm pretty passionate about so I'm commenting anyway. I absolutely hate the trope that being a werewolf is some sort of torturous curse that either drives people insane or leaves them hating that part of themselves. IRL, I'm a wildlife biologist and I find wolves to be one of the most majestic creatures out there. More than that, they are one of the most solidly social creatures.

As such, when I'm writing anything, I absolutely refuse to depict lycanthropy as a curse. At least not to the extent that it turns people into self-hating depression patients. At its worse, I will treat it as a challenge that is not meant for everyone, but has its upsides even to those who suffer the worst from it. Furthermore, since I have a heavy interest in ethology (animal behavior) I like to explore the psychological differences between humans as wolves. This inevitably means a reinforcement of the social reliance found in humans.

When this is applied to the established characters in Harry Potter, my interpretation of Lupin is that his poor mental state comes not from being a werewolf itself, but the fact that he is ostracized from society. In turn, when he gets a chance to actually form a social group, he grasps it far harder than others would. Whether or not he uses wolf terms for this depends on the context of what is happening, but even if he doesn't want to, he can't help acting like a wolf.

*** While I agree with the part about Tonks abilities, I really don't see how getting Lupin factors into that.

***** You're not doing a very good job of being mean, it spoils it if you tell people you're trying to be mean.

***** I mean, why Lupin though? I'm pretty sure that a significant percentage of men would not mind a girlfriend with such an ability.

If you want to shit on Lupin, base it on canon and complain that he is a shitty husband and friend, but not because, for some reason, you think he'd take it up the arse while everyone else would not.

****** I meant as a Alpha-Omega-Beta verse idea that Lupin would either be a beta or a Omega- he REALLY does not have the qualities of an Alpha- more than a comment on his tastes...Canon wise, he only married Dora because she was the one pursuing him, which would fit into Dora as his Alpha. It woud make sense that Dora being the Alpha, she would have to be dominant and have Lupin in a submissive role...something tht not all women would be able to do. A metamorph penis would just come in hand.

******* Actually, recent studies show that the whole alpha thing in wolf packs isn't really a thing, or at least not the way people thought it to work.

******** And the whole concept of werewolves behaving like beasts and not like humans would be water on the mills of Umbridge and likeminded people. Because then clearly werewolves are not human, they don't even follow the same social structure.

I mean, I am all for making them bloodthirsty monsters which are the fuel for nightmares and savage entire villages, but that's not what Lupin stories are about.

******** Well, I am not actually surprised to find out that the world of fanfiction has a whole set of rules in regards to something that has nothing to do with reality!
