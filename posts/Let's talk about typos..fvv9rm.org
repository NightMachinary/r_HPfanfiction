I was editing my upcoming chapter when I come upon this: "Is anyone up for a game of Exploding Snape?" üòÖ

Clearly, I meant to write Exploding Snap, but now I really would like a game called Exploding Snape to exist.

I have nothing against Snape. He's not my favourite, but he's not someone I hate either. Yet the idea of Gryffindors playing a game called Exploding Snape seems like such a fun read.

Anyway, point is, please, share some of your typos that took you by surprise. I'd love to hear them.


** Mine wasn't as much a typo as it was unintended racism - had been a long day and I was slugging through a chapter and wrote the line,

"Chos eyes narrowed, more than they already were."

Didn't see anything wrong with at the time then next day on my proofread lap was like jesus C H R I S T what was I on

**** Where was the racism in that? I mean it just a biological feature. Like people with African heritage have dark skin people and flatter noses; middle to North Europe tend to have lighter hair and eye colours, point-ier noses and burn easier in the sun; and far East Asians tend to dark hair and almond shaped eyes...

***** What does the second part serve to say?

"Cho's eyes narrowed, more than they already were"

The first half informs us to what's happening - the last half is basically "get it, she's asian so she squints all the time". It's not very relevant, it doesn't add more information, and is at best there just as a reference to her being east asian, ethnicity wise.

You can bring attention to biological features when it's relevant, sure. And it's not like the example is egregiously racist. But it's also not very relevant, and falls more into a somewhat grey area.

***** The problem is that many people wouldn't think like you do, and if OP had posted his fic with that line included rest assured, that he would've been attacked by at least one reader. It doesn't matter if it's racism or not. People are way too much sensitive about race, especially on the internet. So better safe than sorry. That's my motto at least.

*********** I personally don't think it's a matter of being overly sensitive, it has more to do with the the idea that people spend their whole lives being made fun of for things like how narrow their eyes are, and even when they're just casual comments they understand that supposedly non-aggressive comments on "differences" are just that, comments about how you're recognized as "different" or weird because of your race. Overt racism is rare from intelligent people nowaday, but it can still really drag on a person to constantly hear people still making these snap decisions about you based on your race and have to pretend that that's okay.

** As a reader, I tend to ignore the occasional small typo - especially if it is clear what the author was intending. I have gotten to the point where I only comment on typos if they fall into one of a couple of groups. 1. Frequent enough that it is clear that the writer didn't even try to proofread or correct. 2. The typos are so obvious and glaring that it is distracting. 3. The writer used the wrong word entirely and it makes no sense. You see this often with writers that are trying to seem more intelligent by using bigger words. 4. The writer used the wrong word and it is very similar to the word I am pretty sure that they meant to use. For example, saying exaggerate instead of exacerbate or excite instead of incite.\\
5. Commonly misspelled words that just grate on my nerves. I cannot count the amount of times fanfic writers mix up quite/quiet and trail/trial. What makes it worse is that they are pronounced exactly like they are spelled, so there is no real excuse. This is completely ignoring to/two/too, their/they're/there...etc. I always make sure that I say it constructively and include positive feedback on what I like in the story so that it is encouraging and the author knows that it is coming from a place of support. If the story is bad, then I don't bother correcting technical details...I wouldn't hike through Chernobyl to make sure the floors were polished.

*** That's understandable. I read my fic a couple of times just to make sure nothing major stands out ,and constantly fix any typo I can find. I probably have missed some. That's why I'm getting a beta. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** Fun fact: The game is actually called 'Snape explodiert' in German ( which translates to Snape is exploding), never sure if the translator thought it was funny or just overlooked what they did but they did keep it throughout the whole series.

*** Yeah, another user already commented on the fact. I went to look for it in my German edition of the first book, yet couldn't find it anywhere because apparently Exploding Snap is introduced on the second book. Go figure. You learn something new everyday. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** I often record my stories in audio, then transcribe through Dragon. It usually works pretty well, but one time it was confused by 'Lord Voldemort'. . .

came out as 'Leonard Voldemort'

I'll never forget that one.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** how about using speech to text software that you have set to have a lesser-used spelling of a set of phonetically identical words be the one used. here is what the sentence was(word in "" was the one that was misspelled the first time): why don't you "come" into professor dumbledore's office, Mr. Potter.
