I'm searching for a AU/AR post HBP fanfic where Harry, Ron and Hermione end up living in a secret part of Grimmauld Place with Snape Dumbledore and the Malfoys. Hermione and Snape are partners and end up having feelings. Letter Snape has to rape her in order for her to live after being captured by death eaters. Can someone please point me to this story?!?! It's like my favorite.
