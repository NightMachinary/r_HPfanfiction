I'm having trouble finding/remembering a fanfic I read about a year ago in which Hermione and Draco are in a relationship (he redeemed himself) and eventually Theo joins in. It's really well-written, a little bit dark, and smutty. Theo is dealing with a tense relationship with his father in Azkaban, they all go to a beach house, Theo is uncomfortable because Hermione likes to be tied up by Draco. For some reason I think that "home" is in the title but I'm totally not sure.

Any ideas?


** I think it might be the alternate ending "After the Sea" to a fic by Colubrina called "The Die," but it appears to be deleted now gskdhglskdhgs. Her FF.net page says there is a link on her tumblr to download epubs but the alternate ending part doesn't seem to be on it which really sucks because I remember liking this fic a lot too.

*** If you have the link for the fic, you can try your hand at [[https://archive.org/][archive.org]]. I've also had luck with going to the [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php][bot's]] website and searching for lost fics.

Edit: Found the [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/download.php?source=ffnet&id=10747169&filetype=epub][epub]]!

**** Oh, thanks! I did search the archive but I'd never tried searching the bot before.
