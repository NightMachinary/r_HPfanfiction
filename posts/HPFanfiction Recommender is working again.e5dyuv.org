Hello everyone,

I haven't had access to Internet from a few months, (apart from some access for a week in September) and wasn't able to maintain my projects. I had hoped that they will keep working without issues, but sadly [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][HPFanfiction Recommender]] stopped working on September 30, 2019. The website was accessible but wasn't able to refresh the data. I am going to have Internet access for this week and will be able to fix any immediate issues that may arise.

Any feedback is appreciated.
