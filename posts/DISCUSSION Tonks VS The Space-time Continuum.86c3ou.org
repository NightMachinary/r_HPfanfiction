Like, give the gal a Time-Turner and you've already won. She can eliminate people after (for her) she sees them but before (chronologically) without causing paradoxes because she can then morph and replace them. Like, imagine death eaters about to try a hostage thing before they get stunned, put in the Auror holding cells, and replaced by like eight Tonkses who then actually carry out the whole situation as she saw it happen the first time but the hostage is also Tonks with a different face and right after Tonks Prime time-turns they all morph back and walk back to the Auror Department and everyone else is confused af.

  they all morph back and walk back to the Auror Department

And that's where the wheels fall off- like one Tonks could safely navigate a corridor, but if more than one was walking the same path they would inevitably collide, and the interaction between so many displaced molecules of cheery clumsiness colliding would kick off a temporal implosion sufficient to erase the presence of magic altogether.

... and she says she's really sorry about that, everyone.

*** now I'm just imagining ten Tonkses in a row walking into the Auror Department and one by one tripping over the exact same thing every single time.

** Tonks didn't quite believe it worked. It is amazing what toys the Unspeakables had hidden away. She was back at the beginning of the year. This was amazing! She could fix everything!

But she mustent mess with the timeline too much. Knowledge is power and she must preserve hers at all cost But how to do that and still be prepared to strike when the moment is hot?

Her mind wanders to a Death Eater attack that had happened early on in the year. Would happen a few weeks from now. She could stop it, of course, but even better, she could eliminate the attacker without anyone knowing.

There were some awesome things about being a metamorph, including an ease of intimidating people. Voldemorte won't know what hit him...

She had done so well on her planning, but somehow it had all turned out wrong. That doddling old fool and his machinations. But she still had the device. She could do it again. Maybe she could get Fawkes to take Dumbledore on an involuntary vacation. Playing a senile old school teacher would be easy. She could fix this....

Manipulating Harry Potter is a much more difficult task than it seemed at first. Tonks just didn't have it in her to play on his emotions the way that was needed to get all the pieces in the right place. The poor kid had been through so much, it was unfair to ask more. All he wanted was a bit of normalcy. Tonks looked down at the device in her hands. Well, she could give him that. Send him too an unplottable island with a magical supply of food and his course books. And she could deal with all the shit that goes down over the year. She wasn't looking forward to her first experience as a teenage boy, but the things we do for the cause...

She had been soooo close, but she had missed something. Some clue that would solve the problem. Honestly she had been distracted by Harry's letters. At first he had been happy to get away, but over time his letters grew more depressed and desperate. He wanted to see his friends. Well she supposed if she needed more time, she could reset and send a friend with him. Her first thought was Ron, but the image of what Molly would do to her once she found out stopped that idea dead. Hermione could use some time on an island paradise. That girl was wound entirely too tight. She would jump at the chance to spend some alone time with a magical library, and it would do wonders for Harry's mood. Tonks smirked. They were teenagers after all. Maybe she would enchant the magical cabinet to dispense less and less covering clothing over time. That should make Harry's letters all the more entertaining...

The damn minister was a fool! She had handed him Voldemorte and his followers on a silver platter and he blew it! Ok, calm down, this can be fixed. It wouldn't be hard to be at the Minister's house when it gets attacked. Let the death eaters do their thing then dispense of them. No one would know he was gone and she could fix this mess...

And thus magical Great Britain was slowly replaced with a world filled with Tonkses...

*** The armies of Good and Evil stood on the empty plains, ready to attack.

"CHARGE!" shouted Voldemort.

"CHARGE!" shouted Harry.

The armies collided, and spells flew. After about thirty seconds of pure chaos, a voice rang out across the battlefield.

"Hold up, hold up, wait a /second/!"

Everyone stopped and stared at the pink-haired auror.

"Lemme just check something real quick. Who here is /not/ me?"

Harry and Voldemort raised their hands. Nobody else did. Suddenly, each and every soldier on the field morphed into the same pink-haired auror. "Why are we even fighting, if everyone here is me?" asked one.

"I dunno, but its fun. Non-lethals only!"

Voldemort and Harry stared as their great battle devolved into a gigantic, every-Tonks-for-herself paintball battle. "You know," began Harry slowly. "I was wondering why that umbrella stand had started attacking /everyone/."

**** I'd love it even more if she didn't kill her targets ever, so somewhere in the world there exists Tonkskaban where every Death Eater is being guarded by a full staff of Tonkses. But they use metamorph powers to screw with the inmates, like impersonating their families or allies that haven't been captured. Then one day it's just a full staff of toddlers.

** One of the issues is that you can't change the past. It must be as you remember it.

The true solution is Tonks, a Time-Turner, and memory charms.
