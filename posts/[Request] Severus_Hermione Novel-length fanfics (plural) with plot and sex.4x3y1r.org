Hi all!

I'm on the hunt for novel-length or near-novel-length (like 20+ chapters) fanfics, with lots of graphic sex /and/ a plot. Featuring Severus and Hermione, please!

A few things I don't want:

1. /Unfinished or abandoned fics/. This is like, the biggest pet-peeve of mine EVER. I have literally cried tears of frustration because I get to the last chapter of a fic and it's a dead-end, with no chapters forthcoming, ever.

2. Main character death. So if the fic features Severus, Hermione, and Lucius, I don't want any of those three to die. Unless there's like, a resurrection or something.

3. Overly angsty stories. Some angst is okay, but I like stories that end on an upbeat note.

4. I don't want a story that reads like a slasher movie or a horror story. I haven't encountered any fics like this so far, but just in case.

5. Lack of grammar, punctuation, etc. I think this should go without saying, and I've never really read a long piece of fiction that has a whole lot of errors of this variety.


** Sin & Vice, Linkffn(11053807), is easily the best I've read so far. I also liked another story by the same author, the master the Warden the headmaster and the deputy, but I can't find the story number to link it. Pet project, which was already mentioned, is very good. Come back to me starts out strange and a bit slow, and gets progressively more awesome as the story continues. Linkffn(9234875)

I have a few more, but I can't think of the titles right now. I'll try to look them up when I get home. :-)

#+begin_quote
  Gently tracing the crease between his brows, the young witch wondered just how much she didn't know about the old wizard lying in the hospital bed before her. Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at her sadly for one last time. "Hermione," He whispered, "come back to me..." - A story involves an unusual form of time traveling and a timeless love.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

**** You know, I honestly don't remember? I don't read a lot of het smut, lol. Usually I just skim over it. It is definitely a slow burn, so if there was smut it would be much later on in the story.

** I love this fic so much. It is rather old and preHBP but part of a series. The other 2 stories are based around other couples but Severus/Hermione are prominent. It is a great little universe. This particular story is the first in the series. [[http://tasteofpoison.inkubation.net/viewstory.php?sid=3]] it is called Body of Knowledge by ArsenicJade

** You could search this on the subreddit. Look I did for you: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ycfy3/request_snape_romance_i_know_i_know/]]

Check out the first comment and probably others but I didn't bother looking.

Seriously though, if you're looking for a specific pairing, it's really easy to find.

I don't read HG/SS but I have seen these recommended loads of times: linkffn(7413926) linkffn(2290003)

*** It's not just the pairing I care about, it's the plot-with-sex part as well as points 1-5 in my original post. But thank you, romance is something I'm into so your help is good. :)

Edit: And it's hard to tell from fanfiction.net's rating system if the story is going to have explicit sexual content. For example, Pet Project is rated M, which it says is suitable for ages 16+, and the "mature adults only" rating is stated to be MA.
