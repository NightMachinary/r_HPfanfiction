Ones where he lives and gets to be happy

It can be Marauders time or Harrys time or in between. But he has to be the main focus.

It cant be more about Harry and his friends or James/Lilly or more about Remus. It is ok if its about his relationship with them or others.

No Sirius /OCs or characters who are essentially OC aka had their name mentioned maybe in canon but you have never gotten to know them in camon like for example Marlene Mckinnon ( Same with Snape and Remus anyone else who is a major character. Minor characters who arent well explored in canon like for example Regulus with ocs or essential ocs is fine)

No Sirius/ self insert ( or anyone else with a self insert)

No Sirius incest so no to him with Narcissa Bellatrix Tonks etc

And nothing with Sirius or anyone of his generation or older with Harry or people his generation. Even if it includes time travel.

No gender bending any of the characters

Apart from that any ship het slash femslash whatever is fine. No ships is also fine

Ive read A Black Comedy by Nojon, Promises Unbroken by Robin4, Innocent Marauderlover7, Stealing Harry Copperbadge, + sequels for fics that have them

Ive also read one I cant remember where Sirius pretends to be Dracos dog.

My favorite Sirius characterization ever was in Renascentia from the Ashes by Kuchikitopi and Tonberrys.
