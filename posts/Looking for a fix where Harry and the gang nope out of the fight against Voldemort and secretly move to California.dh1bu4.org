I need help finding this really off the wall story I stumbled across a long time ago. It involved Harry deciding he was tired of constantly fighting against evil and wanted to just live his life. I can't remember if this was after his fifth or sixth year. There was some legal loophole used at the beginning with a wizard lawyer to get Harry, Ron and Hermione emancipated and then secretly move to the States. I wanna say they settled in the Bay Area but I could be wrong. They got a house and started getting into the grunge/punk scene and it was pretty cool. Harry started smoking which was less cool but whatever.

Eventually they convinced Remus and Sirius to join them, they snuck out of the country as well and got a house.

Meanwhile back in Britain Luna and Draco were married I think and secretly rescuing people from Voldemort and smuggling them out to California as well? That's all I remember, I think it was unfinished at the time.

A lot of this sounds far fetched but it was really different and really well written. If anyone remembers it that would be awesome. As a plan B, if you don't know this story but know of something similarly off the wall/different I'd love to hear it. For example I just finished a Firefly/HP crossover by nonjohn called Browncoat, Green Eyes and I loved it. It's so different from what I usually read.


** I actually found it! It's called Rise Above on Ao3. The first story is complete but has a sequel that is a work in progress, appears to have been recently update too.

*** Thanks - I read through it and really enjoyed it. It's kind of fun to read a fic where Harry can sort of just be this guy, instead of having to be the Savior of the World.
