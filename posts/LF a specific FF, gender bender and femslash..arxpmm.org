I'm looking for a specific fanfiction with gender bender and femslash.

in this Fanfiction, for what I remember, Harry was a girl and she was adopted by an Auror (an original character).

Arrived at Hogwarts she was sorted into Ravenclaw and had a relationship with Daphne Greengrass (around the fourth or fifth year).

Other details that I remember:

- This fem Harry had eyes like Lily, but blond hair like petunia.

Thank you!
