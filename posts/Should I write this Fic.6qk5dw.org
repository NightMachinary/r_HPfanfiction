So today I was in a long line and while wondering what to do I had this idea for a fic.

Since I have never read something like this, I was wondering would people read it?

Also English is not my first language and neither my second, so please also say if my grammar and use of the language is up to the task.

basically would you read it?

This is the prologue, that is basically all that I have written, it's quite short, you should still be able to more or less understand what the story will be like.

The title is at the end because it's basically a big spoiler.

. . . . .

I am really happy, because five minute a go I was born. My name is Wendy. I don't mean to brag but I am a prodigy, I don't even have an hour and I am already self-conscious. Although to be fair I have to say that I have a twin, an older brother, and he just like me was self-aware just a few moments after being born. I guess or we are both prodigies or this is the norm. I don't really know my big brother is the only other member of my species that I know. Both my father and my mother are of different species after all.

I don't really know my mother, although I only have a few memories from before I was born almost all of them are about her. I remember that she was always with this strange old wizard with a strange name I don't remember. Just this morning the strange old wizard brought my mother over here to my father, who by the way is a strange wizard too just not as old. My mother, the old wizard were here for only half an hour, but thanks to that half of an hour that both me and my big brother exist right now.

Actually my father wanted to make us since seven years, seven months and seven days ago. That day he was wandering in the depth of an obscure forest somewhere, searching for the right wood to use in his work. Then he found them. Two of the most ancient and majestic threes that he had ever seen. A Yew and a Holly. How two so different trees were growing so near each other was a wonder. My father was delighted and after a few seconds he harvested the two most perfect branches, waiting for the perfect moment to use them. Which by the way was today.

My name is Wendy, my father is Garrick, my mother is Fawkes, and I am a Wand.

. . . . A Wand Story.

Also just to make things clear in my wand-lore wands recognize their maker as the father and the being that gave the heart as the mother, indipendently by their sex. I know that Fawkes is a male.

Please give your onest opinion. Should I write this.

And in any case thanks for reading

EDIT: in case I decide to write it would anyone (native English speaker If possible) wish to proofread?


** Hmmm. I'm really curious where this would go. You should definitely write it and give me the link. It's a unique idea that I've never heard of before. I wish I was as creative as you are =) plot just isn't my strong point

**** Your English is very good for someone whose first language isn't English. I think that you need to distinguish between 'which' and 'witch'. Although I'm no one to say as my first language is Arabic. I think your grammar also needs some improvement and with practice I think you'll get it. How old are you by the way? I'm 12 so I don't think I have any right to say any thing. You've got good vocabulary too. =)

***** I am a bit older 17. Thank you for your opinion. Ps. Already switched the 'witch' ( what embarrass! An HP fanfic author, or an aspiring one, that mistakes with witch ðŸ˜…)

****** I don't want to be too picky but seeing as you want to improve I think it's 'what an embarrassment' or 'such an embarrassment'. Hey, no one starts off as perfect ;)

Also, a bit older /than/ 17. A HP fanfic author instead of 'An HP' seeing as Harry doesn't start with a vowel. I'm honestly trying to help and not come off as rude or anything. Good luck with your fic =)

** Just one thing...

Flawkes... Really?

That Phoenix may have is flaws, but he's still named Fawkes.

** Here's a bunch of questions that you should probably answer (for yourself) before continuing to write this:

1. Are all Wands sentient?
2. Do wizards know that their wands are sentient?
3. How do you deal with the strong Horror-vibe of Wizards just casually snapping wands and thereby murdering sentient beings?
4. Can a Wand communicate in any way with its wielder?
5. If they can't you have a protagonist with zero agency, who can just observe. Is that a good idea for a story?
6. If they can, how would that affect the world? Winning a wand from another wizard can be much more important (espionage, gaining inside information)
7. For that matter, what about free-will? Olivander says the Wand chooses the wizard, but canon also suggests that they can be won in battle. Are Wands just superficial and vain and will align with anyone who's strong? Or are they forced by magic?

** The concept is unique I'd read it. And about your English I feel the same insecurities as yours, I fear that I'd use some weird word choise or the text will be seen as off or unnatural. I'm still practicing to express myself better in this language. I'm a native Spanish speaker by the way

** The concept is certainly unique, so I'll give it a chance solely because of that. In addition, your English is actually fairly good, considering it isn't your native tongue.

Best of luck with your writing.

** I'd say go for it. This is the first time I've heard of a concept like this.

Btw it's Fawkes, not Flawkes, unless it's not Dumbledore's phoenix then i apologize.

** While the concept sounds interesting, I don't see the story yet. Do some worldbuilding and planning before starting your project.

- What kind of story do you want to write? Do you want to describe the bond between harry and his wand? Do you want to describe the action? Do you want to describe the relation with the wand and fawkes? Do you want to explore the brother wand relation?
- Skip over uninteresting and known parts. Seriously, I don't want to read all canon events from the perspective of the wand if you don't add significant reason to it.
- What is the personality of the wand. Why did he choose Harry? What does it think of the Horcrux in Harry's head? How is the relation with Fawkes? How does he think of the brother wand? Is the elder wand his enemy or how does he look at it?
- Keep the story interesting. Plan it beforehand and don't spoil everything in the first few chapters. I wouldn't mind if some facts in canon are slightly changed for a better story.

** Why not, pal? I mean, what you got to lose? Nothing! It's a pretty interesting idea, I'd love to read this! Your english is pretty good, and there ain't nothing a good autocorrect can't solve! :D
