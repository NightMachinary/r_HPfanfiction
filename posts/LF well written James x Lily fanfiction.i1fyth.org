** linkao3(7042630).

As far as Lily's and James' characterisations are concerned, this is probably the best (and most canon accurate) there is, apart from the random Indian ancestry for James (fucking tumblr) and Remus randomly being bisexual.

In spite of those, it is still probably the most canon-accurate.

  When James Potter disappeared for ten days in the middle of the spring term of their fifth year, the whole school noticed. He buried his parents in a quiet ceremony and returned to school amid outrageous rumors. When Lily Evans disappeared for three days before the Christmas holidays in sixth year, two people noticed. She found the house packed, a nasty note from her sister, and spent the rest of the holidays sleeping rough. Both are left grieving and angry at Hogwarts over the summer, with no where else to go and war raging around them. Really, how else could it have gone?

*** Thanks for warning me, I am all for people imagining the characters having different backgrounds, but when it is repeatedly stated in writing and differs with what I've always imagined, it can be a little annoying. That said - thanks for recommending this story! I absolutely loved it, couldn't stop reading!

  Something must have happened for Lily to fall for him and choose to marry him, right?
#+end_quote

Well, this is a one shot but it's really good and it's about how Lily fell for James.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
