So, I'm writing this fanfiction and Lily and James had three other kids, apart from Harry. The thing is: I'm quite troubled with finding a fitting name for one of the brothers and finding a nice name for the girl (I wanted Rose, but it's a very overused name and, as I want to avoid the clich√©, I won't use).

Also, I don't want to use names like James Jr., Jim, Jamie and whatever.

I've thought about naming the boy after some British royal, which was why I'm considering the name Edward Potter. What do you think of the name? Is it fitting? Does it sound good? 'Cuz I have the feeling it isn't as catching as Harry Potter and I really want something that sounds nice

So, if anyone can give me options, for both boy and girl, with realistic names that fits within the 80s/90s, I would really appreciate.

Thank you!

Obs: I'm not a English native speaker, so I apologize for any mistake.


** Well, Harry was named after James' grandfather, Henry Potter. We also know that there was a Charlus Potter in the family - possibly James' uncle. James' father was named Fleamont.

That tells us that the Potters like names that run in the British royal family. Charles, Henry (Harry), James.

So: Edward, Albert, Andrew, William, and Charles are all strong contenders. Fleamont is also a perfectly good name to use, naming a child after James' father - we know that James and Lily have used names from the family before.

As for girls. Lily and Petunia are both flower names. If you were to follow that vein, there are /so many/ flower names for girls:

Primrose. Daisy. Marguerite. Jasmine. Azalea. Violet. Marigold. Bryony. Dahlia. Heather. Holly. Ivy. Sage.

Or, alternately, James' mother was named Euphemia. You could go in that direction.

** You could also look at Order of the Phoenix, and some of the female names of the folks who have passed from the original Order. Alice could fit here, even though she's not dead, Mary, and Marlene are the only three I know off the top of my head. They would all be people Lily and James knew, it's possible they would name a child after them (kind of like Harry named his kids after people he knew).

*** I could see this, even if Alice or Marlene were used as middle names like how Harry used Luna's.

I could see her continuing the flower/botanical names: Holly and Rose are over-used and cliche, but they fit in quite nicely. An author could also use Harry's deceased maternal grandmother (Lily and Petunia's mother) as being called Rose.

If Harry were born a twin, I could see Holly and Harry being used together: parents tend to have matching names for twins, like Rachel and Rebecca.

** As unfortunate as it sounds, I think Lily would probably call her daughter Petunia. Sure, they don't get along, but I think she would do it anyway, for the sake of their one time closeness.

**** ... Where do you think Harry got his naming skills from? Whole lotta questionable decisions outta the HP/GW family. James Sirius? Reasonable. Albus Severus? Uhh, sure about that bud? Pigwidgeon? I dunno how Ginny came up with that but at least she didn't make original names for her kids.
