I really don't remember too much, as it wasn't one of my favourites, but my cousin wanted to read it. all I remember is one scene, so I'm not too hopeful about finding it. But I figured I may as well give it a shot

In the scene, a woman gives harry a magical ball which would fill with silvery liquid, and get warmer depending on his magical power. Most people didnt fill it much at all, but Harry (in classic super!harry style) fills it to the top, and it burns his hands. Does anyone remember this?


** Possibly joe6991's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Sword of the Hero]]? There's a scene very much like this in the story.
