Does anyone else get distracted by the minutia of worldbuilding, or are more interested in the worldbuilding than telling a story?

I've been "working" on a fic for a year or two and am still on the first chapter because I constantly go off on tangents to research stuff and do worldbuilding. 'Course, mine is extremely AU so there's lots of worldbuilding to do.

For example, I decided I needed to know more about the wizarding economy/make it actually sensible so I adjusted the exchange rate of galleons to muggle currency based on the price of gold plus a big markup because goblins are bastards. I, uh, [[https://i.imgur.com/8rEeFKi.png][made a calculator]] and I've been setting prices for all the things the characters might need to buy.

I'm also making a constructed language that part of the magical population speaks.


** Extremely so. I'm working on an extremely AU fic right now, and spend most of the time in-between updates reading reference material and jotting down notes that are sometimes only share a tenuous connection to the main plot.

But because I don't want it to bloat every chapter, I try and hold back when actually writing, only revealing stuff that Harry will encounter to keep it organic while occasionally using the POV of other characters to shed more light on the expanded world. It's had a Marmite effect so far, it seems.

Everything has a Domino effect, of course, so I usually curse five seconds after having a 'bright' idea because it means having to compensate for decades worth of material (in-universe).

The calculator and language sounds pretty involved though - wishing you all the best!

Agreed. Well done worldbuilding will allow the world to come to life without needing to infodump.

You know my pain. I often manage to get through a sentence or three before going off on a tangent researching something: historic regions of England, Proto-Celtic linguistics, the price of gold in 1991, etc.

This is some creepy deja-vu right here... I've been doing pretty much the same thing! Historic regions of the British Isles to conjure up a believable quasi-landed gentry, Proto-Celtic linguistics for chants used for rituals... that one has proved fruitless so far, lol.

***** The sources for it are pretty sparse, and those that are available tend to be very old and/or academic.

In my setting I have the magical population separating from muggles much earlier and a portion of the population speaking a language that split off from Old Irish.

I might be able to help if you have questions.

****** Indeed. I spent more than a couple of early mornings trawling the web for info. All I found were a few PDFs containing a list of possible root words.

Many thanks for the offer: mind if I send you a PM?

** Not so much, no.

I view the world of Magic and Muggle as intensely different. To get around the wizard vs muggle money I just say that wizarding gold is perfected using alchemy, and worth a ton more than ordinary muggle gold. Simples.

For the more mundane things (prices etc...) I would say the character pulled a fistful of coins out of his bag and pocketed the change. No fuss, no muss.

It's quite interesting to do worldbuilding, but it got in the way of my plot/message/theme and what have you - and I hate wasting time on excess wording so I scrap it out to put in a static "he did this/ she that" "He couldn't afford it / could handily afford it"

Blehblahbluh.

As for a language . . . good luck. Interesting if you pull it off, I tried myself but my brain goo'd out of my ears and eyes when I starting reading big words like . . . /syntax/ and /linguistics/ (shudders).

The problem is actually exactly the opposite. Gold is worth waaay more than canon implies. According to Rowling a galleon is worth £5, but assuming it's solid gold it would actually be worth hundreds of pounds. I don't think the goblins would be stupid enough to set the exchange rate that low. All it would take is one enterprising muggleborn to destroy the entire magical economy by exchanging pounds for galleons and then selling the gold from the galleons in the muggle world (or at least damage it before the goblins caught on).

Heh, conlanging is one of my hobbies so it was a natural fit when I started doing very AU worldbuilding.

**** Ahh. In my fic I say a galleon is around £15-20. I might also say that there are laws against selling money enforced by charms. In my fic I think if you let a muggle get a hold of your wizarding money it's taken off you (Statute of Secrecy breached etc...)

Best of luck anyhow with your fic. Mine's a reet bugger to get sorted, currently on V.4.4, re-write attempt 3.

. . . It's humbling.

And to think there's three sequels, egad!

** Happens to me all the time - especially when I write AUs. JKR's world just feels so incomplete to me and I get this urge to fill in all the blanks (sometimes at the expense of the plot unfortunately).

** Nope. I can visualize an entire world in my head with excellent detail. I can even split them apart and have different worlds with minor variations.

** I've said to my friends before that JKR doesn't do world building. So when I read FF or write FF in character driven universes I tend to flesh out that world.

I feel that character driven novels are wonderful. But when you set your characters into a world and span their story across books/time/whatever you need a solid world to play in.

** I feel incredibly inferior to your calculator, but just here popping in saying you're not alone.

I'm writing an AU drabble series, and somewhere along the way I realized I wanted to get really in-depth with magical orientation and branches of magic in general... but didn't have word count for that nor the understanding that my audience wanted it.

So I made a "guide" (has a table of contents, clickable links that direct you to various other relevant sections, a timeline just for the heck of it, and a rudimentary -small- table showing the effects of magical orientation on casting power) and posted it as the last chapter of the drabble series. Whenever I update, I move the guide back to the (new) last chapter.

It has a bit of other stuff in there too, such as behind-the-scenes character crafting and itty bits that I write in the comments explaining when a reader expresses curiosity about a certain aspect, but have no room for in the actual 100 word drabbles (or author's note).

Well, as long as we have fun, right?
