Harry somehow finds a book on prominent British wizarding families.

He sees he's related to the Malfoys/Narcissa. He sends them a letter, and they respond.

*** That was a really good read, I sat here and read the whole thing in one go.

Any idea what happened to the sequel? The AN at the end says there is one, but I can't find it? Did it just never end up getting written?

**** Yeah it's quite good.

No idea about the sequel, unfortunately.

*** I actually well probably should have mentioned it, but this is the one that left me wanting more Harry with the Malfoys.
