Instead of being left with Vernon and Petunia Dursley, Dumbledore gets some common sense and decides to leave Harry with Lily's Mother's Maternal Half-Sister's Son, a Scottish man named Edwin Evans. As a result, Harry grows up loved, cared for, and very Scottish. (Didn't see any Scottish Harry fics, so decided to make a prompt and post it here.)

** I mean, just to be pedantic, Evans is a Welsh surname so this prompt probably works better for Welsh Harry, not Scots Harry.

Also, and without wanting to be rude, I'm not quite sure what, as others have said, the point would be. I'm half and half English and Scottish, and honestly there's not a huge difference in culture on one side of my family to the other, other than accent, slang words, and the fact that schools run to a slightly different timetable and the qualifications have different names - which wouldn't even apply here as Harry would be going to Hogwarts anyway.

So yeah, genuinely interested what you mean OP by "grows up very Scottish." If you're looking for a fic where he talks in an exaggerated Scots accent, wears a kilt and eats Haggis, it's a hard no from me and probably everyone else with Scots blood on this sub! However, if you wanted something where Harry deals with magical creatures based in the Scottish myths - so Brownies instead of house elves (JKR bastardised Brownies for house elves anyway); he's not remotely freaked out about Remus because he's grown up knowing the myth of the wulvers instead of the werewolves; yet he's terrified of the Patronus charm because it looks like a Willow-the-Wisp and so on, that could be an interesting way to do it.

** Check this one. His adopted family is Scottish but is not as an influential factor as you would like.

  Harry is convinced he's going to die as he waits to start the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, and looking back on his life... he's not happy with how it turned out. When he receives advice from an unexpected source, well, what's a pissed off savior to do? Mild Dumbledore and Ron bashing.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** What possible difference does Harry living a couple of hundred miles to the north make? Unless all you're wanting is for people to badly write a stereotype of a Scottish accent?

Also, if the guys surname is Evans then he needs to be on Lily's father's father's side. Unless you're wanting an "Oh what a coincidence, I'm an Evans and your mum was an Evans. How random!" scene.

*** The Scottish have a very different culture from the English even the Welsh have their own culture from the English. Yes it's very tightly nit but they do. Your comment is as ignorant as someone who looks at the United States and asks how someone from LA could be different from someone who lives in Phoenix.

Scotland is 500 miles away from London where Harry was raised in Canon, and their are plenty of cultural differences to be had that would be interesting to see in a fic.

**** Speaking as a Scottish person who has spent a lot of time in England, the culture is functionally identical. The only differences that would come out in a fic are the accent and a handful of traditions that would be mentioned once and irrelevant thereafter.

***** This. I've got a Scottish dad and an English mum. There's very little difference between the two cultures, unless you get into really stereotypical stuff about kilts, haggis and bagpipes. Which would totally ruin a fic for anyone remotely familiar with Scotland.
