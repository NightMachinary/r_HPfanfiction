Hi guys I'm looking for a Harry Potter fanfic I read a long time ago. All my basic searches have come up with nothing. The story is Harry is evil and tried to take conquer the world but was imprisioned in some crystal prison and centuries later the prison is found and opened by scientists. It's set in the future with space travel, Harry is found by pirates he kills the main pirate and becomes the pirate leader taking his ship, he uses rune and blood magic to make better weapons for the pirates and gains their loyalty, eventually he gets back to earth and finds a magical cache he had hidden but loses an eye, sorry for the long rant I tried to put as much info as I can remember.


** The fic was called The Star Empire by RahXephon, but it was removed for complaints about content. There used to be an archive of it on fictionhunt, but that must have expired or something. The author tamed it down and posted it as The Star Hegemony, but that seems to have been dropped as well. There is an archive of the Star Hegemony [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=65949&chapter=0][here]], but you'll have to grab the text by chapter (or maybe someone who reads Russian can tell us which button to push to download the whole thing).

*** press "‚Üì –°–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏–µ ‚Üì", contents will pop up, along with

"–ß–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –≤ fb2 | –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –≤ ePub",

which means "open as one text/ Download archive in fb2/download archive in ePub"

*** I mean, I don't blame the people who complained. The whole idea's a little far fetched üòÖ

**** I've seen crazier plot ideas than that in Harry Potter fanfics. Originality isn't a good reason for complaint.

***** Can anyone recommend a fix along the same lines, where the protagonist is dark and evil and wants to take over the world/universe and isn't afraid to get bloody?

** This is The Star Empire by RahXephon. It's been removed from a few places that used to host it, I'm not sure where you would be able to grab a copy but it's probably out there somewhere.
