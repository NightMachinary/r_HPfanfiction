I saw something called "public beta" on a Russian fanfiction site ficbook.net (it might also be used somewhere else, but I haven't encountered it).

How it works is simple, readers can select any amount of text on the page (a single character, a word, a sentence...) and submit an improved version. It's entirely up to the author to use it or not.

It's quick and convenient compared to the clunky way some reviewers do it on FFN (copying and pasting portions of text into the review to let the author know where they made a mistake).

Just wondering if anyone else thinks this is a cool idea? I'd love to see something like that on FFN or AO3.


** I would love this. There are so many times I'm reading a fic, and I see a silly typo (not instead of now, a an and issues, little things). It would be really hard to tell the author exactly where the typo is, and writing a review for one mistyped letter seems really picky...

** Readers point out typos in my stories fairly regularly, but I rarely go back and fix them because of the hassle of reuploading the chapters to FFN (if the files are gone), formatting them correctly, and swapping out the documents. A way to edit the chapters that are already posted would be really helpful.

** Don't the forum based story sites have it naturally? I remember stuff like this over on Spacebattles. Though, yes, ff.net could definitely use this. Would be a good litmus test on how much authors care about the quality of their grammar and stuff and probably not bloat review numbers so much.

** Oh my lord, this would be so useful. I tend to make a lot of childish mistakes that somehow Word doesn't pick up. Word 2013 is trash compared to '07, at least in my opinion. A lot of my errors are simple things like that or spacing issues, such as: he was rather intelligent, even a she acted simple-minded.

I don't pick 'em up when I beta read either. I wish that sites had this, tbh. Many sets of eyes are better than one or two.
