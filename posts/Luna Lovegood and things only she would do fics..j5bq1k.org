Luna Lovegood Centric

Language- English

Platform- Any and All.

Genre and Rating- All.

Stories or one-shots that are on Luna. I don't know how to word this but fics that capture her behaviour. The sort of things that will make you think 'Yup, only Luna would do this' in a fond bemused manner.

I can give examples of some fics-

Story: Beauty in Death [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101830/1/8]]

(Luna talks of Threstals. First person POV.)

Story: Dementors are born freezing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13406699/1/10]] (A moment between a lone dementor and luna on the outskirts of Forbidden forest. And how she gave a little of her heat to dementor and he felt the chill go away for first time

Story: Luna's Apparitions [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3727513/1/56]] (Trio shows other Marauders Map and Luna says that the map is missing a ballroom and takes them to the ball of ghosts and wraith.)

Story: Spirits of Hallowtide [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779677/1/24]]

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** Luna's Hubby: linkffn(2919503) Luna rescues Harry from the Dursleys on a whim, the story goes from there. I describe it as "Luna Lovegood Being Her Wonderful Self: The Fanfic".

It does show its age in several ways - for example, the names that weren't known yet at that time are different, among more spoiler-y things. Luna's Dad is named Larry, which is frankly a little jarring to me - I would recommend using a word-swapping browser extension to swap the word "Larry" to "Xenophilius".
