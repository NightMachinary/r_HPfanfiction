**** To all honesty, I'm looking for fics take place in Grimmauld as well. Most post-war fic just dismiss the place saying it's full of unpleasant memories and such, which personally doesn't make much sense to me, as that is the only place where Harry could feel a connection to his past, and of course, it's his bleeding house, at least deal with it instead of ignoring it?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I have a couple Drarry fics where Grimmauld Place is sentient and is a main part of the story, if you're interested - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703?view_adult=true][House Proud]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10615911/1/Building-It-Together][Building It Together]].

â€‹

Edit because I remembered another Drarry fic with Grimmauld Place as a main element - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12045300/chapters/27273531][Nearly Lost Things, Carefully Tended]].

"Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway."

First of a series and the first and best Sirius escapes Azkaban and raises Harry fics I've ever read.

** I posted this the other day so this fic might be familiar to you: but Summer of the Phoenix is set in grimmauld between GoF and OOTP. Really excellent characterization.

** I recall linkao3(10588629) framing grimmauld as kind of a character in its own right, but it was still unresolved when I dropped the fic at about chapter 100

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
