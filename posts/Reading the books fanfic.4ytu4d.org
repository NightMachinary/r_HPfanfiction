** As far as i'm aware there are not fully completed reading the books FF, especially for the last three books. The only one I know of that has come close is "Cris Potters life" but it still leaves off in the sixth book.

*** I can't think of the name, but there's this absolutely dreadfully written on FFN where they read all seven books with Regulus Black, Narcissa Malfoy, Draco, James and Lily, Sirius, Tonks, and Remus, who came back from the grave at the cost of Harry and Ginny becoming these really fucking stupid "Lycan" things.

** Jberns "The Lie I've Lived" and a few others by this author are some of the best i've ever read. The duels are amazing; dialogue too. Many unique ideas. Most of his fan fics start latter hogwarts(4-7) although mostly AU. I think this author is actually published now.

*** I've read most of the large fan fics. Try "The Awakening Power" by sib-ff. "The Hidden Hero" by EveBB.

All these I mentioned are probably considered action/adventure. Jbern's "Bungle In The Jungle" is really good too; complete and with a sequel. These are written in 2nd person which is a little strange but turns out to be pretty engaging.

** I read a good one where the cast from OotP read Deathly Hallows over the Christmas Holidays. It was removed from fanfiction.net but is on fictionhunt. It had a sequal which is still on fanfiction.net where the characters use the information from the book to change what happens and save lives.
