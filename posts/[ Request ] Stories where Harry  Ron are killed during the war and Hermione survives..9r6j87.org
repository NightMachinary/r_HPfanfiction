** This is one where Harry dies, but Ron does survive. It's still a worthwhile read through and I thought it was very in character for Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  It is six years since the fall of the Ministry to Voldemort. Those other than purebloods are deemed less than human. When Ginny's daughter ends up in grave danger, Hermione sells herself to the Death Eaters to save her life. Draco/Hermione. Not fluffy.
