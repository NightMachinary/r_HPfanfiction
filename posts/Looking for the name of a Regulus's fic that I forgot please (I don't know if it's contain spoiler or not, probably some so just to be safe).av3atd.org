So, I have been searching for a fanfic that I read about one or two weeks ago, but I forgot the name of that fic. It's about Regulus asked Sirius to meet up with him on the day he go to the Cave, but Sirius go met him in Padfoot form so Regulus didn't recognized him and thought that was a Grim, so he decided it's was the time to go into the cave anyway. Sirius watched Regulus and Kreacher go into the cave, and after Kreacher had gone he somehow saved Regulus and turned him into a box to get both of them out. Well that's all I could remember, if you know the name of the story or the source, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!!

P.S. please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker ='((
