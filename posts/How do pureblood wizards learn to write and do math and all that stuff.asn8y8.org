**** IRL private tutoring can be the best education imaginable. For example, John von Neumann was taught by his governess and received tutoring in English, French, German and Italian until the age of ten.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Early_life_and_education][However, von Neumann was a genius who could by the age of six could divide eight-digit numbers in his head and also converse in ancient Greek]].

Apparently the whole pre-Soviet Hungarian system was this way. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Early_life_and_education]["Children did not begin formal schooling in Hungary until they were ten years of age"]].

Edit: I misunderstood your statement. I assumed that you meant that they would be incredibly stupid because they'd received bad early education

**** Quick, define the mid-point theorem.

It states that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is always parallel to third side and half its length.

If you're unable to remember, the mid-point theorem is taught in high school mathematics - trigonometry.

High school mathematics may be useful to someone who makes use of it later in his life, like a mathematician, physicist, engineer or whatever. Nearly everyone else forgets it - that does not make them stupid.

***** Even mathematicians forget it. It fades into the background and becomes obvious.

You don't remember the mid point theorem, nor do you use it.

Notice for example that this isn't only true for half the length of the sides but for any fraction of the length of the sides. In a way it can be seen as a consequence of the fact that scaling things doesn't really affect angles.

The theorems you remember are foundational theorems, things like the Pythagorean theorem or the sum of angles theorem.

On the other hand, learning it in the first place is essentially a mental exercise. Most studies agree that education helps develop a child's cognitive abilities.

Type matters too. You don't develop verbal intelligence through math exercises, and you don't develop spatial intelligence through essays. I'd also argue that essays aren't gonna improve much from grade school levels without a dedicated language and literature class to expose kiddies to different registers and forms of writing.

**** I don't know about you, but most of the maths (trigonometry, calculus) I learned in school I never used afterwards. The only really useful mathematics was statistics, but the higher level stuff is only applicable to reading scientific or academic literature.

So I don't think the average pureblood is stupid if they can't interpret a confidence interval. And wizards have their own version of math class, Arithmancy at Hogwarts. If they took that as an elective, and self-studied or had tutoring in the summer, they wouldn't be that far off. Not PISA-exam quality, but does wizarding society need much more than standard literacy?

In actual fact, Tales of the Beedle the Bard, published in the 1400s, was written in runes (and thus presumably was written in either Norse or Anglo-Saxon or a similar language). So the "lingua franca" of medieval magical (northern) Europe appears to be something Germanic, not Latin.

******** The Statue of Secrecy wasn't enacted until the late 1600s. That a children's book, a popular gathering of fairy tales, was published in the native language is nothing new. In fact several such works were published in the Muggle world in their native languages. But academic work was different, it was almost exclusively done in Latin, so that a person from Germany, Italy or France could easily read what was published in England. So your argument falls flat.

********* The Statute of Secrecy isn't really relevant to the discussion. It's well established that the statute put into law that which was already well established socially: the division of magical and Muggle societies. For example, magical Britain had a separate government from at least the 1200s.

In any event, if you're saying that Anglo-Saxon and the use of runes was the native language in magical England in the 1400s, you're already admitting that magical and Muggle England had different languages at the time. In Muggle England, Anglo-Saxon runes stopped being used around the 600s and Anglo-Saxon (thereafter in a Latinate script) stopped being used as a literary language after 1066. So Anglo-Saxon runes continued to exist as a living language in general use in magical England for around 700 years after they fell out of general use in Muggle England.

Very daring statements to make. Remember that even Hogwarts motto is in Latin, shouldn't it be in runes as you try to present? If runes or a Germanic language were the most common language of the academics who wrote books and definitely went to Hogwarts, why isn't the Hogwarts motto (established after year 1000 at least) in that language?

*********** Firstly, you're rather sneakily shifting goal posts. No one said anything about the "language of the elite". We were talking about the language of spellbooks, not the language of "the elite". Indeed, there's no evidence at all that magical elite would have a different language to the others. It's a small community which has possessed universal education for centuries, where the elite attend the same school as everyone else. It's highly unlikely that there is any linguistic divide within the wizarding community in Britain.

Secondly, "best evidence" applies here, I think. When it comes to the language used in medieval wizarding Britain, we have an example of a book which we know to have been widely circulated, read, and popular enough to become a cultural touchstone. A four-word school motto does not displace that evidence. Many Muggle schools have mottos in Latin; that doesn't say anything about the language in use in the Muggle world. Trying to present a school motto as in some sense good evidence of the language in use, either every day language or the language of literature, is rather grasping at straws.

That book is the only evidence of wizarding medieval literature we have. Combined with the fact that Hogwarts teaches runes like Muggle schools teach Latin, I think it's very strong evidence that runes are to British wizards as Latin is to British Muggles. And if people really consider that a book does not evidence the common language or the language of literature, then the alternative is simply "we don't know", not "it must be Latin". There's no real evidence of Latin use at all, and the above two items of evidence at the very least serve to rebut any presumption that you can infer language at use in the medieval wizarding world based on language in the Muggle world.

****** Understanding Latin would be helpful for recognizing the probable intent of an unknown spell in battle or other circumstances.

Even in the real world, knowing Latin is helpful for learning uncommon words that have Latin roots, for intuitively recognizing uncommon medical terms, botanical terms, etc. Understanding Latin roots cuts down on the amount of required memorization, so I imagine it would be helpful for remembering new spells as well.

I mean, it's not like English classes in Muggle schools teach you how to write essays. English class is spent analysing literature, no? Or at least it was when I was at secondary school. It doesn't teach you stuff like grammar or punctuation etc.

You learn how to write essays by writing essays. There's no better practise than doing it. You generally learn more about essay writing in classes like history than you do in English.

Hogwarts has plenty of classes where you write essays and get practice at essay writing. It doesn't need an "essay writing" class.

(As for biology, there's no evidence that it's required to perform transfiguration etc. Indeed, given that students are transfiguring animals as early as second year, frankly there's no possible way that understanding the physical/biological features of the object is a requirement for transfiguration. Twelve-year-olds simply cannot have a complete or even deep understanding of an animal's biology. All signs point to the knowledge required to perform transfiguration being knowledge of the magic at play, not of the biology of the target.)

** It depends on the type of job that you want to use, later in life; but in all honesty I use very little math irl. I also use very little history, I use very little science and everything else.

Honestly, the stuff we learn in school; half of it we don't really need. (Heck, maybe even more than half we don't need).

I use very simple math, I'm really good at writing, but a lot of that is from writing stories on my own.

Your parents can always teach you, or failing that; then you can get personal tutors that are experts in their respectful fields.

I absolutely hated learning when I went to school, being confined to learn just certain things derailed me from being interested at all. If we had more freedom with the learning, it would have been more interesting to me.

Many kids, like you, end up in careers that don't use most of the knowledge they gained from school, but the point of their education was to give them background in a wide enough range of subjects so that they can /choose/ from many different career options that use that knowledge.

The alternative would be specialized trade schools that only give kids enough knowledge to pursue a specific path preassigned to them. Certainly, that would be less wasteful for those kids who prefer that career path, but it also ruins social mobility for the ones who would prefer to make a more educated decision about their career path when they are older.
