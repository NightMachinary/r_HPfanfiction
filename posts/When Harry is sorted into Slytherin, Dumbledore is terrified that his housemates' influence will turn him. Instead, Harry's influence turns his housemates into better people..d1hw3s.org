*** Is this one of those tamer WBWL fics? Because I love the idea, but they always have some degree of James and Lily forgetting Harry exists, Harry being an edgy douche despite the narrative trying it's best to make him look awesome and and incompetent, obese and self-absorbed caricature for the brother.

****** I'm rereading it currently. The best part of it is how nobody is an idiotic caricature of a person, even if they seem so at the time. All the silly tropes are recognized and addressed or explained, but not right away, so some things seem really dumb at first, but end up adding a lot to the story.

I put it away last year, as it hadn't been updated for awhile, but it seems the author is slowly adding more.

Though I'm quite interested in the concepts of the magic in the Anathema Codex, wild magic and the old gods of Britain, I don't care about the plot anymore.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

****** Sounds like my impression of Stages of Hope. First couple of chapters I thought it was tropey. They kinda simmered down, but I haven't finished it yet. Stuff is explained away, but it's still a whole bunch of why? Like Neville and Luna being rescued, but no surprise attack by Voldemort. Things just stick to their advantage. Lily wanting to connect with Harry way too far into the chapter, when it should have been earlier. There's a lot of other things I'm definitely forgetting that I find odd about it. Weirdest trope on the author's part, is denial that Harry and Hermione are a couple. You can't convince me those two are just sibling like when they do the trope of hand squeezing for comfort, and have buried their faces in each other's hair/neck way too many times.

I do like the writing though, how Snape and Sirius are friends, and how Harry doesn't respect Dumbledore's opinion, but they get along anyway.

*** It is great, Harry's influence is good to the Slytherins, but Dumbledore is worried for other things, and he hasn't showed antiSlytherin prejudices. James Potter, by the way, is absolutely crazy antiSlytherin, and terrified.

The plot seems to indicate James has a motive for that.

*** They might not have a choice, if the Sorting Hat can read their entire mind.

But I don't recall a single Slytherin student in Harry's era who is characterised by cunning. Certainly not the boastful, bullying, confrontational Draco Malfoy who leans on his father's success. Not his hangers on; that's sheep behaviour, not cunning. And they have /Crabbe and Goyle/; was the Sorting Hat hitting the methylated spirits or something?
