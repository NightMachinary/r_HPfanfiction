Like the title says anything is fine


** Since anything is fine I'll reccomend this

[[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/]]

I feel I have to point out that it's technically slash. But while their relationship is relatively relevant to the plot, there are no terribly overt displays of it.

Also, it's quite a bit AU.

It is, however, one of my absolute favourites. With a gripping plot. It also makes me laugh everytime.

Please give it a try.

  Fairytale AU. Loosely inspired by Beauty and the Beast. Some said he was once a man, cursed, and some that he sold his soul to demons and became one in turn. Others said that such evil as he could never have been human. That he was instead a nightmare, left lingering upon the earth a very long time ago.Harry just knew it wasn't safe to walk near the Riddle House after dark.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?
