What are the best Harry Potter/ Naruto crossovers out there?


** Most of the fanfiction I read falls into either Naruto or Harry Potter, so I always keep an eye out for crossovers between the two. Let me just say that there aren't many good ones out there.

The problem is that the HP and Naruto universes do not mesh well at all. They have two completely different worlds and cultures. That's not even bringing up what you do with the difference between chakra and magic. It's all very messy and it becomes very difficult to do well and believably.

That being said, I believe that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]] by romantiscue is by far the best I've come across.

Summary: Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

It's basically Hermione reincarnated into Sakura's body. It's well written and Team 7 is characterized splendidly. In my opinion, it's really one of the best Naruto/HP crossovers.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** You're in luck, those two are my all time fandoms!

I'll save you the trouble and just link everything that's decent enough to read.

linkffn(The Biggest Toad in the Puddle by Tsume Yuki;Standing in the sun by tsume yuki;Prompt me by tsume yuki). The first one is a MoD!Harry as Jiraiya's bastard son, nothing much happens before its abandoned, but its pretty fun. There's not much to say about the second one, but the prompt me is a collection of short romance stories, most of which are Fem!Harry paired up with a Naruto guy.

There's also linkffn(Auryn by Araceil;Connections by Sophie3; Against the Odds by PolarPanther;All Hallows' Eve - Konoha by WhisperingDarkness;Find me a white knight cloaked in black by cywcross;hope on the wind by reinamy's cloud;Multicolor Post Its by wingwyrm;The Girl With RedHair by Renatus;Reality Bends by madrigal-in-training) all of which have pretty okay writing. If you don't mind the quality and eye twitching there's also linkffn(Deer Tracks by Hermione).

You can also check out Mrs.InsaneOnes stories. Though I really can't recommend them because of the (for me) boring writing and too much exposition, but maybe you might like them?
