Simple premise- Lockhart successfully memory charms Harry and Ron. What happens next?


** Lockhart realises that leaving the Chamber of Secrets is not that easy. (There probably is some kind of stairway that can be opened with Parseltongue even though nothing is told about it.) He is stuck there until the revived young Tom Riddle comes from the main hall, kills him, Harry, and Ron, and leaves. It is possible that Lily's sacrifice would prevent Riddle from killing Harry and kill him instead. But in that case the amnesiac Harry would still starve to death, and once Voldemort returned, there would be no one to stop him. If Riddle survived and left, it would cause a calamity to the wizarding world. (I like to think that Diary-Tom would, after gaining an own body, decide to usurp Voldemort, because why would any Tom Riddle be content with being a subordinate to someone else?)

*** I doubt Harry and Ron would be down there long enough to starve. The instant Hermione wakes up, the whole thing is exposed, Dumbledore heads on down there with a rooster, and that's all she wrote.

Yeah, given their personality, I definitely think the two Voldemorts would end up fighting each other- which might actually benefit the good guys to an extent.

***** If no more subtle means of getting past the security occurred to him, sure. Heck, if Ron could fake being a parselmouth, I'm sure Albus could.

*** Harry doomed Lockhart the moment he went into his office. He was not going to survive to Riddle or the snake. And apparently there was no good outcome for him in trying to rebel either. He had 0% chance of living a mentally healthy life after that point.

** Swung by Seraphim linkao3(9821300) is based on this premise. Ron only loses a few minutes, but Harry loses all memories after Voldemort killing his parents. Some of this is beneficial - his clear memory of that night reopens the investigation into Sirius' guilt or innocence. ("Daddy said he was gonna thrash Uncle Peter.") But mostly, Harry is starting from scratch, a blank slate, while everyone else has preconceived ideas about who he is.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Is this a bashing fic or not?

Because if it was, the Obliviate somehow raises Ron's intelligence. And the Obliviate hits the horcrux, which spreads to all of the horcruxes and the main soul- rendering Voldemort a moot point. AND takes the "power he knows not" to a whole new level.

-

What happens next? He goes to buy a lottery ticket. The cosmic luck required to successfully cast TWO memory charms with a broken wand is insane. Then he realizes that he's stuck down there without a parselmouth and gets murdered by VoldeGinny.

Seriously, that was Lockharts endgame? He enters into a vault and destroys the only way out. And this is Lockhart we are talking about, the guy who couldn't do anything correctly to save his life.
