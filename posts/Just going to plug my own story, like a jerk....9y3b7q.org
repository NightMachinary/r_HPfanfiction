Have you all seen Hilda on Netflix? I have and was immediately charmed off my feet. As a result, I was inspired to begin a crossover fic combining my newest obsession with my oldest--Harry Potter. I only started it this week, but I'm at 17,000 words and I've never been so inspired.

I know it's rather obnoxious to be self-publicizing my own work, but if you love Harry Potter and you love Hilda, I ask that you give this story a chance. The link is included below.

** It is okay Waffle! :) Self promotion posts are acceptable because yes if they were not they would not have /tags!/ :) :) I have never seen HILDA before but I do like Harry Potter so yes I will read like the first chapter! :)
