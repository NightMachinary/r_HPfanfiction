I'm writing No Longer Alone, which is centred around Harry becoming part of the Tonks family after being taken from the Dursleys after the Third Year.

There is no on-screen abuse but several discussions of canonical abuse (so no rape plots or marking with a fire iron). I'm trying to depict the whole thing as gradual change. Harry does not go around calling Andromeda "Mum" the day after being taken in by them or immediately thinks that his new family is the go-to option for everything after being forced to do things alone for 13 years.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

  Clark comes back a little bit wrong---or maybe more than a little bit. He poses a danger to anybody close to him, in more than one way. There's only one person he can think of who's learned enough about Kryptonian biology to help him and isn't currently in prison; and Wayne owes him, anyway. At least he won't have to feel guilty about lashing out anymore, if he's doing it at the guy who tried to kill him. Except "lashing out" doesn't really cover it, after a while---and maybe Wayne's in over his head just as far as Clark is.

  Non-Magic AU. Harry Potter was not sent to Hogwarts at age 11 as his parents intended. Instead, when an altercation with his uncle turns violent, he is sent to St. Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. But four years later, he has the opportunity to attend Hogwarts, where he learns to live a life he never thought possible for himself. H/D and a bit of mentor-Snape.
