** Literally all of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2dq7gb/tearjerkers_of_any_length/?ref=search_posts][these]] at work, in the library, in front of family. My go to excuse is "a friend's of a friend died" or "a friend's dog died" depending on how many such excuses I've used on the person.

** Thing is, depending on how well it's written, even though I know it's coming, when I'm reading Marauder era and that 1981 night comes up, there's a chance I'll be crying.

Library, school, work (before shift/at lunch), doctors office, one time a plane. I'm constantly reading Lol.
