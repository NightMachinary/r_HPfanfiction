In the moment the Killing Curse backfired, it was all over.

Regardless of his Horcruxes, his litany of rituals and modifications, his deep knowledge of the dark and esoteric... his soul was torn asunder at the moment of his actual death at Godrics Hollow.

Shredded.

He felt the Horcruxes on all sides as the green light vaporised his form and shunted his soul from his body. They stayed staunch and firm, digging in their proverbial heels against the force of death, adamant to pull the horrified, tattered soul into its icy embrace.

All directions, all pulling and pulling. Until Death itself stopped pulling as the soul it held fell to ribbons in its grip.

He couldn't scream, not yet. He hadn't the mental faculties.Instead of becoming a wraith, a consciousness aware and mobile and able to possess, Voldemort becomes something... less. His already minimalist shard of spirit even more horrifically miniscule, spread out across creation in a way that no one could ever see.

As if falling through the gaps of a sieve and getting stuck partway; that was the sensation he felt. He'd become a part of the very fabric of reality on his journey to fall out of it, the Horcruxes keeping him in place.

His anchors. If this feeling of being crushed flat (by what he instinctively knew as 'the Pattern') wasn't already agony, he would be blinded by the pain of being stretched thin by his tenuous grasp to life and consciousness.

He's not sure if he is in the fourth dimension or the second, flat and lost in a plane of nothingness in one second but able to look down upon and observe those in the third in the next. Perspective forever flipping, vaulting and disoriented.

He lashes out when he can shout and curse again, occasionally leaving an extra blot of ink on a page, or a mild imperfection on the surface of a stone. Those who still whisper of his deeds are those who give him power, there he can do more, but never by much.

He knows how to return, how to seek his revenge, but it is not up to him. It is up to those who he no longer walks among. Those who are forgetting him, their moving on actively killing him second by second, day by day.

But he won't die. He will remain, just beyond, a victim of his circumstances. A victim of the Pattern.

Where all he can do... is scream.

  [AU] Upon his bodily dissolution on October 31, 1981, Voldemort discovers that his Horcruxes do, indeed, anchor him to immortality. In fact, they anchor him all too well. Oneshot.
