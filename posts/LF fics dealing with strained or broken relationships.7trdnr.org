For eg: break-ups, divorce, estranged family members, loveless marriages, dysfunctional friendships etc, focusing on the characters and the relationship itself. No incest; other than that, anything is cool. Thanks.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10706195/1/Re-learning-Affection][Re-learning Affection]] by Ki-hori-e-te-ao is a bit frustrating to me because the Weasley family is so broken at the beginning. However, it's a good read overall. linkffn(10706195) Status: Ongoing

  Sirius is sick of his family. James wants him to do something about it. And all the while, invisible in the background, Regulus is slowly losing himself. /No longer a three-shot. My take on the Black brothers, starting with the night Sirius ran away. Warning: abuse in the first chapter. Rated T for a reason. /Previously titled Black Blood.

  The Marauders -- it's hard calling themselves that after Peter -- managed to defeat Voldemort, and are stumbling through adulthood without a war. Harry should get a normal life with his parents and his uncles. But Remus is worried. Because Harry doesn't seem okay. He doesn't seem okay at all.
