On AO3, is there a button like the follow button on FFN? Do I need an account?


** It's called "Subscribe" and it gives you email notifications.

And yes, you need an account to do it.

*** Is there a way to see how many people subscribe to you? I know you can find it for individual stories, but I can't find a page comparable to the global author stats on FFN.

**** The story statistics page gives you a number for each story, but Ao3 doesn't give the individual names of each subscriber.

***** I know that, but you can subscribe to authors as well. And I can't find that number, or some stats like profile views and so on.

****** On the stats page, above the individual story stats, there is a column that says Totals: User Subscriptions, Kudos, Comment Threads, etc. The "User Subs" is the number of people have subbed to you as an author. Ao3 doesn't record profile views.
