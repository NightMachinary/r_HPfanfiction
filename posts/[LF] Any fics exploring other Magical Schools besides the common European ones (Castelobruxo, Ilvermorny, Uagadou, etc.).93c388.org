** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

A second chance at life is where Harry goes to Akren School of Magic in Canada.

Its one of my 2 favourite fanfics. It is complete, as well as the sequel, but unfortunately the third 'book' only has 2 chapters, and is unfinished.

The first two completed stories are good for 600k words though.

I highly recommend it.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

Note that Mahoutokoro here was introduced before Rowling revealed details about it, so it's a very different take (and feeds into crossover elements).

** Alexandra Quick stories happen in Charmbridge, it's quite interesting vision of American wizarding society, but sadly no longer canon compliant. linkffn(Alexandra Quick and Thorn Circle)

** This story Southern Cross ([[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295745]]) although a little old and different from the author's current works which are posted on a different site HPFT after the previous death of HPFF, is still incredible! It tells the story of a Kiwi girl attending the New Zealand school of Magic, Southern Cross (named for the constellation only seen in the Southern Hemisphere).

** California Dreamin' is good if you haven't read it. It's from the perspective of adult Harry teaching at St. Ambrose's Academy outside San Francisco. It's not strictly the boarding-school focus of traditional hp, but it's a really good read.

** HP & the Jade Dragon is a post-DH in which Harry and Hermione finish their last year at Mahoutokoro but be warned that it has more than 1M words and still hasn't gotten past Halloween I believe, still I like it
