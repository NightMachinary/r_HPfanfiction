** frombluetored's [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] series is one of the best depictions of H/G that I've read. It's post-epilogue (post-cc as well I think) and I think one of the few fics that has managed to get me invested in the next gen kids. There's three fics so far in the series, with the third being updated every other month or so. Really recommend reading it, it's amazing.

linkao3(6015) is a somewhat unique Groundhoug Day!AU one shot. It has some great scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): 'Harry' and 'Ginevra' were quite different from the Books, but their interactions were hilarious, and both were competent.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]] is a Year 7 AU fic and a HP/BtVS crossover. Ginny became a Slayer during the Astronomy Tower battle, and the Four of them would go on Horcrux Hunt together. Although Ginny was very powerful here, Harry, Hermione, and Ron all showed remarkable strength.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/Failsafe][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891): Harry and Ginny ended up in LOTR universe after Voldemort's fall. It's IMO one of the best HP/LOTR crossovers, but also unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. A very cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and had ruled magical Britain for the next 20 years. Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance after Ginny graduated from Beauxbaton. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione. Harry, Ginny, and Sirius, though not main characters, would all play major roles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): This one is Harry/Multi, and Ginny is very important. Harry and his girls are all smart, powerful, and quite ruthless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 DAY old Rose got thrown back to 1991. They had to finish off Voldemort as quickly as possible before they could return to their original timeline. During their mission, they dragged a 10 year old Ginny along for the ride.

** I will be honest im just not a big fan of many MC canon relationships when i read fanfiction. Harry/Ginny, Naruto/Hinata, Ichigo/Orihime, they just dont hit me right either because im not a big fan of the paired character or im a bit bored of the vanilla option.

Actually i just realized when im happy with the canon pairing im usually not as likely to search for in universe fanfiction, more so i just search for crossovers. Take Full Metal Alchemist, Im perfectly happy with Ed/Winry and i dont think i have ever read a pure FMA fic.

Book Ginny is a tough girl and she has some real backbone, but shes not a character i personally care for outside of as Harry's friend. When it comes to my fanfiction i generally just enjoy when my favorite characters to get together, unrealistic as it can be.

Rather than just being the odd one that no one cares for, i like Luna when she gets connected to something grander in scale, plus i have always attributed Luna with gentleness which is one of my favorite character traits. Fae touched, Foreseer, or just normal coherent Magizoologist Luna is my personal preference.

** The Thorny Rose Series, where Ginny retained the memories from the Diary Horcrux, and uses them to help Harry win the Triwizard Tournament, and prevent Voldemort's resurrection /twice/. She wants a life of adventure, and Harry is her best bet at that.

** Damned, I wouldn't have commented on this (I've seen this topic back then when you first created it, but I ignored it - but now it has shown up in one of my searches!), but:

How is MOVIE-GINNY different from BOOK-GINNY? Both are IMHO insufferable fangirls who aren't compatible with Harry at all (the only thing they have in common is fucking quidditch after all!)...even book Ginny couldn't talk to Harry at first (she was a stuttering mess, tended to evade him and if I remember this right she put her elbow into the butterdish!)...

ps: I think this pairing would work better if Ginny had been fleshed out, but she wasn't...she was as fleshed out as fucking Daphne Greengras (Note: I am exaggerating on purpose!) who is at least interesting because she's a Slytherin!
