** Ginny was sure her mother would never understand her. It had taken years for Ginny herself to come to terms with her feelings about her family and wizarding tradition. She was the eldest of the Weasley clan and the only girl and so by extension she was the second mum. The year Ginny had graduated Hogwarts it had felt like an immense weight off her shoulders. She was done. No more waking the Littles: Percy, Charlie, and Bill to dress them. No more early mornings cooking breakfast for a family of nine. Did she feel some guilt? Of course. But, her mother never listened. Molly Weasley just assumed her daughter was an extension of herself. Or, rather it felt like that to Ginny.

Her father seemed to somewhat understand, and he had interjected when he could to quell his wife's ranting about their daughter's lack of homemaking initiative. It was thanks to him that she was able to practice her flying, and he was the reason the had been allowed to join the quidditch team. Mum had railed for a week straight in Ginny's second year, adamant she would not be playing a sport that could injure her precious only daughter.

Ginny knew she had been distant her last year at Hogwarts. From her siblings and her parents. Mum had cried when she spent her last Hols at a friend's house. She had kept many things a secret from them to keep from hearing her mum's lectures and guilt trips. She felt justified though, especially after that last Howler when mum had seen the Prophet article boasting Ginevra Weasley as the "youngest ever starting recruit for the Holyhead Harpies". The article was one of her cherished momentos. It had boasted of her dual skills in keeping and seeking respectively and called her a forced to be reckoned with.

She was happy and free now, travelling playing quidditch. She had money and she made sure her siblings wanted for nothing: quidditch tickets, brooms, robes, whatever they asked her for she gave them. She was still their big sister after all. She had helped Ron with his apprenticeship fees under Florian Fortescue, and the Twins would be opening their shop once they graduated. She hadn't forgotten her family in the least. She just needed time from her mum. She sighed, having had enough wool gathering and looked at little Bill's letter pleading for her to take him shopping for his First Year supplies. He didn't want the hand-me-down robes like the elder boys had worn. She laughed when he had asked her for a paid of dragon hide boots and an earring at Christmas last year. She would make sure to send some money to her father, her mum wasn't so spiteful she would turn down well meant help from family... So long as Dad was the one to breach the topic.

One day when her feelings were less raw and she felt less chaffed at the yoke of being an eldest daughter she would talk to her mum. Boundaries would be established, and Molly will hopefully finally learn who Ginny really was. Until then, she would keep in touch and help her brothers whenever they needed her.

Sorry I didn't quite know how to wrap this up. I really feel if the ages and order were reversed that Ginny would experience a more gender based burden in her family. I'm not much of a writer but this prompt spoke to me a bit. I'm the eldest of 5.

** This would be a really fun scenario with the potential for a lot of changes dynamics. Would Harry still be best friends with Charlie, or would they have a bitter rivalry over quidditch? With Fred and George as the older siblings setting an example, would Percy still be such a swot, or would he ease up a bit? Ron doesn't have a myriad of older brothers to give him an inferiority complex here, so who would he aspire to be like? I could see him as having a successful career on the wizard's chess circuit, traveling all over the world for tournaments. And despite Bill being effortlessly cool and popular (Would he be the one to get the diary? Would anyone notice earlier?), it would still be funny to see him as a little kid absolutely starstruck with a crush on Harry.

** Someone should write this! An HP series rewrite -- but AU due to the Weasley family being born backwards and how that would effect literally every plot-point, friendship, relationship, and character. It would be /SO/ interesting!

Also quick question--someone else might've already asked this, but: Did the Weasley's have 7 children because they wanted seven children? (If so, no offense but seriously fiscally irresponsible of them.) Did they not believe in/have access to Birth Control? (Which would be sad but prevalent and understandable--but maybe not so much in /England/ y'all don't have to do things like sell plasma or internal organs to afford it, so that's probably not it.) Or--the most likely reason--did Molly & Arthur have 7 children because they wanted a girl? (Which means they might've stopped after Ron or the Twins if they had Ginny first.) What do you guys think?

*** In response to your questions! Two plausible takes on it:

Wizarding children are rare, therefore contraception and birth control are banned. Perhaps the only reason they /only/ had seven is because there were birth complications or Molly was too old to easily conceive again.

Another equally plausible take? /Magic/. I mean, they can transfigure, charm, and potion anything they need for the most part. They need to pay for food, but that's about it - right up until Hogwarts. Which could feasibly operate on a sliding scale, or perhaps they've been saving up for it all these years. Maybe there's even scholarships for children who show promise early, or a payment plan. Maybe it's a magical public school and it's entirely funded by the rich; no students have to pay for anything more than there supplies.

Just a couple of takes on your questions besides the usual, "They wanted a girl." 😊

**** Those are actually really good ideas! Really thought provoking! Do you think, then, if children are encouraged and contraceptives aren't, that Purebloods' such as the Malfoy's who make comments about them having "more kids than they can afford" say it more out of jealousy than anything else? As they themselves can only have one or two children each generation?

***** I could easily see it being jealousy spurning a lot of it. Maybe genetics or a curse a few generations back plays into it and makes it difficult for them to conceive, or there are certain "old" traditions like in ancient Catholicism where they only believe in copulating at certain times; maybe during certain days in the Pagan calendar. But due to a lack of understanding of biology they don't realize that they're hindering themselves, so they see the Weasleys as violating the most sacred ideals they uphold. Maybe "blood traitors" isn't even so much about blood purity as it is them violating wizarding religion. Perhaps they see the Weasleys as having committed some atrocious ritual to birth so many children over the years when, "Good, worshipping Purebloods like themselves," struggle to have even two children over a decade. It's "Devil's work," or something, perhaps.

Only the Weasleys simply have a regular, healthy sex life and the Old Ways stopped being passed down years ago. Or maybe they even just broke tradition because they didn't care if they were damned when they love each other so much, so they committed the "sin" of love making on unholy days and their many children were the result.

Lol Sorry, I may have gotten carried away there.

****** No actually, I really enjoyed reading it! You have such great points and you back them up so well! Seriously, if you don't already, you should look into going into a debate class or club -- you're so very good at it.

Also, I always love hearing (reading about?) people's theories and/or headcanons about the Wizarding World! Like things about their traditions, their religion(s) & religious practices, the different branches of magic out there--what's labeled as light magic & what as dark, and WHY/HOW, what makes up the "Old Ways", is this part of it? Also, magical careers outside of Quidditch, Hogwarts, and the Ministry--info on them, we get none. And the Ministry/"Magical Government" (such as the Wizengamot, the ICW, the Hogwarts Board of Directors, etc.); what do they *actually* do when they're not either /completely/ corrupt or being run by someone/people who are corrupt. How do you even become a member? Popularity? Blood-Status? Do you buy your way in? Are you elected? Hooowwww?

Another reason I love your rambling is because it reminds me of different HP fics---becaise people fix a lot of things in fanfiction that we all wish the books or J.K. would, y'know? Like: at Hogwarts, bring back the classes Dumbledore got rid of (w/ teachers for those classes), get support/teacher's aides for the Core-Class Professors, get rid of Binns the Ghost, find and break the curse on defense post then get a good, fully-qualified professor. At the ministry, they have actual freaking /truth serum/ *so use it* -- pay a potions-master well(very well seing as it takes a full lunar cycle to brew if I remember correctly) to keep you stocked up on it -- and use it in every. single. trial. Then there's a bunch of other things too lol. Like make somebody notice things! Like: that Harry is being neglected at /best/ and abused at /worst/ at the Dursley's; that the way Neville's Gran and Great Uncle treat him is not okay; that the entirety of Ravenclaw house is bullying one of their own (for *years* without stopping); go back decades earlier and notice that laughing and waving away the Marauders actions (bullying, humiliation-bordering-on-torture, sexual assault) as "pranking" and, probably, "boys-will-be-boys"--would have serious, long-lasting consequences for so. many. people. Right, imma stop now cuz I've been writing this for like 2hrs.

But like I said, please don't ever be worried about rambling on or saying to much. The WW wouldn't be half as much fun if all of us weren't constantly adding new ideas, traditions, customs, spells, potions, rituals, creatures, political structures, etc. Us rambling *is* what makes this so much fun.

*** I mean, I think they just wanted a full house. Arthur was moving up the ranks in the ministry, and they have a chicken coop and garden that helps supplement their diet. Sure the younger kids didn't /always/ have nice things, but they did have their own things, as Ron's Chudley Cannons theme room can attest to. And we all know that Molly Weasley had those kids eating 3 square meals a day. They may have lived a simple life, but it was never a truly hard life.

They wanted kids, and they worked hard to make sure those kids had a happy life and put them through school. Sure, maybe Molly just really wanted a girl, or maybe they just wanted a large happy family. The point is that while it wasn't financially ideal, it was still financially doable. People like to reference Molly sweeping up the small pile of coins in their vault during the second book, but you have to keep in mind, she was going to have to pay for 5 complete sets of Lockhart's books, and you know that prick wasn't selling those for cheap. That's got to be the equivalent of at least $20 per book per kid. From what I recall, there were 7 books by Lockhart, making it /conservatively/ an extra $700 out of their budget, plus all the tuition costs and other school supplies that they were already prepared for that month.

They were poor, but they were financially stable enough to put all seven of their kids through school, and that was enough for them.

*** nah miss me with that Ron x Fleur shit, we're going full Ginny x Fleur. I mean even in canon Ginny is more similar to Bill (confident, popular, good a quidditch, ginny would've bee prefect if the war hadn't happened most likely -- i honestly imagine ron and percy as being similar siblings because they are both headstrong, they leave who they love but come back eventually, they are both also prefects, percy gives me very insecure vibes just like ron)

***** honestly i think all the weasley's except ron and charlie could have been in different houses (but i like them in gryffindor) -- here's how i see their secondary houses

Bill - not known much, very gryffindor, secondary ravenclaw

Charlie - nothing known, very gryffindor, no opinion on secondary house for him

Percy - secondary house slytherin

Fred - secondary house slytherin or ravenclaw (both can be debated, the twins are creative, smart, ambitious, mischievous)

George - secondary house slytherin or ravenclaw (i do quite like the idea of them in ravenclaw because they would make ravens seem less stuck up and they may focus on their studies more which could eventually help with WWW)

Ron - no opinion on seocndary house, I vehemently disagree that he should be a hufflepuff like others say (he isn't friendly, he isn't hardworking, he is barely loyal and even if you use that argument he still leaves before he comes back, he isn't kind to his non-friends. honestly if ron had another house it would be slytherin and no one can change my mind but he seems to be gryffindor through and through)

Ginny - secondary house hufflepuff or slytherin (very ambitious and kind of sneaky, but very popular and reminds me of Cedric)

Molly - secondary house hufflepuff

Arthur - secondary house ravenclaw

******* No! I wasn't trying to do that, I don't like Ron as much as harry or hermione, but i have never hated or bashed him. I guess it came off that was because in my head I was comparing him to Percy who does not have many amazing qualities. Let me fix it to be more nuetral: Ron is ambitious and mischievous, he is not hard-working like a hufflepuff but seeks power like slytherins, he loves his friends and would fight with them (like draco and crabbe and goyle) but he also can be disloyal. overall, he's good to the people he loves but can be mean (i could also describe harry, hermione, draco, or ginny in a neutral way -- so i hope this isn't seen as bashing but is more trying to not be biased)

***** It's a fanfic, no one actually cares if they “show lesbian tendencies” because fanfic is not canon. Also, if you wanna argue lesbianism in canon we know that Fleur marries bill and goes on a date w Roger Davies. That's it. She seems to hate the attention boys give her because of her beauty so it is possible she likes women if they are less creepy towards her, but her and Harry aren't “friends” so why would she mention it to him. Again this is all just possibilities because the book is from Harry's POV. Ginny seems to exclusively date men in canon, but once again this is a fanfic.

And under this post it has the Weasley's ages switched but doesn't clarify anything further which could mean that everyone ends up with their counterpart (hermione and Charlie marry + Harry and Bill marry) or that it changes the entire plot and these people don't get together, it's just fanfic.

** Now if the order was reversed would you

a) keep their birthdays and only switch the birth-years

b) switch the birthdays ie (Ginny and Bill flipped Ron and Charlie flipped and the Twins and Percy flipped)

c) give Ginny Bill's birthday and then keep the same number of days between each kid in reverse?

Per The Harry Potter Lexicon the canon birthdays of the Weasley kids are

Bill - November 29th 1970

Charlie - December 12th 1972

Percy - August 22nd 1976

Fred & George - April 1st 1978

Ron - March 1st 1980

Ginny - August 11th 1981

​

If you keep it the birthdays but switched only the birth-years

Ginny - August 11th 1970

Ron - March 1st 1972

Fred & George - April 1st 1976

Percy - August 22nd 1978

Charlie - December 12th 1980

Bill - November 29th 1981

​

If you flipped the birthdays

Ginny - November 29th 1970

Ron - December 12th 1972

Fred & George - August 22nd1976

Percy - April 1st 1978

Charlie - March 1st 1980

Bill - August 11th 1981

if so then wouldn't Percy be the trickster with the April Fool's Day birthday.

​

If you changed the birthday keep the same number of days between each kid in reverse

Ginny - November 29th 1970 + 528 days

Ron - May 10th 1972 + 700 days

Twins - April 9th 1974 + 587

Percy - November 17th 1976 + 1349 days

Charlie - July 27th 1980 + 744 days

Bill - August 9th 1982

which would have no April Fool's Day birthday, Charlie being only 4 days older then Harry

Ginny would start in 1982, Ron in 1983, The Twins in 1985, Percy in 1988, Charlie in 1991 and Bill in 1993

*** Or you keep the birthday, keep the canon age differences between each sibling and Ginny is simply the oldest:

Ginny - 1970\\
Ron - 1971\\
Twins - 1973\\

Charley -1979\\
Bill -1981

Note Charley would still start in Harry's year, but the problem is there is only 7 months difference between Ginny and Ron.
