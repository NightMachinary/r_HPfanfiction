I'm looking for something new, and thought it would be interesting to read a fic that focuses on characters we hear almost nothing about in canon. Su Li is used in a lot fanfics, but there are others who are rarely focused on. Elphias Doge, Hepzibah Smith, Merope Gaunt, Winky, Dedalus Diggle, Bill Weasley etc. Any rating and any pairings are fine. Im just looking for something well written.


** Mundungus Fletcher is a main character in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** Well... there's stuff like "A Boon for Bill," where Bill's situation kinda drives the whole plot (which admittedly is more H/Hr than anything, and absurdly so). I'm not necessarily saying this is /good/ story, mind you - but it's the first thing I thought of where Bill is featured a bit more.

**** Bill has a fair role in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) as Harry-James' confidant (and trainer). He has his own agenda for the most part. JBern also gave him some meat in linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle by jbern), so the author must have some appreciation for his character.

** linkao3(turncoat: in defense of andromeda tonks nee black by dirgewithoutmusic) is a part of the "we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within" series about the "forgotten" women of Hogwarts. I only actually liked the one about Andromeda Tonks because the others were too preachy for me, but you might like them. There are pieces dedicated to Parvati Patil, Cho Chang, Pansy Parkinson and so on.
