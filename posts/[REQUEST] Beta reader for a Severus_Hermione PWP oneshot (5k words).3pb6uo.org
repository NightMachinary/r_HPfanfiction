This is my first fanfic attempt, so I'm particularly looking for a *gentle beta reader* this time around. So I'd like detailed feedback on what does & doesn't work, but said in an encouraging way. ;)

The fic is Severus/Hermione, oneshot, PWP (ie, explicit), 5k words. "We must have sex to save you!" fun-times. If you don't enjoy this particular ship or that particular trope, this isn't the fic for you.

I'll take any betas I can get, but in an ideal world I'd get feedback before November, so I can use the feedback to inform my NaNoWriMo writing (which is going to be more of an epic sshg story).

What I'm looking for:

- Did the story work for you?
- Do the characters seem in-character enough?
- point out any typos or awkward phrasing (although I'm pretty good at copyediting myself)
- Brit-picking

If you're interested, comment here or PM me and I'll share the Google Doc with you. Thanks!

*EDIT: The story has been beta'd and is up on AO3: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5072038]]*

** Me, too! Can I put my comments directly on the google doc, or do you want me to give you something separate?

  Severus is suffering from a curse, and Hermione is the only one available to help break it. PWP oneshot.

  #+begin_example
      This is my first fanfic; I hope you enjoy it\! It has been beta’d by a lovely group of beta readers, but it has not been Brit\-picked\. So if you see any British English errors, please accept my American apologies\. ;\)
    A million thanks to my friend consulting\_queer for encouraging me to write my first fanfic, which also happens to be my first erotic story\. Without her support, I would probably have chickened out of writing this\! She also named my throw\-away "Fulgara" \("lighting"\) curse for me\.I'd also like to thank my team of beta readers: jrl2014, Madam Hook, Psantium, and of course consulting\_queer\.Additional thanks go to redditor MyBoySokka of /r/latin, for the Latin phrase "Tactus Amatoris"\. I really hate naming things\. ;\)If you liked this story, I also recommend a couple other delightfully smutty stories in a similar vein: "A Knock on the Door" & "Twenty\-Four Little Hours" by Severusgirlx, "Phlebotonum" by littlelizzyann, and “The Fourth Unforgiveable” by Abby\. I swear I hadn’t even heard of Abby’s story when I came up with my idea\! ;\)Finally, a shout\-out to the fic "A Beach in Ireland" by Bambu; bonus points to reviewers who catch the small quote\. :\)
