** Yes, the canon Slytherins in Harry and Hermione's year are not going to take very well to having a muggleborn in the house.

But if we take just a second to think there might be Slytherins who fall into the Slughorn mould, or even the early years Tom Riddle mould, then I could see Hermione's talent being recognised early on by older students who would no doubt want to have that particular resource available to them in the future, so would offer a measure of protection.

And Hermione would do quite well with the attention of older Slytherins, and would use all the cunning that canon shows us she has to make a success of it.

There is already precedent for this - Snape is implied to have been taken under the wing of Malfoy and some other older students, despite not being a pureblood, because his talent (particularly with hexes and jinxes) was recognised.

She would not become friends with Harry though - even if she identified him as a valuable asset because of the BWL fiasco, I don't think Harry would have the necessary forcefulness to overcome the house rivalry until much later (the first non-Gryffindor friend he has outside of classmates and Quidditch opponents is in his fifth year).

**** I can't see Ron going out of his way to befriend Hermione in that scenario - in canon they're "fire-forged friends", who only become friends because of shared experience of danger.

However, the dynamic for Ron within Slytherin could lead to him (covertly) standing up more for his family's muggle-friendly attitudes because he'd be confronted much more frequently with the anti-muggle hostility of the other Slytherins.

** Long story short,

- Hermione gives Ron the structure, the planning, and the tutelage that he needs to achieve his ambition to surpass his brothers.
- Ron helps Hermione stay sane and keeps her from becoming any more fem!Moody or Dark Lady Granger than she has to.
- Together, they take the wizarding world by storm. It is quite possible that Ron becomes the youngest Minister for Magic in history, and Hermione is what happens to anyone who stands in their way.

Or, Voldemort escapes, but he has no idea that Harry's sacrificial protection can hurt him, so he gets a nasty surprise next time he goes after him, knocking him out for /another/ 3 years.

He may even come back just as Hermione and Ron are executing their plan to take over the country, and wouldn't that be fun?

Or, heck, something else happens, and it's Hermione and/or Ron there with Quirrlemort, but either of them would love to use the Philosopher's Stone used (damn Slytherins!), so they aren't any better at getting it out than Quirrelmort was.

Ron continues to be Harrys friend in the first and maybe second year but peer pressure causes them to drift apart much like Severus Snape and Lily Evans. Ron could still be a good guy, but would need to pretend to be buying into pureblood dogma in order to survive amongst junior death eaters.

The troll ending up in the bathroom makes no sense in the first place. In it's dumb brain it has to decide to go out of it's way into an offshoot room instead of continuing down the hallway. My headcanon was always that the troll heard her crying and followed that into the bathroom.

There are no bathrooms other than the ones in dorms in Gryffindor tower so that rules out bathrooms in the Common Room if we're keeping the layout more or less the same and I don't think we've ever heard of one in the dungeons; d) I don't think we have any evidence that older years would mercilessly tease someone five years younger than them in tears, just because they're a Slytherin.

She could be crying in that bathroom, but Halloween 1991 was on a Thursday, and so she'd have to start crying sometime after 3:00 PM. The feast is around seven, and since Hermione, being Hermione probably went to the library straight after the classes finished, the next time she'd be in direct contact with the Slytherins is while walking to the feast, which is on the first floor in the Great Hall. The closest bathroom to the Great Hall is the Troll bathroom.
2. The troll went into the bathroom originally because it heard Hermione, so if Hermione was in a bathroom in the dungeons (where the troll was originally released), it could have heard her there and gone in to kill her. The two places where Hermione could have gotten killed were the dungeons and the second-floor bathroom.

Also, she may have had a completely different class that day (slytherins only have potions with Gryffindor that we know of) so she might have used a bathroom on a different floor anyway. Also, when I said she might use a toilet in the dungeon I meant that she might purposefully go there (regardless of class) in order to be in a less used restroom because as u said the troll bathroom is nearest to the great hall which implies heavy traffic, and therefore, lots of people to hear u awkwardly crying and tease you/ ask if ur alright in that weird way that people do when they don't know you.

************** 1. The troll was roaming around the corridors before Harry and Ron locked it up, and since we don't know much about trolls, aside from the fact that they're clumsy and dumb, we have no idea if the troll could climb stairs. You can make the argument that because it's so huge and clumsy, it would have been difficult, but there's no conclusive evidence- we have to make do with the albeit, unreliable information that Quirrel gives us.
2. The point I was making was that she didn't have *potions*, which is the only class in the dungeons that we know of, since, as you pointed out, they share it with the Gryffindor's. She could have had a different class on a different floor, but the troll wasn't there during class time. Besides, she is WAY more likely to get walked in on in the middle of a busy corridor when students are exiting a classroom and using the bathroom.
3. In order for the events to play out like canon, Hermione would have to be in a bathroom (we disagree on which bathroom and whether the troll would have got to her, but I haven't heard you object to her being in a bathroom) around 6-7:00 PM. Also, I really don't think Hermione is the kind of student who goes all the way downstairs and risks being late to her class that is definitely /not/ there, just because she wants to cry.
4. If we go with the information Quirrel gave us, and what Harry and Ron observed, the Troll travelled between the dungeons and the second floor. This means that any bathroom between these two floors could also have been targeted.
5. We know that after class, students usually spend time in their common rooms, so traffic in the Great Hall would probably peak around dinner time.
6. Hermione is still Hermione. Right after class, she's still going to do her homework, and she probably won't talk to her Slytherin peers during that time. Like I said before, the time she's really exposed to them is when walking to class or the Great Hall. The walk from the dungeons to the Great Hall and all of the bathrooms there are within the Troll's hit zone.

*************** Did she not go straight from class to the bathroom to cry?

Also she may not have been crying. This happened a short while into the book and she has presumably been bullied more due to being a mudblood previously and either changed how she acts or become more tough-skinned and therefore is probably with everyone else and not crying.

And yes, Hermione is more used to it by now, but this doesn't mean she has developed a thicker skin. In fact, she may have internalised it and figured that there was something wrong with being a Mudblood, or just sunk into a state of sadness. Personally, though these are possibilities, I don't think that'd happen. Hermione has a very strong idea of who she is, and she's not going to change that, and she's also a very stubborn person, and I don't think she would hold on to sadness like that. The other possibility, which I think is very likely, is that she's been bottling up her emotions (because the bullying in Slytherin is relentless and she can't cry all the time), and someone says something very cutting, which causes her to break.

***** Would it be more common, though?

This is digging a bit deeper into early-canon Hermione's psychology, but the thing with Ron happened because Ron /wasn't/ bullying her---and didn't even mean for her to overhear him. What broke her then was that she had been harbouring a misconception that they were friends---and if you don't believe that she harboured that misconception, ask yourself why else she would act as if refusing to talk with them was some kind of a punishment---and Ron's comment disabused her of that notion very suddenly. She realised then that she had, in fact, been antagonising Harry and Ron all along, and she didn't know exactly what was it that she had done. (After all, helping them with classwork and telling them when they are about to break rules and get into trouble is what friends do for friends, right?)

A hypothetical Hermione in Slytherin forming such a misconception would require far more subtlety from first-year Slytherins than they are capable of. Their bullying would almost certainly be overt, direct, and immediate. How she'd respond to that is open to interpretation. However, I would think that after some disappointment early on, she would make peace with having no friends, and focus on making it so that she no longer has enemies, either...

That said, I did once outline a Slytherin!Hermione fic in which her treatment in Slytherin resulted in her becoming a scrappy Dark witch, an anti-blood-purist, anti-Voldemort fanatic, and a murderer and a terrorist. I ultimately decided not to write it for a variety of reasons, but it did have a Troll Incident that I wrote into prose. I won't repost it here, but [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/post-15356279][here is the snipped on Spacebattles, that also provides some additional context]]. It involves Myrtle, who completely misunderstands the situation, and thus accidentally saves Hermione (or, rather, causes her to save herself) as a result.

If Hermione would be Slytherin, she would be bullied 24/7 and would be the punchbag of the house. As a result, she would spend more time crying in bathrooms than in cannon.

Chances of the troll encountering her was already astronomicaly small in the cannon yet it did anyway. Almost as if the troll was searching for little crying children to eat.

Ron would fare a bit better simply beacuse he is a pureblood( a poor one, but still a pureblood.) He would be bullied too, just not as much as Hermione. Unlike with Hermione, they would give him a chance to join them if he accepted their way of thinking. Ron might actually bully Hermione more severely than in cannon in the hopes of acceptance by his housemates. Peer pressure is a strong and evil thing.

***** Thanks for replying despite my snark.

Where we disagree is that I don't think Hermione will be spending hours crying in the toilets again and again. It's just not what she normally does when dealing with disdain of others and social isolation: she either busies herself with work (PoA) or responds with aggression (HBP). If anything, she'd be spending all her time in the library.

The Troll incident was a very specific confluence of social circumstances [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hddpq5/grangerhermione_slytherin_potterharry_gryffindor/fvmdwhq/][for reasons I describe in another post on this thread]]. Under the prompt's premise, if she does end up spending a day crying in the toilets, it would happen much, much earlier than Halloween 1991, and then she'd move on.

Now, I can see her [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/post-15356279][hanging out with everybody's favourite hydrokinetic Muggleborn ghost, who is waiting for her to die so that she could have a little sister]], but that would change things as well.

To see why I suspected that you had something against Hermione, consider the big picture: this prompt is /about/ Ron and Hermione in a new setting. But, rather than consider the interplay between them or anything like that, you killed Hermione to turn her into an entity that pretty much by definition can't have character development, and her only role in the story from that point on is to assuage Harry's loneliness---even though this prompt isn't even about Harry.

** Ron ends up in detention for the entire first year because having a head of house who's actually paying attention means he can't get away with acting like he does without consequence... and because he's the new scapegoat when they can't prove his brothers did something to the Slytherins.

He comes back second year after a long talk with Percy and starts taking things seriously, picking his fights and paying attention to what he's doing.

Harry is... fine. Malfoy gets told off by Snape for picking on a fellow Slytherin, and with that calmed down it's just a hostile living environment. Harry's used to that. It does likely mean he never really opens up and makes friends, and ends up a quiet one. The first time Ron turns on him is the last, as without the pressure of his house behind making up he won't trust again easily.

He still befriends Hermione, the other outcast in the year, and together they become abjectly terrifying. Two smart kids, one with the level of protective paranoia that abuse can give and the other brilliant and isolated all her life.

Snape, being Snape, asks some sarcastic questions about why Harry's staying at Hogwarts over the winter holidays, and finds out where he's been living. That makes him angry enough to look at Harry's memory, which in turn infuriates him entirely. Between that and seeing too much of himself and Lily in Harry and Hermione, he becomes tolerable over time, and does his duty as head of house to work in their best interests.

He'll never be nice. He doesn't have it in him. But he won't let them be targets for harassment within the house.

******* This is conflating their characters with the information that we have about their characters. They have well-defined underlying personalities, values, goals, strengths, and weaknesses, almost all acquired prior to meeting Harry. Now, due to Harry being the sole point-of-view character, /we/ are forced to learn about them only through their interactions with him or in his presence, but that's our problem.

To say that they are empty cutouts without Harry to revolve around is like saying that you didn't exist until I read your post.

These are literary characters, not message board posters. They have no independent existence outside of the narrative.

That's not true. At some point in the first two years of my life, I learned object permanence, and since then, I have been able to conceive of other people and things existing outside of my perception. This includes the conception that you existed even before I became aware of your existence.

By that reasoning, nor does Harry Potter---keeping in mind that the narrative is entirely in 3rd-person---nor does Hogwarts or any element of the Potterverse setting. If you reject the idea of story elements existing outside of the canon narrative, then what are you even doing in a fan fiction subreddit?
