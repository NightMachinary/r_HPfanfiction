Hoping to find some new fics to read. I tend to enjoy good Adventure/plot-heavy books. I especially like ones that flesh out magical theory well or have interesting magics. Snape is my favorite character (I know that's a bit of an UO here, but there it is), so I prefer fics involving him (doesn't have to be main character, I'm fine with him in the teacher role/in the Order, but with plenty of screen time). I don't like slash. Also nothing that places romance/angst over plot.

Any recs?

  "Bored by unchallenging classes? Sick of sitting around, doing nothing grand? Eager to learn forgotten magics and gain power beyond your wildest dreams? Join the Young Adventurer's Club now!" A mysterious poster for a new club catches Severus' eye. Little does he know... What the club has planned will challenge everything he knows and change the course of his entire life.

** I would recommend linkffn(Happiness is a Broken Wand). HP/LotR crossover with Snape as the protagonist. The story's magic system is rather off-putting (it has magical cores and versatile wandless magic), but it is fast paced, well characterized, actually changes stuff from LotR canon with well done plot twists and isn't afraid to put Snape in terrible situations.

Also abandoned, but hey, can't have everything.
