:END:
Hey looking for a Harry/Regulus fic,

James and Lily died and Sirius was mean to raise Harry but palmed him off on Petunia and ignored his existence while spending a huge chunk of Harry's money. Harry was betrothed to Ginny against his will but she fucked Sirius on a couch during Christmas? And Sirius had to marry her instead. Harry moved to America where Regulus was and became a shaman/healer? Also something about demon blood giving them different traits?

â€‹

Bus also any other Harry/Regulus fics you know slash only please


** Your story seems so wild!

For any Harry/Regulus, there is the super well written [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] (even if it's a very slow burn).

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12895634/1/][*/A Second Chance at Happiness? Maybe?/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5482960/animeotaku20][/animeotaku20/]]

#+begin_quote
  A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe? Slash, mentions mpreg.
