One of the things I like about villians is their agenda should be believable. Like villains in Naruto? Thanos? How do you view GG's beliefs? How has your perception changed after watching the new movie? Can someone give a before-after analysis?


** Personally I prefer the Grindelwald I've seen in fanfiction before the movies came out.

The fics I like portray him as pro-wizard and anti-muggle, without any of the blood purity nonsense of Voldemort's followers. In those fics Grindelwald's followers included muggleborns, halfbloods and purebloods and were brutal against their opposition regardless of blood status.

This works well in my opinion, because it differentiates the two figures and shows how Voldemort's beliefs developed as a warped ideology that twisted Grindelwald's original "For the Greater Good" goal. Voldemort's campaign was built from the horror of living through WWII and was supported by the remnants of extremism that were left after Grindelwald's campaign failed. Both Dark Wizards grew up in different time periods with different political realities that shaped them, so their beliefs should not be carbon copies of each other.

In the fics I've enjoyed, Grindelwald used the Nazi movement in Germany for several reasons:

- The violence of the muggle war provided a smokescreen for his followers' attacks on muggle and wizarding locations, thus maintaining a false sense of security for the rest of wizarding Europe until it was almost too late.

- The extreme destruction and loss of life from the muggle war would cause more wizards to start viewing muggles as dangerous, thus weakening the nonintervention stance of those who support the Statute of Secrecy.

- Grindelwald's ultimate goal was to have wizards reign supreme over muggles, but this is hampered by the fact that muggles vastly outnumber wizards. Thus, the 'final solution' enacted by the Nazis was a convenient way to decrease the muggle population.

My favorite portrayal of Grindelwald is in the fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]]. In that fic he is charismatic, ruthless and driven, with schemes conducted behind the scenes that history would never learn of.

*** SPOILERS for CoG: the OP mentions it but just in case.

. . .

Isn't that essentially what Grindelwald is in the movies? He's pro-wizard. He has followers who are into blood purity, but he doesn't focus on it. It's wizards vs muggles for him. He criticizes aurors for striking down their own kind. He uses prophetic visions of WW2 to show wizards how cruel and dangerous they are. His ultimate goal is to rule over muggles. He's charismatic and ruthless and he has everyone following the path he lays out for them.

**** I haven't seen the movie that just came out, but judging by /Fantastic Beasts/ he lacks charisma, acting more like a transparently conniving Disney villain. If he actually had strong wizard vs. muggle beliefs then he would have been more sympathetic about the abuse Credence suffered from muggles rather than just wanting to use him as a weapon. Grindelwald comes across as deranged in the end of that movie.

** In my headcanon, Grindelwald, unlike Voldemort, sincerely sees himself as a hero.

As for his motivation... he is as similar to a religious zealot as it gets in the Wizarding World, in my view. There are many theories about where magic comes from, and a prevalent one is that it's a gift given to the Chosen (the wizards) by God/the Gods/Mother Earth/the Flying Spaghetti Monster/whatever. Grindelwald buys it, and considers it is magicals'' bithright to rule over non-magicals, not because of "might makes right" per se, but because it is their purpose and destiny in the world. He's big on destiny and Prophecy and things like that (and secretly upset that there /wasn't/ a big Prophecy made about him and Albus to foretell their duel).

He personally does not believe in blood-purity, but he has a number blood-purists (mostly "moderate" blood-purists, the sort who don't want to kill Muggle-borns and are fine with Half-Bloods, but still thinks pure-bloods are "better") in his entourage, because "magic makes you superior! Muggles were born to be inferior to us!" is naturally an idea that appels to blood-purist-types, and he's not going to turn away free support. However, he also recruits among those Muggle-raised who grew up with reason to dislike Muggles (Obscurial or not, someone like Credence would always have been a target for him, and that goes regardless of blood status).

He is also very accepting of magical nonhumans, though if pressed he'd still admit that wizards should be at the top level of the hierarchy in his ideal utopia. He believes in the widespread (but not entirely proven) theory that magical humanoids are all offshoots of wizardkind, whose magic mutated them, Lamarck-style, over the generations. For this reason, his army also include great support from rebellious Goblins and so on, who don't necessarily believe in his "magic is superior" ideology but consider he is their best shot at getting more power over wizards.

I'm not sure if JKR can do justice to GG. Although, I'll hold my breath till I watch the movie.

***** [mild(?) spoiler] My biggest issue with the movie was its portrayal of Grindelwald. I also like the version of him where he's self righteous and truly believes in his goal and sees himself as a hero and savior (which also makes his fallout with Dumbley a lil more compelling and believable) but in the movie he just seemed plain evil. A lot of the things he did in the movie were just to make him seem like the bad guy instead of showing him contributing to “the greater good.”

***** In the movie, it's debatable how much he truly believes in these ideas, but he does preach that it's their purpose and destiny to rule. He argues that wizards are just born with that something extra. He relies on prophecy to get through to his followers. He preaches that wizards should stick together and criticizes aurors for killing their own. There doesn't seem to be any concern with blood purity. The only other wizards he singles out are aurors and the ministry, framing them as the aggressors and oppressors. I didn't see him interacting with magical humanoids.

** I buy him as a person more than I ever did with Voldemort. Voldemort is cool but he seems like he'd be a villain in a cartoon from the 80s - what with his sole focus being on immortality and power.

Gellert seems like the type of guy you'd actually read about in a history book, if magic existed.

** In my personal headcanon, his central beliefs are of a meritocratic nature while absolutely putting magic above non-magic, pretty much without exceptions. So differently from Voldemort, who basically allied himself with the strongest faction, Grindelwald's followers are way more diversive and also extend into the non-human range with less prejudice than the purebloods showed. I'd assume he'd strive to sign contracts similar to the one with the goblins, such as vampires given free hunting rights in certain (muggle-only) areas in exchange for not daring to attack magical folk. Throw in a difference in taste between magical and mundane blood and you already have the beginnings of another kind of conflict going.

In fact, he would probably be way more at odds with the rich and powerful than with your average muggleborn. If Voldemort basically attempted a hostile takeover from the higher echelons, Grindelwald is closer to a revolution from the ‘normal' people. Building on this, I see the rest of Europe as having less problems with pureblood-thinking: a lot of them either stood against him and were eliminated or agreed with him and fell from power after 1945. On the other hand, he could offer the muggleborns (and halfbloods, to a degree) a vision of a world where they truly belonged instead of being tolerated and where they could achieve things based upon their own performance instead of the position of their parents.

Personally, I don't like the scenario with Grindelwald as the puppeteer behind the whole WW II, or even behind Nazi Germany. I don't think anyone could've orchestrated the whole chain of events in such a way. (I'm kind of split about him having contact with Hitler. The Nazis were found to be quite invested in occultism and celtic artefacts, and together with Grindelwald looking kind of Aryan, doing something here is possible) He did, however, certainly know how to use it to his advantages. The Nazis were famous for rounding up dissidents and I'm fairly sure Grindelwald would've used the guise of concentration camps to get rid of his own enemies and blame it on the ‘terrible, brutal muggles in need of guidance'. On the other hand, it's also a personal headcanon of mine that France did fall as quickly as it did because of magical sabotage, causing the chaos of war to spread much quicker. Basically he wants to create a magical utopia, would then point to the violence in the muggle world and use this as a justification to rise over muggles and rule over them.

As for him as person: I kinda always imagined Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald as three parts of how you'd imagine some sort of fantasy wizard-king. Voldemort stands for raw power. Engaging in the equivalence of magical arm wrestling with him would always end in his victory, but he kinda sacrificed diversity and reason for that. Dumbledore stands for skill, he is in a sense ‘the best' in magic and since knowledge seems to translate into power quite easily in this universe, he's also the one who would win most actual fights. He is, in my opinion at least, however not that great at being a leader and far more suited to a life as a scholar -- even if he wasn't allowed to be. Grindelwald would, even while still standing far above most other wizards and witches, lose to both in a direct fight, but he mainly stands for charisma. He'd be the one with a silver tongue, the one who prefers gaining devoted allies over fearful obedience. His power lies less in his personal strength than the number and cooperation of his followers.

This kinda became a rant, but I'm on mobile and my station is coming up

** I generally think of Grindelwald as a Robespierre-like figure. Highly polarizing but immensely influential, vilified for his brutality but occasionally praised as a revolutionary figure. I pit him against the magical aristocracy on the Continent, leading a political movement which essentially slaughtered the ruling class of Germany and France, with a general backdrop of muggle hatred that was held back until he saw an exploitable opportunity in WWII. This answers some of the questions about why Dumbledore would wait so long to intervene---if he generally agreed with Grindelwald's goals (reducing the power of an oppressive aristocracy), if not his methods, he might have seen fit to let the foreign nations handle their own situation. However, I think Grindelwald would have seen the atrocities of the war as an excuse to start a rallying cry around the abolishment of the Statute of Secrecy, which Dumbledore absolutely /could not/ allow to happen as it would lead to the collapse of the magical world as he knew it. So he went to Grindelwald, defeated him, and imprisoned him for life.

In terms of long term impact, that sort of true purging of a class cannot be ignored, and would have led to more stable changes in continental magical society. In addition, I think it provides a compelling origin story for Tom Riddle. A highly intelligent sociopathic boy who hates muggles and is seeking power might see the outline of Grindelwalds's plan and twist it to better fit the situation in Britain. So he backs the ruling class rather than the oppressed and scales back on the anti-Muggle views that threaten the Statute, replacing it with anti-Muggleborn discrimination. It turns an already brutal political position into outright dystopian bigotry, of course, but he genuinely doesn't care about anything but his own power.

** My personal headcanon for him is that he had some ties to the Lithuanian nobility and went to Britain to find some supporters against the Tsar. He met both, Adrianna, with whom he fell in love, and Dumbledore, whom he led on because he would be a useful tool. Albus finds out, they duel, in the end his love lies dead on the ground and Gellert knows whom to blame. Sadly, the British public believes Dumbledore and so Grindelwald has to run, swearing revenge.

So when the German Empire kicks the Russians out of East Prussia (Battles of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes) Gellert sees an opportunity. He makes common cause with the Kaiser and supplies the imperial army with some enchanted gear, Veritasserum and so on. In return, he is supposed to be head of state of Lithuania after Brest-Litovsk, but Versailles removes German influence over the Baltics and therefore Grindelwald does not get "his birthright". So he continues to work in the shadows until there is war again. Bitter over Versailles, he decides to settle an old score with the British and exchanges magic for a few V1/2s and the rights to Lithuania (which historical borders include a lot of Eastern Europe). The V program gets some magic homing heads and quite a few of the "misses" actually hit hidden magical houses. The Soviets win the war, wear down his followers over years of combat and Dumbledore swoops in to finish him.

So you have a freedom fighter who eventually grew into a warmongering monster who wanted to rule a third of Europe (everything East of the Third Reich).
