Vague title, I know, but it basically sums it up. I'd like recs of fics where Harry participates in some type of tournament event. Not even specifically looking for the TriWizard Tournament -- I remember reading something with competitors from magical schools all over the world (what's that fic, if anybody knows), one where Voldy's looking for a consort and enters Harry, and multiple with completely different events/tasks, etc. Slash, gen, AUs where Voldy won, AUs where Harry didn't attend Hogwarts, super OP/MOD Harry, whatever -- anything goes!
