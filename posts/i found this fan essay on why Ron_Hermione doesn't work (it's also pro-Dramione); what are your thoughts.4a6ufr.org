Bonus disparaging of canon relationships with Newspeak buzzword:

#+begin_quote
  But in terms of the Romione dynamic, it's *problematic.*
#+end_quote

Hrrk.

The author then goes on to confuse flighty concepts such as 'good' and 'bad' in a series where it was quite clear who was evil and who wasn't 90% of the time:

#+begin_quote
  [JKR] offers [Draco] no redemption, and even the fact that his family didn't have to serve in Azkaban is tainted by the fact that JKR wanted to further this concept of Harry being amazing and good, rather than to really give the Malfoys some absolution of guilt).
#+end_quote

Even JKR's 'everyone gets redeemed' philosophy isn't enough for some fans. They want absolution. Quick, I need an old priest and a young priest.

The author also attempts to lessen the impact of the Malfoys' bigotry and places the crux of Draco's belief system at Lucius's feet:

#+begin_quote
  But it's important to remember that those aren't Draco's beliefs. They are his father's, and Voldemort's, and Snape's.
#+end_quote

In a moment of rhetorical clarity, the author attempts to anticipate the most likely objection to their argument:

#+begin_quote
  [Draco] didn't know to challenge his elders simply because that's not the way he was raised. I doubt Lucius Malfoy taught his son to “question everything” or ask “why?”. No way. Draco was told to sit down, shut up, listen, and do as we say. Or else.
#+end_quote

The author was forced to strip all agency away from Draco in the process of defending his actions. How revoltingly boring: a character without a values system of their own.

Sorry for the often sarcastic rant, but I strongly dislike redemption stories for thoroughly despicable villains. +Tom Felton+ Draco is one of the most popular characters in the fandom, so I understand that people defend him, but for the life of me I can't figure out /why./

Some people /do/ like redemption stories. And also Draco is not a "thoroughly despicable villain". Voldemort is that. Bellatrix. And, hell, people seem to have less of an issue with Bellatrix pairings than they do with Draco. Draco was a bratty kid who was raised to believe he was better than everyone else. To expect him to have risen above that and adopted a better moral framework while still a teenager surrounded by people reinforcing the original one is /ridiculous/. One's values don't appear ex nihilo. They're the product of your environment and experiences (and biology to an extent).

We also know that when it came down to it he couldn't actually bring himself to kill or to betray Harry to Voldemort. His attempts to kill Dumbledore were half-assed, indirect methods that seemed designed more to look like he was making an effort than to actually succeed. The fact that they were just as likely to harm someone other than the target (and did) is not exactly laudable, nor was allowing the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, but I don't know how you can reasonably expect anything else from someone in his position.

There's a good chance his experiences in the war would have shaken his belief system. Overall he seems like an ideal candidate for a redemption story. That story /is/ Draco developing a values system of his own.

#+end_quote

This seems a bit disingenuous. "If you aren't a Dark Lord or his sadistic lieutenant, then your heart must not be in it." Surely Draco's actions have painted him as an unrepentant bigot. It's true that Draco didn't harm /as many/ people as TMR or Bellatrix, but he was still directly responsible for too much death and destruction to ever be absolved of his actions.

#+begin_quote
  One's values don't appear ex nihilo.
#+end_quote

He also doesn't exist in a vacuum. There were /plenty/ of other influences throughout the series that could have helped him to develop a more mature values system if only he'd been open to alternate points of view. He saw Lucius and Narcissa for only three months of the year, which I'd think would greatly diminish their contribution. For the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts, he was surrounded by the likes of Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid. He had plenty of opportunities to ditch his bigotry but chose not to do so.

No, for the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts he was surrounded by other Slytherin students, at least most of whom were raised like him. Even Harry only interacted with Dumbledore occasionally and he was special. He would've interacted with McGonagall and Hagrid only in their respective classes.

This is a terrible comparison. Peter actually was surrounded by people with a better moral framework.

This kind of black and white thinking is what frustrates me so much about this topic. People are not inherently good or evil. Yeah, Draco did bad shit, and I'm not saying he should just be absolved of it. But I argue that based on how he was raised and the environment he was in you can't expect him to have acted in any other way, to suddenly have a complete personality change and decide out of nowhere that what he's doing is wrong and he won't do it anymore, damn the consequences. That doesn't mean he can't change in the future. He's now seen the utter failure of that belief system he was raised with. A redemption story is at least a plausible way for his character to develop in the future.

Harry is able to discount the inane opinions of the student body during CS and GoF. Why can't Draco do the same with the prejudices in Slytherin?

#+begin_quote
  He would've interacted with McGonagall and Hagrid only in their respective classes.
#+end_quote

And yet Harry's occasional and brief interactions with both of these individuals (and Dumbledore) was often enough to put him back on track whenever he occasionally went astray. Draco chose not to make use of these resources.

#+begin_quote
  And in neither case did his attempt get anywhere near accomplishing his actual task - killing Dumbledore. Nor were they likely to.
#+end_quote

I don't see any evidence that these ineffectual assassination attempts were anything other than genuine efforts to do TMR's bidding. Maybe I'm not picking up what you're putting down, but I don't see how Draco's failure to kill Dumbledore excuses his attacks on Katie Bell and Ron.

#+begin_quote
  This is a terrible comparison. Peter actually was surrounded by people with a better moral framework.
#+end_quote

I chose that example because both Peter and Draco had the option to refuse to do TMR's bidding and die doing what was morally praiseworthy, but chose not to do so. This comparison had nothing to do with their wildly disparate support structures.

#+begin_quote
  People are not inherently good or evil.
#+end_quote

In real life I absolutely agree and I can empathise with your frustration about the monochrome attitudes that often bleed into character discussions. Literary characters in YA fiction, though, /are/ frequently paragons of virtue or irredeemable villains.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Harry saw right through the Dursleys, so there's a precedent. Vernon and Petunia treated him quite poorly, so that likely aided his decision to spurn their values system, but the fact remains that Harry was able to settle on his own moral framework independent of his parental figures.

I think this boils down to a fundamental disagreement over the level of Draco's agency throughout the series. I think he had quite a bit, but set the stage for his future problems through his own bad decisions. You seem to be arguing that lacked the ability to affect any changes in his environment. If that's the case, I doubt we'll find any common ground, but I thank you for the interesting conversation anyway.

** They do have a good point about the fact that the epilogue is 2 decades of time with no character development; it makes everything seem a little odd. But both the parts that criticize Ron/Hermione and the parts that hold up Draco/Hermione ignore textual evidence and conflate or exaggerate other sections as suits them. Hell, they say that they "personally believe" that Draco gave up his pureblood beliefs as early as book 4 in spite of their being absolutely no evidence of that, and ample evidence of the opposite. They say that Ron constantly compares women to his mother and holds her up as ideal. There is exactly one time that Ron brings up his mother as an ideal figure, and that's with regards to cooking, while they're starving in the forest and he's wearing a horcrux. They assume that the thing Hermione would value the most in a partner is the ability to match her for wits and cleverness, in spite of her expressly stating the opposite as early as PS.

** I would agree with two things: That Ron and Hermione were an odd and uncomfortable pair that I have trouble imagine working out long term, and that few other male characters were developed enough to be a potential romantic partner for Hermione.

If you put aside Neville, as the blog post author did, then Draco is the only eligible male character that's had significant page time. As he is at the end of the seven books, he's shown to have at least /disliked/ the reality of the rhetoric of his family and the Dark Lord. He also seems to be somewhat intelligent with a sense of humor, though he's a little jerk and a bully and arrogant as all get-out.

I think a good writer who chose to continue the story post book 7 could /develop/ Draco into a viable partner for Hermione, and in terms of storytelling there's real value there. Conflict and tension, etc.

A good author could also develop a whole new character who is a decent match for Hermione, too, in that case. But since many fanfic readers like to see their familiar characters treated, it might not pull in many readers . . .

I don't agree that Draco is the only logical choice for Hermione, but I think the author brings up good points about the nature of Ron and Hermiones relationship. I always felt a little weird about their dynamic, and I think the observation that Hermione is exacting and Ron is insecure really hits the nail on the head about why their relationship always felt off to me personally.

*** I think it has more to do with the "my ship is better than yours" tone, than the actual content. That said, this is discussing Draco "kill all the mudbloods" Malfoy and Hermione "muggleborn" Granger.

**** I don't agree with the article, just some of the points. I think Hermione and Ron would have to mature beyond where they were at 17 in order to work, and the epilogue doesn't give them that journey.

And I don't ship Dramione, but I think a lot of people are being hipocritical here by bashing that idea as stupid and illogical, while being angry with this author for defending her pairing and calling Ronmione bad.

Ship and let ship, I say.

** I found it well-reasoned. Especially the Ron continuing to be immature and the relationships at 18 generally falling apart. And at least they rejected the "Hermione shows Draco the light" idea; I, too, wouldn't be surprised if he found rejecting his father's views to be in his own best interests, without anyone else's input. After that, imagining the two of them connecting as adults is believable.
