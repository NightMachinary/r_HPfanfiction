** 1. They don't have the capability to do it. In canon, the closest the Ministry can get to preventing magic is stuffing an area full of Dementors.

2. Even if they could do it, I doubt they'd want to. The Statute of Secrecy exists for the convenience of wizards, not the protection of Muggles. Making vast areas of the world no-go areas for wizards would dramatically decrease wizards' convenience, not increase it.

***** Why? They're indifferent at best to Muggles, and aren't supposed to use magic in the Muggle world anyway because of the Statute.

I feel like Law Enforcement would be on board, less work in the long run.

****** Like I said, setting all of this up would be tons of work, like having speed control on absolutely every street in your country. Most wizards and witches think themselves superior to muggles, even those fighting on Dumbledore's side, and giving up some of your personal freedom for someone you perceive inferior will enrage lots of people. People aren't necessarily rational 100% of the time. And there are only a few wizarding communities out there, I doubt many would want to only be able to practice magic in Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley.

I see your point. They could still do magic in their homes and property (which is what they're supposed to do anyway), and public wizarding spaces/properties.

******** Yeah, generally it's a good idea (if such magic exists) but it's like a huge attack on personal freedom for them, magic is innate to them, a part of them, so I'm not sure if many would want that. It's not like eg taking guns away from people, it's more like tying their hands together in public

**** I think it could be an interesting start/setting for a fic actually. It'd probably need a larger wizarding world to have enough to spare for this, and could make for some interesting tension with other wizards abroad that haven't adopted that

** Several reasons. Here are 3.

1. I say this a lot and people get upset about it, but I will say it again. Wards aren't canon. The term ‚Äúwards‚Äù never appears in the HP series once. There are magical ‚Äúprotections‚Äù but never a series of interlocking long lasting protections. There is no canonic ‚Äúrune stone‚Äù to power them. All of this is borrowed from other fandoms and universes. The ‚Äúshield‚Äù we see in the DH movie isn't books canon and took the combined efforts of the entire Hogwarts senior staff to cast with many many other adults - and Voldemort broke it in an instant.

2. There canonically does not exist magic that removes someone else's ability to cast magic until the Fantastic Beasts movies. Even then, they're an enchanted object not a spell.

3. Removing all ability for magic to be expressed in muggle areas would prevent wizards from defending themselves against muggles, which no one would support, and would according to FB canon turn nearly every muggleborn into an Obscurial since their magic is constantly pushed back in and repressed.

If you want to write a fanfic based upon this principal world change/differences it could make for a great dystopian fic where muggleborns are truly feared and reviled, though.

*** Just one minor point.

While wards as a term is never used in canon in the sense fanon uses it, there are examples of things in canon that fanon would call wards. For example, the Anti-Disapparation Jinx, and the protections Hermione puts on their camping site.
