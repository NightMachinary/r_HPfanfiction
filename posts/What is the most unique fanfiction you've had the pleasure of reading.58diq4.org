** Seventh Horcrux. linkffn(10677106) It takes a very black humor approach to Voldemort's thoughts in the most hilarious way I've ever seen him portrayed. Here are the 3rd-5th sentences of the fic, and give a pretty good look at what you can expect to see whenever we get a look into Voldemort's mind:

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix crouched at my feet, sneaking glances and occasionally emitting dreamy sighs -- exactly the sort of behavior that caused me to turn myself into a nose-less snake. Rabastan Lestrange was playing a game called Curse the Recruits, the recruits were screaming, Nott was paging through one of my Dark tomes, and Lucius had disappeared to go brush his hair or something. There were worse ways to spend Halloween, I supposed.
#+end_quote

And that's not even getting into "Harry's" thoughts and dialogue with Hermione and Ron.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

*** Now I remember why Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin annoyed me so. The author starts with year 4 in the first chapter and then reverts back to year one going 80+ chapters before we see the prologue again. It was basically "Hey, let me set this cool story up for you" and then "But before we get to this, lets do 40 chapters of cliche first, yes?"

As for the storyline of group of students uses a defective portkey in both [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] (link to the series rather then just first fic) and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] replaces the crossover world with Naruto and has some promise, but is slow to update. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/258048][The Ark and the Desert]] is about magical society colonizing a planet, but is abandoned. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] is a very well known example of building a new magic civilization. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, and are forced to build a community. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3450026][The Wizard Beyond The Walls]] fits a little bit? It is abandoned before the heavy duty community building though. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] was inspired by Xerosis and has a similar storyline but they take over a hidden world rather then the moon.

[[/u/viol8er]] aka Cole Pascal's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/1/][A Trek to the Stars: The Potter Files]] also has Harry interacting with an established magical society on a distant planet, and causing some major changes. He comes in later, but it goes into detail, so may be worth a go.

By Esama specifically, in the Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up alone on an asteroid and has to terraform it, which is similar I guess? Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up creating a seemingly sentient forest on a distant planet. Harry and fellow student build a sort of society in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346][D.S.S. Requirement]].

Settling on a new planet is harder then it seems, especially when they find they are not the only ones wanting to claim it as their own

  basically starts with a bunch of cliches (Hadrian Remus Potter is abandoned at the Dursleys while his parents raise his brother), but the author subverts them one by one (with reasonable, logical explanations that add to world building)
#+end_quote

I feel a little bit misled. I started reading this and up until Chapter 21 nothing has been subverted yet. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining and sort of well written, so I'm enjoying it, but there's a extraordinarily intelligent and politically savvy WBWL... a misunderstood mentor!Snape (who did nothing wrong while Sirius Black gets all the blame), evil/heartless Potters, arrogant Boy-Who-Lived, and everything else that goes along with Slyterhin!Harry stories. Honestly the only thing that's missing to hit all the cliches is a misunderstood!Draco. I firmly expect a subplot in Year 2 that Slytherin actually wasn't a pureblood bigot and it's all propaganda (no spoilers please).

Is there actually any subversion of these tropes going to happen? Just so that I can adjust my expectations.

#+begin_quote
  Is there actually any subversion of these tropes going to happen?
#+end_quote

I think so, and Year 2 is when it really picks up. I'm gonna dance around spoilers (b/c I don't wanna spoil anything), but I'll give some examples.

#+begin_quote
  there's a extraordinarily intelligent and politically savvy WBWL
#+end_quote

This question is actually brought up later on by another character. The question is, how is Harry so well spoken if he was abused and denied an education for the first 11 years of his life. The author hasn't revealed how yet, but I have my suspicions.

#+begin_quote
  Evil/heartless Potters
#+end_quote

The Potters have good reasons for hating Slytherins. James' (and by extension Jim's) is pretty spoiler-tastic, Lily's is simply because her confrontation with Snape made her realize how little she fits in to the wizarding world. Her parents were brutally murdered because she dared to marry a Pureblood, and she actually hates the magical world a decent amount. (She willingly sent Harry away b/c she thought he was a squib and would rather have a non-magical living child grow up happy and not discriminated against).

What you'll start seeing in Book 2 (which you rarely see in WBWL stories) is Jim and Ron get huge character development during Year 2 (no spoilers though) to the point where I'm extremely psyched for the next 2 upcoming chapters (focusing on Ron and Jim). Jim and Ron's character arcs are a large part of Year 2, especially towards the end.

Also, Pettigrew, Lockhart and Luna are done too. Lockhart is extremely smart and competent, and Luna's "ability to see nargles/wrackspurts" is explored (and revealed to be dangerous, both for her and others).

Yeah, ok, sorry, probably not going to happen. I'm contemplating dropping this fic: I've grown increasingly frustrated with the writing in Year 2 (what's up with the lack of agency by the main characters? Seems like everyone is a victim of circumstance and plotrails) and the apparent big head of the author. At least from the Author Notes I now understand why people say this fic subverts things, since the author himself doesn't seem to understand what subversion means - yet constantly claims he has successfully subverted some kind of cliche in the AN.

It's a shame really, since the author certainly has some talent and in a less ambitious story he might not have lost himself in convoluted plots/schemes that don't have any real payoff (wow Lockhart was leading up to batting spells away. Did I really have to read pages upon pages about ping-pong to get to that point?). Mystery writing is hard to pull off if you can't strike a balance between blatantly obvious revelations or pulling stuff out of your ass. Like I get it already, there's something terribly mysterious compelling Harry and Jim to hate it each other... can we get on with it please? "Brevity is the soul of wit" or in other words, don't waste my fucking time.

IMHO the author made a big mistake by writing that prologue. Now he is pretty much committed to keep the same character dynamic going between James/Harry/Jim for 4... almost 5 years without resolving anything. Reminds me of JKR and her infamous epilogue which was supposedly already written before everything else.

The story does suffer from some flaws, some glaring, some less so. Characterization is iffy, the plot loses direction at times and there are some themes that detract, rather than add to the story - like the author's obsession with sexual assaults.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. I didn't think I'd like a non-magical AU, or a retelling of the entire series with a twist, but this story taught me differently. Enough changes to canon, subtle and not so subtle, to satisfy me, entertaining ways to replace magic with technology, with logical consequences as well, and a great slow-building romance, as well as unique character changes. One of the relatively few year 1-7 fics that are actually completed.

Highly recommended, very unusual in concept and execution.

Part of the premise is that Harry is not the BWL (that's Neville), but he /is/ a really great wizard in the making, under Dumbledore's tutelage. A lot of what distinguishes the stories is his writing style, which is unusual and very, very good.

Too bad part three never got written.

  Fenrir Greyback is in London again. She knows this because she pays attention, because she listens to whispers and reads between the lines in newspapers. No one's seen her for two years--no one who remembers her as Lavender Brown, at least. In Lyon she was Camille Delacorte; in Dresden she was Madgalena Burkhardt; in Bucharest she was Anastazja Kusmenova. But here, in London again, she is Lavender Brown, and she wears her true name like she wears the scars on her throat: with pride, accompanied by sharp claws and sharper teeth.

  Hermione is sixteen years old when a wall of Time Turners breaks near her. She glances toward the chaos and sees time floating freely from the small golden charms as clearly as she sees a shower of glass and flashes of red and green light all around her. Then she hears something both distant and familiar; all the truth of space and time and herself swell up within her. Tears fall from her eyes before she collapses onto the floor. When she awakens, Hermione has two hearts.

***** First of all, I don't write that shit. Hell, I barely write fan fiction /at all/ at this point.

Just... stop while you're ahead, please.
