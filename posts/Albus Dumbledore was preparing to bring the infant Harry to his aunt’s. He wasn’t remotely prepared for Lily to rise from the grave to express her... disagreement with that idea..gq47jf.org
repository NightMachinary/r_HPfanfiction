*** Ooo, there's an idea!!

Being that the war was so violent, as well as tragic, many people died before their time.

What happens when ghost start returning to the living world a year to the date of their death?

***** Also, you got the title wrong, so I don't know if the bot will pick it up it's /Harry Potter, Squatter/ with a comma, not a period, and it's capitalized(don't know if the bot's case sensitive).

These days, I just describe all the fanfics I'm listing and use linkffn(13274956) or whatever the ID is for the fanfic at the end of the comment.
