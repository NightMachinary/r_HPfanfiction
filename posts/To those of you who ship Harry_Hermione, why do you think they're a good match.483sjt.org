And in your reasoning, don't bother comparing them to Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny, focus on why you think they specifically are good for each other. For the sake of this thread not having arguments that span for 20,000 posts, people who disagree, kindly refrain from arguing.


** OK, shipping is often about the shipper, not the characters.

So I will say that as a girl who was more academically inclined than sportily inclined, who loved her books, who was not considered one of the pretty girls at school, I identified with Hermione more than any of the other female characters. And I suspect that that applies to a large proportion of the kind of fans who become shippers (as opposed to more general, less fervid fans of the books and movies).

OK, so I feel like Hermione is my analogue in the books. Who do /I/ want to be with? The hero. Not the guy who makes fun of my studying and my books (uh, more), not the guy who dated someone who always made fun of me. Not the guy who called me a nightmare when I was 12. The dependable guy; the one who only argues about important stuff where he actually thinks about the argument rather than simply taking the side opposite to mine; the one who can buckle down when something is important, and will do anything for his friends.

So, in my opinion, it is usually not about Hermione and Harry, it's about the bookworm getting the hero.

*** I can stand behind the bookworm getting the hero. Too often, the smart girl gets a consolation price - the not so attractive, not so brave sidekick - while the hero gets the cheerleader.

This wouldn't been much of an issue if Ron hadn't been wrecked by JKR in the later books, instead of growing up to be a hero. He could have been the counterpart to angsty Harry, the one pulling the two others through, talking them up, keeping morale up. So much potential wasted.

** To be clear, everything that follows is post-hoc rationalization: I like the ship because I like it, and I have since I was a kid. Pretending there's a rational basis to it is fun for talking to other people, but I think it's a bad way of understanding most ships and shippers. A bit flips while you're reading the books (or watching the movies, or even reading fanfic) and there you are.

Anyway, I ship them because I think their backgrounds have given them very similar fears and anxieties. Neither of them seems to accept as a matter of course that the people around them will like them, or continue to like them. They're both very service- and work-oriented in terms of how they relate to others; there's not a lot of easy camaraderie in their lives. They can't understand the broader, social world without some effort. They have an intense connection, forged in extreme pressure for years and years. (As, of course, do Ron and Hermione; I've got absolutely no interest in debating ships 10 years after the fact.) That connection is not 100% pleasurable for them but is clearly as valuable to them as anything there is.

And that's interesting to me! Some people are more into the opposites-attract idea, and I get it. I have no interest in proving myself right or anybody else wrong. It's just that I'm personally more intrigued by the way that two people who have the same dysfunctions---who seem, in part, to be drawn together by them---find a way beyond them.

So that's what I like to read, and that's what I like to write. (For me the main failure mode of H/Hr stories is when that work comes extremely, inexplicably easily---without warning, Harry and Hermione are not /two people with the same flaws/ but /the same person/, which typically involves Hermione's personality being transplanted, cleanly and without warning, into Harry's body.)

** I ship them because I like them together. That's about the sum total of it, really.

Part of it is that I identified so much with bookworm Hermione from the get-go (complete with awful unmanageable hair, lol). I mean, I know Harry's the protagonist but it was Hermione that hooked me in.

She has some of the characteristics that I'm most drawn to in fictional characters. She's clever - really clever - and quiet and awkward and /lonely/. It's no coincidence that my other favourite HP characters - Neville and Luna and Lupin - have similar traits.

Harry has this too. Like Hermione, he comes to Hogwarts essentially isolated, with no social network to fall back on. They're both disadvantaged in making one, too: Harry is too-often seen /first/ as the BWL, and Hermione doesn't have the social skills not to make her intelligence off-putting.

I like this shared, non-magical background. I think it's something they could have bonded over more than they did. Instead a lot of family focus falls on the Weasleys - and I /like/ the Weasleys, but even on the page they're very loud and a little exhausting. In real life, supreme-introvert-me could only manage an hour or two of them before escaping to the library for quiet.

I like that this shared background allows them to sort of see past the other's faults. Hermione never really (past the first train meeting) sees Harry as anything other than a person first. She knows what being lonely is like and sees that Harry really wants no bar of being the BWL; that it's actually a hindrance for him socially as much as a danger. And Harry, having lived with the Dursleys, knows the value of consideration for others. He can see perfectly well that she's annoying but when push comes to shove he'll go rescue her from a troll and even make others do so as well.

Yes, they fight but I never got the sense that, fundamentally, they lost respect for each other. They might be angry and worried and foolish, but they're not mean when they argue. They don't get nasty, they're not demeaning - and they know every button the other one has so they could easily hurt the other one savagely if they wanted to but they don't.

They always struck me as people who would do well in a long-term relationship. When life gets difficult, their instinct is generally to pull together. It's one thing to hold together when your life's at stake, and quite another when it's 3am and the baby won't stop crying and someone's forgotten to pay the power bill and there's an important meeting in 6 hours and none of the laundry's done. Alright, a lot of that can be fixed by magic but you get what I mean. In the long term, consideration and kindness and respect and shared backgrounds and the desire to pull your punches get you a lot further than fireworks. Which might explain why I also ship Hermione with Neville, for instance. (I think adult Hermione would go beautifully with adult Neville!) And I read a Hermione/Luna fic recently which I thought was wonderful and which has nearly converted me.

So basically: I see chemistry in places where I see chemistry, and that coupled with personal identification and preferred character traits make me ship this ship. If you don't, that's all good, go find your own bliss with another ship and be happy.

Wow, really? To me she seemed like the most talkative person in the series, literally barging into peoples' compartments and introducing herself, or talking to people that don't want to talk to her (Harry and Ron in the first book). Her voice is often described as shrill.

To me this seems like the opposite of an introvert, and makes your comment about the Weasleys quite hypocritical.

**** It don't think it's hypocritical for me to say that I personally find the Weasleys loud and exhausting. They are loud and I do find them exhausting! And I never said that Hermione was an introvert. I said that /I/ was an introvert. Just because I identify with her in some ways doesn't mean that I do so in all: it's you who's conflating us there, not me. I grant the paragraph you're referring to wasn't clear, however. Basically: To me, HP is a lot about found families. In the text a lot of that was tied into the Weasleys, at the expense I think of some other relationships. Harry and Hermione, yes, but Harry and Neville as well - although the bits that focused on the mirror-pasts of the two boys were excellent and I would have liked to see more of them. I can see /why/ Rowling chose the way she did, though: she enjoys relationships between opposites. Contrasting the Dursleys with the Weasleys, for instance, and between Ron and Hermione. "Opposites attract" is a deservedly well-used tool, and heaps of characters (and readers) go for that. It's fun to read about how warm and close the Weasleys are compared to how cold and horrible the Dursleys are. But though use of opposites is a lot of people's fave, I tend to prefer books that focus on similarity rather than opposites. It's no better or worse, just personal preference.

Hermione has both extrovert and introvert qualities. She copes with the Weasleys better than I would, but she's still used to - and actively seeks out - extensive periods of silence and asocial activity (aka The Library). Harry, from his time under the stairs, is also used to the same extensive periods - and that's always struck me as a commonality between them.

I know it's a kids series, but I've always thought there was insufficient attention given to the consequences of Harry's early childhood. His formative years were spent locked away, essentially, unable to interact with normal kids (Dudley is not normal). And frankly, I can't imagine Hermione having any friends either, pre-Hogwarts. She's just that off-putting. That both of them didn't have more trouble fitting in is something that got skipped over somewhat in the text, I think (though more in Harry's case than Hermione's). They both missed "How to make friends 101".

There's a potential for bonding there that never really got explored: two grossly isolated children catapulted into a magic world where everything single thing is bizarre. ("Why aren't they using ballpoint pens? Do we have to write with these stupid quills?")

I do think you've got a point that Hermione can be very talkative in some situations. In the classroom, certainly, but I've always interpreted that as an outcome of poor social skills. She tends to see her own value as purely intellectual and wants to reinforce that impression - granted, we don't see Luna in class, for instance, but I doubt she's so frantic to prove her own value. But then again, Luna's in Ravenclaw so whatever other issues she has there's an implicit institutional acceptance of her intelligence. And Hermione does tend to talk a lot in service of others - when trying to help them find a toad or avoid death and expulsion - but she also places a heavy value on silence.

No-one who likes the sound of their own shrill voice more than anything else spends that much time in the library, where the expectation of silence is absolute. At least when you give Hermione a book (and she has a book, like, 90% of the time) she shuts right up.

I mean, there's an element of confirmation bias here. We see the books from Harry's point of view, so the only time we see Hermione is when she's interacting with him in some capacity. We do know from the books, however, that she spends a vast amount of time in the library silence. Partly because she's playing to her strengths, but partly because she genuinely loves the environment there.

Ok, stopping now. It's amazing how much I can focus on something that isn't my horrible boring thesis. Procrastination, thy name is kakapo.

***** I get your point about the Weasleys being loud. I don't think Harry or Hermione fit with the Weasleys because of that. Imagine Harry and Ginny sitting at a dining table and Ginny keeps talking happily about her day and all the other Weasleyss are happily chatting. Harry's just happy listening but he doesn't even try to get a word in edgewise because he's just so happy to see a loud loving family. How is that okay? Harry and Hermione on other hand just fit. Hermione likes to hear the sound of her own voice sometimes and Harry listens. However, Hermione also is mature enough to see when Harry is quite and she asks him about his opinion and ideas. Harry and Hermione rely on each other for the small things like a crowded party neither of them wants to attend. Harry and Hermione are the kind of people who fight because both of them want to do the dishes. I know it's probably just me but I don't see either of them with anyone but each other and definitely with the respective Weasleys.

As a vocal H/Hr enthusiast, I respectfully disagree. I don't think there ever was an opening because the author had her heart set on R/Hr and H/G from the beginning.

I agree. Every time I see this, I think of it as a self-insert instead of any AU version of the canon Hermione. I've always thought of Hermione as a late bloomer who bears almost no resemblance to the actress that portrayed her in the films.

I've never really understood the obsession some writers have with making it clear to the reader that a character is considered attractive. For a good portion of the series, they're children. Kinda squicks me out a bit.

** (Obviously everything that follows is my /opinion/.)

I'll be ignoring some of the character derailing from books 6 and 7 that JKR only did in order to force the One Big Happy Weasley Family ending.

Some reasons I think they're suited for each other:

- Hermione choses Harry, not Ron, during the Horcrux hunt.\\
- They have mutual respect for each other. Harry considers Hermione to be the smartest person he knows and (with one exception, the broom incident) supports her throughout. Likewise Hermione believes in Harry's potential and is basically the only reason he accomplished anything at all.\\
- They are also shown to understand each other wordlessly. Consider the hiding of their identities when the Snatchers grab them, or how Hermione's plan to lure Umbitch to the Centaurs is immediately understood by Harry.\\
- +Unlike some dysfunctional canon couple I won't mention,+ they're not constantly shown as bickering over minor things . The one time we do see them fight it's over the broomstick, where Harry feels betrayed because she went over his head and he apologizes later when he realises she only did it to protect him.\\
- There is no mean jealousy shown between them. Hermione never desires Harry's fame or money and is happy for him when he is happy, Harry is never jealous Hermione is better in class.
- Everyone else sees them as dating. Cho Chang feels threatened by Hermione since she believes Harry wants to date Hermione instead, never even considering this may /not/ be the case; Rita Skeeter writes them as dating (which they are not /angry/ about, just confused/frustrated; whereas Ron is furious/jealous).\\
- They come from a similar Muggle background and both suffer prejudice. Harry because he is a Half-blood and Parselmouth, Hermione for being a Muggleborn.\\

***** When I say assumptions, I'm not talking about your reasons for shipping H/Hr. I specifically meant that you assume that JKR abandoned her characters and let them derail for the sake of a convenient plot 180, when her canon pairings were set in stone from the beginning.

With your original comment you very clearly disregarded anyone who ships R/Hr by quite snidely describing them as "some dysfunctional canon couple I won't mention", which is quite childish and makes you seem really closed-minded. If you want people to respect your views, you should do the same to others.

You don't have to respect "people who tell you you're wrong", but you could also choose to not go to snarky lengths to defend your point, and then be angry when you're being downvoted. [[/u/Almavet][u/Almavet]] has even explained what they meant in their first comment and it clearly wasn't what you took out of it.

It's cool that you're passionate about a ship, but don't let it make you passive agressive. People are going to disagree with you about anything and that's their right, as is it your right to do the same.

** Discussions about pairings have less to do with the characters and more to do with which tropes the reader enjoys most. I don't like First Girl Wins or Will-They-Or-Won't-They, so the canon pairings are right out.

I never saw H/Hr happening in canon. In fact, I agreed with JKR that several of the 'anvil-sized' hints of R/Hr were readily apparent in the original series. That doesn't make me enjoy H/G and R/Hr by default, though.

The pairing appeals to me because I think there are a lot of options available to fanfic authors with a pairing featuring a brave, snarky hero and a brilliant but often haughty sidekick. In a nutshell: H/Hr is easy to write.

** I'm no shipper. If a fanfic identifies itself with its ship alone, I most often won't read it.

But I do like Harry & Hermione together as a couple in fics. I did entertain that idea from the moment I myself found girls to be interesting and probably projected a lot of my own fantasies onto those two characters. Harry because hes somebody I can identify with and Hermione because she always was the type of girl I aspired to date (sans her bossy attitude).

** The ship (it is my go to when I want a romantic story) is because when well done actually opens Harry's eyes from his passivity (as stated in this thread and across many other threads he's an incredibly passive character overall).

The scene she wrote when Harry realized it was Hermione at the beginning of the Yule Ball started my interest.

And then the tent scene. Oh god that tent scene.

It's always bothered me.

And this is the biggest issue I've had with her writing (and I've said something this before).

As she got further and further into Harry's story the writing seemed to get away from her.

She's put magic in the real world. Using specific dates and years. But doesn't explore what it means to be a magical from non magical parents (muggle-born) or really what it means to be born from one Pure Blooded parent (Half-Blood) in the terms of how a person (protagonist/main character) reacts to this knowledge.

Even if we put aside all the issues of Harry being raised by the Dursleys he just doesn't...he basically goes along for the ride.

So of course he doesn't see Hermione as a potentilla love interest. It wasn't put right in front of him.

Of course Ginny just pops up and becomes the love interest. It was put right in front of him.

I think it would take a bit more exposition but in canon (ESP after the tent scene) HHr could have been a thing.

What the hell does that even supposed to mean? how was Hermione not put "right in front of him" while Ginny was?

And what tent scene are you referring to? the one where they talked so little that Hermione had to get a racist portrait for company?

The scene where Ron bounces and just leaves them to their own and in that scene I read into what could have been.

A genuinely touching scene that could have forced them to actually deal with what is going on is basically instead instead not dealt with and then you're right. She has to get something out of the portrait.

Which is Harry being passive.

No. It is Harry left alone with someone who's sole company he doesn't really enjoy (according to his own thoughts). Not making a move on Hermione does not mean being passive. There was nothing "going on" to deal with, other than Voldemort's reign.

As a reader I also believe I'm allowed to look at scenes and see what's there and what's not there.

The subtext and the context are important. I looked at their scenes and saw what was there.

And I brought with me everything I had read up to that point. Including the book as it was.

There was an emotional action that affected the scene and effected the characters.

And through that I found the responses lacking.

Ginny got /less/ attention than Hermione in the series, your argument that she was "put in front of him" while Hermione didn't is absolutely ridiculous.

It's an AU, with Hogwarts a Spy School instead of a Magic School, but wonderfully detailed, and Ron is great. Hermione's crush on him through the years is very well plotted, and slowly built up. Really changed my view of the character, and his potential.
