Looking for the most unique harry potter stories like Core Threads, Faery Hero, Browncoat Green Eyes. Basically a Harry that is not seen much in other stories, only requirement I ask for is 30k+, and Harry has to be a powerful person in the story.

The reason I ask this is, because i'm getting bored of close enough to canon Harry, and Godlike, but nothing changes, or the whole rich as Bill Gates, wandless magic, friendly goblins etc... rinse, and repeat stories. I don't mind Godlike Harry as long as it's not basically the same thing everytime, and like I said i'm bored of basically canon Harry stories as well.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

My two most recent comments about that fic. It is definitely a different story and if you don't like that it's fine. There is almost nothing playing at Hogwarts, most of it plays pre-canon, and some post-canon.

This means new places, new faces and new everyhing, although it still feels like Harry Potter to me.

fem!Harry is really not that big of a deal in the "big picture" of this fic, it is mostly used for plot, and not for omg-female-harry.

**** With WKGQ, it goes with the idea that Pansy's character is a persona she maintains to survive in slytherin, but keeps enough of the character intact that she's not completely ooc. It's very well done imo.

Marauder's plan is a bit more cliche. Father figure sirius, op harry. And it does drag a bit. But at least it doesn't have an overpowered and supported Harry but refuses to jump off the canon rails.

**** Jeconais seems to have a style of writing that is pretty polarizing. People tend to love or hate his stories, there's not much middle ground.

Personally, I lean towards the hate part, at least towards the majority of his older stories. The amount of fluff is ridiculous, the tension artificial and characterization is strange, at best. But the worst part is the dialogue. It just rubs me the wrong way, to the point of physical rage. He has a way of making all characters sprout "clever banter" that comes across as 12-year old children attempting to sound poised and witty. I literally couldn't read past the 2nd chapter of [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]], even though I tried repeatedly (hello, Harry/Gabrielle).

That said, [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] is at least tolerable - he applied some restraint there. And [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] along with sequel, the [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]], I enjoyed thoroughly , perhaps because the story format was so different from his norm.

***** I think you're massively underestimating the proportion of people who neither hate nor love Jeconais but couldn't care less. He's one of the authors that you know exactly what you're going to get and thus while it often fails in comparison to the best it will be a solid 6.5/10 every time. He's an author I might read if I'm bored but would never seek out desperately.

**** He grows in power throughout the story actually, but he has the advantage of a fallen angel teaching him magic, so he's obviously going to be a bit more capable than everyone else.

I'd say he's pretty damn powerful, but so are characters like Dumbledore and Voldemort and other powerful characters that aren't part of the HP canon.

  Gabriel's fallen angel who has come to earth to study. Her older sister, who is an angel, learns about her misdeeds. My take on what should have happened when Zelel visited Gabriel. Spoiler: What if the dog hadn't scared off Zelel and she stayed to "rehabilitate" Gabriel, like she initially planned? WARNING: Story contains non-sexual spanking between sisters. Read at your own risk.

*** I looked at the story, and it looked like another rehash of Soldier!Harry. As in he is very powerful, and very independent. Would that be what this is like. Basically Harry with military tatics takes down Voldemort, and Death Eaters with ease. Also bitch slaps Dumbledore if he gets in the way with second chances. I really want to read a good Soldier!Harry story so please if it is different could you explain how.

Thanks in advance, Wassa.

**** Ok I've gotta preempt with a little backstory. I generally avoid cliches like the plague in London; and this one was little exception. However I'm gonna be honest despite the seemingly tepid plot there's a lot of interesting stuff. To my knowledge there's none of that dumbledore slapping around, and the conflict is more of a shadow one between the warlord/general father and Voldemort. Plus the author really does a number with a unique pure blood family that's super foreign and with a very diverse culture.

All in all it's a decent !concealed!powerful harry story and is enjoyable despite its flaws. There's some unpleasant scenes with the Dursleys, and some just general disturbing imagery later on, but even for one as picky as myself in regards to fanfic; this is worth the read with a few sections you could skim. Try it I guess or don't
