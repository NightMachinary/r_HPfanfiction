** Pretty good point in general when it comes to writing. Info/lore dumps are boring, readers want to experience the events not be given a 10000 word summary of it.

Also I think this goes hand in hand, but be wise about what details you use, how many you use, and why you use them. It's so boring to get just info dumps for paragraphs and paragraphs about this is how Harry feels and this is how his plan works and his magic and his this and his that. It's really dull and boring. Some of the details might be exciting to write, but it will really bog down the story. I remember reading a XO Mass Effect fic where the author spent 20000 words rewriting the lore in a list basically. Killed the fic for me. This is so common with "political" fics, where the subtlety, wit, and intrigue is just ruined by over-detailing and explaining everything.

*** mass effect fandom is particularly bad at this, especially in any story about powering up humans.

Anytime an author wants to change something about humanity before first contact, you better be ready for the horde of "codex" pages which is basically a list an entire new timeline, ship/weapon specs, and often general humanity fuck yeah! power-wank. and OFC it will inventively open with the first contact war in which humans will stomp the Turians. Then skip to the first game.

It's utterly maddening if I am honest. Hell, the authors have a near perfect example of setting the scene from the opening of the first damn game. It doesn't explain all details about the races that inhabit the galaxy, Doesn't give a 20 page primer to the history of humanity, it certainly doesn't contain a whole bunch of ship and weapon specs. It trusts the player to be able to explore and find these details on their own, without forcing it down their throat.

Sorry for the rant, if you cant tell, the ME fandom has been irritating to read a lot as of late.

***** Well, it's not exactly a fic but do take a look at “Renegade Reinterpretations” (linkffn(7170477)), it's an interesting piece of work and I say that as someone who generally disliked the renegade options in the game (well, games; whatevs).

Then, take a look at this one-shot:

  A species without Paragons is one with a sad and terrible history. Humanity enters a very different First Contact War, and Mass Effect as you know it will change. Warning: this fic may make you rage and wish genocidal retributions against aliens.

Our solar system had no eezo, no Prothean technology; just a message warning us about the Reapers.

We were stuck here for far longer and galvanized by a galactic extermination threat - so we developed in a unique way.

** My favorite explanation of this concept is Chuck Palahniuk's [[https://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs][essay on "thought" verbs]].

To quote the essay:

'Instead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.”

You'll have to say: “Between classes, Gwen was always leaned on his locker when he'd go to open it. She'd roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her ass. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”'

**** There aren't really rules in writing, but there are /guideposts./ If you hear a rule that says "don't tell readers how the characters feel, show the reactions that display the emotion," that's the collected wisdom of many writers says "when you don't do this, it almost always turns out badly."

Like if you see a sign by a pond that says "danger: crocodiles", no one's going to come in a drag you out of the pond should you decide to go in anyways. And maybe you'll come out the other side wet but otherwise no worse for wear. But the odds aren't in your favor.

Which is why every "rule" seems to have an exception - Douglas Adams tells damn near everything in /The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/, but he can do so in such an entertaining way that nobody chides him for it.

Having said that: there are things you should just tell the reader - background details, what a secondary character did over their summer holidays, other not-in-focus details. But if you're a new writer, there's like a 90% chance that you're telling a lot of things you should be showing, and almost no chance that you're showing things you should be telling.

** Agreed, large text dumps tie with terrible grammar and "abilities that the main character has but will never use" for the quickest ways to get me to stop reading a story.

A real shame, there have been some really good ideas that were just bogged down with page upon page of explaining. I even remember reading a few where dialogue is near non-existent and the entire work is just explaining what happened.

** I personally that there needs to be a balance of showing and telling.

It is always weird when a character monologues for like two pages, with no description what is/was happening around them. It makes me think on anime were the other characters are just standing still and not moving/blinking.

For example, if someone is giving an impassioned speech, they would be doing some sort of movement, even it is hand/arm motions. That can be described easily to break out the speaking.
