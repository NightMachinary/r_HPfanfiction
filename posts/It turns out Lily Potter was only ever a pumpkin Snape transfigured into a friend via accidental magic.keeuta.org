** Snape really just wanted to keep Lily away from James because he knew that with all the pranks being thrown around, it was only a matter of time before someone tried to cast /Finite/ on her, which would lead to lots of awkward questions.

Now he keeps pushing for Harry's expulsion for the same reason. The world really doesn't need human/plant hybrids running around, so it's best for Lily's descendants to stay in the muggle world until the plant genes are diluted away.

*** "Avada Kedabra!" Yelled Voldemort.

"Vine whip!" Harry answered as some tentacle vines came out of his armpits and butt, taking Voldemort's wand away just in time.

"Eww!" Shouted Lavender.
