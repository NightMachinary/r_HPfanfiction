** Could you tell us a little more about the stories? Who is going to be the main character, is it going to be a romance, a darker story, one with Voldemort or without, one following canon closely or not...

And maybe some examples of fanfics by other authors that you enjoyed? So that we know what kind of writing you like... or maybe aspire to?

*** Sure thing.

Because I want to make a plot that's got an element of mystery and plot twists I don't want to say too much, however I can say plenty of things.

In all honestly I got bored one day and decided to try to come up with some original plot ideas for the HP universe. This escalated with each successive idea until I felt like making a total plot rewrite with what I had so far. I've just become quite enamoured with this concept so I came here looking for help to develop it. Also writing can be a fun past time so might as well write it up seeing as I like it so much.

Main character is Harry, it's basically a canon rewrite (not looking to make 7 200k word stories, if I do I'll be fine with that but also impressed with myself, but I do want to develop a plot that spans most of his Hogwarts life).

I want to pass over as few of the stations of canon as I can, and I have a skeleton of the 7 year plot (length pending, it could be shortened to year 5-7, I just don't know because I don't have the full details yet designed) with very little reliance on the canon. The only things I want to directly transfer from canon are characters (many will have their backstories changed a little), and the rules of the universe with a few of my own additions. There will be no Voldemort (Tom Riddle probably, but he isn't a dark lord), no Philosopher's Stone, no Chamber of Secrets, no Sirius break out from Azkaban, no Triwizard tournament (probably, not sure yet), no Half Blood Prince, no Deathly Hallows, no Horcruxes, etc.

I might have something similar to the Chamber of Secrets in that there's a chambre in the castle that poses a threat to the populace. And I might have an object like a horcrux that needs to be destroyed to defeat the main villain, but beyond that sort of adaption I don't want to copy canon at all.

As for things I liked, honestly the original books are probably your best bet on what I'm trying to aim for in terms of narrative structure. Another good set would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series (first story linked)]].

**** Thanks! I haven't read the Albus Potter series, but your idea sounds quite interesting from what you said. But also like a big time commitment. Personally, I'd go the way JKR did and keep the earlier years far shorter than the later years. I don't have as much time at the moment as being a beta for a story like this would require, but I'd be open to discussing specific plot points if you ever feel like you want a second opinion. Just send me a PM. Best of luck with the story!

** I didn't really get a lot out of the explanation you already gave. It sounds super ambitious, but so far removed from canon (characters with different backstories, no voldemort, no horcrux,...) that I get the feeling like you'd be better off writing something entirely new. That doesn't mean that you have to write something in a new universe, but maybe you could go for something this fandom seriously lacks: universe expansion. What about going for a story in Ilvermorny, or Durmstrang with a new set of characters? That may not find as much audience at first, but its a sure way to be a unique exception among the 750.000+ stories already out there.

Anyway, that is one thing I felt like it needed to be said.

In general I'd be interested in helping with plot and narrative, but I'll reserve a final say after I can get an idea of what you've planned.

*** Thing is, I not only like the characters of the universe already and feel I have a decent grip on them, but I also am not the best at coming up with my own.

As for the different backstories stuff, that would be for 5 or so people at most, most of it caused by the AU I want to set up. Didn't phrase that well at first sorry. Characters will definitely still be themselves, just tweaked to fit better into the plot and serve the narrative.

Another problem is that almost the entirety of the plot I have come up with relies on the story being at Hogwarts, or at least in Britain. So expanding upon the universe might not work that well. I considered setting it several generations after the originals where their actions are just myth and legend now but preferred to just stick to AU rewrite.

**** Fair enough. It was just a feeling I got when I read your previous posts. In any case, I can't really say more about it if I don't know the actual plot. It's an AU, it doesn't do canon, but has the 7-years structure, it has a new (?) villain and it has the original characters with small changes in their design. So far, so vague.

** It doesn't sound as if you're asking for a beta -- that's what you want when you've finished. This seems as if you want more of a co-author.
