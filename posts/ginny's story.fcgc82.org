does anyone know where to find hp 2,3,4 and 5 (i have 6 and 7)

â€‹

for the 2nd book I'd rather it not be like "a very secret diary" like a 3rd person of ginny not her diary entries

Thanks for any suggestions!

** Do you mean fics that cover the book events from Ginny's perspective? I don't have anything for books 3-5, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/882572][Secrets]] linkao3(882572) is CoS from her POV.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.
