:END:
The time travel fic i am talking about is in which harry travels back to marauders era and becomes a teacher and provides the slytherins a neutral option and whenever he makes a big difference a chime sound is heard only to him as if the fates( or other primordial concepts) were laughing or some shit like that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.
