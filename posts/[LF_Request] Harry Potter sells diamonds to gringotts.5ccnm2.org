This was a old fic I read before where harry could create somehow a variety of things but more specifically he sold multilayered diamonds to the goblins. Any help appreciated!


** Didn't this story also have some silly thing where Harry accidentally wrecks the wards in a huge chunk of the world just using one of those "layered diamonds" as a ward stone?

There was also something about him going into an alternate dimension where he gives the goblins there more of these to essentially have it so that they controlled the wards that now covered the entire planet.
