Are there any fics where the token "bad guys", like Malfoy or Bellatrix are actually spies for "the Light"? Like not Snape, who is essentially on his own side, as why would you play the two most powerful wizards that have graduated Hogwarts?


** Draco has some interesting character development in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) and particularly its sequels (but note that the series is very long, so if you're just reading for that, don't hold your breath). Basically, his parents are both manipulators, and their various meddlings, some aligned and some at cross purposes, produced some tangled results.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
