I wonder if the exact 204 people will come back? Though one of them seems to have gone missing. 23 comments too.


** This seems like a good time to congratulate the mods on changing the flair wording from "Fic Search" to "What's that fic?". I now see much fewer instances of people mistakenly using the "Request" flair when they should have used the other.

*** Yeah that is a good thing. But people still get confused by request and reccomendation. I did when I first came here.

*** Yeah, I feel like Request could be changed to Seeking Suggestions or something

**** For a while the mods made it "Seeking Recommendations", but then they changed it back, possibly because people said it was too long. Here's the thread about the change: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bhdit0/post_flair_update/][link]]

** Theyre kinda like the people who post ”Can someone help me please?” in a chat.

*** I get the urge to troll whenever I see a post with poor grammar and/or structure. A crappy plot idea just reinforces the idea. The now re-enforced rules means I probably shouldn't.
