I'm fairly sure Harry was an Alteran or a descendant of them, but there was a meeting with Earth that went badly for Earth because Richard Woolsey was a self important dick, akin to Umbridge and Fudge, rather than a good politician, trying to act like the Galaxy belonged to Earth, and he was vilified for it (rightfully) for potentially making another enemy, one that could wipe out Earth like it was fodder.

I'm also fairly sure Harry took all of the Alteran technology from Earth (except the Gate, but including Merlin's cache from Glastonbury and the Phase device, as well as the Control Chair/Defense Platform from Antarctica) after either Woolsey's screwup, or another screwup by Earth.
