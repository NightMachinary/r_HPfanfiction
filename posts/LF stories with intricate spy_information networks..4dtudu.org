After reading Seventh Horcrux, I absolutely fell in love with the role Ginny played as a type of information master. And I usually despise Ginny in canon and fanfics so color me surprised! Thank you to everyone that recommends Seventh Horcrux- well worth the read and I probably wouldn't have given it the time of day if it wasn't so loved around here. Anyways, enough gushing...

- This "network" can either be the main focus of the story or play a background role.

- The main character can be anyone.

- Any pairings are fine (including slash), except for harems.

**** The opening information about it being a crossover with this and a crossover with that and this put me off from reading it originally. It has some good ideas but be warned there's a lot of uselss techno babble that eventually turned me off of it.

** Aberforth and his shadier friends are used to gather information for Dumbledore in my story "Patron", to track down Voldemort's agents. The focus is more on the spying action though - scenes deal with agents infiltrating Knockturn Alley, going undercover, taking out Death Eater agents, and so on.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), contains extensive spy operations from all sides. Harry's spy network was essential in his rise to power, maintaining the control, and defeating hostile forces. [[/spoiler][His assassination of Draco Malfoy was an excellent move that created huge distrust between Dumbledore and the Minister Scrimgeour, and forestalled an imminent takeover of the British government by the Ministry of Magic. Ginny Weasley used her network to carry out extensive terrorist activities against Harry's country and plant the leads to the Death Eaters, as to incite a war between the two parties.]]

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
