So far I haven't read a lot of good romantic/slice of life fics. Probably because it's easier to write adventure than romantic stories but there still has to be a good romantic/slice of life fic right?

Anyway, what's your fav?


** Seconding /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/. It is fantastic. Also very good, linkffn(11111990)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** most things by little0bird. A lot of those fics are post-war slice-of-life. Almost canon compliant too if that's your thing

** linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/4703843/]])

"That Old House" is a wonderful slice of life fic that I've come back to again and again. Read it, it's wonderful.

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10116793/1/Anna-Summers-PA]])

"Anna Summers P.A." This nearly turned my brain to cotton, its so fluffy and it's got a pretty excellent romance arc as well.

  If Anna met this woman in a bar, she would have swept those pretty bangs out of her eyes, dragged her out on the dance floor and seen whether she could convince her to spend the rest of the night with those long legs wrapped around her. But this wasn't a bar. This was an office. That was her boss. Elsanna Business!AU Lots of Fluff, and Smut in later chapters.

** It's the only next-gen fic I've read and liked(its not something I broach very often)

** Probably the Dramione It's All Uncharted. It's well written and really cutesy almost too much. But it was a fun read. There was another AlbusxOC with a main character named June really good. linkffn(It's All Uncharted by redhead414)

*** Your second one is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]], which is the one I'd nominate, too. :)

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290281][Napoleon's Complex]] is a personal fav of mine; it's a more offbeat romcom though.

**** Oh yeah! It was so sweet definitely one of the best. The build uo to the relationship was so well done. It's a shame that the sequel wasn't as good. Nonetheless a very good fic.
