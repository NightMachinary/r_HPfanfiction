Second Chances by Mara Rome is the absolute best Snape mentor fic I've ever read. I used to read it when she gave fairly regularish updates but she hasn't updated since 2012ðŸ˜­ I know she had family issues and I should just come to terms with it being abandoned but it was.so.damn.good. Anyone heard anything from her if she'll ever update?


** I've been waiting so long for an update. I was in middle school when I started reading that fic and am now 25 and have graduated college with my BA. . . Sometimes I lose hope. But other times. Like last night, I go dig it up and re-read it and have some slight spark ignited.

*** Same! It was one of the first Severitus fics I read and I was probably around 15. It was also about when it updated last :( one of the few fics I go back to reread quite a bit

**** It's pretty devastating tbh.....it was a beautiful piece of work.I actually have it opened in my browser rn because I am procrastinating on a summer class I am taking rn. I m planning on re-reading it this week as an incentive for my hard work. I sometimes do wonder if reaching out to her and emailing her would garner any response again.

***** It never hurts to try! I've done it a few times through the years but have never gotten a response sadly.
