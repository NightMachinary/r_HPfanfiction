** Maybe try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606][souls touch, and the future changes]] and it's sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307][right under their noses]]. Harry's not a complete sociopath, but he's definitely got some sociopathic tendencies. It's really well done so far

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming by BolshevikMuppet99) like a 6/7 year series, Harry gets progressively wild. Haven't fully read it, but he goes very dark/sicopathic-ish in this series.
