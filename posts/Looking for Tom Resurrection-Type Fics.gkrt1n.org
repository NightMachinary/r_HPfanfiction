:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for two separate stories I think, but here's the first one:

Salazar Slytherin is alive and is slowly collecting the destroyed pieces of Voldemort's soul, and when voldemort dies at the BoH (battle of hogwarts), Salazar brings him back.

The second one is more vague, and also a request for any similar fics.

I think it was a Tomione, but the diary bit of Riddle is taken out and put into the current time and he helps defeat and outsmart him. Any other fics like this?

I didn't read very far into either of them because I was just checking to see if the writing was good, and then I went on to open more fanfiction tabs, and now I can't find it.

Thank you!


** If you don't mind Ginny as a main character (not paired romantically with Tom though but they're very close), [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/Things-in-Common][Things in Common]] has Diary Tom essentially coming out of the diary and teaming with Ginny to take down Voldemort.

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU. COMPLETE.

  At the end of Harry Potter's second year, something extraordinary happens: when Tom Riddle comes out from the Diary, he merges with the Horcrux that is inside of Harry.A few years later, this event will bring strong repercussions. Tom Riddle's soul will finally take control of Harry's body at the end of his fourth year. This means, Tom will pretend to be Harry Potter in front of the people that know him best. But Tom's plans won't go as he expected. The soul is a tricky thing.

** For what it's worth, it's not "Tomione" but there is a fanfic where Luna Lovegood gets her hands on the diary.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)
