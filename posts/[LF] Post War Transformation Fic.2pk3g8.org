I am looking for this one story that I found a long time ago and the idea of it just came to mind today, I want to say that is was just a oneshot or it was just a one chapter story that was never finished.

I remember this story took place after the war and the castle was so badly ruined by the Battle of Hogwarts that they abandon Hogwarts afterward. But Harry was bitten by Greyback and so were a few others and they chose to stay behind and live in the abandon castle. Another part I remember is that Hermione wasn't bitten to begin with but stayed behind to be with Harry and that she was bitten by Harry. I also want to say for some reason that he didn't transform into a Werewolf but something more.

I just can't remember. If any of you know of the Fanfiction, I would appreciate it.
