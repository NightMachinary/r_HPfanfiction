Reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l0y3d9/i_just_realized_how_the_hell_does_everyone_know/]] made me think.

When Voldemort becomes something lesser than a ghost in the potters house, shouldn't his wand been found there.


** Though I don't think canon ever fully states i believe Pettigrew was there and he took the wand and then escaped as as rat. How else would Pettigrew have Voldemort's wand at his resurrection?

*** Wormtail was the secret keeper, so he should have been physically present there.

**** As secret keeper he only has to tell someone the secret he doesn't have to "escort" the person there so there's no reason he had to physically be there (from the secret keeper perspective).

Edit: Dumbledore was the secret keeper for Grimmauld and if I remember correctly he didn't bring Harry there the first time Harry went there.

Now I do believe he was there otherwise he wouldn't have been able to give Voldemort his wand back at the Graveyard. Pettigrew had to get Voldemort's wand somehow and the simplest answer is that after the explosion from the killing curse rebounding Pettigrew entered the house saw Voldemort's robes, found his wand and then left.

If that isn't the answer you then have to discuss why Voldemort's wand wasn't snapped/destroyed, why it wasn't securely stored in the DoM so no one could access it, etc. And then how did Wormtail find out where it was stored and how he retrieved it.

** I believe there was an official statement about Peter finding it wherever it fell to. I did write a fic on the subject before that.

  A loose end J.K.R. never seemed to tie. Set after PoA, or shortly before the end. Insignificant spoilers for book five, but nothing more than that.
