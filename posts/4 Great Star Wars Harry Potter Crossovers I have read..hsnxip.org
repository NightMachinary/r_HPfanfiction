*The Potter Of the Ages*: Great story. I really like how even though Harry attacked some of the new Jedi masters, he was still welcome. I also kinda like the idea of each Jedi knight training Harry Potter some hand to hand combat and how Harry uses that with the combination to his wand. I also like the relationship between Harry, The Skywalkers, and the Solos. It feels like the Skywalkers and the Solos are like the Weasleys. They really cared about Harry and don't want anything happening to him. I also like how Sirius is alive and how the veil was a portal. I also enjoyed how Luna Lovegood and Hedwig is trying to find Harry and how the author slowly unveil who is looking for him. If you like a story with Harry still being amazed and a quick read, this is for you. Oh, I forgot to add that I enjoyed how Luke got personal with Harry and told him what happened. 5 wands/ 5 lightsabers is what will rate it.

​

*Stars Crossed:* Another Great one. This one takes place during Episode 4. One thing that I actually admire is how a certain scene is played out. (More on that later) The story is really good and I enjoy how the trio got separated. Hermione with Luke, Harry with Han Solo and Chewie, and Ron on the Death Star. I really enjoyed how the character relationship between Han and Harry, *SPOILER ALERT:* In the part where Han, Harry, and Chewie escaped, Han told Harry that if he returns, they will all be killed. He will come back for them. I also enjoyed how Ben, Maz, and even Vader feel that the trio is an anomaly. I also enjoy that Ron is hiding in plain sight. Wth the Hermione and Luke storyline, it is very enjoyable and is somewhat wholesome. The scene that I mention before that they changed is Uncle Owen's and Aunt Beru's death. In this scene it was shown that instead of the Stormtroopers, it was Boba Fett that killed Luke's aunt and Uncle. I also like how you feel sad about what happen to Hermione and how you feel how lonely she is. This is one of the better ones. I will give it 5 wands out of 5 lightsabers.

​

*Crooked Stars:* I enjoy this story. It probably will be the weakest out of the four though. The story is interesting. Hermione being kidnap by slave traders and escaping through the use of magic and her newfound friends. But one thing that kinda threw me off was the divorce storyline. It didn't land right for me. The action is good and the ending is somewhat surprising, having it to be a Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off. I will give it 4.5 wands out of 5 lightsabers.

​

*When Harry Met Yoda*: This I read recently and I was really enjoying it. Great storyline and great character choices. Some people, both fans of Star Wars and Harry Potter, might not enjoy this for multiple reasons. But too be honest this like the previous three stories feels somewhat normal to what the story entails. I like how they tie in the force as ancient magic. I also like the redemption arc of Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi. I like how the author shows how each character of the trio, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, view the force and how they overcome their personal hardships to feel the force. One thing that I will say is a double edge sword is how long each chapter is. The chapters are pretty long and some parts are pretty good, while other parts it just repetitive. The author uses sometimes, but it was only during Harry's first lightsaber fight with Eleanor. Also, another thing I think they should take away is Eleanor and her master story arc. The story arc is stupid and it shows how the master is trying to be Palpatine. And speaking of him, there was one scene with him and Darth Vader. I feel like the author should continue with their storyline and have Darth Vader come to Earth. It seems possible and I feel more danger towards the golden trio. Eleanor and her master to me don't seem like true sith lords and they are always arrogant and cocky. Especially during the forest fight scene, she thought she can overpower Obi-Wan. So what will give this storyline, writing-wise, it will be 4.5. The author needs to improve on the actions scenes a bit. Again long chapters can be both a good thing and a bad thing, but it depends on the pacing. But for a crossover,5 wands out of 4.5 lightsabers. Damn that Eleanor and her master ark. It was just kinda stupid.

​

*Side note:* So I just wanted to add a side note that I find pretty funny and somewhat annoying. In Potter in Time and When Harry met Yoda, Luna Lovegood can feel the force. I find it funny, because of her character nature and how she believes in anything that no one else believes in. But I kinda find it annoying because at least in a Potter in time, the author did a great job hiding her identity. But once it is revealed and you read another fanfic that does the same thing with Luna, it just doesn't have the same surprise. It feels repetitive. With that being said, I didn't add it to the reviews because it just doesn't feel right to attack an author for trying to use Luna as a force user. It feels kinda bias in my opinion. But hey is that what reviews are.


** May I recommend Of Clones and Wizards? linkao3(61209361)

(Hope that works, never used the bot before.)

Harry from first year gets yeeted into the the Clone Wars. It's super new but the character dynamics are great, Harry isn't OP, it updates daily, and we all get to make fun of the Jedi for being basically shit. (Seriously, this one updates scarily fast. No beta reader, either, and the writing is still solid.)

Legal assistance Better commenting system Better tags (ffn kinda fails at this pretty hard) Better writing (the grammatical consistency is just /chefs kiss/, the stories are actually readable) You can download copies of content(how I stay sane on trips outside of data range)

It just takes a little patience to set up your account. Essentially it's real popular and run by pretty basic servers despite it's general good quality, so there's a waiting list. You just need to submit your email address to it and wait. Mine was pre-Covid traffic but it only took like a week lmao.

******** Here's the best part about ao3. You go to the fandom tag, so in our case HP, and open the filter box. You check IJ or SW in the filter. You sort by most kudos, the equivalent of upvotes. The fics you're looking for are listed in descending reception. You can also filter complete works, updating works, content warning tags, misc tags, ship tags, character tags- you name it. This also works for excluding tags. Bam, the fics you find are basically as close to your taste as currently exist.

************* I also want to ask, what is the fanfic you are writing about. Mine was originally a Harry potter came into our universe and people knew about him. But then I expanded it more to a Indiana jones style where it is a race to find the fountain of youth. Also, since magic doesn't exist in our world, characters from the Harry Potter series get the magic drain out of them. I am on either part 5 or pt. 6 and I been wondering how should I write it out. The idea for this chapter was that Donny, the main protagonist, stops by his father to receive some help in the location of the fountain of youth and donny will train the family in hand to hand combat and firing a gun.
