I am reading the first book with my second son at the moment, and I just noticed again how Petunia mentions how her parents fawned over Lily being a witch and how proud they were of her. As far as I remember it is never mentioned why they aren't there anymore, and neither are James's parents. Are there any well-written fics that explore how everything could have been with one pair of grandparents still there? Or maybe even one grandma or so, I mean anything would have been better than just the Dursleys. Please only complete and well-written stuff. Thanks!


** It's complete, and well written. It's also a short one-shot crack fic...

  Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.

  Thanks to the desperate actions of his wife, Fleamont Potter survived his dragonpox. Now he finds himself awake again in a world where all the members of his family are supposedly dead---except that the Potter family tree tells him that his grandson lives yet. Fleamont sets out on a search for his grandson, and then a quest to keep him safe once he's found him.

**** I personally liked the way his survival was done. I think it could have been done simpler, for example, with him just using the Draught of Living Death until a cure is found, and that that would have been better and that a different personality and more reasonable treatment of the situation, i.e. with greater openness and no killing or threats, would have been quite interesting.
