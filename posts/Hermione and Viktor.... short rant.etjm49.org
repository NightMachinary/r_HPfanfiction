In most fanfics focusing on these two, the have them meet at the World Cup briefly and basically have Krum fall for Hermione on sight (did they even meet at the World Cup in canon?). These fics then tend to make Hermione to be a lovestruck fool or unknowingly seduce men and teenagers at Hogwarts.

I get that these authors are trying for romance but purposely re-characterizing Hermione to just snogging Viktor or walking around the school at night in a tank top and shorts of all things....

There is some good fanfics with Hermione and Viktor, but most tend to change her so dramatically and bash Ron so bad that it just takes you out of the story. How are you going to have Ron berate Hermione for studying and reading all the time when all the story has her do is think about Viktor and "bump" into him all the time to spend hours away from studying...

Does it bug anyone else how some authors change characters so much for the sake of the genre they want the story to embody?

Hermione and Viktor are one of my favorite ships that weren't given a chance in canon, and I wish that it was used in stories more often, even in the background.


** Not my favorite pairing, but it's often a side ship in what I read. I've always liked the idea that Viktor saw her reading in the library all the time and got curious, quickly developing a crush. And while I also usually imagine her enjoying the little physical action they get, I've always found the line that he sits and watches her study amusing. Relationship goals, I guess?

And that's pretty much how I've written them too.

*** The lesser shipped ships are often side plots like that. Viktor admiring Hermione's knowledge and dedication for studying was so refreshing to just having her constantly "help" with homework and whatnot. I always felt like he appreciated her as a person from the beginning, not caring for titles or anything.

** unless you count him flying past the stands during the game as "meeting" eachother, then no they did not meet in canon until the other schools came to hogwarts for the tournament

*** Yeah in the fanfics they make it seem like he spotted her during the match and he thought about her through the game till he decided to get the game finished. Or that they also met after the match cause the Weasley's somehow got into the Minister's box and they have a short conversation. Or the mega twist for them to meet is during the whole attack at the end of the World Cup and either Hermione saves Viktor somehow or Viktor saves her somehow.

***** The attack thing as meeting has been done to death though, and I think Fleur holds the patent for that method of meeting the MC.

**** I mean they WERE in the top box with the minister in canon, they just didn't interact. After the game, both teams met in the top box (where Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, the Malfoys, the Ministers, Winky, and Barty Crouch Jr. all were) for the presentation of the trophy.

*** They were both in the Top Box during the QWC for the presentation of the trophy to the Irish, but they didn't interact at all. So he might have done a double take when he first noticed her in the library, but that would've been the extent of it.

I notice that more with Slytherin-centric fic than romances, but yes, it can be annoying.

#+end_quote

Being in a relationship changes people. Both their priorities and, more slowly, their overall character. I can totally see Hermione borrow Harry's cloak to sneak out to her boyfriend, where (some) clothing may become optional anyway. And Hermione is pretty quick to disregard rules which get into her way. But if she's just dressing "up" in the hope of a random encounter, well, that's beyond stupid.

** This love at first sight always bothered me. My head canon is that the other champions, of course, took Harry serious (defeated Voldemort as a baby, killed a basilisk at 12...), so Viktor looked into him and his access and allies and that is how he noticed Hermione in the first place

** Eh, I feel like Victor would have been better for Hermione. If she had flat out rejected Ron fourth year he could have become a better person in the long run. Maybe a fic where a jealous, hurt and rejected Ron becomes less jealous over the course of fifth and sixth year, improving himself on his own merits. Maybe he dates Lavender properly and gets over Hermione for good. Instead, both of them danced around each other until Ron dated Lavender (out of spite) and Hermione went 'When Birds Attack' (out of jealousy) on him.
