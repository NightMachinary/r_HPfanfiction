Harry Potter isn't a fandom that I've written in, just one where I obsessively read All The Fic - but this plot bunny has made a nest in my brain and I guess it's not going anywhere until I write it. So!

Arabella Figg is a squib, it's true, but that doesn't mean that she has no magic at all. Just that she has almost none, and what little she does have, she can't use. She has enough, though, to feel that there's something wrong with little Harry Potter. He makes her skin crawl, she wants to hide him away and not look at him - but he's just a sweet little boy. Something is not quite right.

She doesn't contact Albus Dumbledore. He dismissed her concerns in 1933 when she told him that she could see the hand of Gellert Grindelwald behind a certain German political party, she doesn't expect that he'll listen to her now. After all, if he ignored her when she was entrenched in the Muggle intelligence service as an employee at the now-famed Bletchley Park, he is unlikely to respect her as a retired breeder of half-kneazle cats. Instead, she calls her brother, one Alastor Moody.

Moody realises that there is a piece of very dark magic stuck to Harry, that is causing people to react badly to him. His own magic is encapsulating it to protect him, but not fast enough. At this rate, it could take ten years. After some research, Dumbledore and Moody figure out how to greatly accelerate the process.

That's the bunny that bit me - it goes on with Mrs Figg teaching Harry advanced mathematics and code-breaking, the two of them spending Harry's summers revolutionising (well, on a small scale, nothing too Gary Stu-ish) arithmancy, and Moody teaching Harry and Dudley martial arts. Moody also disagrees with Dumbledore when it comes to keeping Harry ignorant of the magical world, although he does agree that he shouldn't grow up being worshipped for something he doesn't remember, so Harry is disguised for any time he spends in the magical world. With the Horcrux neutralised earlier rather than later, the Dursley are not as vile (they're still hardly paragons of humanity, but they don't keep Harry in a cupboard).

I'd love to hear any thoughts and suggestions before I set +pen to paper+ fingers to keyboard. Is there anything you think would be cool? Any tropes I should stay far, far away from? Anything in the plot so far that sucks nargles?


** Well, you ask for tropes you should stay away from, yet you have Harry (and Dudley - why?) being taught martial arts. Lets also to mention that their teacher is to be Moody, a person who has a wooden leg.

So, I have seen Arabella fic play various roles in different fics through the years, from being an ex-Auror, to being a mentor to Harry, to being Moody's sister. So nothing really new on that front.

Moody going out on a limb involving Harry isn't anything new either.

So, finally, you say you want Figg to be teaching Harry advanced math, code-breaking, and getting to the point where he revolutionizes arithmancy. If that's not a giant red-flag, I don't know what is. And, from what I gather, this is to all happen before Harry even gets to Hogwarts. I'm not sure if I can think of something less appealing than reading about pre-Hogwarts training mongtages.

And then you have nicer!Dursleys. Sure, this could mean they they're less cartoonish, but that can be done without bringing special attention to them at all.

Honestly, there's not a single part about this idea that appeals to me at all. Sure, I realize that not every story has every target written in mind, but looking at this, it would read more like something that was taken out of the indy!Harry scene in 2007, rather than something being written in 2017.

*** This is actually exactly the sort of feedback I wanted, so thank you. The points you make - martial arts, or rather dirty fighting because Moody strikes me more as that sort, is because if you lose your wand and you can't cast wandlessly , you're screwed. Any advantage should be expanded on. Teaching Dudley as well, because as a close relative of a Wizard, he is presumably exempt from the Statute of Secrecy, and a potentially useful asset.

Mrs Figg teaching Harry maths wasn't supposed to be like that. Certainly nor pre-Hogwarts, but I was planning on him starting there with a more advanced knowledge than the typical muggle-raised eleven year old. He would then take arithmancy as a thirty-year elective, and suspect that if it can be used with muggle-raised mathematics, it might be capable of more precise predictions. He takes the idea to Mrs Figg when he is home for the summer.

Not so much nice!Dursleys as less-vile! Dursleys, and I've always been rather taken by the observation that Ron is driven half-mast wearing Slytherin'so locket for a few days, but not by sharing a dorm with Harry for a few years. It wasn't supposed to be a major plot point, just something I fancied including.

Thanks! (edited for ludicrous phone autocorrect)

#+end_quote

The thing is: Against an armed wizard you /are/ screwed (in canon), even if you can fight somewhat.

(FB Spoilers ahead, but it's been 6+ months so no tag)

One example: We know as a fact that Grindelwald is an extrodinary wizard, who couldn't be taken down for years until Dumbledore stepped in. [[https://youtu.be/4HERsolqyZc?t=32][He fought 30 aurors singlehandedly without problems]], until he got taken down and lost his wand. He doesn't try anything then.

I mean what use are material arts when you can cast a stupefy in less than a second?

Any competent wizard will do the same as anyone with a gun: Not let you come close. That is how police operates all around the world. (I think the only one that Harry takes out with his fists in canon is Draco, and he is 17 or 18)

There is so much more Moody could teach that would be more helpful: How can you gain a wand in a hostage situation? When are people most unaware? When in custody, what is the most unexpected thing you can do? What are good ways to hide? To lay false tracks? How do you detect Polyjuice and the Imperious?

All of these seem more like stuff my headcanon!Moody would teach, and are way more likely than fighting.

I just need to give the other side counter-balancing toys, if Harry gets new shinies. Although, with the arithmancy thing at least, the idea is more to give the subject greater depth rather than greater power.

** So... What's your story? As in plot? Correct me if I'm wrong, but what see here isn't plot, it's background info to launch a different Harry. Unless this /is/ your plot. Because this could be dealt with in a single chapter, teased bit by bit in the story, or it could be a full-fledged story.

If you're looking to write a pre-Hogwarts Harry, then I can tell you I probably wouldn't read it. I'm not interested in a toddler protagonist or Arabella Figg & Moody as main characters.

In case this is just your planned backstory, where would you go from there? This could set the stage for a Ravenclaw!Harry who is already familiar with the Wizarding World, and you can go literally anywhere from there. Keep playing on the code breaking theme. Have the Unspeakables recruit him while still in Hogwarts to unravel curses with arithmancy, or Harry could become a curse breaker for Gringotts.

*** Yeah, definitely closer to back story than actual plot, there will be a bit of pre-Hogwarts but mostly in recollection, not even flashback. But posting it has got me some really useful constructive criticism, so hopefully I'll have a strong base to launch into the actual plotting! I had been thinking king that going Unspeakable would make a lot of sense but possibly in some kind of summer intern program because being a full-fledged Unspeakable while he's still at school is distinctly Sue-ish.

I can roll with everything up till here. I've wanted to read a good Moody raises Harry fic and am yet to find one I adore. My problem and what I implore you to think about is what place does maths have in magic? I'll get to my dislike of martial arts later. Arithmancy is magical statistics used to predict the future in canon, I am fine with that and I am fine with you deciding that is boring and changing it. My issue is that maths is a language of logic and fundamental truths. We use it define and perhaps more importantly limit what is possible. What place does logic have with magic, magic is meant to be magical. If you dissect and break down magic into numbers then you're leaving fantasy and heading towards sci-fi. I like a good bit of sci-fi but I love the quirky, broken and nonsensical Harry Potter world more, I want the world where something crazy happens and people can just shrug and blame magic. Magic doesn't need to be fair or balanced the whole point of magic is that it is beyond that. I don't see a way maths can be applied to magic in a way where it doesn't either neuter it or become completely ridiculous as if nobody has ever tried something like this before. Maths is truth and the truth can be ugly, when I read I escape reality and its limits. I don't want newly imposed limits on that and the truth can suck the joy out of things. I know that my engineering degree made the world more boring to me. You also have the potential issue that will turn off more readers here than anything else. Harry's magical index number is over 9000 measured in your new system, this experienced opponent who by all rights should have Harry out matched only has a magical number of 2000 because he's an inbred pureblood and so Harry wipes the floor with him because the number is higher.

Martial arts, fitness probably does help, a bit of self control certainly will help Harry in his life. Harry will not be physically fighting his way out of a Death Eater lair with my belief successfully suspended. If you are close enough to hit someone then they can curse you a hundred different ways without you having time to stop them. If you try and get close they apparate or they banish you away, they transfigure the ground to trap you in place. There are so many ways in the magical world to not get punched in the face its hard to believe. If you're going for the whole lost my wand thing then put a wrist strap on it. You ever owned an expensive camera, they have a loop that goes around your wrist so if you let go of it then it will just hang. Harry's mokeskin pouch suggests we already have things that only open for their owner so Harry could have one of these put as a strap on his wand and no more worries. Moody also lacks and eye and a leg, he's a great example to show you don't need to be mobile and physical to be great at fighting dark wizards.

I would recommend and love to see a Harry raised by Moody. The man is paranoid and successful. Gruff but with his heart in the right place. The man has more experience hunting dark wizards than anyone else so he's a great resource. Would Harry be as paranoid or would he mock Moody slightly, would he be a great duellist or a thorough planner? You might be able to work code breaking into magic but I think it would be easier and preferable to focus on the Moody side. Would he go to Hogwarts at eleven or would Moody see that as a security risk and therefore Harry doesn't arrive till Moody agrees to teach in fourth year. That way you also don't have to worry about writing eleven year olds accurately which is something a lot of people struggle with. You'd have the two part conflict of Voldemort on the outside while Harry struggles to adapt to normal life on the inside. Maybe Voldemort has already been dealt with by Harry and Moody and only now Harry is trying to find a way back into normal life after being raised so differently.

Good luck and have fun. Its far easier for me to criticise than for you to write so don't let this get you down.

*** Thanks! All criticism gratefully received.

I wasn't planning on changing what can be done with arithmancy, although canon is pretty vague so I guess it could be spiced up a bit. I was thinking that incorporating muggle mathematics could refine it somewhat. It certainly wouldn't increase Harry's magical power in any way, but it would let him go into a situation a little better prepared - assuming of course that he had long enough to actually do the calculations. It would be used for one or two major plot moments, rather than a constant crutch.

Martial arts, yes, for the dropped wand cliché - but also for the moment when your enemy has you helpless on the ground gloating, and then in less time than he can incant a spell you've kicked him in the goolies, then while he's writhing in pain you've grabbed your wand, and cast incarcerous. Its the element of surprise.

I would love to write a raised by Moody fic - I fact this started as one and the Mrs Figg wanted to be a sassy old ex-intelligence officer.

Again, thanks for the comment!

****** Well, if you want my two Knuts:

Look at the different set-up, and then ask yourself: How would this make the plot develop differently?

The plot of the Philosopher's Stone would start very differently with a Harry who knows the wizarding world. For starters, there's no reason for Hagrid to take him to Diagon Alley; he'd already know the place, and more likely Figg and/or Moody would take him.

This means he's not with Hagrid when Hagrid gets the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts. He may hear about the break-in, but there's no reason he'll connect it to Hagrid. Likewise, he may not meet Draco Malfoy in Diagon Alley, and if he does the conversation would go differently anyway.

His first interactions with other character would be different too. With Mrs Figg and Moody there, he won't need to ask the Weasleys about Platform Nine-and-three-quarters, and he won't need Fred and George's help to get his trunk on the train. He might still end up on sharing a compartment with Ron, but he'd likely talk to him differently.

Being taught by Moody he won't take the bait when Malfoy steals Neville's Remembrall -- hence, no spectacular first flight, no youngest Seeker in a century. And even if that happens, he'd never fall for Malfoy's "duel" ploy, which means no midnight sneaking out, no discovering of Fluffy. In addition, he may not be as close to Hagrid, so no clues to the Philosopher's Stone there.

See? A lot of the plot just kind of vanishes if Harry knows what he's going to and up against. So the challenge is to replace these things with something interesting.

Figuring out how to remove it without killing Harry? Sure thing. If you stick to those, I think you're on firm ground, because it hasn't been done to death. Things start losing appeal for me when characters are overpowered. This would come with the martial arts (wtf?) training coming from Alastor Moody. That's a bit much. Harry spending ages with Arabella Figg, learning maths and the lot? Yeah, seems out of character. In the books, he is a fair to middling student. He gets through because he's got Hermione to keep them on track, but isn't an outstanding student when it comes to studying.

When it comes to /doing/ he's ace. Quidditch. DADA classes. Duelling. He does great at those, because he's an active boy. He's not the type to be satisfied with reading dusty old tomes. That's more Hermione's bag. Dursleys being less hateful? Sure. Dursleys not having him do a bunch of random chores? We're on shaky ground here. Maybe they wouldn't be quite as nasty as to Harry as to throw him in the cupboard under the stairs, lock up his owl, etc etc. But remember that Petunia is, at heart, still that pinched nasty withered old bitch she always was. She's still bitter at the magical world. She still blames the magical world for the death of her big sister. She's got some deep seated issues to work out. So maybe Harry gets his own bedroom, but he'll still be responsible for the gardening, the dishes, taking out the trash, and general cleaning, which Petunia ends up re-cleaning anyway because it's not up to her standards.

Try to cut the stuff about the martial arts, and the god moding of Harry, and you're on good solid ground for an interesting fic. Maybe Snape could be less of a twat too.

I see your point about martial arts, but I'm thinking perhaps I phrased it badly - I was going for dirty fighting, how to swing a decent right hook, when a quick jab to the kidneys might buy you a few seconds to cast a spell, or just to interrupt your opponents casting if you happen to be in range. And as for maths, if she started him young and made it a game, I could see Harry enjoying the puzzle. I do also agree that it seems a little OOC and I'd have to work pretty hard to make it seem natural.

  That's the bunny that bit me - it goes on with Mrs Figg teaching Harry advanced mathematics and code-breaking, the two of them spending Harry's summers revolutionising (well, on a small scale, nothing too Gary Stu-ish) arithmancy

Arithmancy is not math, nor is it heavily math based. If you have no idea about it then read something llike /Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought/, or Crowley's association of trigrams with numerology system from /Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang/. Or numerology relevant stuff from /Three Books of Occult Philosophy/ by Agrippa (he even got his own Chocolate Frog Card, he surely knew what he was writing about).

*** I always thought it was strongly implied that World War Two paralleled the Grindelwald war. Maybe it's just fanon but it seems possible that Gellert would've manipulated the Nazis and the war as a smokescreen, even if he thought himself "above" non-magicals.

**** Obviously there are intended parallels, JKR stated that in the interviews. But I don't think we should take parallels as a sign of direct connection.

If anything I would say that WW2 would be another thing setting Grindelwald in his belief that he is right - that muggles can't be left to their own devices, that "for the greater good" they have to be ruled by wizards.
