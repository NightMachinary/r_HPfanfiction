  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

Interestingly, because of historical reasons, they had a not so small feud with Delacours (“Of the Court” in English), which put more tensions in the Bill and Fleur relationship.

** /Prince of The Dark Kingdom/ depicts Hogwarts as only accepting the magical elite. It is referenced throughout the story. linkffn(3766574)

/Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome/ also discusses other wizarding schools within the U.K. Although, this story has more interaction with the schools and their students through dueling tournaments. linkffn(10210053)

Both stories are very good and I would recommend them to most readers.

Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** There was a charming, unfortunately abandoned, story called "Those not Worthy" by ?. Can't remember all the details but basically baby Harry goes unsupervised into his mother's lab, who's an Unspeakable, and causes thousands upon thousands of galleons in Ministry property damage, while getting injured himself. I think NL was the BWL.

Now poorer than the Weasleys the Potters live in the equivalent of Wizarding slums, some city named X or Y, can't remember. Harry, due to the accident has erratic magic. The majority of Wizarding Britain lived in that city, I believe. Eventually, they gather enough money to send their younger child to Hogwarts, while Harry stays behind. It was a unique premise and decently executed. Shame it was abandoned and apparently deleted. Maybe someone could find it...
