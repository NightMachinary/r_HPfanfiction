** Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them). Nice little AU in which a young HP discovers he's really an elf, not a young boy at all. After all, boys can't do real magic.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** - not Hufflepuff or Gryffindor
- ambitious or innovative
- not a pushover, can take care of himself
- no crazy/insane Harry but I love it when he's morally ambiguous and Dark Harry or Gray Harry is completely acceptable
- a harry that actually cares to learn about the world he lives in
- any rating is fine
- not a complete copy of canon
- a harry that questions everything or at the very least isn't a mindless robot who can't think for himself
- 50000 words PLUS
- witty/sarcastic/you never know what he might say

I know it's a sin to say here, but Harry Potter and the *Methods of Rationality* (HPMOR)?
