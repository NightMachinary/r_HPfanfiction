I prefer if he has to turn to crime to make ends meet. I read and enjoyed a fallen god, denarian renegade and with strengths of steel wings.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

** One story that I've read that has that premise is Harry Potter: Ultimate Wizard by Moyshas. It's about 42K words long and it's a WIP that looks abandoned (last update June 2017)

  A different set of circumstances during his early childhood turned Harry into something more. He would show Albus Dumbledore that he cannot be manipulated. He will show Voldemort that it is he who must be feared. He will show the wizarding world that he is not to be fucked with. And if he by any chance manages to woo a few witches, all the better.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.
