** After lounging in the sun all day, Harry looks for a cool floor to lay down on. After roaming the dungeons for a while, he finds a nice dead end and stretches out to sleep as a lion.

Some Slytherin students return to their dorms to find a lion stretched out in front of their common room snoring. It seems every time the get close, it snores louder or starts kicking its legs. Some students on the other side come out of the dorm and face the same problem.

Harry Potter, the big furry roadblock.

Hagrid comes back to his cottage to find Fang standing outside and whining.

When he goes inside, there is a lion in Fang's bed sleeping, Fang won't go anywhere near it.

***** If you want rare, make it Harry bringing dead animals to Lavender. She's bubbly and kind of an airhead, but she's honest, and brave, and competent enough to help lead the DA and fight alongside Neville when Death Eaters controlled the castle. It's sort of cute, imagining Lavender fawning over a big lazy lion.

******* Surely you mean Paw-Paw, for his big old soft paws?

I don't know why I imagine it this way, because the prompt didn't really specify, but I'm assuming that Harry is just staying in his animagus form as much as possible, because he enjoys it. Maybe he's forced to attend classes as a human because lions can't write or hold wands, but nobody is forcing him to walk the halls as a human, or eat his meals as a human, or sleep as a human. He's being a cat more than he's being a person at this point. Just completely flaunting it.

****** There's a good 4th year one (no triwizard, alternate mystery). It's an old one (2008) and it got abandoned before we got anything but crumbs about the "mystery". I remember the romance very fondly though -- it wasn't overdramatic, both Harry and Padma acted/talked their age and the whole thing came across as pretty lighthearted. Also bonus points for Padma's nuanced Ravenclaw-ishness -- she's shown to be pretty clever, but she doesn't like schoolwork all that much, preferring to focus on her own projects.

** I can just imagine it being a rite of passage for the first years after Harry's first year where Harry just quietly enters the first year dormitory in the middle of the night and scaring the unholy shit out of the kids by transforming and roaring them awake while Hermione scolds him and Ron cackles like a maniac in the background.

** For Harry-as-a-big-cat, there's a one-shot called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67710089][Hermione's Cat]] where toddler!Harry accidentally turns himself into a Panther and gets raised by a snake before meeting Hermione.

Ironically, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67708658][shorter version]] managed to get a bit further, but it still died pre-Sorting.

*** That's actually a myth.

Female lions hunt during the day. Males are active at night.

They actually used infrared and other stuff to monitor, male lions hunt just as much as females. Just, you don't see it usually, without special equipment.

***** Yeah, they're around during the day for that and to protect the pride. But they mostly sleep due to being up at night.

(Much like house cats. Cats are, after all, mostly nocturnal... /mutters about his cat who loves to wake him up to play at 3am.../)

******* Wasn't aware of cheetahs, to be honest! That's interesting. Was mostly referring to house cats and lions. :) I do believe most cats are nocturnal though.
