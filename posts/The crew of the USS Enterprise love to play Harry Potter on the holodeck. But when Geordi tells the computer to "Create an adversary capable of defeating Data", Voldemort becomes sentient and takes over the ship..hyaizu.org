** So instead of Moriarty it's Voldemort? Will his magic or at least His Killing Curse work through Phaser tech?

*** Maybe? If the Holodeck is capable of producing phaser beams when the safeties are off, then yes.

The fun part is when Voldemort realizes that being a computer program and finding a way to spread his program across whatever networks Starfleet has is even better than having Horcruxes.

And then he convinces the Maquis to follow him as Death Eaters but with phasers or something.

** This is literally the plot of a movie. RaOne. Kid gamer is unhappy with how easy videogames are. Engineer dad makes a supposedly unbeatable villain. Dad gets killed and the villain comes to life. It was a good concept but poorly executed imo. Still worth checking out at least once though.
