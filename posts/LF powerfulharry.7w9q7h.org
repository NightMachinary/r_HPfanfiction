I want a story with a powerful Harry but without being godlike or that kind of thing. A fic that he has to train to become powerful or that someone teaches him like Cadmean Victory, Deprived(Harry is powerful in this one but it's well written and interesting), Magicks of the Arcane, etc.

**** For what it's worth, the story is 440k words in and the "harem" has been solely about friendship and loyalty to Harry. In my opinion the romance genre is highly misleading, at least until the girls get old enough to actually be romantic interests for him. Which could still be a while off.
