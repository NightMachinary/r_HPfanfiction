As the title said, I'm looking for well written fics, preferably completed ones. As of lately I'm facing a difficulty finding interesting and well written works featuring this OTP. No drak!Harry please or tragedy, also I have a real soft spot for angst with a happy/satisfying ending. Thank you all on advance! (Formatting might be off cuz mobile, sorry)


** It's not complete yet (but it is one chapter from completion according to the author), but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents]] on the Run is a great little Drarry AU.

Main plot is that the Dursleys successfully prevented Harry from finding out about Hogwarts, so now he's 17 and finds out magic is real from some weird kids on the tube (read: Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Draco).

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/the-war-mages-trilogy/][That Old Black Magic]]. OK, it's the only story in a stated trilogy, but it doesn't end on a cliff-hanger or anything. Time-travel/do-over (but not all the way back to 1st year). Good humor in places. I love her Mad-eye. And, you no longer need an account to read (though you do to comment).
