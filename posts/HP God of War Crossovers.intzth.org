Anyone know of some good God of War crossovers? Whether it's Harry as Kratos or just joining Kratos doesn't matter.


** Fanfiction.net apparently has a few, which now I'm going to have to read, darn you!

** Kratos stands over the lifeless body of Lucius Malfoy. Harry Potter is shell shocked that his new friend and mentor murdered draco's dad. Professor McGonagal rounds a corner and purses her lips, “five points from Gryffindor!”

I honestly don't see how this could work.
