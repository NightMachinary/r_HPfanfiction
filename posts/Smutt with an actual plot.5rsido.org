I'm looking for a fix with smutt but that has an actual plot and doesn't just revolve around the sex. I prefer Draco/Hermione. I've read all of the popular ones like Silencio and Isolation


** Not the pairing you're looking for, but Incubus is pretty good if smut with plot is what you're after.

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!

** If you don't mind a bit of a nontraditional pairing, may I suggest linkao3(Safe Word is Devil's Snare by shayalonnie)? I usually read Dramione too, but I LOVED this one.

I can rec you more Dramione if you want but it's hard to tell what you have and haven't read, but if you want let me know and I'll write up a list.

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension.

**** I'll try this one out! But please do link Dramione! Hermione and Draco are my OTP. I really loved Isolation and was looking for something along those lines, or Head boy/head girl. I read the bracelet which was really good but a little bit too slow for me. You can link whatever you want!
