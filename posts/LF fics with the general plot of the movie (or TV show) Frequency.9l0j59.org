The general plot of the movie and of the TV show is that the child (male in the movie and female in the TV show) somehow is able to speak to their now dead father like 20 or 30 years in the past before his death via ham radio and is able to stop their father's death. Butterfly effect type ripples happened and they have to keep communicating to solve the new problems that crop up.

Thought it might be interesting to have an adult Harry able to talk to James (possibly by the magic mirrors?) and they manage to stop Voldemort from killing them but then that would create other ripples that they would have to work to solve as well.


** I've never read a fic with this idea, but your premise description makes me want to read it.

I need to check out the Frequency TV show too. I liked the movie.

*** It was only one season and it's on Netflix. They were also able to make a short epilogue to close things off and that's widely available.
