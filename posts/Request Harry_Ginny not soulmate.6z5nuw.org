Looking for a more fleshed out Harry/Ginny (Like it to be Multi-Chapter, completed if possible). If not completed then at least frequently updated.

I love Rowling and her work but her romance was definitely lacking in the series, I want a good multi-chapter dealing with Harry and Ginny being together, (With Ginny actually being a character, because even her book characterization was lacking), through thick and thin. But so many of them deal with Soumate/Arranged Marriage AU, and while those are nice, I don't want that, right now.

Any Harry/Ginny after the final battle would be amazing as well.

If any side pairings please no Draco/Hermione. Would rather it be Ron/Hermione.

Thanks for the Recs. (Any rating is fine as well).


** I have a completed 39 chapter Harry/Ginny story called California Dreamin'. It's part of an AU I started writing one-shots in between OOTP and HBP, but this was finished this year. There are sexytimes, so it's rated explicit on AO3. If you're interested in more, I have several of my old fics up along with some new ones.

** Over at the [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] subreddit, I created a thread where I recommend as many decent Harry/Ginny fics as I can find. You probably would find something there.

** I'm gonna shamelessly self-promote here, I completed my Harry/Ginny action flick this week. It takes place after hogwarts and Harry has to escort Ginny to a quidditch match, but then they get chased around by a group of mercenaries. The response has been incredibly positive. Maybe you'll like it. Linkffn(Driving Miss Weasley)

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.
