I would like slow progression so that it feels more realistic, no crack fics, and Ron & Ginny bashing. I'm fine with snarry, romarry, and drarry. Just not focusing on romance.


** The fuck is Romarry?

** Souls Touch, and the Future Changes.

You can find Book 1 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][here]]. The author then went and abandoned the story for a short time, and because they did that they couldn't carry the story on using the same account (damn AO3), so they carried on the story on another account. So you can find Book 2 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593][here]].

  The Multiverse is vast, full of innumerable wonders and horrors. Anything and everything is possible in its myriad realities. So it's just Harry's luck when he practically trips into it. Now watch him grow, along with the family he creates along the way, into something... Infinite, and Unbound.
