I can't remember the name of the fic or what it was about but I remember that Arthur Weasley was some kinda dangerous maniac and when Molly got a notice of money from a goblin and was surprised, Arthur attacked the goblin delivering the message. Also bones makes a call to Arthur to catch Wormtail and Arthur already has him and tortures him with an electric battery. Something like: 'they all think I'm mad but I've always wanted to know how spark plugs work... while Wormtail starts to struggle'
