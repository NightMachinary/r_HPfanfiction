#+TITLE: Dumbledore had been under the Imperius curse the whole duration of Harry's Hogwarts years. The person who put him under that spell had used Dumbledore to prepare Harry for the eventual showdown with Voldemort? Would you put Voldemort as the good guy but framed as a baddie in this potential fic?

** As long as most other things we know from canon stand I'd think Voldemort is still a baddie. The person controlling Dumbledore is /also/ a baddie, but in a way I think it is more interesting to have two bad guys on conflicting sides (one with an unknown agrnda which may go welk beyond "fight against Voldemort in ruthless wssys" and one we know the agenda of), than the alternative.
