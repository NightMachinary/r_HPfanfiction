:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been unsuccessfully trying to find a Severitus fanfiction that I read a long time ago. I don't remember details - Snape and Harry end up in the past (Marauders' time) and I believe they use fake names, pretending to be father and son.

The main thing I remember is that James Potter is not very nice to Harry and also, nobody actually sees the resemblance between him and James, which surprises Harry as he's always heard how similar he looked to his parents.

I don't remember much else so this might not be enough to go on, but I'd be super grateful if you could point me in the right direction if this rings a bell!


** Do you happen to also read fanfic in French? I know a fic that matches that description exactly...

  1975 n'est pas une bonne année pour le monde sorcier. Ni pour Severus. Replongé dans ce passé oppressant,confronté à son double trop curieux, à une guerre qui fait rage, protéger Harry Potter prend un tout nouveau sens. VOYAGE DANS LE TEMPS. NO SLASH

*** This was a fantastic story, but I'll never read the sequel because the author said it won't make any sense unless you also read the fic which doesn't have Harry in it because it's what happened while he time travelled. I am not a fan of Harry Potter fics without Harry Potter.

Also, I'm just going to say that Google Translate really sucks at pronouns. Sadly, my college French was too long ago to read the story in the original French.
