What the title says. I don't care if the time travel is accidental or how major the teaching is, just want some interaction. Preferably a powerful Harry.

Thanks :)

It has, sadly, been a while since I last read this one, but I think I remember Harry having an interaction with Dumbledore in this one, which leads to some form of minor teachings and in the end in Dumbledore giving Harry the elder wand.

But I wouldn't actually bet my money on that, there have been quite a few time travel stories were something like that happened, so I could just be mixing things up. It is still a really good Fanfiction tho.

Its Marauder Era btw.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Realignment is my favorite time travel fic and the only one I can think of with a powerful Harry being taught. Even the one moment is more Dumbledore acting like a teacher than actually teaching Harry.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

***** Oh, sure! It upsets me slightly that Harry doesn't get over his grudge/hatred against Tom Riddle after it is ever so obvious that he has changed and cannot become Voldemort. Also, whilst I can accept the ending as appropriate, I would have preferred if you could be certain that Harry lives... I fee that it is left to the reader to decide as Harry is MOD and all that, but I would have liked more detail on Harry and Lady Clara after the massive duel/battle. Just a chapter possibly to explain how Harry is nursed back to health and they try to retire peacefully(could work could not? Idm).

** Well, I can't think of any where Dumbledore teaches Harry but since no one else is responding I at least have a time travel fic with a powerful Harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est by Lord Silvere]]

*Summary:* Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

/Note:/ The summary is not particularly good, however the fic itself is much better. It has excellent and rather unique characters, well planned and thought out plot, is decently well paced, and is (imo) a fun read all around. It is set in the Marauders era and does a fantastic job of exploring a world where the war hasn't yet really happened.

Sorry no one has been able to find what it is you are looking for.

*** Thanks, I've read part of it before, but I'm not a fan of it... I don't like that Harry is so unconfident and ends up as a potions professor. The writing is good though and thanks for the recommendation
