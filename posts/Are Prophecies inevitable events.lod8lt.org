If Voldemort had ignored the prohecy of his downfall, could it have been stopped? Or would it have happened regardless?


** The answer to your post itself comes from Dumbledore:

  ‘If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?'

** No, at least based on what Dumbledore said in HBP. This Prophecy is IMHO a total con job, and only set in motion because that sadistic genocidal maniac chose to act on it. He could have won it right there if he had decided to ignore it.

It seems that the literary world is infatuated with prophecies these days. We are now in 21st century, and every sci-fi or fantasy flick has a prophecy. It doesn't matter whether it's in a Galaxy Far Far Away, in Middle Earth, in the cyberpunk Matrix simulation, or in some other lost realms of nowhere. Don't people get tired of it?

I really want to read fics that completely and totally shit on prophecies.

Two points; the first is that it was basically unavoidable for someone somewhere to rise and defeat him. Right now, or far in the future, whatever. The immortal witch-king always dies at the end.\\
The second point is: would Voldemort, as we know him, be able to ignore it? He has one fear : death. He seeks power primarily to avoid it; magic is his most evident path to power, the one that put him apart from others, that makes him special, and prophecies are a form of magic. He can't ignore it, he is Oedipus who caused the prophecy when he tries to avoid it (Oedipus, Son of Laius and Jocasta, is raised by - and thinks hiself the son of- Polybus and Merope....).

**** Yes, he “couldn't” avoid it because it's his flaw, but it is true that HP prophecies are only meant to come true if they're believed in.

It could have been interesting if Trelawny gave a prophecy to Hermione when she was leaving the Divination class but it has 0 effect because Hermione doesn't believe it.

***** The causality works both ways, though. Would there have /been/ a prophecy if Voldemort had /not/ been the kind of person to act on it?

The existence of the prophecy may cause the prophecy to become true, but whatever destiny or fate means, and whatever prophecies predict, it may well include the existence of the prophecy in the first place, and thus they become a part of the happenings. Prophecies aren't neutral observers, isolated from the world they appear in.

****** (The causality does not work both ways) Yes, there would have been a prophecy even if Voldemort didn't believe it because the Hall of Prophecies has some that never came true (it's not an exact or logical rule, it's actively the opposite of logic). Dumbledore didn't believe in the prophecy truly until the Potters were betrayed. He only had them protected because they would be a target by Voldemort. After Harry got “marked” he figured the prophecy would play out because Voldemort was so fixed on it, but he had no clue how it would happen. It's my theory that Dumbledore was so relaxed about Harry going into danger because he knew that either Voldemort would get defeated or Harry would be safe to do it another day. That said he did work to research how Voldemort survived, what he was doing, as well as just being a powerful protector.

Got a bit side tracked there, sorry.

*** Prophesies make really good framing devices, and set up the story's "promises". If you're after a comforting story, one that starts with a prophecy will probably also do the thing of keeping your favourites alive.

*** D&D did it with GOT, they called it "subverting your expectations". I'm guessing you must have really liked season 8.

**** That's a plus, but unfortunately, D&D blew it completely with their retard military tactics in the final season. Nerds and other armchair generals have already eviscerated this issue so I won't repeat them here

***** If your main issue with Season 8 was the military retardness, you're quite lucky I would say. Lucky to don't mind shitty storyline and meaningless characters arc (prophecies for example) etc...

****** Here is a thing: Despite often heaving criticisms at JKR here, I greatly admire her for finishing such a fantastic series. GRRM on the other hand, got bogged down and lost his story to those mediocre fanfic writers. What a disappointment!

** I think that because of Voldemort's personality, it was pretty much guaranteed that Voldemort would not ignore the prophecy.
