So I'm about halfway through Swimdraconian's fic and I find his take on Harry's characterisation to be uniquely engaging. I very much like the idea of a Ruthless!Harry for whom killing has no qualms. I like the idea of a Harry who has been highly trained from a "young" age to be a killer (consider like a Hitman sort of situation - Harry is taken at childhood & groomed to be a highly intelligent, highly skilled assassin of nightmares).

Plot points that turned me away is Harry's apparent insanity, and also his "need" to have friends. I want an independent Harry too.

In summary I guess: Dark!Harry / Ruthless! Harry / Independent!Harry

I hope I'm not asking too much! Looking forward to your suggestions

EDIT: I'm not a crazy fan of time-travel fics. Too much of it stinks in the "if Harry can do it why the hell can't Voldemort" category for me. Speaking of which, a realistic Voldemort is always welcome, though I do support the idea that some insanity is probably necessary as a result of him having made seven freaking horcruxes


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Hogwarts was a spy school. All kids there were trained to become 'analysts', assassins, infiltrators, saboteurs, and spies right from day one. Harry was in author's own words, "an extremely dangerous young man", and Hermione was also in her own way terrifying.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): It's a Star Wars crossover, in which Harry followed Sirius through the Veil and ended up in the SW universe. Emperor Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith. Harry returned after 4 years in the SW universe, but only 41 days in his home universe, extremely powerful and terrifying. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. Together they embarked on a megalomaniac plan of global domination.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11790110/1/Gabriel][Gabriel]], linkffn(11790110): A variation of the WBWL trope where Harry's brother was NOT an asshole. Harry himself was trained to become an expert assassin and basically steamrolled those bad guys. Extreme Dumbledore bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): The backstory indicated Harry being trained by Sirius and Co from early on. The main story happened after the War in which Harry hired Ginny to accompany on some adventures. The ending has a major twist though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): The Grangers were NOT what they appeared to be, and Hermione was secretly programmed early on as a Spygirl. She was activated during the DoM battle at the end of Year 5. They began training Harry soon after.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620): Harry started doing nefarious things with Dudley well before he went to Hogwarts. There, he mostly trained himself. When Voldemort took over, he, Hermione, and Theo Nott launched a devastating campaign against the Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434): Lockhart was DoM special agent Adonis and he began training Harry and Ginny to become super killers right from Year 2, with Luna being their controller.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either.

** I can't blame you. Circular Reasoning is my favorite fiction of all time, and I never fail to promote it. Sadly, I haven't particularly found anything even close to mimicking it. There is a couple reasons for that.

1) Character development. In that fic, we have a very clear sense that development occured, either by the authers summarizing a little or with flashbacks, but we don't have to go through the painful angst of edgy teen dark Harry. We start straight off with a messed up adult, who is absolutely serious so that the story is serious, but has a sense of humor, so it isn't too intense.

2) Engagement. The story is incredibly engaging and fascinating. It is well written, with an excellent plot, great literary devices, and is internally consistent, as well as mostly consistent with canon, and in cases it's not, the provided version is better than canon. That is rare in fanfics.

3)Tropes and Themes. The auther sets up a much more complex plot than usual, using cause and effect masterfully to weave together multiple points. He flat out ignores the tired romance trope, and instead goes for a fucked up soldier, being dragging into everyone's webs of manipulation. He is also not afraid of using dark magic tropes and generally nasty stuff, but he puts good reasons behind them, many chapters in advance and doesn't do it to make Harry edgy.

4) Alternate magic systems. He pulls from other series, notably Abhorsen and the Dresden Files for magic systems that make sense, are not contradicted by canon, and don't replace anything in canon. Canon doesn't give us necromancy mechanics, so using the decently written ones from Garth Nix makes sense.

This all makes it super difficult to find fics of this quality. linkffn(Too Young to Die) goes straight into dark themes and self-destruction, but also features an arrogant angsty teen as the main character. linkffn(Deprived) does good on intensity and engagement, but has all the wrong themes, and the main character takes himself too seriously. linkffn(Reunion) has all the right plot points, but it is too light of a story. Harry glibly massacres legions of death eaters in a way designed to get hysterical laughter from readers, which doesn't even come close. linkffn(The Denarian Renagade) series does have an awful lot of killing and adult themes, but while much less of a crackfic, the main character is still an annoying arrogant brat with little to no character development. But then again, it is mostly fight scenes the whole way through. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) in my opinion is actually pretty good. Harry is basically an adult, though not a super agent. It ranks somewhat close with engagement, the tropes and themes are generally pretty good, if you can ignore the cheesy romance angle, and it has several unique parts to it. It does involve time travel, but more like groundhog day. However, it doesn't have the dark themes, and the main character is overly cavalier and arrogant for my taste, though that can be easily overlooked with the rest of the story. This one I would actually recommend.

Anyway, this is all I am willing to put effort in for today. Good luck. If you find a comparable fic, PM me or something.

  Harry Potter has the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's deserving of some enjoyment, isn't he? Well, he thinks so, and he intends to act on it. The strange gifts he has, and isn't going to question, should help in that regard.This is a story in which Harry has sex with just about everyone. Any necessary warnings will be at the top of each chapter, and a little summary will be there as well if you're reading this for the meagre plot included (There's no discernible reason you would be, it's first and foremost smut) and don't want to read that particular chapter.The background story will basically follow the books, and won't bother restating everything that happens. There might be included a very basic recap just as a reminder in the notes, though.Can't promise especially quick updates, it'll depend on how often the mood strikes me.
