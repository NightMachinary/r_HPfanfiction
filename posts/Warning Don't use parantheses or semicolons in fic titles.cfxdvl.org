Using ')' or ';' in your fic titles will cause the bot to mess up when someone tries to link it!

Example: Linkffn(/Rise of the Dark Lady Hermione (adopted/) ; Lord Hermione?)

This won't link the second fic because the bot stops parsing at the first closing paranthesis!


** This seems like a rather easy burden for the recommender to deal with.

The FFN Bot doesn't require an exact title - it performs a search and attempts to grab the most relevant result.

In this case:

linkffn(rise of the dark lady hermione adopted; lord hermione?)

Should work just fine.

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

** Your title could have been clearer. The urgent-sounding title made it sound like you found a bug on FanFiction.Net that messes up stories with those characters in their titles, which would be very important for authors to know. Finding you were only referring to links on this sub-Reddit having to be written differently makes your title feel like click-bait.
