Any fic recs where Harry is oblivious to any subtleties or anything. Or even where he's just being really dumb but in a lovable way.

Just thinking about “I know how to do math” when Hagrid says he doesn't know anything in the first book.


** Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694)

Doesn't understand 'the quidditch' or the House Cup. He doesn't realize detention is a punishment, he thinks it's prime tutoring time.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

*** I was really enjoying this story, right up until Harry was giving a perfectly accurate and reasonable argument against Hermione's insistence they memorize a bunch of potions... only to completely change his mind /because Ron agreed with him/. This scene also had Hermione actually poking Harry in the nose with her finger in her +nagging+ insistence, and he just goes along with it because he automatically disagrees with Ron anytime Ron and Hermione argue. End result: Harry helps Hermione bully everybody into studying details they don't need to know.

I limped along through a few more chapters after that, but it had really lost its shine and I got more and more annoyed until I gave up on it altogether.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Make a Wish, linkffn(2318355)

One of my absolute favourite fics! Harry is amazingly oblivious to what happens around him, how people perceive him, what's normal etc. It's also very funny

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

*** Despite being incredibly popular, this fic is an awful mess that just gets worse and worse as it goes on. It has promise, there are a few jokes that make it seem like this might be a fun story, but nothing pays off. Do not go into this expecting a good story, or even an okay one, but if you want the literary equivalent of burned popcorn, this is for you.

** He's not unintelligent - the opposite, really - but chirpy and cheerful and a bit naive (because dragons mature more slowly than humans) in [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]].

Like the time when the centaurs, in terror of the (eight-year-old) "Great Wyrm", tie up one of their daughters and leave her near his lair as a sacrifice to appease him.

#+begin_quote
  Suddenly, it clicked. A lady tied up outside a dragon's lair --- this was just like that story with the damsel and that dragon that lived in the sea! Well, she wasn't naked like the one in the story, but he guessed it was kind of cold out, so that made sense. He'd never really understood that part of the story anyway. Harry nodded decisively. The lady with horse instead of legs was a damsel, and that made the question of what to do obvious.

  “Grr, grr, GRR. I'm a big fearsome dragon, and you're a damsel, so I'm going to carry you off to my lair, grr!” He declared, stepping out of the undergrowth. He wished he had gotten those stomping lessons from Hagrid already. Harry wanted to do this right, and it just didn't seem proper that the ground wasn't shaking from his every step. He hoped the horsey-lady wasn't disappointed.

  As Harry approached his new damsel, the thought ran through his head. Maybe damsels were some sort of treasure? If they were, then they were obviously a very important sort of treasure. The stories had always taken care to specifically name the damsels, and they never did that for the not-damsel treasures.

  Surely, the Great Wyrm would eat her soon?

  Again, she didn't resist as its mighty forepaws closed around her and lifted; to quaver would be to shame her family. This was her fate, and she would face it with dignity.

  Oddly, it seemed to be holding her exceedingly gently.

  Having picked her up carefully, it then proceeded to whisper out of the side of it's terrifying mouth, “Am I doing it right?”

  “...what?” It was the first word she had spoken since the previous night. She hadn't quite been able to work up the nerve before.

  “Well, this is the first time I've done this carrying-off thing, and I want to make sure I'm doing it right,” it explained. “I'm a dragon, and I'm supposed to know about this stuff.”

  For a moment, Suze considered saying he was doing it wrong, she had been expecting to be eaten by now, after all, but she reconsidered. It was probably an exceedingly bad idea to say no to a dragon, she reasoned.

  “I think you're doing it right,” Suze said uncertainly. “I've never been carried off before either, so I'm not sure how it goes, but, well, you've done a very convincing job so far. You may need to work on your growl, though.”

  The dragon didn't seem at all displeased by her commentary. “Okay! I guess GRR! isn't really fierce enough. I've heard dragons should be very fierce when carrying off damsels.”

  “Umm, I suppose so, but well... um...” Why was the Great Wyrm asking for advice rather than eating her? This was not what she expected at all!

  “Well,” the dragon sounded resigned but determined, “I guess I'll just have to make it up as I go along.” With that, he took off. The ground spun dizzyingly away beneath her as Suze was carried along for the ride, and then her captor landed with a bone-jarring thud in the entrance to his lair, where, to her continuing surprise, he set her down gently.

  “...um, sorry, I haven't quite got landings down just yet.”
