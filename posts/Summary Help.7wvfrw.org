At the beginning of her fifth year, Abby Albright had it all loving parents, one doting older sister named April and one distant older sister named Amy and a little brother named Jason she has to watch over after his dramatic first year. That all changes December 1993 when her parents are killed on the way pick her up from King's Cross. After her parent's death, they briefly move in with Amy but that doesn't turn out well as expected.

This will encompass her last three years of Hogwarts and her friendship with Lee Jordan and blooming romance with him. He will probably realize his feelings for her around the Yule Ball they go as friends because he's the only she agreed to go with while two or three guys asked her. Though, she won't realize them until later.


** Well . . . it's a bit boring. It reads like a shopping list but doesn't give any clue as to what the exciting events are going to be. I'm not your target audience but even if I was, I don't think it would grab me. Give some indication of what the character's goal is and what the obstacles are.

**** Why? If you want to attract readers you'll have to make them think it's going to be an interesting story. Ask yourself what attracts you to a story. What sort of summary intrigues you and makes you want to know more?

Personally I'd be inclined to start it something like this: "At the beginning of her fifth year, Abby Albright has it all, but in December 1993 everything changes." Give some idea of what significant event causes the change and what difficulties it is likely to create. Then drop a hint about the romance.

**** A trick is to ask questions. Here is a short description that might give some inspiration:

When Abby Albright, a 15 year old muggleborn, witnesses by the mysterious death of her parents her life is suddenly not as easy anymore. How will she deal with her new foster parents are not allowed to know about magic? How will she balance her duty as an older sister with the romantic feelings she is developing? How will she cope with the ministry not researching muggle accidents?

***** I like that but I was originally planning having one of the twin sisters raise Abby and their brother.

****** You can still have that. It doesn't have to be in the description to appear in a story. I mean, mystery fics would be really boring otherwise.

******* But I like the foster parent angle. I don't think the muggle courts would allow a twenty-year-old woman to take in her younger siblings.
