I was watching Snowpiercer earlier and the character who plays Ollivander(John Hurt) has a role in the movie. For some reason seeing him in the movie got me thinking of plot possibilities with Ollivander and Harry.

So, if there is anything out there already written i'd love to read it!


** Been a while since I've read it, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8289640/1/Apprentic-James][Apprentic James]] was good while it lasted. It's a short, unfinished fic and I doubt it will ever be finished.

Extensive Muggle and magical historical and anthropological research has revealed much, but not the whole story. In 2023, ten years after the master wandmaker's death, a provision of Mr. Ollivander's last will and testament allowed Harry Potter to give several exhaustive interviews telling the wizarding world the Ollivander family history - the founding of the oldest wizarding business in the world. Finally, the StoryTeller can chronicle this in a readable manner -- from Harry's eyes the summer before his third year.
