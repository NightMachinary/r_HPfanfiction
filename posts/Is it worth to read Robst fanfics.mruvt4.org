So I'm a Harry and Hermione shipper and I would love to read some good fanfics with their pairing.

I always keep coming across Harry Crow by Robst when I start searching for a new story. The summary honestly, never hit me. So I avoided it all the time. However, after seeing the suggestion for too many times, I decided to give it a go. And if I'm being honest here, I couldn't read beyond the first chapter. The sorting scene was absolutely horrible. I wondered why it became such a big success and then left it.

But whenever I ask for people's opinion, they recommend this fanfic to me. When I said I read the first chapter and I didn't like it, they urge me to continue reading and that I'd fall in love with it soon. I've read another of Robst fanfic too and it was as bad as the first one. But still many people keep saying that it looks like that in the beginning, but we'll fall in love if we continue reading.

So I'm here for your advice. Please tell me if those fics are worth to read.


** There are a few Robst fics I like, but everyone has their own preferences. If you've tried two of his fics and couldn't keep going then don't push yourself.

I read Harry Crow early in my fanfic career and I think I was entertained by it (not the same thing as saying it was good), but I've never felt interested in re-reading it and I don't think I would enjoy it now.

** I'm going to be honest with you. If you really didn't like the first chapter, then it won't really get any better. Robst stories are a "You either love it or hate it, no in between" thing. If you didn't like the first chapter, dont push yourself to read any more of the fic, or really any of his stories at all because they are all kind of the same tone.

** I've read a number of his stories, and if you didn't like Harry Crow, you won't like the others - he tends to have similar plot elements no matter the start of the story.

I haven't read his later stories, though.

** I've read all of his fics that are posted to FF.net and loved them.

Having said that, if you've read one and started another, and didn't like either, you're probably not going to like any of them. They generally have a similar feel to me so unfortunately, it's kind of a 1 or none kinda thing.

** ha ha I found that story got really boring after the first few interesting chapters.

I found Daniel Granger to be quite good, there's a few that are ok. But I think the biggest issue with Rob was that his work was all very similar, and then a bunch of people mimicked his style and plotstyle (particular where the grangers and Mugglewank comes in), so you reach a bit of a saturation point. If you like Harry/Hermione I would recommend reading at least two of his stories because he's certainly a bit of a cornerstone in the pairing.

Oh I just saw that you've already read some. I would say if you don't like the ones you've read you certainly won't enjoy the others.

Have you read Kiera Marcos' stuff? She is also a big harmony person but a different style

*** There is also

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]])

for a harryxhermione with similar vein to Harry crow but far different (and far more enjoyable in my opinion) as well

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?

** If youre main interest is the Harry/Hermione relationship, then you may be disappointed. Both characters typically become very OOC near the beginning of his stories.

If you like stories where Harry becomes OP and dunks on Dumbles and Voldy, Robst can be entertaining. If you're looking for romance their are much better choices imo.
