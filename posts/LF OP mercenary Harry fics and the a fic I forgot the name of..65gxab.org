Ex. linkffn(Deprived) I like when Harry is an OP mercenary and when people are hired to take him out they get scared shitless at the very mention of his name. Also I read a fic like this once where Harry was raised by Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange and I would appreciate if someone could tell me the name, I really want to re-read it.
