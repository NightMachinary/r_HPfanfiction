Having Hermione as the only studious member of a year is so unbelievable it isn't even funny. Maybe have Dean shine a bit, or Parvati be as smart as her sister.


** Bleh I agree. Just because Hermione is smart doesn't mean all of her house mates are stupid.

*** Canon makes it seem the house is only full of average students. I'm not asking for a dumber Hermione. Just a smarter house.

**** The smart kids are meant to mostly end up in Ravenclaw, sure there's the odd exception like Cedric (who was apparently the best student at Hogwarts according to a certain goblet), or Hermione, and a couple of past exceptions in Dumbledore, Snape and Riddle, maybe even some people like Fred and George (who are clearly quite talented, but also not really focused on schoolwork).

There won't be all that many exceptional students at Hogwarts at once to begin with (there's not exactly many students in general) and to not be in Ravenclaw they need to be an even better fit for another house, meaning they'd need to really exemplify that other house's qualities.

***** I disagree with that sort of setup. I think it's more of the approach they take towards life than anything. But having all the academics in one house is just a terrible thing. I find it makes for a more diverse cast if the knowledge doesn't come from one source.

** Gryffindors are not shown as stupid in the books.

Some eamples are of course Dumbledore, (Aberfort still powerful and clever, but just a tiny bit less than Albus), McGonagall, the Mauraders (Peter is by far the least competent one and he seems like surely one of the top 5 people Voldemort has, but other than that James and Sirius are both described as especially bright and good wizards, they created the map and became animagi really early), Lily Evans, Bill Weasley (was said to have very good grades), Percy (he got 12 OWLs and that by only 12 subjects taught in Hogwarts and without a time turner like Hermione, that either means back then there were better shedules around or he self-taught him some of those subjects)

Just to name some, it is this fandom idea that Gryffindors are stupid or less smart than others. The only house that can claim to be really more intelligent than any of the others is Ravenclaw, the other three all have the same chance the got brilliant minds or idiots in their house (and yes that does include Slytherin). But I always felt like the characteristics to sort the students correlate with the way students like to learn. Ravenclaws study for the theory and all there is to know, Gryffindors have a more hands on aproach, more learning while doing and solving problems when they show up, Hufflepuffs learn best in groups and Slytherins like to take shortcuts in their learning and studying

*** Past examples are like that (an excellent counter-argument by the way), but the current Hogwarts class has Harry as prime prefect material. At best a B student! Who is replaced by another at best B student.

Of course, Rowling doesn't understand math, so as the population for 280-1000 students is different.

*** No I just don't want ravenclaw to be the place where all the smart kids go.

**** It's where the majority of the smart kids go though, just like Gryffindor is where the majority of the Brave kids go, Hufflepuff is the majority of where the kind and fair kids go and Slytherin is where the majority of where the Ambitious kids go.

Yeah, there is nuance and some smart kids don't go to Ravenclaw, but it's very rare and few and far in-between.

***** Ok, so first off, rule 9. You do not discuss requests. I thought you were going to try to find something.

Second, it's a request. I'm not arguing about canon.
