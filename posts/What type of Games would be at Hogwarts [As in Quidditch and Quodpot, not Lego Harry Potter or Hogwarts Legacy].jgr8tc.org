So, two parts to this post - a *discussion and a request*.

*Discussion* is - *what games do you think exist at Hogwarts (or should exist) that we didn't get to see in canon?* From what I can recall (and google), we got Quidditch, Quodpot, and Broom racing on Brooms, Dueling with Wands, then Gobstones, Chess, and Exploding Snap. What others do you think they might have? Would there be Wizarding Tabletop RPGs with illusory figures and maps and things? Would there be Oneiromantic Orbs that let you actively play and control your dreams like a video game? Transfiguration Minister's Cat, where you have to transfigure a Cat Doll into a thing beginning with the next letter of the alphabet from the last suggestion? A Charm's maze where you have to add different Charms to a thing to get it through a maze? Butterbeer Pong?

==o=o=o=o==

*Request* is - *have you got any fics that deal with games?* And I mean actual in-world games, *not* Gamer!Harry fics.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** On the discussion point, I don't think there'd be any "controlling your dreams" orbs because that's what the daydream charms, which are new, seem to do.

I think that there'd animation racing, where students might transfigure or charm objects and race them. It would be hilarious to race 10 tables around hogwarts and see which table is the fastest, the one with horse legs or the one with animated table legs.

I'd expect there to be drinking games with potions involved.

On the request side, I'm afraid I don't have much.

*** I was under the impression the daydream orbs were more like movies than video games. Like, they just made you dream a specific sequence rather than let you control them. I meant controlling in the sense that, with one of these orbs, closing your eyes to dream would be like putting on a VR Headset.

Ooooh, I like both of those ideas. I don't know if these are just a British thing or exist elsewhere too, but there were these horse-race games in arcades that you used to put coins in to get these little plastic-metal horse things to race. Your racing idea kind of reminds me of that.

And the drinking game thing would definitely be fun too, though I'd be curious to know if it'd follow the typical drinking game pattern of just being an excuse to drink more, or if you were actually trying to avoid drinking potions (or the wrong potion, I guess).

** Knowing the Magical World, I imagine some games to be pretty chaotic. Sort of like this:

#+begin_quote
  "I move pawn to D5."

  "YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD!"

  "WELL I SUNK YOUR BATTLESHIP!"

  "I ROLL NAT 20 AND CAST MAGIC MISSILE WHILE ADOPTING YOUR GOBLIN TRIBE!"

  "I ATTACK WITH MY VANGUARD, HITTING TWO CRITICAL TRIGGERS ON MY DRIVE CHECK!"

  "I TAP MY MYR BATTLESPHERE AND DEAL 8 DAMAGE TO YOUR FACE!"

  "Now move your last pathetic piece, Potter!"

  "My board has no pathetic pieces! But it *does* have the unstoppable Exodia!"
#+end_quote

In all seriousness, this is a very interesting topic. I wonder if anyone knows such fics.

Maybe an actual game attached to the Chocolate Frog cards, like the AR Figurine games that were a fad a few years back. Collect some people cards, then upgrade them with equipment cards and spell cards, etc.

** There's an invented broom game in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) that's kind of like tennis on brooms. The fic is huge and the game is such a tiny part of it that I don't know if you'd want to read it though. You can search "Ricochet" just to read about the game.

Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

I can do a keyword-search with the fic's URL and find the specific bit that the game comes up in, though.

** Having read The Lie I've Lived, I'd consider broom racing to be a sport or past time.

Then you can have a whole array of racing sports based off magical creatures and gambling on those sports.

Could be a tinkerer's version as well, like those 'full performance enhancing drug Olympics' comedians occasionally suggest. Either people transfigure and build their own custom mounts, or perhaps the one field that actually gets an exemption from the ban on experimental breeding.

Especially since Jacks used to be called Knaves, which is an old Shakespearean era slang term for a liar or an unscrupulous rogue, so the Jacks could keep trying to give bad advice and misdirect the players. Add an extra layer of "Which advice do you listen to?" minigame in the vein of the "I only tell lies, he only tells the truth" doorkeepers. :D
