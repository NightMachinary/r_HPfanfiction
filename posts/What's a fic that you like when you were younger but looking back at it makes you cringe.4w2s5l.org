** While I wasn't really that much younger than I am now (probably about 2 years now), I was still incredibly new to this whole shindig, it would have to be Brutal Harry. How the hell I finished that I'll never know.

The stilted prose and even more stilted dialogue, the fact that literally every adult with the exception of Dumbledore just let Harry keep on truckin' instead of actually trying to help him past his issues, the over-the-top Dursley abuse, the terrible magical theory and that fucking awful ending. A disaster from start to finish.

** I remember liking a good portion of /Sixth Year: The Steps Toward the End/ and kind of hand-waving / writing off about 20% of it as not great. I'm pretty sure the parts I was ignoring would make me physically cringe if I read it again today. Can't remember exactly, but I'm pretty sure this story features Love Potion Ginny, so...

I can't actually remember what happens in /Harry Potter and the Hero's Path/ well enough to say for sure, but it feels like some of the wandless magic / badass Harry stuff would probably not be as cool as it was when I was younger and hadn't read much fanfiction.

** Almost everything pre-2009, and then some.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=133890][Love Before Death]] groomed (for want of a better term) my then passing interest in the fandom. It's not the worst fic that I've come across, but the oddly phrased prose, synapse-stalling dialogue and superficial motivations of the cast all contribute to the most WTFs per clause that I've ever encountered on a re-read. The author's other works are similarly if not more bizarre.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Crystal Song) introduced me to fusion fics, and in a context I've yearned for ever since: exclusively HP characters inhabiting another universe. In this case, it was Final Fantasy. I went back to read it yesterday, though, and realised that the author used Levels, XP, classes, etc.

It wasn't a "game" fic.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element) was my shit for almost a decade. Incidents such as "Harry's Porno Search Gone Wrong" among many others have caused major trust issues. If a fic exceeds half a million words and covers less than ten months, I just can't any more. That goes double for ship fics.
