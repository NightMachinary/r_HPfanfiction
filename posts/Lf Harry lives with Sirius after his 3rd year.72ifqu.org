Remus did not transform to a werewolf on the day they discovered Pettigrew in the shrieking shack. Pettigrew got sent to Azkaban and Sirius was released free.

Would appreciate if the story follows Canon as much as possible but a bit of change is also nice!

  I think A Marauder's Plan would interest you, but I found it quite boring. It was just such a fix-it, and slow going. Not enough conflict. I don't know if it got better after, but I read the first 100k words and then some.

I got up to the start of the Triwizard Tournament before I gave up and I've got to tell you it does not really get any better. It's a shame really because a politically savvy Sirius taking over the Ancient and Noble House of Black could make for an interesting read, if only to see how things would affect Harry and co, the Wizengamot, Riddle and his ilk, etc. Alas, the very large portions where nothing of consequence happens makes for a very boring read, even in a character-driven piece such as this. When it takes 40 chapters and roughly 400k words of a nearly 900k work to cover the summer of â€˜94, there's too much filler. Even accounting for deviations from canon directly after PoA, including a more involved World Cup, at some point, the story needs to move forward.

Obviously people like the story given the extremely high number of reviews and favorites. I just wanted to put that out there for anyone who wishes to dive into this story.

** Linkffn(Weres Harry?) Pettigrew is captured, and things get interesting in fourth year because Harry was paranoid enough to know someone would try to enter his name in the goblet.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
