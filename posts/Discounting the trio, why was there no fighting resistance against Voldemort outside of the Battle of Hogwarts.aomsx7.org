It just seems odd that there was no proper resistance during the war. The Order occasionally runs a radio show and the DA annoys the Carrows a little, but it is strange that people managed to organise uprisings and acts of partisan warfare when they don't have magic but the ones with the ability to teleport themselves, most of whom are also familiar with telephones, cannot.

Obviously, the chances of success are slim, but that didn't stop the Armia Krajowa or the Resistance from actually hurting the Germans. There is no Muggleborn defiance, nothing like the Warsaw Ghetto uprising or the Assassinations of Heydrich and Seyffardt. No Muggleborn corps formed in exile like the foreign legions during both World Wars.

Obviously, Voldemort is a lot more capable than anyone else, but he is just one man and not an entire internal security agency hunting for "traitors". Also, I doubt that the Dark Lord would personally hunt down some random Muggleborn while he is busy searching for the Elder Wand just because some underling of Umbridge vanished.

And I understand that not everyone is born a fighter, but statistics alone dictate that there should be more Muggleborns or people who had family targeted by the new regime willing to openly defy Voldemort other than Hermione.

There didn't seem to be any in the Order either. My headcanon is that they left the country because Hogwarts was a shithole where the whole blood purity thing is tacitly encouraged. Why the fuck you bother coming to save some backwards may as well be foreign country when you can make a real nice living in the muggle world using magic on the side.

** I don't see the average Muggleborn as having an emotional investment in Wizarding Britain. Not to the point where they'd risk their lives for its sake.

Sure, you have some Muggleborns like Hermione, who was basically fostered into the Weasley family from the start, and stayed with them every summer instead of going home to her parents. Or you have adult Muggleborns like Mr. Tonks who have integrated into the community and married longstanding members, like Andromeda Black. But the average Muggleborn would have maintained Muggle links and family, on top of their Muggle identity documents and licenses, so it wouldn't be hard for them to move back into the Muggle world for the duration of the War and keep to themselves until it ended.

Just as Death Eaters wouldn't have stalked the supermarket checkout lines across England, waiting for Harry and Hermione to stock up on groceries, Umbridge's crew wouldn't have gone through Muggle tax records to find one random temp worker at a Sussex call centre.

*** But there would be many whose family would be at risk. Half-Bloods, whose mothers are suddenly being rounded up. Or Spouses. You obviously wouldn't fight if you could bail, but given how effective the Ministry was at persecuting people, you'd think that there would be more vigilantes and partisans around whose motivation is revenge for lost family. More people like Ted Tonks who had built a life to fight for.

I mean, he was pretty stupid about his escape, I'll freely give you that, but shouldn't there be more people in his position, some of whom would have fought. Hell, most of the people in the fighting age probably grew up with a grandfather or even great grandfather who had fought in at least one world war or Korea. (Great) Grandmothers, who toiled in munitions factories to do their part for the war effort.

Getting out of the country isn't particularly difficult in Europe when the people trying to hunt you down a, aren't a legitimate government, b, probably can't even conceive of an airport like Heathrow where whole of the magical population could decide wander on in one day without causing undue hassle, and c you can teleport.

imo the only ones who stuck around were probably too stupid to do anything meaningful, competant enough to lay low with their families or too young to know any better which precludes the whole fight the power thing. And that's assuming we buy into the whole "they're totally gonna kill all the half and mudbloods guys, now don't question why none of the plebs are in our secret club or why our most knowlegable member on the the muggle problem doesn't even know what electricity is" thing.

** "Surprising lack of resistance" is a phrase that reminds me of comments Primo Levi made in one of his books about being a concentration camp inmate, to the effect that nobody in those camps was from a culture that was predisposed to resistance, that there was a cultural assumption that you submitted to Authority or were at least helpless before it.

Wizarding Britain, with its narrative that the problem gets solved by the Mighty Hero taking down the Evil Villain in Heroic Single Combat (See: Gellert Grindlewald, defeat of), could well have that problem. And while they wait for the Prophesied Hero, they put up with the boot on their necks.

There probably was some resistance, but it was small, scattered, and ineffective, lacking outside assistance in the form of the Wizarding SOE or similar. Insurgent movements generally don't do so well if they're purely homegrown: I can think of /maybe/ one that succeeded without overseas aid, .

** Honestly, how many of them were left to resist? If the first war was as devastating as it's been portrayed, then I'd expect a lot of resisters would have died then. The second war would have started like 15 years later? That's less than a generation - without significant immigration the population of adults wouldn't have recovered yet.

Additionally, it's also likely that we just don't see it because Harry doesn't.

** First, we need to recognize that the Death Eaters are prototype Nazis, and the Muggleborns in this instance do have the same roles as Jews in World War II.

With that in mind, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a4ogc0/why_didnt_the_jews_fight_back_more_during_wwii/][you]] are not [[https://www.ushmm.org/educators/teaching-about-the-holocaust/common-questions#answer%203][the first one]] to ask [[http://www.aish.com/ho/i/48945626.html][this question]]: "Why didn't Jews resist more during the 2nd world war?"

This answer to this is not trivial, I'm not entirely qualified to give it, but I'll have a quick go:

- They did indeed fight back, although mostly on smaller scales and from the underground
- One time they did fight early on, a jew shooting a single officer of the German embassy in France started the "Reichsprognomnacht" ("Night of broken glass"), which destroyed many jew's livelihood, burned down their houses, and is - to the best of my knowledge - regarded as one of the worst nights in (German-)Jewish history.
- The Jews didn't really know what happened until it was too late. By then, leaving the country was hard, and it was overall a shitty situation.
- You can't really fight a well-armed army that has the support of the general population. Fucking Russia had trouble with the Nazis, what could unorganized and untrained civilians do?
- There was also the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising][Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], where in a riot the captured Jews (and other prisoners) rose up. The held control of the ghetto for a while, but in the end it didn't matter.

#+begin_quote
  13,000 Jews were killed in the ghetto during the uprising (some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation)
#+end_quote

The three articles I linked have better answers, if you are interested in this topic, I do recommend reading them and more.

Anyway, A lot of those reasons do also apply to the same discussion with muggelborns.

- Voldemort is even scarier as Hitler, as he can't even be killed
- There was an underground resistance, and probably more than one
- Open defiance might have made things even worse, not only for you, but also for friends and family.
- Resistance doesn't matter, you'll die anyway, and if you resist, it's probably gonna be worse.
- Organization was difficult (Taboo, Caterwauling charm, ...)
- Nobody can trust nobody

Lastly,

- We don't know exactly what actions had been taken, we are limited to the small viewpoint of Harry Potter.
- In a magical world, if you get captured, your resistance is toast. Veritaserum, Legillimency, ... will make it hard to resist. It's even better than torture.

It's really not an easy topic.

*** This is the correct answer. Maybe you need to emphasise the aspect of families being threatened more, because that's a standard tactic in autocratic, repressive regimes. And it's also something that was very evident in Deathly Hallows, but in the shape of Hogwarts essentially becoming a concentration camp for all the wizarding kids. You saw what happened to defying people when Luna got arrested for Xenophilius' writings in the Quibbler.

Just look at the assassinations of Heydrich and Seyffardt, the sabotage of the railway system in France prior to D-Day, the Warsaw Uprising, Witold Pilecki, Norwegian heavy water sabotage and the Soviet Partisans.

And there was later quite some resistance against the Soviets as well, at least in Poland.

*** The reaction to the Holocaust was (some) Jews making their own country to be safe in, the impact of holocaust literature and the promise of "never again". In the Wizarding World, the reaction to the first Death Eater war was to celebrate Harry Potter's life, buy books about him and go back to business as usual.

There was no awareness shown by any Muggleborn or Halfblood characters that they should flee or fight back, except those influenced by Dumbledore. That's what gets me. Not even a scene of Muggleborn fleeing the country, they either fight at the final battle, or die in the buildup.

As someone who is a racial minority, you can bet your bottom dollar I'd be extremely attuned to issues like racial attacks in the country I am living in. I don't feel this from the Muggleborn characters in the books and it bugs me. Hermione is particularly egregious in the 6th book. She knows that Voldemort is out there, she knows that Pureblood bigots are gaining power and influence. And she runs off and plays hero with her Pureblood/Halfblood BFFs rather than possibly trying to foment some sort of Muggleborn flight or resistance movement. From the founder of SPEW, this was disappointing.

Sure, but Hagrid took months travelling to stay undetected and because magical travel was monitored, and that was in book five. Also, what gives you the idea that Wizards in general have normal passports? They aren't normal British citizens, from what we can tell.

Yeah, but the constant threat of:

- What if the wizards can intercept royal mail? (Hint: They can, they managed to get Petunia's letter to Hogwarts)

I mean, if you contact anyone who isn't "arrest on sight" (all muggleborns), you could contact some friendlies like the Weasleys:

But in DH13, we get a look athis file:

#+begin_quote
  ARTHUR WEASLEY

  BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.

  FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.

  SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously)
#+end_quote

So, if you contact Arthur, he either has to report you, and you're fucked, or he doesn't report you, and you're both fucked. Fun, isn't it? Oh, and the Ministry could /easily/ regularly send someone pretending to be a muggleborn, and if you don't report the plants, you're a traitor. Nice, isn't it?

And again, if you tell someone how / where to find you, and they are compromised, you are now dead.

Fear culture is pretty real, man.

#+begin_quote
  Kinda difficult to get worse than "being round up and deported to the worst place on earth with soul sucking demons as guards" and "hunted by Death Squads"
#+end_quote

Sure, it's difficult to get worse than that. But let's look at one example:

#+begin_quote
  “A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying. “Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?”

  [...]

  Umbridge ignored her.

  “Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”
#+end_quote

If Mrs. Cattermole had put up any resistance, what do you think would have happened to her children? Her children, that were trapped at Hogwarts.

They were children of a muggleborn, but they are halfbloods. Not desirable, but they didn't "steal" the magic, so no need to send them to Azkaban.

And in danger of repeating myeslf: We have an INCREDIBLY limited viewpoint. We do not /know/ what forms of resistance there are, and what they are doing.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  “You didn't hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn't have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  “These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.”

  [...]

  “Yeah, well, I couldn't ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That's when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.”

  [...]

  “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo's and Gran's on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I'm my parents' son, and to keep it up.”
#+end_quote

Harry had not heard of all this resistance until the Battle of Hogwards, until it basically was over. And until the end of the book, he didn't really talk to others about what they did.

To say that nobody resisted, is pretty presumptuous, and that is beside the reasons for not resisting I gave.

** Well, first, you have to consider that the Death Eaters took over the magical government, and all its resources, in one night, killing the former Minister of Magic and replacing him with a new one immediately. Now it's theirs to control.

They thus controlled everything from the Aurors, to the news/propaganda, to the Department of Magical Transportation (which monitored everything from Floo Network to Apparation) and had access to records for every witch and wizard in Magical Britain.

During the confusion, and before any of the news broke out, they most likely targeted as many potential threats as they could, bringing in, or killing as many as possible. It was obvious what was happening to those associated with the order, but the Death Eaters had otherwise tried to keep their transition into power as quiet as possible. Rumors of the Ministry falling may have spread, with some people believing it, yet others not wanting to believe it. It happened before when Voldemort first came back, and it's easy to see that it would happen again. By the time people realized what was happening, the muggleborns were already being rounded up.

They also had a Taboo on the name Voldemort, which is huge, because A: it targets anyone who's not afraid of Voldemort, and B: adds another layer of fear and oppression and wariness.

There's also the problem of organizing a resistance. As far as we know, there's only one group who even offered passive resistance against Voldemort: The Order of the Phoenix, and they couldn't exactly recruit too much, as you couldn't trust anyone. They could be spies or under the Imperius or susceptible to the Imperius. They could be subjected to Legilimency and not be a sufficiently trained Occlumens to keep information hidden.

As for resistance from the current roster of the order, as far as I can remember, at that point in the series, the Order has exactly 2 active or former Aurors in their group, and one of them is pregnant and already going into hiding because of their muggleborn father, blood traitor mother, and half-breed husband. That just leaves Kingsley as the only true fighter left in the Order.

If Kingsley tried to take action, and got caught, then there is no one in the department who could gain information on what's going on there.

Same reason why many of rest of the Order in the Ministry. There was no way they could actively fight the entire might of the MoM, and Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

Most of the Order's actions were probably to smuggle out as many Muggleborns as possible with the least amount of risk, and gathering information to inform the people for the radio show.

Lastly, there's one huge reason why they couldn't offer any significant resistance: Hogwarts.

Attendance became compulsory, which meant students were essentially hostages for their parents' good behavior. We saw it in action with Xenophilius Lovegood. He was resisting by printing the true stories, but the MoM and the Death Eaters took Luna and held her hostage. It's easy to assume this wasn't the first or last time they would use the kids as hostages or the threat of taking them hostage.

And if that family were to disappear? Well, time to "interrogate" all their known friends and extended family members and everyone they've regularly met with over the past 6 months.

The fact is that Voldemort acted quickly and quietly, and had a pretty smart plan overall to control the populace. He didn't know love, but he knew fear.

This makes me laugh. There's a thing called "bureaucratic inertia," which basically means that it's impossible to redirect a government quickly. Probably the least useful thing you can do is take over the leader. Leaders come and go with the political breeze, but bureaucrats frequently stay in the system for decades. That's basically the point behind the old British sitcom, "Yes, Minister".

You want to see resistance? Take over a large ministry and tell them that you are completely changing policy. At least a quarter of you workforce will leave; most of these will be near retirement age and unwilling to learn new skills. Maybe another quarter will nod and smile but refuse to adjust. Another quarter will actively oppose you. And maybe a quarter will be go along, but be hemmed in by all the other workers.

To make JKR's scenario plausible, the Death Eaters would have needed to infiltrate most of the major department beforehand. This would probably require at least decade of preparation. Nothing about the way she depicts them makes it seem like they're capable of such long range planning.

...That's actually exactly how it happened. Every head of department was either sympathetic to their cause or under the Imperious Curse by the time they went after the Minister.

They go over this in literally the first chapter of the 7th book.

As for how they even prepared all of this, the Death Eaters had become entrenched inside the Ministry over the years due to their own ambition and self-serving goals. They didn't need years to plan, because they already were making plans to gain more power and status all on their own.

Even after the Department of Mysteries incident, there were still Death Eaters and Death Eater contacts still working from the inside.

And so, with Dumbledore dead, and the Imperious Curse a thing, It was relatively simple for Voldemort to take over an incompetent Ministry, weakened and softened up by years of political corruption. All he needed to do was bribe, threaten, and curse the right people at the right time.
