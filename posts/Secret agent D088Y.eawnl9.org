** "Right away, Great Master Harry Potter Sir," Dobby said with an elegant bow and popped away. The little House-Elf pretended not to notice the slight grimace on Harry Potter's face and popped away into Dumbledore's office.

The usually jovial old man glared at Dobby, looking all in the world like some retired drill sergeant.

"Greetings, Agent O-Double-Eight," Dumbledore said in a grave tone. "I have a new mission for you. Grindelwald has been up to something sinister; your job is to find out exactly what he is doing and foil his plans."

"Yes, sir," Dobby replied in a deep, masculine voice that would put Kingsley Shacklebolt to shame. And then, he popped away.

/~ Grindelwald Evil Incorporated ~/

As soon as Dobby popped into existence into Grindelwald's base, he was captured and forced into a chair by two robotic minions. Doctor Grindelwald smirked smugly at him.

/"/Ah," Grindelwald said in his stereotypical Eastern European accent. "Dobby the House-Elf. You have returned once again! I trust you are enjoying your stay?" Dobby only glared at him. "It's a precaution I must take! Abandoned warehouses don't grow on trees, you know."

Grindelwald was oblivious to Dobby using a bobby pin to systematically shutting down the robots' joints, as he began to monologue. "This time, I have created a device of great power, one that will surely allow me to conquer Magical Europe!" He held out a small device with a big red button on it. "Behold, the /Rita Skeeter-inator/!"

Dobby gasped.

"With one push of this button, I can transform any middle-aged woman wearing a little too much makeup into a scandal-building, dirt-manufacturing reporter who is an insult to all of journalism!" Grindelwald cackled. "In fact, I shall demonstrate - /ah/!"

/Kapow!/

Dobby knocked the device out of his hands and caught it while flipping three times in the air; he landed in a perfect three-point landing. Grindelwald stood with his jaw hanging open.

Dobby stood up and looked Grindelwald in the eye.

"/Hasta la vista/, baby."

And then he popped away. Grindelwald fell to his knees. "Curse you, Dobby the House-Elf!"

  I keep getting attacked by plot bunnies. When I'm not being actively mauled by plot bunnies, this is where they reside. Perhaps one day, a lucky bunny will be spunky enough to become a plot rabbit. Rating bumped up for ch. 11.
