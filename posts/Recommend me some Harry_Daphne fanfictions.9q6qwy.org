** They are popular because there is literally nothing known about Daphne besides she's in Harry's year and in syltherin... Toss in the fact she wasn't shoved into a relationship with Harry , it makes her a popular choice

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

**** Also a story might be better if you haven't read the author's other works.... The black's resurgence is a great example... 3 stories all really well written but if you've read honour thy blood the other 2 (which aren't finished but are still being updated) follow the exact same path different relationships, sightly different story but same exact path...... Several authors are this way as well

** The best reason as for why Daphne is popular has to be "I like her name". It wins any argument.

JK, she's popular because she's a blank slate Slytherin Pureblood. That's it. And her family has a connection through Astoria Malfoy-Greengrass.

Read everything from Dorothea Greengrass and Shygui, they mostly write Harry/Daphne. Also, just type on the search bar to your right >>> Harry/Daphne and you'll find dozens of posts exactly like yours. Most have at least 5 fics suggested, though they may be repeated. I myself have suggested dozens and dozens of Harry/Daphne, seeing this is my favourite pairing.

** I think the currently being written story linkffn(13022013) fits pretty well to your request of the setting. No bashing that I remember though.
