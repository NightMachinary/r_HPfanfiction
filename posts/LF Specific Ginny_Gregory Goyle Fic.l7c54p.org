Ok so I read a fic a while ago, it was either Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Snape (but I'm leaning towards Draco and whoever it is is the main pairing). I'm pretty sure it was a marriage law fic where they were put together based on like compatibility.

Harry/Ginny are together (not married) in the beginning and Ginny decides that she wants to prove that her and Harry are meant to be so she gets them both to do the compatibility. She gets put with Gregory Goyle and I think Harry gets matched with Daphne Greengrass.

They are both minor relationships but I really liked the Ginny/Greg aspect and want to read it again. But I am having a lot of trouble finding it so if anyone knows it would be great.

Thanks!

  New marriage law passed just three years after the second wizarding war to prevent any future wars due to blood prejudice and to increase the wizarding population which was affected by the war. Unmarried purebloods were forced to marry muggle borns, half bloods and blood traitors. Love never came first. Starting was a struggle. HP/DG, RW/PP, DM/HG, GG/GiW, GeW/MB NL/TD pairing

** Well this is the oddest pairing I've seen in a while.

Also Harry/Daphne is great.

But I wish you luck in finding it, as I haven't read it sorry.

*** That's ok! Yeah it wasn't even a main pairing, they were minor to the story but I actually really enjoyed it. Wish there was more.

I'm hoping I can find it again because I keep thinking about it, and have had no luck finding it. Thanks!
