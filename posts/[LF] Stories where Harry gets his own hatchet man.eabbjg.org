Voldemort has Bellatrix, Dumbledore has Mad-eye.. Can anyone point me towards fics where Harry ends up getting a Hatchet Man of his own, to kick arse on his behalf when needs be?


** Well Partially Kissed Hero has Harry using Bellatrix as his hatchet man under the impression that she is serving Lord Voldemort possessing the body of Harry. But it's a pretty crappy fanfiction, just the only one I could come up with.

*** There's a lot to love about Partially Kissed Hero! Unfortunately there's also a lot to hate :(

**** Yeah I never actually finished though I did get further than some. The problem is the author has a lot of unique ideas but the execution itself is terrifyingly terrible at best.

***** I've thought sometime about a fic that cherry-picked the best ideas out of that fic but without the awfulness. Kind of a dick move to write though. "So anyway, here's Partially Kissed Hero but good" you know?

****** I'd read it. Even if you didn't come up with the ideas yourself you can certainly write them better. Actually that's what fanfiction is often used for even if this would be more of a fanfiction of a fanfiction.

**** I guess the closest thing to an enforcer harry has is maybe Beville in some fics or the Weasley twins in a fic or two

**** Would you call Adorable Violence Hermione an enforcer? I'm not quite certain myself, but it's not a stretch to say she's kind of just Harry's Bellatrix in that fic.
