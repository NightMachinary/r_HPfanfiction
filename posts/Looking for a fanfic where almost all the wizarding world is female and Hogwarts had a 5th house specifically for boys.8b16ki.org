****** If you're the author, I'll ask a quick question before I start reading:

How did you thought of this premise? Any influence from Firebird's son or an A/B/O story?

I might start reading before you answer.

******* I stumbled across the premise while developing AUs for an adult-rated Harry Potter RPG.

Basically, a lot of people in the game wanted a "harem" option, but while I have a certain soft spot for the concept of harem fics, they're never done well in HP stories, and the wizarding world in canon REALLY does not fit the "harem" scenario, and it's generally just used as "Harry is so cool and such a stud that he gets multiple girls!" with the girls in question never becoming any more than trophies.

So I thought: Okay, in what sort of society would "harems" be a natural thing? Obviously, in a society where men were rare and women either had to share, or go without men. So I started developing a world where witches outnumbered wizards ten to one, and I got so caught up in developing the world that I thought this had to make for an interesting AU fanfic.

I did try to read the Firebird trilogy.... after I'd had the idea I went to see if there were any other fanfics that used that premise, and I found the Firebird trilogy. But to be honest, I didn't like the story and I gave up reading after a while. There is exactly one thing I swiped from that story to use in mine -- the word "coven" for the harems. It was just such a GOOD word that I couldn't resist.

I'm not sure what an A/B/O story is?

******** Thank you for your answer!

Yes, the Firebird trilogy can be a bit hard if you're not on from the start.

An A/B/O (or A/O or A/B/O/D) is a story that (for a quick explanation) have gender role inscribed in it's DNA, it is usually used to include a part of society condonned animalistic behavior.

To make a longer, more complete explanation, A/B/O/D is for Alpha/Beta/Omega/Delta. It usually only applies to magical species (werewolves, veelas...) but can apply to all wizardkind.

An A is assertive, good at fighting and the dominant in a relationship, male. An O is submissive, prefer diplomacy and healing and is submissive in a relationship, female.

You can compare to the Japanese stereotypes of Uke (O) and Seme (A).

A D is someone who don't follow the /normal/ gender role, and usually goes in the more extreme behavior in the A/O "spectrum", so a male O or a female A.

A B is someone who is neither A nor O, a normal human being without any advantage or disadvantage in using battle magic or healing.

I wanted to link a fic show how it could be well done but I can't find it right now. If i find it I'll summon the bot.

********* Ah, okay. Nope, none of that in my story... the harem thing is a result of magical society being the way it is, not due to any sort of genetics or animalistic urges. Witches and wizards are still 100% human; the only real difference in this world is that post-puberty they age more slowly than Muggles, and this is a little more visible than in canon. (Dumbledore, who is over a hundred, still looks like he's forty or fifty.)

The witching world IS more blatantly sexual than the wizarding world from canon, but again this is more that society is different (and that I have the advantage of not having to make sure the story is kid-friendly at all times).

Muggle-borns, who grow up in a world where monogamy is the norm, often have problems adapting to the polygamic expectations of the witching world.... I touch briefly on this with the story of Lily, who was NOT going to share James with anyone else just because society said she should, but it'll be brought up again with Hermione.

********* There it is!

Sadly, the author as deleted all but one story from ffn and everything is on ao3 with a lot of them inaccessible to non logged readers.

I have only read the first 5 chapters when they were still on ffn so I do not know how well or bad it went afterwards.

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, the cupboard which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it all have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about in hushed tones? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
