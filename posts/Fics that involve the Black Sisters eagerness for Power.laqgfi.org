i want to know, if there exists fics as in the title with Bellatrix and/or Narcissa are eager to gain Power. Through Manipulation or whatever.

I thought that both are more or less manipulative Women. Until at some point atleast one of them finds a Man, that she unintentionally falls in love with.

The fics doesnt have to follow the Canon. Actually im fine and would rather expect it to happen in an AU with or without Voldemort or Tom Riddle. Ok, maybe Tom exists but is a rather good or neutral guy.

Sex can be included aswell. I would like the actors to be adults like seen in Canon.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** I'm not clear on whether before or after marriage is relevant for you.

I have this: linkao3(28896630)

Perhaps less fitting, because the focus is more generally on Narcissa from Hogwarts until Voldemort's first fall -- though Narcissa being who she is, your request is fulfilled by default: linkao3(8010667)

And if you are willing to drop your requirement of Narcissa or Bellatrix (and don't mind non-adult characters), it really doesn't get much better than this:

  Summary: AU of HBP. Romilda Vane was as cunning as any Slytherin and when she decided she wanted something, she got it. What she didn't factor into her scheme to gain the love of the Chosen One was that he might just be as much of a Slytherin as she was. A Love Story. Harry/Romilda.
#+end_quote

Pretty much a perfect fit in all other aspects. That Romilda usually splits people, but I think you might just fall into the group that loves her.

  The Ministry of Magic has been the stage for schemes and plots for centuries. The tale of how Lucius Malfoy was acquitted with applause and Bartemius Crouch lost all chances to become Minister for Magic is Narcissa's contribution ... and it always ends in Courtroom Ten.

  People tend to forget - love does not exist solely on the side of the Good and the Light.This is the story of Narcissa Black Malfoy.
