Do you remember yourself at the age of 11? We all were strange beings at the time. Our values, preferences, and insecurities were still shaping. How can we or the Hat make a choice that would determine us for the next 7 years? The Hat should have at least some access to our future character, right? Its powers are still a mystery.

For the Houses and their values are so different. There's much in-between. But, in the end, each of them encompasses a wide range of characters

So can you answer "[[https://quizlagoon.com/quiz/harry-potter-house-quiz-ravenclaw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=HPFanfiction&utm_medium=sortingHat][which hogwarts house am i]]" now? I can and offer you to get this too.


** I would recommend removing the question about pop culture songs. Without knowing these songs, it's difficult to choose something that feels personal, and these are the only part of the quiz that will feel dated in a short while.

These quizzes always give me a melancholy feel. I would hope the Hat could see our potential at age 11, rather than what we are at that age.

** I got Slytherin, usually I get Ravenclaw.

The music question felt very pointless considering I didn't know most of the songs.

Also I'm very curious about how you weighted the light/dark question: Slytherin vs everyone else?

** I got Ravenclaw. I like to take tests for fun. I get that house about half the time and Slytherin just as often. I think part of it is because whenever the question which would hurt to be called most, I always pick stupid. I have an idiot complex and I also think that one of the worst things anyone can be is dumb.

** Let's be honest though, if you're taking a sorting hat quiz from the hpfanfiction subreddit, you're definitely a ravenclaw.

Except me, of course. I'm the sole exception who's a slytherin.
