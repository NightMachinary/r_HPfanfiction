** Honestly, that's more cruel to Luna than anything else. It's not that they don't get along, it's that Hermione dislikes Luna.

*** I figured it was more like Ginny would realize "This seemed a good idea at the time" than anything else.

Or Hermione gets a glimpse of what Luna goes through every day.

**** I agree. I'd like a fic where Hermione has to go through what Harry, Ron, Luna, or Neville go through. She's never been mean to Neville, but she's literally the most tactless person in the series.

****** I think it could have been improved. I think the scene in book 7 where Ron leaves was contrived, and I think the entirety of Half-Blood Prince was stupid. I don't like Hermione as a character, but she pretty much became a stupidly jealous idiot in that book.

******* Yeah I agree on all counts, I really like Harry's developments in 6 and 7 but in both of those books it felt like at least one of the trio was always getting shafted character-wise.

******** I actually really liked Harry in the Half-Blood Prince. He was excelling, but more importantly, he was the sneaky kid he was in the first few movies.

I actually wrote a scene at linkffn(13321360) that highlights the ridiculousness of the birds scene in that book. Ignore my other fic, I wrote that on my phone and it comes across with bashing rather than criticism.

Mind, I like the concept of the trio, but a Harry who was more interested in magic rather than being a slight underachiever would have been great.

  A one-shot to show why Hermione should never have attacked Ron in the Half-Blood Prince. OOC Ron.

****** That's fair. Personally I don't understand the whole Luna/Hermione thing. Hermione does not like Luna at all in canon. Hermione learns to tolerate Luna in canon. She doesn't even like her.
