Looking for a fanfic located on either FFN or AO3 where Harry is the main character. I believe there was some time travel where HP goes back in time but doesn't de-age? HP ends as the leader of a 3rd side of the Light/Dark-Dumbledore/Voldemort war. Only this side consists of all the magical creatures races. HP uses a bar? For operations to build his “army”-ish. The bar? is either in Knockturn alley or some other alley made up by the author (so not Digon Alley). HP is likely some sort of magical creature himself--- I think he came into his inheritance and then either post Voldy war or before it was finished went back in time to set up the 3rd side. The 3rd side's goal is to have Dumbledore and Voldemort beat each other down so that whoever wins will be weak and not suspecting a war with the magical creatures that the MoM have long suppressed. --- a bit like the HP parallel of Plant of the Apes. I think others of HP's usual gang of friends are present at times? but ultimately the creatures are set to take over as the new rulers.

The fanfic I'm searching to find again is long and completed. I've been searching to find it again for at least a year so it was likely written 2016 or older.

P.s. Not sure if this needed a spoiler tag. I presume that in order to recognize the correct fanfic I'm looking, the the more details I can remember and share the better.

---Update: A commenter found the fic I was searching for: Stand Against the Moon by Batsutousai on FFN. Linkffn: 10724291. My appreciation to all that replied.


** This isn't what you are looking for probably, but nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2329599/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freedom-of-Apathy][Freedom of Apathy]] is similar?

** The only fic I can think of that is similar to what you're describing is linkffn(10724291). Harry is a magical creature and has been sent back in time, but he's de-aged. He's supposed to fulfil a prophecy that will see magical creatures shift to the top of the world order, and is considered a Lord amongst magical creatures. His usual gang are present but don't play a very significant role. And I'm not sure, but I think that one of his main ideas for fighting the war is to let Voldemort and Dumbledore fight it out before taking over.

It's also Voldemort/Harry slash.

*** Hmm I don't think the fic I'm searching for was a Harry/Daphne Greengrass pairing. I might read this one anyway though. Thanks for the effort.
