** Not a fic rec (since it doesn't exist) but your post reminds me of a note by a fic author I was reading, where they were playing with the idea of Sherlock dying and being reincarnated as Harry - but within the lifetimes of the others, so John Watson, Mycroft, etc. are still alive. And that Hermione Emma Watson Granger was Harry Watson's child and the cousin of John Watson's child.
