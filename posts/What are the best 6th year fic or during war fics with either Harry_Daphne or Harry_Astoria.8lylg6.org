I've read a lot of those types, but recently I'm stuck without anything new that catches my eye to read. I've started re-reading fics from boredom. And I'm losing my hands (carpal tunnel) to Fortnite and I just wanna relax and read something new and interesting. Preferably fluffy and romantic.


** linkffn(the grass is always greener; living dangerously by cgph)

These stories are both sickening fluff. The second one is set in some sort of weird blend between fifth and sixth year.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

  An accident during potions class forces Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass to work together for a detention. One thing leads to many others, and a sordid romance is born.

*** You know, I couldn't get past the first few chapters (can't remember which one exactly) where there's this argument with Hermione and Harry. It just seemed... tropy ? is that a word ? IDK, wasn't my cup of tea, but maybe something has changed in my perspective since then.

And I am really bored right now anyways, so if this is really good, it might just amuse me for a while. Thanks.

**** Well because I hate Hermione it was really easy to bear their arguments but a friend of mine who doesn't hate her much also liked this fic. Just try to bear though the first chapters, I think you will like it :p

***** I also somewhat hate Hermione as she is in canon, but it wasn't exactly that, it just felt... IDK, forced ? But yeah, perhaps i'll enjoy it if I stick through it.
