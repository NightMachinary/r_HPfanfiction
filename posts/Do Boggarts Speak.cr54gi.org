I know this is a stupid question, but a pivotal point in one of my future fics is an AU where one of the character's boggarts turns out to be his parents and they have an argument with it. It could be one sided, but it would be nice to double check. I didn't see anything on the lexicon


** They do. From PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.

  ‘Hermione!' said Lupin, startled. ‘What's the matter?'

  ‘P-P-Professor McGonagall!' Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. ‘Sh-she said I'd failed everything!'

  It took a little while to calm Hermione down.

*** My headcanon is that they can't /converse/, but they can imitate the sounds that their victims find most terrifying --- those words from McGonagall, in Hermione's case.

** They may be capable of mimicking speech, if the fear they're representing demands it. For example, a lot of people here have mentioned Hermione's Boggart in the third year exam. That Boggart turns into Professor McGonagall. However, Hermione isn't afraid of McGonagall as such. What she fears is *being told she isn't good enough* - the fear specifically works because of what McBoggart is saying. No speech means no fear.

So, what does your character REALLY fear? His parents?

Or something his parents might say?

** Hermione's boggart in 3rd year was mcgonagall telling her she failed all her classes, so that implies they can speak. That doesnt necessarily mean theyre intelligent enough to have a conversation though, it could just be like a puppet with a few set phrases.

** Boggarts are like parrots if they could read minds (copyrighted). My guess is they can only imitate what the victim thinks could be said or has previously heard. Fear is about possibilities, not absolutes.

** No official example of them speaking to my knowledge, so up to you. Worth noting that Boggarts are considered Non-Beings alongside things like Poltergeists and Dementors, both of which we know from canon are capable of speech.

*** How do we know dementors are capable of speech?

As far as I remember the only "speech" is the horrible memories they make you hear.

**** I believe in Prisoner of Azkaban Fudge says that he or someone was able to question them about Sirius' behaviour leading up to his escape.

How exactly they communicated is never explained.
