Could someone link me a time travel fic where Harry goes back to his parents time and retains his same physical age, More specifically, I want him being at least somewhere in the range of his parents and have Lily accidentally develop a crush on him only for him to be mortified because it's his fucking mom. I'm fine with tension/slight romantic elements but straight up incest is a no go for me for obvious reasons, even if they're from different timelines. I just feel like something like that would be funny as shit to read because of how awkward Harry would feel in those situations. This is more or less a Harry Potter version of back to the future, but I don't mind if it strays from the basic idea as long as it has the whole Harry goes back to when his parents are in school + Lily having a crush on him.


** Yes, yes... someone please link the incest one's so we know from what stay away... Don't miss even one! We must prevent accidentally reading them!

** linkffn(Delenda Est) I think Lily has a minor crush on harry. I think they make a joke out of her thinking he's attractive in A Black Comedy as well. But I could be wrong

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** I read this fic with HP and HG messing up the travel in 3rd year, ending up in the Marauder era. At one point, Lily asked him out, mortifying him and him fleeing. It didn't get anywhere, allthough I found the situation rather amusing. Don't remember what the fic was called.
