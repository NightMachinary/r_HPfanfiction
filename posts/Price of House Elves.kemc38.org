How much does it cost to buy one house elf? I know that most just tend to the house but surely there are some trained to read and write, so they would be more expensive.


** It's funny because in a lot of cases the cost is zero... they're inherited so even an impoverished family could have one if its an old family. I wonder if their value would be related to skill-- wizards wouldn't often bother to train them, but some could probably cook better, some could clean better, some could interact better with wizards (Kreacher appealed himself more to the Blacks than Dobby did to the Malfoys, for example) so if that accounts it could change the price. I read a fic where Narcissa was annoyed that someone had killed an elf bc they were hard to find rather than their cost... so I wonder if they're something of an endangered breed too?

*** That is an interesting concept. If they were endangered then what would happen if someone tried to make them more numerous? How would the wizards react and is the service agreement/contract only there so they don't die off?

** It seems that house elves are only really owned by old wealthy families. And even they only have one or maybe 2, in canon anyway. So I'd think that they are an equivalent price to something that's only really affordable to extremely wealthy people unless it's been passed down from previous generations. I've always thought of them as around 2-5 million galleons, which converts to 10-25 million USD. Expensive enough that very wealthy people can afford one, but wouldn't want to have more than one unless they really needed it. Also expensive enough for Lucius Malfoy to get upset about losing Dobby, but not bankrupt him.
