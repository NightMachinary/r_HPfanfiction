Is Voldemort as insane in canon as he is often portrayed in fanfiction?

I vaguely remember him torturing his own followers in canon but I don't know if that's fanon affecting my recollection of canon. Help pls!


** Fanfic tends to portray him as a weak sociopath who insanely goes on a warpath.

Canon sets him as a psychopath who punishes failure, with control over his emotions weakened by Horcruxes.

*** Oh good! That's what I thought, as I have this theory about horcruxes actually negatively affecting the sanity of the wizard using them. Hence the other wizards who only created one horcrux. What do u think?

**** That's the general consensus for them, I think. Another is that no other wizard has done it because other dark lords aren't batshit insane enough to fuck around with their soul like it's a piece of scratch paper.

***** ... welp. thats one way of putting it. I would also like to state that Voldemort was only crazy when Harry was involved in canon. It has been stated that Voldemort was winning the First War. He wasnt insane then. I think that its more likely that he became fixated on killing Harry, more than anything else. so... he just had a murderous form of fanboy syndrome if you wanna think of it like that.

******* He conceptualised Harry, the Chosen One, prophesized to defeat him, famed for his downfall who evaded him multiple times and who he insists on killing himself, as the ultimate obstacle to domination, in addition to Dumbledore. He was definitely obsessed with him.

**** Another one that not many people mention even though it makes complete sense and doesn't even need a real fab theory.

Voldemort spent thirteen years as something less than a gosh. Thirteen years alone, unable to interact with anything besides for snakes and two crazy followers. For like ten years of that time, only snakes.

That's long enough to turn anyone insane.

** Voldemort is definitely insane in canon. The question is how insane, and was he insane before his resurrection?

*** I think Voldemort was insane long before he even heard of Horcruxes. The Heir of Slytherin business in his sixth(fifth?) year shows that clearly - there was absolutely no point to that.

That said, I don't think he treated his followers half as bad during the first war (and his school years) as he did after his resurrection. He basically felt they betrayed him and were indebted to him, so Crucioing and humiliating them became a nice pastime of his.

**** The heir of Slytherin can be justified I think. If you consider young Tom Riddle, mudblood in Slytherin, needing to put on a display of power. If we assume that house is as bigoted and hostile as canon portrays than Tom can't have been a happy student. He finds out he isn't actually a muggleborn, but people won't just believe it because he says it so he does something big and petrifies some students. Then Myrtle gets killed accidentally and Hogwarts almost closes.

***** That plan is heavily flawed though. Dumbledore knows he's a Parselmouth so he immediately suspects him. If Riddle wanted to show his housemates that he's the true heir of Slytherin, then that can easily backfire if someone were to investigate the Slytherins and one of them broke and told the truth.

The entire heir of Slytherin business reads like Riddle has great-great-granddaddy issues. He doesn't like his real family, so he leans on his ancestor and the legends associated with him, and continues his "noble work" in order to make his great-great-granddaddy proud. It's a huge risk for very little, if any, gain.

He definitely does. Really just try to imagine what young Tom Riddle went through. Don't imagine a young psychopath just a kid who grew up in a shitty orphanage then gets pulled into a wonderful fantasy land to start over. Basically the same story as Harry Potter. Except Tom then goes into Slytherin where he would not be accepted because of his heritage(or lack thereof). The wonderful new world he finds himself in isn't the happy place he imagines, he'd be called a mudblood, and I don't think its a stretch to say he became fixated on his ancestry.

I'm big on nurture over nature. Tom Riddle was made into Voldemort, not born that way. It started in an orphanage, and continued in the magical world. Think about his first contact with wizards. Dumbledore comes into his room and sets all his things on fire. This is an orphan, he doesn't have much and Dumbledore just waves a wand and its burning. Life at the orphanage is all about power, Tom has power over others with his abilities, then Dumbledore shows up and demonstrates how powerless Tom really is.

*** The issue I have with this is that I just can't see how Tom Riddle (known to be charming and devious and manipulative and so very smart) who, according to Dumbledore himself, was one of the most talented students to ever pass through Hogwarts, could have believed in prophecy. The issue here for me is that you have this guy who's smart and can say people. He had to have been a good orator to inspire such fanaticism in his death eaters, and he was apparently very powerful magically. So he had to have been a well read guy I think.

So why does this guy believe in prophecy? I mean, come on, he's on the verge of taking over wizarding Britain and then suddenly he starts chasing after a baby???

Hence my theory: Tom Riddle was dangerous (slightly insane since he did try to take over the world of course) but not as insane as we see him in canon. But once he heard the prophecy, perhaps due to the influence it had on him (assuming that prophecies can exert external influences of their own) he was (for some inexplicable reason) affected by it and tried to defeat his "nemesis." his body was destroyed and he spent a decade as a bodiless wraith surviving by possessing animals (which he mentions during his resurrection in Book 4). This is when he went mad and lost whatever sanity he had left, exacerbated by him slitting his soul into 7 pieces (and then 8 after he made nagini).

This of course brings in to question the power of prophecy in Harry Potter. The very act of conquering Britain shows that Tom Riddle had no interest in fate or anything like that. He says (I think) that "there is no good or evil, only power." So why would he believe in prophecy? Why couldn't he have ignored it? This means that the splitting of his soul was beginning to affect him or the prophecy had it's own influence, where, if it is heard by one of the people involved, it will affect them.

This of course brings in the question of whether the splitting of a should affects the mental capabilities of the person, something that JKR doesn't address, I don't think. Or it could be that no one thought to give the man a copy of Oedipus Rex. Seriously, can you imagine this:

Voldemort going, "time to kill my nemesis and defeat this prophecy"\\
"My lord, have you ever heard of a play called Oedipus Rex?" Interrupts Death Eater no. 6, concerned for his master.\\
"Of course I have! What're you talking about? of course I've read that book!" Voldemort raises his wand threateningly.\\
"No..nothing never mind..it's ok," says Death Eater no. 6. "...filthy half-blood," he mutters, "he's clearly never heard about a "self fulfilling prophecy""\\
"Did you just call me filthy?" whispers Voldemort "DIE! Avada Kedavra!"\\
And that's how the Dark Lord Voldemort sealed his fate.

**** Prophesy is real though. We know its real even if it isn't a fool proof thing. There is no reason Voldemort wouldn't seek to kill any sons of his enemies that were born at the end of July. To someone without morals it is the logical thing to do.

I think after that night Voldemort was just hellbent on getting Harry, the prophesy never mattered too much anymore except to know how Harry survived. If Voldemort heard the prophesy and it wasn't what he thought and killing Harry wasn't necessary, Voldemort would still seek to do so because of the trouble that Harry caused him.

***** I'm not questioning what he does after 1981, but rather why he believes in prophecy in the first place. Yes, as you say, it is real, but as it's mentioned in OotP, there are many prophecies in the DoM that have gone unfulfilled. Hence my frustration as to why Voldemort would let such a thing affect him.

******* I thought that the whole prophecy thing depended on belief. Take oedipus for instance. His father hears that his son is going to kill him form a prophet name Tiresias. He then takes this infant and has a servant take him out to kill him by exposing him to the elements. The servant takes pity on the boy and many years later, Oedipus, raised by other people, is traveling close to the city and (spoiler alert) unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother. So the whole thing could have been avoided if the king had simply treated his son well (as we find out, Oedipus is a good man which is why his story is tragic).

Thus, the prophecy was kicked off by the king hearing it. And by trying to "[eliminate] a lose end"/ kill a potential rival, the king sets himself up for death by the his son's hands. Does this scenario sound familiar? It does? Hmm... I wonder why...

*** Tbh I think the resurrection played a part, but not that it affected his sanity directly. I think he rather justifiably thought he was invincible, because he very nearly actually was.

** No. In fanfiction it goes way over the board, the mad cackling, torturing and killing - at least in my opinion. On the other hand, yes, he was still insane in the books. But as Servalpur mentioned, he was living ( or rather un-living) as a ghost for thirteen years. Very few individuals have such a resilience to go on and on, to survive in such conditions and even fewer can achieve it while remaining sane. One has to admit, he had an admirable willpower. People often forget few other things: for Voldemort, already immortal at that time, powerful beyond imagination (for god's sake he could fly without support!), the idea of a child destroying him, the sheer audacity of it was laughable even unbearable. So what does he do? He gets angry and plans to kill the child, just for the sake of it. Unfortunately for him, it all goes horribly wrong and so for the next decade he lives like ghost and the principal thing sustaining him is hate. He hates the child, hates his followers for leaving him alone, for believing this kid killed him, shortly, he hates everybody. Then, when finally, he is resurrected (that feat alone is unheard of) and anxiously meets his conqueror, lo! our dear Harry awaits him with his dirty clothes, unruly hair, broken spectacles and mediocre power (mind you, mediocre in comparison to his). I would be livid. So was he. And we all know what happens next... it comes as no surprise Voldy is obsessed with killing Harry.
