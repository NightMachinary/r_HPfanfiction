** /Goblet/ of fire. Because seriously.

That said, is there any specific genre you are interested in? Because there's a lot of post-GoF fanfics, and enough that are considered good, but they vary greatly in genres and in how dark (or not dark) they are. For example, you have “Renegade Cause” which is definitely dark, and on the other hand you have “Realizations” which is all things considered fairly light-hearted.

*** Oh, I had just finished the rereading of the book and was really sleepy, so didn't realize I spelled it wrong. Anyways, I know that's a lot a of "post Goblet of Fire" fics out there, but as said, I want the good ones that follows the events of the ending of the book. Being a little more specific, I wish to read fics that maintain the dark tone of the final chapters of the book and I don't care if its slash or not, I just want the best ones or I don't know, more popular (in the criteria "following the dark tone and the events of the last book). If possible, fics involving politics, Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry would be much appreciated.

**** In that case I second my recommendation of “Renegade Cause” (linkffn(4714715)). It is somewhat AU because the author had their own vision of how things would go, and it has some OCs, many of whom are interesting if not necessarily likeable, but it is appropriately grim, it does have a coherent plot, it is focused on the ministry to an appropriate degree (if not necessarily on Fudge).

Outside of that, well ... let me check my list, for the only thing I remember off-handedly that starts at the end of fourth year and is not light-hearted is a Robst story which means it started out dark and then went derp (I don't really recommend trying to find it).

Well, I have “To Reach Without” on my list and it is something that begins after the fourth year is over, but it is highly AU and whilst the world of the story is one that has some darkness which you can definitely see and it's clear enough during the story that not everything is sunshine and roses for Harry, I think it counts more as a “niche” thing than a genuinely “dark” think, the darkness just isn't suffocating enough for me to count it as such. If you want an example of something I consider dark, then “you will bleed to death with the pain of it” by LullabyKnell is a good example, though I am not linking it because it's not a post-GoF fic so it doesn't fulfil the requirements; it definitely does have that suffocating darkness of a certain kind, even if it has some hope within too, so I am noting in case you want to go down that rabbit hole.

And ... having gone throught everything I have bookmarked for liking it, I have to say that I don't really have anything else that would begin after the fourth year and be /dark/. I have enough light-hearted ones, be them adventure or comedy or even parody, and some darker ones that begin at different points, but nothing else you asked for really. So that's one, maybe two depending on your liking of AU niche things, from me as far as this request is concerned. But hey, I can say I tried.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

****** Hm, that's not exactly what I'm looking for, but I'll check that out. I'm part of some niche stuff (slash etc.), but by now that's not what I'm searching. What I want is dark in a more political way and not just "blood and violence". I think I may find fics like this with plots involving the Ministry and dark times (AU or not/OC or not, if it's good, I don't care), but not exactly after the events of the fourth book. By any means, thank you for taking the time to have some kind of a stream of consciousness commenting the stuff you're more familiar about (in the criteria) (:

** There's a number of post-Goblet of Fire stories. You'll have to be more specific in your criteria, as there's thousands of stories of an innumerable number of genres that are post-Goblet of Fire.

*** Based on their reply to my comment, they want dark (at least somewhat) stuff, possibly with some focus on the ministry. If you have anything you know would be good for that then please post some since I don't really have a lot of stuff that fits.
