Hey all, so we all know that Rowling dropped the ball when Harry fought the dragon, instead of some awesome magic sequence, Harry rides around on his broom and gets the egg mostly by luck.

I'm wondering, what are your favorite Harry beats the dragon moments. Is it a Harry who is overpowered and a magical prodigy, or is it a cunning and sneaky way of getting past. Maybe even a Harry who talks to the dragon.

Please leave a link or the title of the story.

My favorite is Harry dropping the Hogwarts Express loaded with explosives on top of the dragon in blood stained by flameraiser.

Peace, JJ

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** I think with the exception of Fleur, Harry's plan was the best among the four champions.

Harry is prodigiously skilled on a broomstick and flying as he does, he gets an extreme advantage in both speed and maneuverability. That would be true for any skilled flier. He kept himself at a safe distance while still seeming threatening to the mother dragon and eventually annoyed her enough to draw her away from the nest, and then used his superior speed to get around her and grab the egg.

It was a simple but effective plan and is reflective of his skills as a fourth year student. The biggest drawback was that he had no secondary plan if the dragon had decided to hunker down on her nest.

*** I'll admit. Haven't read the book in more than a few years. Is the book version any different from the movie version?

I just think that in a competition that emphasizes creativity in solving tasks with magic and having the proper skill to use that magic; that using a broom is kinda......i don't want to say unimaginative.... but that's what I'll go with.

Now that's not to say I don't agree with the points you brought up. Tactically speaking, very good plan, if a little dangerous in execution as he's flying away from a fire breathing dragon on a wooden broom. Admittedly Harry is an amazing flier, and I don't believe in any scenario where he'd lose to a big, slow, and less maneuverable oppenent like a dragon. Harry (on broom) vs Dragon = Harry win.

I just think it could have been done a different way. More magic, more charms or spells or transfiguration or DADA.

Just disappointed in the movie I guess. Which I'm basing my reply off of.

Edit: Just had my brain fart wafted in front of my face (thank you kind sir). BROOMS ARE ENCHANTED!! How the bloody heckling heck did I forget that. Thanks to ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ this guy for reminding me that broom makers probably thought of enchanting the brooms against fire.

Very different. In the books, the dragon is protecting her own eggs as well as the golden egg, it is not waiting next to the entrance for Harry, there's no chase through the grounds and the dragon is neither dead not injured. Harry's broom is not damaged. And the moment the dragon abandons the nest to chase Harry, Harry dodges her and grabs the egg. He does suffer a shallow gash from a tail spike across his back initially but he's the fastest among the four champions to complete the task.

#+end_quote

I think not. The enchanted broomstick is not likely to be any more flammable than Harry himself. Any lick of dragon flame that comes close enough to burn the broom is going to give Harry second degree burns at least, which is /less likely/ to happen on a fast broom.

I agree. It's what I meant about the secondary plan; something to distract, draw away or incapacitate the dragon if using himself as bait (risky!!) fails. But in the books, Harry barely managed to learn the summoning charm (to get his broom) in time for the Task.

This is something to explore in time travel stories, where a more skilled Harry from the future is attempting the Task. But usually it also involves the author dissing the canon attempt.

I completely agree. But that's movie's pandering to the Rule of Cool.

** I forgot the fic, but Harry used portkeys. First, he took out a slingshot. Next, he shot a portkey-rock into a pile of dragon crap which portkeyed on top of Draco. Then, he shot the golden egg and left.

Then this one here is my favorite of all. Triwizard Tales, linkffn(7594305)

He bribes his way through the tournament. Dragons? Here, have some gold, cattle and booze. Merpeople? Here, a pallet of peanut butter. Forgot what he did for the maze though. Crack.

** My favourite is undoubtedly from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb][Weeb]].

Harry dumps a shit-ton of liquid nitrogen on the dragon and then claims it to be his "ancestral dragon-slaying magic". Your mileage may vary on how powerful you imagine a dragon to be, but I find it to be the most interesting method out of all that I have read.
