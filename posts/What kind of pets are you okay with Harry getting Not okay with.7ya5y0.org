**** Well, stories with snake as a pet usually quickly fall into one of two options:

- I don't have any friends other than you, Hissy. Oh woe is me.
- I'm cool and badass and to show that I will threaten everybody with my snake.

Still dropping a story that you actually enjoyed only because of snake seems rather stupid.

***** While I've never written them down I'm certain I have more than 20. A pet snake is probably among them. Partly because they never have a terrarium, the snake is just an accessory to wear that bogs down the story. And presumably pisses and shits all over Harry every day.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

****** I gave one of my Harry's a snake and I quickly realised that Harry having a pet that I didn't really understand was poor form. I slowly cut the snake out and now she pops up every now and then to simply let the readers know that she hasn't died. Sadly, she is a major plot point and I can't just kill the snake and be done with it.

Why didn't I just give him a cute little kitten? :(

** Snakes are cool pets for Harry

Owls are fine, especially Hedwig

I honestly am indifferent if Hedwig becomes a phoenix

Now, a toad is fine for Neville, but Harry, the Boy-Who-Will-Not-Die simply cannot have a toad

If it's something utterly ridiculous like a monkey or zebra, then we definitely have a problem

*** It's midnight when I'm typing this, so naturally every idea I'm having seems hilarious. Considering making Hedwig be a Phoenix that finds Harry in my HP fic (Harry ran away in this). Now to spoil it, he initially thought his accidental magic incidents were just non-magic superpowers, so he started off consulting comic books to figure it all out. X-Men comics helped when his Metamorphmagus powers cropped up.

But the silly bit is I'm considering having him go on a stint of being a superhero, the BusinessMan (his main metamorph is an adult in a business suit, so why not?) Hedwig as his white phoenix sidekick. Maybe make Hedwig a anifamiliar(?) Can turn into a snake to annoy people who hate reading about Harry having a snake, lol.

A bit redundant since the first magic he mastered was Apparition. Oh well, this will either make everyone laugh or leave. 50% chance~

*** But dogs in HW would probably be able to spent their entire days in the Forbidden Forest. Just like a dog would love their life to be. Come to think of it, Dog would probably have the best life ever even if Harry doesn't visit to pet him every now and then. (Well... maybe give him some wolf genes so he doesn't get eaten XD)

** I like seeing Harry with Dogs, Cats, Snakes and Hedwig. Other than that post canon I can see Fawkes latching on to Harry and that's it. Few do exotic pets well. Often Snakes are fun as they can be used in Interesting ways like as says or in potions. Owls should either be Hedwig or a anti Hedwig if Hed is the WBWL/RBWL's owl. But Hedwig is preferred

** OK with: A dog, a phoenix, a snake, a basilisk (if you're killing horcruxes, a basilisk will supply venom and they're supposedly very easy for a parselmouth to raise and control). Harry's Christmas cracker mice if he ends up getting to keep them. Anything else where the circumstances of the fic make it make sense.

Not OK with: a spider, because Harry was utterly indifferent to the spiders in his cupboard. If he was inclined to make a pet of them, then it would be canon. He never showed much interest in Lee Jordan's tarantula either, beyond noticing it on the platform.

A dragon because they are not friendly at all and if they spoke parseltongue, Harry would have been chatty with Norberta in canon.

A unicorn because those, too, don't seem to like humanity much at all. They're far too skittish to be a pet, though he could maybe visit a particular one in a grove or help Hagrid with one.
