So, I'm looking for fics that have harry or any other main character as a reincarnation of someone or something else from any fandom . I'd be very happy if you could find me some Akatsuki!Harry though cuz I can't help myself but to think how awesome Kisame!Harry or Sasori!Harry would be. Anyways, thanks a lot!


** Not exactly reincarnation per se, but linkffn(7648998) is brilliant (although unfinished).

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

**** Not at all! I confess that I haven't watched Naruto before, and stumbled upon this fic purely by accident, but it's easy enough to understand if you're fandom blind.

  Harriet Potter knew she shouldn't have picked those three Hallows... but she did, and now, she's immortal, and the gods have a proposition for her : help the heroes of other universe to save her mother's soul. And to help her, they'll give her a tool : the Gamer's Ability. First stop : the Mafia World. fem!Harry, MoD!Harry, gamer!Harry

** It's the other way around reincarnation world-wise, but this might be worth a look if you have not seen it before: linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romantiscue). Very nicely written, if incomplete.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

  His first remembered thought was "Harry? How dull." Reincarnation story. Harry Potter is nothing like what the wizarding world thought he would be. Manipulative!Dumbledore. False Prophecy. Johnlock. Severitus. Now starting second year, my take on the Chamber of Secrets.
