There was this really long fic I read a while ago that I can't find

Memorable details:

- Harry stays with the dursleys and is super good and mind magic. The dursleys move all over the place including Switzerland and Japan -Harry learns martial arts from a Japanese samurai and can grow 4 arms
- he is in a relationship with Tracey Davis (?)
- there's a point in which he like duplicates himself in a computer and that makes a second Harry Potter running around (there was like an Easter egg where the second Harry Potter helped start magic the gathering????)

Hopefully that's enough info to go off. Any help would be appreciated


** I don't remember the last point, but the first two made me think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]]. It has been so long since I've read this, so I hope this is the one you're looking for. linkffn(2428341)

Also, shouldn't the flair be 'Fic Search'?

  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.
