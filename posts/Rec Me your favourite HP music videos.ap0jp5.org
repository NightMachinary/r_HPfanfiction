Few things in life make me happier than a great fan music video. I mean, for the most part these things are just a visual medium for a fanfiction, and I love that.

The ability to cut the video to timings really well - especially in an action video - is super uplifting, and a well-matched song for a concept or a pairing can make me quite emotional. That's what I think I look for most - that emotional connection. If your videos can make me feel something I'm done.

So please link me to the best ones you know of, whether they be canon tribute, character appreciation, shipping or story videos.

Some of my established favourites are linked below:

Tribute video largely on the culmination of the story of Deathly Hallows [[https://youtu.be/Bm581j_-9mc]]

Goblet of Fire tribute, with some great timings [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o-UT0BxHhMU&list=FLlO_ZcIPv-E1LbVWyOUDecg&t=0s&index=120]]

Another war tribute: [[https://youtu.be/DFBzZfxkWUg]]

This one gets a special mention. It is an almost entirely instrumental MV, a quidditch tribute using footage from only the first two movies. It's been on the internet forever and doesn't use any fancy effects. The song also has a long-ass intro (about a minute and a half), but once it gets going, it's just got really solid timings and gets you really into the exhilaration of flying and the high speed danger of the game.

** I do not have a favorite Harry Potter music video because I have not seen one before. :(

*** That is a crying shame, because it is a beautiful medium to express one's love of Harry Potter. Hopefully you'll enjoy some of the ones I've linked.

** I think this one as an aesthetic tribute to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2RZMaFMfFc][Slytherin House]]. Length - 1:46.

It has a lot of non-HP movie footage mixed in with movie stuff, but I think it does a good job of establishing mood and themes in under two minutes.

*** Hey thanks! Nice contribution. Personally I encourage the use of footage not directly from the movies, as it gives you much more versatility to paint a picture. When trying to create moods or portray characters who don't get much screen time, or even show footage of the cast actors in other roles to expand the character's story. This video makes great use of the motifs of water and knife imagery, and the overall "sexy, mysterious and dangerous" feel that Slytherin is so well known for. I like it.

** [[https://youtu.be/u0K-cHESi1c][Beauty and Lord Voldemort]]

With Emma Watson in the new Beauty and the Beast, there had to be a slightly edited version of the movie trailer with Voldemort as the beast.

*** "Show me the smile" Bahahahaha!

That was brilliant! I freaking love the concept, and a great segue from Hermione to Belle.

*** I particularly enjoyed Open at the Close, didn't realise til halfway through it was a Wrock song :)

The last one was also beautiful, particularly the comparative scene of Hagrid carrying baby Harry to the Dursleys, then finally carrying Harry's body back to the castle.

*** Haha wow. There really are loads of Harmony screen moments throughout the movies aren't there? I have no issue with Harmony, but have preferred ships for both characters, but I have to laud this creator. Brilliant editing of still shots and great effects to juxtapose Ron and Harry. Thanks for the rec!

**** I agree! They did a great job! Nice rotoscoping and I like the snow effect. A little too many zooms in the back end, but really well put together.
