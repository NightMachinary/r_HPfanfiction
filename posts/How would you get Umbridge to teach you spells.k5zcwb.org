Harry had a chance to convince Umbridge to teach them some spells when she asked him why they would need to learn how to cast spells. Since his approach didn't work I would like to know your attempts.

I would have used Sirius Black as an example I mean he officially tried to kill Harry in his 3rd year

While that would have worked better than using Voldemort as an example, her response would have just been to let the aurors handle him.

A better argument would be "What if I want to be an auror?" But her response would probably be that learning theory is enough to be able to cast the spells when you need to, and auror training will teach you what you need to know anyway.

Personally, I'd try to appeal to her bigotry. 'If theory is all that's important, why don't we teach magic to muggles?" I'm sure it wouldn't work as an argument, but it would make her angry and at least be amusing.

This, but more hardcore.

** "Do you expect to be attacked in this classroom?"

"Wouldn't be the first time ma'am. Every Defense Professor I've had so far has tried to kill me. The werewolf was the scariest though. Can you imagine ma'am, being forced to sit in the same room as a werewolf for nine months? And he's still out there somewhere. Dumbledore fired him, but he's still out there somewhere. Probably went back to Fenrir Greyback to tell him which of us students they should turn. I dont want to become a werewolf ma'am, won't you please teach us the spells we need to put down such dangerous beasts?"

** Bulldoze her with flattery. Don't give her a chance to come up with objections, just keep talking like:

"Oh, but of course only the best Purebloods know that practice makes perfect, right? Bloody Muggles stole that phrase from the Tarpentines down in Chiswick, such a Noble Family, ruined by Muggles. But we know better now, don't we - of course you agree, you're an upstanding Pureblood witch - and we really do need to use this gift of ours like good Purebloods, we're so much better than the Muggles like that with their insert racist bigotry here and their other discriminatory things too! They'd never understand how to get truly great at Magic! Even the Minister uses his power regularly, potent pureblood that he is," and so on and so forth until she starts nodding along.

** I don't think any argument could have convinced her. Because Umbridge never intended to teach them anything in the first place. She came to Hogwarts to dig dirt on both Harry and Dumbledore, in the intent to silence them (and if possible arrest them). Had she been confronted by good arguments (such as the fact that Sirius Black was still roaming free), she would have either lied through her teeth or used her authority to end the conversation. Harry would have still ended up not learning anything, and would probably still have gotten a detention (Umbridge was targeting him, and she is the kind of person who write "disagreement" as "disrespect").

That being said, it is a fact that Harry was just terrible during this scene, and acted exactly as Umbridge wanted him to. While Umbrige couldn't be convinced, he had his whole class as witnesses, and most of them were on the fence concerning his claims. It would have been hard to convince them that Voldemort was back without proof, but a good performance could have helped convincing them he was not crazy.\\
Using the previous DADA teacher as an argument is probably a bad idea. Most of what happened with them is "confidential" (most don't know about Quirrellmort, or Fraud Lockart), and it's something that can be used against Dumbledore anyways (a "proof" that he is terrible when hiring teachers). The fact that Sirius Black is still free, and have already managed to enter the school and escape before the arrival of the Aurors is probably the best argument. He is officially a menace, has a know interest for the school, and even the Ministry can't deny that he managed to escape the Aurors several time.
