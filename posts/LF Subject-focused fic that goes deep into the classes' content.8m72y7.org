The thing that makes me the saddest about the books is how little importance the classes themselves have. I always thought I'd be extremely interested in the content of the classes if I'd been in the characters' place.

That's why I found fics like "The Arithmancer", "Runemaster" or "The Pureblood Pretense" really interesting, as they went pretty deep into a class's subject.

I don't have a preference as to which subject (even ones that aren't really big in the books like Alchemy), who's the MC or whether or not they excel at this class; I'd just love to see them work at it and read their stream of thought as they comprehend the subject.

Thank you very much!
