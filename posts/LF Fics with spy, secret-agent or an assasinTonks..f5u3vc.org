She's a metamorphmagus and as such is suited for espionage (or assasination of high profile Death-Eaters in case they take over like Aunt Bella) which the Order of the Phoenix could have utilized ( Instead of crushing on a werewolf with low self-esteem) to boost morale .


** Not exactly ehat you're looking for per your description, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) has Tonks (and Harry) becoming Unspeakables. Basically they act as the magical equivalent to the CIA/FBI/MI6, doing missions to bring down the Death Eaters. Tropes include Indy!Harry, Friendly!Goblins, and semi-manipulative!Dumbledore. Dumbledore and Harry work things out towards the end, and even though Harry can be a shit he mellows out more when he starts working with Dumbledore rather than against him. He's also more powerful, but still struggles against people like Voldemort and Bellatrix.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** The only one of these I really know is Summer of Change by lordwar. In case you haven't read it, be warned - it's an early one and feels quite cliche at times, and it also features an Han Solo/Indiana-Jones-esque semi-rapey relationship between Tonks and Harry (has a very 'You like me because I'm a scoundrel' sort of feel to it). I just skim those bits until they get back to the secret agent-ing again.
