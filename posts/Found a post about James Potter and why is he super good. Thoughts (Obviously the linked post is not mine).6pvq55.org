  Snape was a dick. A horrible person, who apparently, in the end, did the right thing. He is still a horrible person. So is James.He started to bully Snape, just because Snape disliked the idea of going to Grifindor. We have seen how terrible James's bullying was. There are even theories that that is the reason Snape went dark. Plus you know, Sirius thought it would be funny if they tried to kill Snape using a werewolf. No wonder he turned out like that. I am not excusing Snape's behavior, I am merely stating, that neither Snape, nor James, nor Sirius was in fact, the Holy good guys. Their actions are inexcusable.

I think this comment (which is mine) perfectly summarizses James/Sirius/Snape goodness/character.

**** I can definitely agree with that.

I can't remember where I read it, but a possible explanation for extreme bullying by children is because children are by nature possibly sociopathic, but given that an accurate medical diagnosis can't be made until the individual is eighteen years old, experts aren't exactly sure about it. They do not understand the consequences of what they are doing, and thus are not accountable for their actions, given the fact little proper thought was put into the action - the action merely being the product of the child's anger or lack of regard for their victim(s).

Don't quote me or hold me to that, though. I could be remembering it incorrectly.

******* The "Educationalists" believed that children were born as "blank slates", beginning their lives morally neutral. From this point of view, infants were neither inherently good or inherently evil. A child's nature and personality would develop over childhood, a period of time during which the educationalists believed a child was particularly impressionable. Adults surrounding a child could potentially have a very lasting effect on his personality.

******** So essentially a glorified and partially ridiculous description of "nature versus nurture", then.

I personally disagree to a degree. Some people are born with inherent deficiencies in their brain that may cause a higher risk of conditions such as bi-polar and psychopathy. Other (individual) effects of these harmful mutations can include a lack of empathy, lack of remorse, cruelty towards other people, hurting or killing animals, an inflated sense of self worth to cover for their hidden deficiencies), a fake "persona" put up around other individuals, being manipulative, prone to pathological lying, mental and emotional shallowness, lack of ability to hold attention or interests(ex - jumpy, can not be in a marriage for long), and too many behavior problems to further list.

In essence, that theory is likely bullshit, given that the already damaged brain of a future psychopath is impossible to repair right now.

However, I do believe that theory is correct when referencing neuro-typical people. A damaged brain limits influence that does not fall within the damaged range of emotions from the person with that damaged brain.

***** I wouldn't say that kids are sociopathic by nature. I've never heard that theory, although it does sound a little bit of a mix between religion (children are immoral until they are "saved") and something Freud would have concocted. The leading theory that is driving practice right now is eclectic (take the best from all the theories) as well as the biological-sociological theories (brain chemistry and environment, aka "nature vs nurture"). Hell, I would throw in peer pressure for bullying specifically. Kids can be vicious to each other.

You learn about the older theories in intro classes and such, but that was the last time they were discussed. Here are some other interesting tidbits about adolescence:

The prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain that makes decisions and such) is not fully develop until you're 25ish or so. The biggest impact that we see is on decision and planning. So while a kiddo might be super smart, they might not have the foresight to plan for events long down the road. Throw in the chemical cocktail that is puberty, and...well, you know. I had a professor in college that liked to say the prefrontal cortex is just turned off, ages 11-16. Adolescents are also prone to what is called egotistical thinking (EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME).

We don't really know why some people can go through shitty circumstances and come out fine while others completely bomb. It's called resiliency - if you wanted to look up some studies. You're right though. We don't give extreme diagnoses to kids younger than 18 because there are such extreme implications on something that is so imprecise.

****** My statement had no religious influence at all, I've been an atheist since I could consciously make the choice. I haven't read anything of Freud's other than that on psychoanalysis, which has no bearing at the moment.

What I've heard, read, and believe is, for the most part, similar to what you said. I stated that many kids are possibly sociopathic because, when they are angry with each other, they haven't learned that there is in fact, a line that can be crossed when it comes to getting back at their "attacker". The thought of their thoughts and feelings can be forgotten in a lust to get back at him/her. Hence why kids can be cruel bullies or do extremely embarrassing thing in that pursuit of revenge. When I was younger, I was bullied rather severely. The people bullying me /did not/ care about my feelings. Whether it is because they didn't know better, or are truly sociopathic, can't be said, because they are children. Children are unpredictable, irrational, and are still on the road to growing up. You just can't diagnose a kid with something purely off a behavior, hence why I preceded my earlier statement with /possibly/. It's not certain.

#+end_quote

So apparently Snape is redeemed for his sacrifice but James who also sacrificed himself in a more meaningful way, who had not cast a single Jinx towards anybody other than Death Eaters since his Seventh Year of Hogwarts, who did not attempt to make Neville's toad die, who did not instill such fear into the poor boy that Neville feared him worse than death itself. Yeah, what an asshole right? This post is spot on about taking a single anecdote, despite Remus himself saying that Snape fought back plenty of times, and using it as a basis for someone's whole personality.

******* James wasn't shown to be bullied like Snape was though, so it's more understandable why Snape was so hung on the past. James changed, but he had no excuse for being horrible in the past either. The damage he did to Snape remains, just as the damage Snape did to the Potters and the students of Hogwarts remains.

*** I dont really get what your point is?

My view is that James was an arse and a bully when he was a teenager. He changed and stopped and grew as a person. Snape was abused as a child and bullied as a teenager. Snape then went on to be a Nazi, had a change of heart becuase the girl he was infatuated with could potentially die and the turn spy, at great personal risk. James dies protecting his family, Snape gets away scot free from being a millitant racist, and then becomes a teacher at the biggest school in the country. Snape then goes on to (as a 30 something year old) bully two 11 year olds where one is an orphan and the other is practically one as well. He then continues to bully/belittle them for 6 years, helps in the quest to defeat Voldermort and all is forgiven. Whichever way you look at it James IS a bully, but so is Snape the only differnece is that James bullies his peers and Snape bullies children.

** Meh. Rowling is not consistent. She needed a red hearing in book 1, hence Snape. She wanted to humanize Snape, hence James is a bully.

You can see it in a lot of things. Unless everybody suddenly became retarded over a generation, you had the marauders and Snape do some really cool shit that our protagonists don't really come close to, except for Hermione in some instances, and Harry with his Patronus. Inconsistent and incomplete info leaves a lot of room for pointless debate.

How people see James and Snape (and Lily, for that matter) is usually more a reflection of themselves than anything Rowling put down on paper.
