*** I generally have a rough outline - start, end, some points in the middle - but when I write, I let the characters act and react and shape the plot. Even major outlined plot points can be changed like that - like in "Uncle Quentin's Spy". Originally, it was meant to feature Hermione playing a cat and mouse game at Hogwarts against Umbridge, but the first confrontation quickly led to developments that prevented that. Still, I do plan ahead when writing.

*** For me, it depends on the mood. Sometimes I'm super wide awake and will be writing scenes to like, pumping Nicki Minaj through my headphones. My general iTunes is very eclectic, but it's mostly dumb pop (through several eras) and showtunes. The lyrics can be distracting, is the issue.

Mostly I put on a soundtrack of specifically instrumental or choral pieces - like, there are a few things like Mozart, Verdi, Handel, but the majority is game soundtracks. I really like the music in FFX and FFXII, and thenI have a lot of the music from Xenoblade Chronicles!

*** Hmmm..... it has been about 3 and a half years since I first started writing that story, so it's hard to remember where the idea came from. lol...

I think, in general, I find villains more interesting. They're more complicated, I guess. I really prescribe to the idea that no one is ever the villain in their own head. The idea that everyone is the hero in their own story, and it's interesting to me to get into someone's head and try to work out how their internal logic works to allow them to see themselves as justified in their actions, even if they acknowledge that their actions may be considered villainous by others.

I think it's also why mob movies are often popular - especially when people who are by all means murderous criminals, still operate by their own internal code of ethics. The Godfather movies and others of that ilk fit this idea pretty well. Yes, these people are horrible, but they don't see themselves that way. They may even see themselves as honorable in some fashion.

I think the only really evil villains are sociopaths because their brains literally work differently. Right and wrong are totally different constructs to them. They don't feel things the way normal people feel. You can't predict a person's actions very well when you take emotions out of the equation. I also have a really hard time writing a character like that - and I find them really boring and crappy to write too - lol. So if we stick with the idea of Voldemort being basically a sociopath/psychopath, he stops being interesting to me. So I brainstorm for interesting ways to make him not be that. hah.

I like the idea that Tom Riddle could have been a relatively functional human being /before/ mutilating his soul, but it was the act of creating a horcrux in the first place that set him down the path of turning /into/ a sociopath/psychopath. The idea of restoring his soul having the potential to fix that mental/psychical deficit that prevents him from experiencing love and remorse intrigues me, because then it opens the window for 'how does he deal with his choices if he can feel?'

With Again and Again he has regrets and he does feel bad about his past crimes - but not bad /enough/ to drastically alter his goals because he still sees his goals as justified. It's that justification and exploring how a person on this side would manage to work it in their own minds, to excuse their actions, that I find an interesting challenge.

In Meddling of a Mischief Maker my Voldemort decides to totally change directions, but finds it difficult to do this - both through outside things pulling at him, and through his own hesitation in giving up things, even if he knows he /should/.

  The Weasleys don't have any muggle friends.
#+end_quote

This is inaccurate. Arthur reaches out and befriends the Grangers immediately when he sees them them in Diagon Alley. Given that Hermione henceforth spends the her vacations at the Weasleys, it is clearly implied that they are friendly acquaintances with the Grangers, at the very least.

#+begin_quote
  They have a Squib relative who they don't talk about.
#+end_quote

They have hundreds of relatives, as pointed out in DH. Of course they don't talk about most of them. There is absolutely no indication that they don't speak to the squib because he's a squib.

#+begin_quote
  Molly has no patience for Arthur's (even then patronizing) interest in muggle machines and memorabilia.
#+end_quote

Good. I would be exasperated by someone collecting plugs, too. If that someone starts enchanting muggle objects to break the statute of secrecy, then that becomes a greater problem.

#+begin_quote
  The family is Pureblood and seems not to have ever (until Ron's generation are adults) married muggles or halfbloods
#+end_quote

There is no indication of this in the books, and is incorrect by Word of God. The Weasleys have ties to many muggles, which is why they protested being placed on the Sacred 28 list.

And for introducing pro-muggle bills, to the point that Lucius Malfoy is persuaded to try and kill their daughter. But I see that you chose to ignore that little point. Your selecting choosing and interpretation of facts is amusing.

No, that's the point of character bashing. The question here is whether the Weasleys can be reasonably characterised as racists given all the information in canon, and the answer is no, because the evidence against it far, far overwhelms the evidence to the contrary. No reasonable person can argue otherwise.

*** Hi [[/u/TazKidNoah][u/TazKidNoah]]. When I drew the initial plot up of Assumptions - linkffn(Assumptions by GryffindorTom) - that was inspired by a story the late Broomstick Flyer, I actually felt sick to the stomach and was hesitant to publish it.

Some of the stories I wrote or scenes I wrote were actually published based on dreams I had of myself with a fly on the wall view in them. There's a scene in one of my stories, The Betrothal Situation, where it was actually conceived whilst I was asleep. This scene was the argument between Harry and Hermione at The Burrow.

*** When I was very little and I had trouble sleeping at night my mom would tell me to just come up with stories in my head, like making up my own tv shows, and just imagine those stories until I fell asleep, and I don't think I've ever actually stopped doing this. lol

So 'Have you had dream-like experiences as if u were living in ur own stories?' -- yes. Yes I have. lol...

The reason I started writing was entirely because I wanted to organize the more elaborate stories I'd dream up at night so I could move forward better. Whether or not anyone else would like the stories was never part of the equation. In fact, I always assumed that no one would give two shits about any of it, and never intended to post anything ever. It was only about 7 or 8 years ago when I first started coming to ffnet that the idea first occurred to me to actually put things out there for other people to read.

As for hesitation in drawing up certain plots... yes, I've had that. In fact, I find that if I'm starting to worry too much about whether or not other people will like something I'm considering doing, I realize I need to take a step back and refocus. It messes things up if I'm too concerned with other people's opinions, and it screws up my motivation.

It's one of the reasons I like to write huge chunks of story and then post them at once, rather than post a chapter as soon as I've got it written.

As for your prompt... hmmmm. I dunno. the Obscurial concept is still fresh and I haven't gotten much chance to play with the idea any. Someone did post a question about what would it have been like if Harry had been an Obscurial due to his treatment by the Dursley's that made me go 'Oooooo.... that's a neat idea to explore' but that's about it. haha.

Taking a child, conceived by werewolf parents, who has suppressed their magic enough to become an obscurial, is a complicated enough concept on it's own, but throwing the Hallows into the equation... it's a pretty convoluted idea and I'm not even sure where to go with that. haha.

*** Everything I write I have usually been daydreaming about for a long time. When it comes to focusing, this is something I'm struggling with at the moment because I am both busy and very happy, but was easy for me last year because I was using writing to escape and going on long train journeys every weekend, which is when I wrote best. I never expected people to read it. Now that I know people do follow my stories I feel a different kind of pressure and can feel quite nervous about posting something, especially if I've put a lot effort in. I definitely feel hesitation about certain plots because I can almost picture certain reviewers being unhappy with it. I always just go ahead and do it though, because I think it's important that I do it for me and not anyone else.

I'm not sure. Perhaps I'm boring but your scenario is a bit too out there for me! My stories tend to focus on emotional journey rather than magical objects of power.

After the puppy was born they left it for adoption because of The Hunt(an imaginary event like Hircine does from ElderScrolls:Morrowind but in Harry potter Universe). Since adopted he was raised by an environment that didn't acknowledge Magic. The pup would mentally suppress the Magic(thinking it wasnt right) until it did something with his Wolf form.

1) What do you personally consider /canon/? Is there a sliding scale? i.e. (Word of God>Pottermore>Books etc.)

2) While writing, how often do you refer to the source material? Is it mainly a fact-checking exercise or something more?

*** Hi [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]], aww you do flatter me.

1) I am a word of God believer, so anything Rowling writes or says is canon for me. Books, Pottermore, interviews, tweets. When she says something contradictory I just pick whatever I feel makes the most sense. I also consider CC canon but I'm unlikely to ever write anything relating to it (I've written one one shot that alludes to Scorbus but nothing else). The movies I allow to fill in any missing gaps but otherwise aren't canon. There isn't really that much of a sliding scale for me, something is either canon or it isnt.

2) it depends what I'm writing. For certain chapters of Not From Others I had DH open in front of me as I wrote, and I was fairly continuously checking canon to keep the timeline accurate. For silly one shots like aunt marges even bigger mistake, I just used the wiki if I needed to double check anything like names.

*** Hi [[/u/bunn2]]. I think my fic the Aurors (linked up top) is probably my best long piece of work. I have one shots I prefer but Aurors has a bit more going for it. I tried to balance an OC with plenty of Harry, and without the usual traps OCs often fall into, and I tried to create a plot with lots of tension and suspense and an interesting villain. There's no point trying to make a new Voldemort, so I used a villain who was highly emotional, not particularly skilled at magic and was someone you want to be innocent. This provided a twist perhaps halfway through the fic, and from then on a lot of the tension is driven by the reader knowing more than the characters and the dread they feel as they watch them falling into his trap. I also focused quite heavily on the platonic relationship between Harry and Theia - I wanted it to feel realistic and rich without it being romantic and without rushing it. They have a slow transition from colleagues to friends and it was important to me that the reader cannot pinpoint exactly when this occurs. It should grow in the background while the story focuses on the plot.

It wasn't a perfect fic. Lots of people here know how frustrated I got with a certain magical solution, which had to be corrected later. The OC is also quite flawed, and though she noticeably grows and develops as the story moves on, she was not immediately likable and I think a lot of people gave up. For future fics, I need to make sure there's a save the cat moment to prevent this.

I'll go back after a month or two and re-read a story I haven't touched in a bit, and then I'll usually get some new ideas and find that I can block out the next few chapters and move forward again.

There are some writers who will whine and cry because someone didn't like their fic, and told the author.

*** Hi [[/u/sir_skier][u/sir_skier]], thanks for your question. I would say the best advice is to draft your story out before typing and publishing it, take note of reviews about grammar and punctuation and have fun.

You'll occasionally get some bad eggs "reviewing" but as they say, you can't please all of the people all of the time.

*** Don't try to please everyone. Lots of readers have very narrow-minded views and lots of pet peeves, and will try to tell you that unless you write to their expectations, you suck. There is constructive criticism around, but you need to know the difference between criticism that helps you write the story you want to write, and criticism that boils down to "Write another story! One I want!"

A good rule of thumb is that if a review or comment is written in an insulting or mocking manner, then it can be dismissed right away - constructive criticism and insults do not go together as anyone who has experience at work will tell you that insults simply breed antagonism; the exact opposite of the goal of constructive criticism. In effect, such comments are mostly pandering to an audience.

*** Haha - you know, I think I included in that description a note about how what is posted in that 'chapter' is literally all I had worked out, and that really honestly is true.

I'm not one of those organized authors that plans the whole story out ahead of time with an outline and ending already sorted. I literally don't know how it would have ended either. Yup. Seriously. I'm kind of awful like that.

I always start with an idea that's sparks some interest and then it's sort of like a character study from there. I let the character tell me where to go, and I make stops along the way to come up with some challenges they could face and see how they overcome them. I guess this is why my stuff goes on and on and on and I rarely finish anything. Ha. Yeah, I'm awful. But I tend to see the stories like ongoing shows, rather than a single self contained story. Like - I know I'll aim for finding a good place to tie things up eventually, so like a series finale, but until I get there, there are mini plots and challenges along the way.

The pairing /is/ utterly ridiculous by any reasonable measure. Making it work requires some real finesse and doing it well is a challenge that I enjoy.

My memory is crap, so I don't even remember my own stuff very well.

Rereading my old writings usually results in me writing more on it, after not having touched or thought about it in years. I recently read through a story I wrote about 4 years ago and it's like, I remember why I liked the idea so much, and I got ideas for continuing it and went and wrote another 30 pages on it before I set it aside again. I do that shit all the time, which is awful and stupid and probably one of the biggest reasons my things don't get updated for ages since I don't see a point in posting 20 pages I added to some abandoned plot bunny.

I had one of these stories where I'd posted a 20 page first chapter to my Ao3 page and called it 'abandoned' but every few months I'd go back and re-read it and end up writing another 10-30 pages on it. At some point, someone posted a review on the 20 page plotbunny asking a question and I realized that I'd written stuff that addressed their question. I checked the word doc and found that it had reached 200 pages at some point when I wasn't paying attention. So I had more than 180 pages written but not posted, and I went ahead and posted it. Recently stuck it on my ffnet page too, so this weird tendency I have to re-read ancient stories usually ends up in them growing bit by bit, even if I've officially toss them into the 'abandoned bin' in my mind.

I tried with TSG to start Harry off exactly the same, except that he had a copy of Hogwarts: A History on the top of his pile. Now, of course, he's very different, but I try to keep the elements that make him Harry the same - the bravery, the focus on self-sacrifice, the cunning, the genuine want to be good to people.

Basically, my answer is that different stories require character development. Every step away from canon can have an effect.

*** Hello [[/u/Mu-Nition][u/Mu-Nition]] - thanks for the question this afternoon! I think both of us can say that it's not just Harry that gets portrayed in a kind of generic way by some authors, but also Luna and Hermione does, Luna as either a nut or a Seer and Hermione as the bushy haired bookworm.

The reason I usually have Harry as a main character within my Fics is because if you look at it, he is the reason that most of the stories are quite often eventful. I mean, without Harry, Voldemort may have won until the Muggles got involved, Ginny would have been left in the Chamber, nobody would have known about Moldywarts coming back until it was too late for Wizarding kind.

I think that the reason you say that as FanFic authors have changed Harry in their Fics, and I know I do it, is because Harry is one of those who have, reluctantly for him, had greatness thrust upon him and because of that elements of his personality are shown more than others.

An example in The Betrothal Situation is Harry unwittingly saving Hermione from a worser fate by him taking her as a Concubine, he stops Ron and Dumbledore from having any further control over her.

** This question is for [[/u/Taure]]

I swear this is (allegedly) a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you (allegedly) crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You (allegedly) ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanne. You (allegedly) didn't call her afterwards. She (allegedly) cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you (allegedly) been so knee deep in Hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip?

** To [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] , something that's just been niggling at me with Divided and Entwined...is Cedric Diggory's murder ever used to argue against forgiving/appeasing Voldemort?

I can understand why it doesn't come up from a writing perspective; the anti-muggleborn dark-lord-appeasing laws need to pass in order for the plot to exist in the first place, but is there any point in the story's timeline that Cedric's murder was used as evidence?

*** His father certainly did use that argument, but since Pettigrew killed Cedric (although on the order of Voldemort) it's rather easy to blame the underling instead of the Dark Lord. Pretty easy to sneak that in once it's clear that Sirius's exoneration can't be delayed any longer. Maybe even blame the boy, for fighting the Dark Lord - it's not as if all the details of the scene are known; Dumbledore certainly wouldn't want to spread knowledge of the ritual by having Harry be interrogated in too much detail.

When it comes down to it, Cedric was just one among all the victims of Voldemort. The latest, and one after Voldemort's return, but not that much of an obstacle to appeasement. If people want to avoid a war at all cost, a dead boy won't carry much weight.

I feel a bit weird asking a question since I've actually interviewed you before ;)

In the minds of many readers (myself included) your stories Not From Others and The Aurors are essentially canon. It is also a pretty good assumption that Rowling herself will never right or approve of a story set during Ginny's 6th year or anything between the battle and the epilogue.

Do you have any desire to write anything else set between that time period, particular an immediate aftermath story? If not, do you feel that there isn't any story there beyond the typical "struggling with grief" that would feel in canon?

Along those lines, as a Harry/Ginny writer, I know you and I have had slight disagreements over whether there would be any issues between Harry and Ginny in getting back together/staying a couple in the immediate aftermath.

Of everything you've seen on that topic, which possible issue do you think it most plausible and would you ever consider writing a fic that dealt with this? This is my way of asking for you to write the definitive post-Battle fic so I can move on with my life.

*** I will be writing more canon compliant stuff during the time of DH, but not about Harry/Ginny and probably not an aftermath fic. I'll definitely be covering Remus's time in DH and possibly Dean and Seamus at some point. Anything I write about them will be a at least a year or two after the battle. I can see that healing process clearly in my head but it really wouldn't make for an interesting story. Any conflict between the would arise later, I think, when the dust had settled and grief stopped driving people's daily lives. I have to be honest and authentic in my writing; as a favour to people here I tried to write a Marge meets muriel fic once, but I just couldn't find it plausible and nothing I wrote of it was any good. I don't think I could write a realistic conflict between harry and Ginny within the first year because I don't think it would happen. I think the earliest I might be tempted to write post battle would be a Harry and Ron Aurors adventure while Ginny was at school.

For more Harry/Ginny stuff, I will be writing their engagement/wedding, probably as a fluffy one-shot, and their story will be interwoven with others.

**** Ultimately I agree that right after the battle would not be the time for conflict between the two. When things settle down and Ginny goes off to school, perhaps then there might be conflict purely based on the two not seeing each other much and both having jealousy streaks in them. That would be realistic both to their characters and to relationships at that stage in general. I think it would be interesting to explore the dynamic of this couple who risked their lives for each other yet had only dated a few weeks before taking a break and then a few months before Ginny goes off to school. There would be a lot of pressure for the relationship to succeed based on what happened during the war but a lot of things her final year of school that would try to come between them. Surprisingly, I've only read a few fics that actually deal with this specific story.
