Looking for fics where Harry is done with Dumbledore's manipulation and no longer allows it.

Also looking for fics where Harry is in Slytherin and quickly rises up the hierarchy.


** So, basically, just search up either:

- The average, clichéd Slytherin!Harry fic.

- The average, clichéd Independent!Harry fic.

- The average, clichéd Drarry or Harrymort or Tomarry fic.

- The average, clichéd Dumbledore-bashing fic.

- Robst.
