just after order of the phoenix was when i got into fanfic, so it has always been one of my favorite starting points.

i am also open to even many unpopular tropes manipulative dumbles (good or bad)

pairings are not really an issue, slash or not is cool but not really looking for explecitly sexual fics but if it does include sex scenes its not a deal breaker.

would prefer non abandoned fic's and or complete ones as well


** A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight was written just after OotP came out and has a good alternate idea for the series. Two fics are complete and the third (seventh year) is in progress.

Let's see if the bot is working

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
