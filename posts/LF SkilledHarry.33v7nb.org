** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6808016/1/The-Sniper-II-Babylonian-Nights][The Sniper II: Babylonian Nights]] each have Harry learning to shoot.\\
[[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice]], [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Journeyman_Potter/index/][Journeyman]], and [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Master_Potter/index/][Master Potter]] in which Harry learns runes (I think). It's been a long time since I've read those.\\
In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] Harry becomes /extremely/ proficient in summoning and banishing.\\
These are the ones off the top of my head.

*** To be fair, in A Black Comedy, he starts with these skills, and they don't develop further throughout the story. Brilliant story, and I recommend OP read it, but it's not what they're looking for.

** I really like the way Blue Steel projects Dumbledore. Not a amazingly well-written, but the characters were enjoyable.

*** Agreed, the character was portrayed VERY well. I enjoyed the hell out of that fic despite the fact I hated Zoolander.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] is the first that comes to mind. Its been a long time since I read it but it focusses on Dumbledore teaching Harry a extremely rare form of magic and the complications/challenges this entails.
