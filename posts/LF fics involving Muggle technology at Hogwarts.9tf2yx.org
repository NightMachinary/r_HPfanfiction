Specifically, I'm looking for something in which technology is integrated into the HP universe in a way that's mundane. Anything where modern social media culture is part of life at Hogwarts. I'm looking for less "Harry uses Muggle weapons to fight Voldemort" and more "Harry has an iPhone and everyone is on twitter & watching netflix"


** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has Hermione working on ways of bringing electronics to the school. It becomes a pretty important part of the storyline but I can't really say it's done in a way that's mundane, and there's certainly nothing about social media there.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I am not sure it is what you are looking for, but linkao3(6894757) is a funny one-shot about a Muggle-born student bringing a thermos to Hogwarts. Wizard logic being wizard logic, this has very unexpected results...
