However, for each person brought back from the dead, another person's life has to be sacrificed.


** The Master of Death can bring people back to life Orochimaru style but only those who at some point held the Elder Wand. The Elder Wand remembers their magical skills and brings back their body, the Resurrection Stone brings back their soul or a projection of the caster's memory of them, and the Invisibility Cloak can control the summoned person's actions.

**** Even edo tensei is a bit bullshit. Like come on, infinite chakra AND regeneration. Like make it a bit fair. For example like the chakra level should be equal to the summoner. And chakra cannot be regenerated by edo tensei. That would be a bit fair. Then only sages could use edo tensei to full effect to bring back OP legends like Madara and Hashirama.

** I have so many questions. What counts as another person? Has it to be a wizard or do muggles work as well? Do centaurs, goblins, acromantulas work? Do they have to agree to give their life or can you use captured enemies? Can you use the life of a cancer patient who's almost dead already? Do they have to be born? Could abortions be used? What about clones grown in a lab? Homunculi? Aliens? If sentience is required, how about a self-aware robot? Could you repeatedly copy and kill the same living AI?

*** I would imagine it to be like first you have to create a body/vessel without any soul (Dementor victims?) and then use the resurrection stone to summon the soul and then sacrifice another soul to take the summoned being's soul place in the afterlife (the balance must be maintained) and then sone bullshit ritual to exchange it and guiding it to the correct body.

As for the requirements for which being to resurrect, as long as you have a soul it works. Then a goblin can be resurrected as a centaur or some other shit.

**** Question is, what exactly is a soul? How is it created? If you grew a clone in a vat pumped with aging and healing potions, would it have a viable sacrificable soul? Trying to think of the most easily scalable method to resurrect the largest quantity of people.

***** According to me when you have an idea of self, when you can truly take decisions for yourself, when your decisions are not changed or dependent on another, that is when you have a soul. Since the moment you are born to the moment you die, it is constant piece of art being drawn with each stroke being an experience and the pcture being drawn your soul.

** Slight modification: It also requires a souless living body in which to place the soul of the resurrected person. Makes it more horrifying to use, plus you could tie it in with the origin of Dementors - they were actually created to supply bodies for some Dark Lord wielding the Resurrection Stone.

** Hmm, this could tie into my MCU/Potter crossover idea, in which the Resurrection Stone is an (inferior) attempt to duplicate the Soul Stone. A soul for a soul.

** I'm using this mechanic in a not yet released story where.. Harry's plot amour malfunctions.

And Harry Potter is the chosen one, so well, the Trio doesn't even begin finish the battle of Hogwarts alive. But never fear... two joke shop owners with the Deathly Hallows and Herminoes mum...

And after all, convicted death eaters are thick on the ground post-war.

The morally reprehensible bit is played for laughs.
