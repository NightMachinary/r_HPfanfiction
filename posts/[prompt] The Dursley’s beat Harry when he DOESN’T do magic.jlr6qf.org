Getting over their hatred of the abnormal, the Dursley's seek to abuse Harry for his gifts in a different way.

A broken vase?

Magic it back together.

Out of gas?

Magic some more.

Someone does something that they don't like?

Magic them to death.

But if the freak fails to perform when they need him...

The belt comes out and the frying pans get thrown.

The result? A Harry Potter who is conditioned through torture to call on wandless magic whenever he needs it to do whatever he wants it to.

I'm not sure how the rest of the plot will go. I have an idea for a story that uses this as an introduction, but I'm not going to share it in case I decide to write it.


** I feel like he would grow up hating his magic.

*** Mmm... true. I didn't think about it like that. Maybe the obscurial comment wasn't so far off base.

I feel like it would be more likely that he would grow to resent it later, but as a child, to him, it would be the only thing saving him from a beating. For example, after Harry realizes that he's a wizard in canon and that's why the Dursleys hated him the entire time, he still loves magic and considers Hogwarts his home.

**** Same, there is just something about Neville's character that makes him seem very likable (though admittedly it may be the fact that we didn't see enough about him to find many faults, or maybe he is just relatable to some of us, I for example remember that I used to be quit shy as a kid), Luna also is one of those characters that are extremely hard to hate at all, even her antics and eccentrics come across more as endearing than annoying somehow.

*** You get an obscurial when you get abused FOR using magic. Like Harry COULD, and perhaps SHOULD, have developed when growing up. It's when someone hates their own magic and wants to suppress it so much that it collapses in on itself.

It does not, however, form when you try and force your magic to surface. As evidenced by Neville.
