So a couple of days ago I was reading a Harry Potter gamer story, and it reminded me of It's a game Hermione, enjoy! by Mist of Shadows, since it's been a couple of years from the last time I've read it, I decided to reread it. However the site that hosts the story hpfanficarchive.com appears to be down. Whether or not the site is permanently down or down temporarily is unknown to me, but since it's been two days and the website is still on accessible I figured I'd post a thread here to see if anyone had an archive copy or an alternate site that hosts the story. I would appreciate any help that you could give me.


** I think he also posts on Twisting the Hellmouth, perhaps under Mistofrainbows - I am not sure about the name.

Starfox5 I managed to get a hold of them on SV since space battles has a stupid time/posting requirement to p.m. someone and I don't have a space battles account thanks for the help.

*** Thanks for the help, sadly as newguyontheblock19 said several the links give 404 errors although I did manage to get about a third of the chapters

aMiserable_creature I did finally get your method to work although I had to use bing since Google which is the default only had less than half of the chapters, although it became a moot point since Harry Potter fanfic archive is back up and running thanks for the help anyway.
