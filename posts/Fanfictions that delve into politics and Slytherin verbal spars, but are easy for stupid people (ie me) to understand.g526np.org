So I want to work more on improving myself, and I supose the best way to do so is through a conduit that I can relate with. So, looking for (not pretensious) long, kinda political fics where Harry is intelligent and works up and gets his shit together! Thanks!


** Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series might be good?

Harry, Ron and Hermione are in Slytherin, in the core of wizarding politics, and are involved whether they want to or not.

Here's the first out of 4 stories

** The Accidental Animagus has a smart, politically savvy Harry who often has verbal (and sometimes beyond that) spars with Slytherins.
