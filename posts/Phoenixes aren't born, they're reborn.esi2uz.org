Phoenixes don't reproduce, at least not as we use the term. Instead, when a witch or wizard (or possibly other magical being) of extraordinary virtue and purity dies, their body burns away to reveal a phoenix chick.

Albus Dumbledore became aware of this due to Fawkes, perhaps even having known him as a human. Now he seeks (and fully expects) to be reborn as a phoenix, and also does his best to guide others towards such a rebirth. The Order of the Phoenix is not named such after Fawkes, as most believe, but after Albus and those who follow him in the Light. Everything he does is shaped by this agenda and by his interpretation of what traits lead to rebirth: Killing is wrong, because it denies the victim any further chance to be redeemed and reborn. Self-sacrifice is noble and Light, as are forgiveness, mercy, and virtuous suffering. Any of the over-the-top or bashy Dumbledore traits/actions that aren't outright selfish can be similarly rationalized.

I'll admit that the above is somewhat inspired by the Dumbledore in linkffn(Sympathetic Properties), but hopefully this is an original twist.


** Ohhhh! I like this. In my fic, Harry has been impacted by the Phoenix Tears... I might consider this as a possible outcome at the end of his life... hmmm.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** Yes, the Order of the Phoenix is Dumbledore's twisted idea of virtue; the members are supposed to die and be reborn into the "next great adventure."

  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.

I must say, that is quite a painful summary.

**** The story could've used a beta read, but its still rather well done. It's a unique premise, and my go to rec for bash-free WBWL and tearjerkers. And while the OOTP has nothing to do with it, it's related to the prompt lol.

** Interesting prompt. I've heard of a couple fics where Harry dies and is reborn but as a human. I like the idea that the Creature that is a phoenix is the reborn form of a person. In my mind I'd play this as something based off of mindset more than actions. If your Dumbledore does things because he wants to be reborn as a Phoenix, he'll never reach that mindset required for his own rebirth. Especially if he is trying to help push other people into that path.

*** That'd be my take on it as well - the very fact that you're doing what you're doing for your own gain makes it no longer truly virtuous, so it doesn't make you worthy of rebirth. Pushing other people towards it might not be an issue, but only if the mindset was more like "I'll never be worthy, but they might be, and I want the best for them."

** I know there's a fic somewhere that's kinda like that. Basically Harry defeats Voldemort with a powerful light spell that's like a nuke. But in the end he turns into a Phoenix egg and like ten years later it hatches. I just can't remember where it is though.

** While I do plan on having phoenixes being shown to reproduce, once the Quidditch World Cup rolls around (many years in the future), I am glad my story could inspire something new within the fandom.

As always, thanks for reading. ;-)
