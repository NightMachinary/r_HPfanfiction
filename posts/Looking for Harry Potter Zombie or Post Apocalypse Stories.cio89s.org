Hey all. I'm looking for any good stories where Harry is around for a Zombie outbreak or in a world where society has ended from either an Apocalypse or a World War. I like the premise but haven't really found much. Thanks.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9310847/1/][Future of Ruin]] The fight between Harry and Voldemort in the books isn't the first or last time they fight, they are immortals and the fight goes back millennia. About 500 years after a nuclear apocalypse Harry comes across a time rift that spits out a ~25 year old Hermione.

**** linkffn(Time, Mr Potter?) is it. I've dropped that link a lot recently it seems. Incredible fight scenes, original twists in a decade old fic, and actual grammar. Oh, and it's complete too! Cheers

** linkffn(The truth between wands and zee) This is a trilogy. Check the author's page for the others. Harry appears in the flashbacks.

There's also this rather old story on LiveJournal called Wake the Dead. You can find it here: [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/?skip=100]]

#+begin_quote
  The war between humans and zombies rages even after five years. Military efforts to repel the hordes of undead prove less than entirely effective. A team of military medical specialists are brought together to try and find a solution. They are joined, however, by some unexpected participants. The survival of humanity rests in what emerges from the meetings. (First Tale)

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has Voldemort using zombies and a huge battle against zombies in Jamaica.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) has Voldemort using a bunch of super zombies that Grindelwald made.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** A good one I found that I like is Walking Dead Wizard by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan. It's a HP/Walking Dead crossover and is slash. Not my usual cup of tea but I like it well enough to ignore that. I don't remember reading anything explicit anyway.
