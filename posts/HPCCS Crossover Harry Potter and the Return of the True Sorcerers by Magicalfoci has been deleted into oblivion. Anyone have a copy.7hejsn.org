Pretty please with a cherry on top? It was an HP/Cardcaptor Sakura fic.

**** It's 108GB /compressed/. With typical text compression ratios this can be anywhere from 500GB to 1000GB uncompressed. Yea, it's pretty crazy.

Edit: turns out it's only ~303GiB uncompressed. That's... surprisingly low? Maybe they chose a lower ratio for speed.

***** Yea, I found it in the index. Trying to extract it now.

#+begin_example
  tar -xf Fanfiction.tar.gz "home/ben/Desktop/Ben's Stuff/Fanfiction/Card Captor Sakura/In-Progress/Card Captor Sakura - Magicalfoci - Harry Potter and the Return of the True Sorcerers.txt"
#+end_example

Too bad gzip can't really do multithreaded decompression. This box has more cores than single-thread performance.

Edit: I have an ETA of ~50 mins if the file is at the end of the archive.
