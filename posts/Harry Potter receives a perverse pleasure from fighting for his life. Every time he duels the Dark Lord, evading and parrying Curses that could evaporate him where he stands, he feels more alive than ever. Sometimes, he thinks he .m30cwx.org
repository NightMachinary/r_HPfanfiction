#+TITLE: Harry Potter receives a perverse pleasure from fighting for his life. Every time he duels the Dark Lord, evading and parrying Curses that could evaporate him where he stands, he feels more alive than ever. Sometimes, he thinks he can see the same excitement reflected in Voldemort's eyes, too.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”
