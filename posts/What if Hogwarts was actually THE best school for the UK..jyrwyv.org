I see it all the time, Hogwarts is the only school, Hogwarts is one of many schools and how the education is actually crap compared to foreign schools or that Hogwarts is just a long standing institution and while its education standards are failing over the decades is still considered the best.

What I want to see is that Hogwarts is actually the best, hands down. Like, Harry has taken his Hogwarts education for granted thinking that its just a basic education for all wizards but is in fact like all the Ivy League schools combined for quality and prestige. With Harry finding out that most wizards don't actually get to go to Hogwarts or even get close to OWL education standards. (even though they're called Ordinary Wizarding Level) And later finding out what that all means. Like Hermione really tries her best because she actually knows how amazing it actually is. That Molly and Arthur are that poor because they are putting EVERYTHING into their kids education and that Ron's actually a bit of a assclown for not trying as hard as he could.

Stuff like that. Like Harry doing a mildly difficult transfiguration only to learn that its actually pretty fucking hard and amazing for him to know this level of magic.

I also once came across a story where Hogwarts actually had more to offer AFTER graduation from the Seven-Year course and that most of those unused classrooms are just used on different days, weeks, months depending on whats classes are being taught and the normal students just don't notice.


** It's honestly quite interesting to consider. Nice idea.

You could go with 'OWLS are what normal people strive for.' For example, a normal school lasts 7 years (or longer) and at the end they take their OWLS, and usually manage to get one or two. In contrast, Hogwarts gives them in 5th year and then goes beyond by offering NEWTS, which other schools can't and those students have to try and self-teach that knowledge before applying for the exam at the ministry as adults.

This would also effectively lower the Ron bashing if written correctly. It's not that he's lazy, he's just very focused on the things he CAN do well, and is much more like an average magical in the other aspects. This, of course, leads to him being unable to follow along properly with Hogwarts' accelerated curriculum.

I think one of the reasons people think Ron is shitty in school is because he is very vocal about the amounts of homework. But I don't think he is a shitty wizard. All his siblings are well accomplished and talented wizards in their own sense and he even levitates a club when all they are taught is to levitate feathers in the first year.

** This has always been my assumption. There's a few weird fanon assumptions that are not borne out on an actual read through of the series:

1. Ron and Harry are bad students. This is not true? They're very normal students. They complain about homework. That's one of the most normal things to do in the world. They go to class, do all their homework, and even practice outside of class when they're struggling. While compared to Hermione they're not as diligent, compared to your average student they're probably above average.

2. Hogwarts is not up to snuff. This is also kind of obviously not true. How did Hogwarts compete with Durmstrang and Beauxbatons so well, in that case? Cedric and Harry were # 1 and 2 for a reason. Furthermore pretty much every example we get from classes shows the teachers to be running competent and interesting classes. I'm thinking minor stuff that shows this: Flitwick's cheering charm class showing a teacher who teaches well and lets their students have fun in the process. Any of the Slughorn potion classes they show. The way students are told to work it out with nonverbal spells is reminiscent to me of immersion when we were told to suddenly stop speaking english.

I think writers just tend to use both to justify their Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, even though they have no basis in anything for it.

*** I think the 'Hogwarts isn't up to snuff' thing might have originated from people leaping to conclusions after thinking about Hogwarts' faults:

1) Safety. Hogwarts is kind of dangerous (although, this might just be due to, what I dub, the 'Harry Potter Effect') 2) The ever-rotating teaching position for Defense 3) An insanely boring ghost teaches History 4) Snape should not be a teacher. He knows his stuff, but he doesn't seem to actually /teach/ much and he despises children.

Hogwarts is a pretty sweet school, but it's got some wrinkles to work out.

*** It's more about the lack of things that real private (and public) schools have (in the western world at least). The teachers for the most part are competent, there's just not enough of them and most are serving double (and triple in McG's case) duty. Most likely this stuff was removed because it was irrelevant to plot, but it is very noticeable for not being there.

The Staff-student ratio is really bad unless you assume that there are a bunch of staff that are just not mentioned in the books. The ghosts, portraits, and the house-elves aren't shown to be involved in disciplining children or keeping a eye on them.

There are not enough extracurriculars for all the students - Ron doesn't get involved in anything until fifth year and Hermione doesn't get involved in anything at all. Their only physical activity is only open to 28 students (and maybe a dozen alternates). Harry shares a common room with a quarter of the school but there's no mention of someone strumming a guitar or playing a violin or anything.

There is no health class, art class, social/world studies, language studies other than Runes, or field trips to anywhere. I would think sex ed would happen at some point, but it's not mentioned at all.

** It could work and help with wizarding population math, though they cannot be that many schools. 5K students Isles wise is already implying like a 100k magical population.

That being said, the thing that always has made that thing difficult to work are the Weasleys. The "being poor because they're paying for school" can only take you so far. They were already poor on Bill's time, and 6 kids came after. It could work but it need clunky world building or dropping some parts of cannon.

It is an eternal struggle in fics. Trying to keep everyone that mattered in Harry's orbit (single school) and justifying population maths (more than 1). I think I have a neat compromise, but still far from putting my approach on a fic.

Harry's 40 student year is at the peak of a war that has been raging for 10(?) years, that targeted a lot of the population.

what we do know is that the ministry is huge, they have a national sports league, they have a Wandmaker that sells wands for basically nothing and have specified shops that sells merchandise in a spesific area.

**** Indeed.

By Harry's year, there should be like 5K wizards in there british isles.

JKR said there would be 1K students at Hogwarts, which would translate to around 20K population.

By government size, that should be more than double.

If Ollivander makes a reasonable living out of selling 1 galleon wands, then he should sell upwards of 10K wands a year. Considering most of them should be from first years rather than lost or malfunctioning wands, that means he should be living in a magical british isles with at least 150K population

Now 13 professional Quidditch teams is just crazy. The amount of people that they have to have each 15 days in the stands, especially considering kids can't attend because they're at Hogwarts, is nasty. I would say at least 500K population in the British Isles. Which really is not what JKR aimed for.

Right, and if you tried your best and still fail, I can't fault you for that. However, as I mentioned previously, Harry has the /potential/ to be a high achieving student. His good grades in defense didn't come from his one day a year of extracurricular field work. Unfortunately, this potential is wasted due to the poor academic attitudes he picked up from Ron.

Hogwarts is a boarding school so parental influence is largely removed as a factor. The other main factor is faculty influence, but I can't imagine Minerva urging Harry to slack off.

That being said, how would we maintain the "Harry taking his Hogwarts education for granted through ignorance" thing if Ron actually tries? I mean, without Ron as the main reason for Harry not noticing early on how big of a deal it is to get a Hogwarts education, it would just be Harry and some obscene levels of obliviousness and or an ungodly amount of being distracted at key moments that would have alerted him to it to begin with.

This generation of weasleys would be far different, as the weasley family has been going to hogwarts since the start of the damn thing and hell be damned they will lose that right

I imagine that there are two factors that allow entry into your hogwarts, Legacy and money.

the weasleys would have the legacy, but due to poor finances perhaps due to grindalwalds war and the one against voldemort. they lack the funds needed.

so while the weasleys are generally allowed a spot at hogwarts. if this generation of weasleys perform poorly it could take generations before they are allowed back even more so since the weasleys are considered blood traitors and most of the rich families would gladly see them lose said spot.

So this Ron would grow up knowing he has to do well at hogwarts for the good of his family.

****** One way would be to diversify Harry's friends, at least at the start of his Hogwarts tuition. That way while Ron studies Harry could be hanging out with minor characters that get dropped later, while Harry just assumes he accidentally picked two best friends who are crazy about studying once it's been long enough to be an established character trait for Ron.

Another would be to keep playing off his ignorance of the wizarding world. In Canon, Ron is Harry's major exposition on the wizarding world and its culture. How often would characters like Ron and such bring up the other lesser magical schools (edit: Especially if its a pride thing where he pretends it's perfectly in his station to be going to such a school like Hogwarts and doesn't want to mention the alternatives if he gets too low a grade)? Maybe Harry just assumes its a general wizarding cultural thing to study (wise wizards trope, basically just assumes its all studying all the way)

That remains true for all the Weasleys, and really every students who didn't work as hard as they could (so almost all characters but Hermione), no matter how successfull they end up being nor what kind of learner they are.

The twins were more interested into their jokes and building their joking shops than any lessons their parents worked so hard for them to get. They barely worked for their OWLs.

**** That is in fact incorrect. According to the books, a special quill exists, which writes down the name of every magical child in Britain at the time of their birth. This allows Hogwarts letters to be sent to all magical children at the appropriate time, even those who are Muggle-born, so they do get accepted at the time of birth they just don't know it. Neville's family were just impatient.

What makes you a better wizard or witch to qualify for going to Hogwarts? Just because a quill says so? Then how is it any fair? If the school is a meritocracy that only accept certain students then an interview and an entrance test is a must to weed out the weakest and choose the candidates most suitable for a life at Hogwarts. It's not just about “test-taking skills” it's how you evaluate merits on a level playing field. There's a reason why you need aptitude tests and interview for university acceptance. Besides, if we're talking about merits, then what the hell are Crabbe and Goyle doing at Hogwarts? On pure nepotism lol?

We're talking about magical power, not academic performance or intellectual ability. The "entrance test" is the Quill and Book combo and they weed out the magical "weakest" because those with more magical power are the ones "most suited to life at Hogwarts". There are plenty of people in real life who have exceptional skills but would score low on intellectual tests. You seem stuck on defining merit by your terms instead of within the scenario the OP suggested. Hogwarts only cares about magical power for entrance. It was designed specifically for students to learn powerful magic that other witches and wizards struggle with due to a lack of power.
