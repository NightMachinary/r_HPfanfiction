No one knows what started this phenomenon. Some say that it was a disease carried from mosquitoes, that it was energy from the Earth's core, or even that it was from the asteroid that hit Earth all those years ago. But whatever the case may be, one thing is for certain.

Humanity will never be the same.

At the dawn of this extraordinary era, people began to develop their newfound powers for basic things. Growing food slightly faster, making sharper arrows to hunt. But as much as people used their powers for good, they also used them for evil. Resentment began to grow against these people who had so much power over them.

Around this time, the enigmatic figure All for One was born. His true name lost to the annals of history, he was the only person born with his unique magic power.

The power to steal magic.

Not only did this power have the benefit of adding to his already massive reserves, but it also had the benefit of prolonging his lifespan, as well as the power to give magic to others.

All for One exploited the growing conflict between wizards and muggles for his own gain, he lurked in the shadows and used this power to secretly steal magic from powerful wizards throughout history. Now, since wizards were losing their magic and supposed "muggleborns" were gaining them, this only heightened the tensions between them, creating an even more vicious cycle for All for One to take advantage of.

Eventually, the wizard/muggle relations got so bad that they were forced to create the Statute of Secrecy in order to protect themselves.

Now that wizards are no longer publicly known to muggles, All for One has been forced to take an even more subtle approach in order to consolidate his influence. He pondered about what to do, but then he figured it out.

The squibs.

By giving these resentful people magic, he has slowly but surely amassed an army of loyal fighters willing to fight and die for him. The question now remains:

What is his goal? And if he decides to act on it, could anyone stop him?
