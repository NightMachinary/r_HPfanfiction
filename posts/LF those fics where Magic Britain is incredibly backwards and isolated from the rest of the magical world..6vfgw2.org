I love them for some reason.


** Mm, nothing comes to mind, but funnily enough the first snippet on this page: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/13/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection]] has the inverse mentioned in passing; Tom Riddle leaves Britain for somewhere more enlightened, only to find that the rest of the world is even worse.

It is kind of a guilty pleasure to read fics where wizards from X-place do so-and-so better, like having a functional judicial system and magical creatures of all kinds attending school and potion theory following better logic and so forth, isn't it?

The things I worry about seeing though, are ones where 'you have a horcrux stuck in your head? I'll dispel it in 5 seconds' or 'oh, yeah, we have a permanently-effective Wolfsbane formula that makes lycanthropy non-infectious, painless, and you keep your right mind' or 'we can track Voldemort's horcruxes and we have a super easy way to destroy them, and we can satellite-strike the Dark Lord to boot'...

You know, basically 'These magicals are so awesome that they can solve canon problems with a wave of their hand so that my Super!Harry can have his own adventure, aren't British witches and wizards so backwards and corrupt, titter titter.' Honestly, I see that enough with helpful-goblin fics...

...Actually, I wonder if there's any fics that zig-zag the 'Backwards Magical Britain' idea all over the place?

Like, Britain's all backwards and stuff and the rest of the world has much better magitechnology, BUT that magitechnology turns out to burn through the world's natural mana resources/introduce toxic arcane energy to the atmosphere and Britain's 'backwards' ways are deliberate in order to avoid poisoning the environment, BUT Britain really is controlled by an entrenched pureblood elite who resist magical progress even when it's demonstrably sustainable, and their culture and legal system is behind and corrupt, BUT they aren't the real government of Magical Britain, there's a secret one behind another Statute of Secrecy that brings in various muggleborns and purebloods once they're mature enough to keep it a secret, BUT this double-secret magical community has its own political squabble due to being full of tons of magical races with their own ideals and values, BUT it turns out that some of the magitechnology is toxic/unsustainable and some isn't, and it turns out in the latter case that aliens have landed and are saturating the atmosphere with toxic stuff in preparation for terraforming...

...And it turns out the aliens are based in a parallel Earth/back in the timeline where humans/other beings haven't developed civilisation yet, so Harry and co. go to that place to train up the local creatures in how to use magic and jump start a civilisation and military, so the result is that you have a Magical Britain that is simultaneously primitive and the most advanced civilization around...

*** I have a feeling that if this rabbit hole ends at all, it ends with the whole magical world actually being controlled by a random number generator from the future that was sent back by Death to accomplish something utterly inconsequential.
