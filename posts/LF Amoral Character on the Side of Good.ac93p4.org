You see a lot of Evil Dumbledore potioning and controlling the Goodguys to take all the abuse etc, but we never see an Amoral character being like "Leave Umbridge to me" and then Imperio'ing or potioning her to keep her from causing the school trouble. "Imperio. Act the same but treat all students better and do not harm any" and an Obliviate when the Imperio stops being necessary.

It was really hard to tell that anyone was under the Imperius, and it'd be even harder if they never acted out of character, so it could easily be covered up. I just want to see a Good guy with no morals just doing what is necessary to keep people safe.


** Beside Hermione and Snape in canon, amoral characters on the side of the good guys is very common, beginning with some of the most recommended fics on this sub:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort is quite evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Bellatrix is definitely no paragon of virtue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Harry is highly manipulative here. How he outmaneuvered his boss is kind chilling.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434): Luna is a total psychopath.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald is struggling to not commit worse atrocities, and all Harry's friends eventually take great pleasure in looting.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550578/1/Narcissa-Militant][Narcissa Militant]], she pretty much kills or maims whoever tries to hurt Harry. I don't remember how she dealt with Umbridge, but I bet she wasn't around for long. Both Narcissa and Harry are pretty ruthless in it. It wasn't really my cup of tea exactly because of how immoral Narcissa was, but it might fit your request.

** That's something difficult to accomplish with books such as Harry Potter where the plot, while not truly lacking, isn't deep. Throughout the books, only a handful of character's actions contribute to the plot. Other people are generally passive.

But even if they weren't meant to be passive, you are talking about criminal activity and expecting it from children as they are the only ones to have regular interaction with Umbridge. Not really something that happens, no matter how amoral the characters are.

** Hermione already has a history of that (second-year polyjuice, fourth-year Skeeter in a jar), and that is basically Snape's entire character, but useful to the trio.

*** Maybe this reflects poorly on my morals, but I've never thought of them using Polyjuice to be a horribly immoral act. And I can't remember the length of time Hermione kept Skeeter in the jar, but I would suggest the duration to be important to how strongly I felt trapping her (and kidnapping her) was immoral.

Maybe I'm just a little too ready to accept bad behavior being perpetrated against people I see as deserving of it. (I.e. it's hard to feel too bad for bigots or sleezy journalists.)

The outrage from some folks about Hermione 'mind-raping' her parents with the memory charm was a little hard to understand for me too, especially folks who thought it was out of character. It was in character, based on the above, and I still don't see it as that damnable of an act in the grand scheme of things.

**** Honestly the big one for me is the DA contract everyone signed; Hermione didn't even tell the boys that she'd cursed the parchment. It was preemptive revenge, not a deterrent against betrayal. The false memory charm is often confused with straight up Obliviate (which is irreversible) so that one is debatable. As far as I can tell Hermione kept Skeeter in the jar for a week, still trapping a human for being rude to them though. And using the Polyjuice isn't necessarily a horribly immoral act, but brewing it was illegal (plus they had to steal ingredients) and knocking out your classmates and stuffing them in a closet so they could use it is sketchy. Part of the immorality is at what age she is willing to commit these acts. Theft and drugging classmates at 12/13, and kidnapping/unlawful detainment at 14/15 is considered a bigger deal than if an adult were doing it because it could indicate that Hermione just doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
