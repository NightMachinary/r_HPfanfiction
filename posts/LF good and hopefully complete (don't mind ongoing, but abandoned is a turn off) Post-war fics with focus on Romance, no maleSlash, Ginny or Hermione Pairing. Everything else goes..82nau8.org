A few that I enjoyed the tone of, were "Days to Come" "Good Days and Bad Days" "Black coffe with sugar", also 3 fics from "Dorothea Greengrass", all post war romance with Daph/Harry. There was another one that I enjoyed, but I don't remember the name, where Luna is working for Olivander, Hannah is Harry's partner in the Auror's Corps. Another with Luna where she's an Unspeakable after coming back to the UK 4 years after the war (she went to Canada, I think) but sadly that fic was abandoned. BTW, I really disliked Unatoned, so anything with that tone isn't my cup of tea.


** The commas are in the title are confusing me a bit, but are you asking for a non-H/Hr and non-H/G post-war romance?

*** Basically, yes.

Are commas not used like this ? I always thought it was, but it makes sense to be different than my native.

**** I've seen it in other ways, but I figured I'd check to be sure. I'd initially read it as "no maleSlash, Ginny or Hermione Pairing (desired)". Sorry for wasting your time!

** Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is probably the best Harry/Daphne fic around.
