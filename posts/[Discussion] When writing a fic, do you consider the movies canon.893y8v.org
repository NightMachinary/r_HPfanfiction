** As a whole I focus more on the books, but if something suited my needs I'd probably use it.

I once got into an argument with a reader because I gave Daphne and Astoria blonde hair in a fic but Astoria was shown to be a Brunette in the movies.

So yes, I once had a reader tell me that I couldn't make a character blonde because the one off actress who got the part because she was fucking Tom Felton, had no dialogue and appears on screen for about a second was a brunette.

Yep.

Also from that conversation I learned that it's completely impossible to dye your hair in the magical world. So Muggles must have a stranglehold on hair style products.

Hogswallop! What about Sleekeazy? The freakin' /Potter fortune/ is partially based in hair products.

**** Well the reader claimed no one would ever dye their hair blonde in the wizarding world. So....I guess maybe just blonde doesn't exist then?!

** Yeah I don't consider the films canon at all.

** I go with the movie (and enthusiastically!) exactly as much as the Wiki does. If something in the moving pictures contradicts the books, I'll pick the books, but I gladly use movie-only or game-only info that doesn't contradict anything --- things like the existence of certain spells or students or creatures.

*** The wiki and games are great if you need names for background characters. I dug up Patricia Stimpson not even half an hour ago. Even though she is actually book canon, no one remembers her (the girl who broke down over the OWLs according to George) and if not for the wiki, I wouldn't have that blank character who will literally get one mention.

** Hmm. It depends. If the scene from the movie can be considered canon compliant with the books, then perhaps. If not, nah.

The only exception I've used is with how Quirrell ended up. In the books we don't really get the impression that he's burned to ash. But I like using that anyway. Tis badass.

** I lean more towards the books as far as events and timelines go. The movies and games throw in a few more background characters and a few spells here and there and if they don't directly contradict the books, I'll use them on occasion.

** I generally go with the books, but I don't really care about canon when writing - only what fits a particular story.
