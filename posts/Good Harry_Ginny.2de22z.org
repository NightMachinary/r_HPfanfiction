** One of my favorite post-Hogwarts stories is /learning to live again/ by seeker68. Its really angsty but it does have good adventure closer to the end of the story.

#+begin_quote
  Starts the morning after the Final Battle. Follow along as Harry and Ginny live through the next few years and learn how to deal with the after-effects of the war, and try to live the life they deserve. Main focus is H/G but lots of other characters

*** This is one of my absolute favorites! Seeker68 actually still pays attention to his reviews and responds to all of them, BTW.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]] is a dependable author for this pairing. Her /Backward with Purpose/ series is one of the best in the fandom, but she has several other AU stories of note.

S'TarKan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past]] is another classic; 390k words, WIP.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

It goes to some very dark places and may not be for everyone, but Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] is a readable post-DH AU; 17k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]]

#+begin_quote

** I would recommend hgfan1111's writings. Many of hers are AU H/G stores and are excellent.

However, they've removed their stories from most websites. There are a few still floating around.

Easier to Be is my personal favourite, and there's a copy [[http://www.scribd.com/doc/194945821/Easier-to-Be-by-Hgfan1111][Here]]
