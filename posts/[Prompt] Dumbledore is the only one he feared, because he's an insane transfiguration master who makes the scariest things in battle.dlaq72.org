***** Don't talk about Tom like he was six or seven. He was eleven, and eleven is the age where one absolutely needs to hold kids to adult ethical standards, even if you have the understanding that they may not yet reach them. Stealing is wrong. You teach that to kids young, and they understand it well by the time they're eleven. Dumbledore was establishing early and firmly that stealing was not okay and he'd know if Tom did it at Hogwarts. That's what you have to do with kids from troubled backgrounds as an educator.

And this was a child who was in an environment where the only thing he could learn was that cruelty begets power and will make bullies leave him alone. The only thing such a move will accomplish in a smart, self-interested child with no internal moral compass is a desire to never be powerless, which is obviously what it did.

******* I have also taught elementary, as well as Pre-K, middle, and high school. Specifically, I have taught elementary in districts where the kids came from rough backgrounds, and occasionally they were even in homeless shelters. Punitive measures like Dumbledore's aren't arbitrary because you make it clear what exactly is deserving of that punitive measure, you leave no physical harm, and you make it clear what the child has to do in order to fix it. My students were happy because I made sure they treated each other well, and they knew exactly what my rules were and what the consequences were if they broke them, but they could have all the positive reinforcement they wanted if they followed the rules and paid attention.

Kids need structure, especially if their lives outside of school don't have it. Tom didn't turn out the way he did because Dumbledore told him not to steal shit. He turned out the way he did because he was a psychopath, which apparently developed in the womb because of love potions.

******** I think you're both kind of right. Dumbledore wasn't wrong to tell him not to steal, nor to demonstrate that it wouldn't be tolerated at Hogwarts. On the other hand, Dumbledore also seemed to dismiss Tom as irredeemably evil offhand. Which I think was a mistake on his part.

Dumbledore complains that Tom showed no capacity for forgiveness, but how was he to learn that when it had never been demonstrated to him.

Also an issue brought up in To Reach Without comes to mind. Tom believed his power gave him the right to force others to do what he wanted, then Dumbledore comes in and reinforces Tom's belief that power confers right by 1. Demonstrating that he's more powerful than Tom. 2. Forcing Tom to do what he wants.

So maybe a better approach would have been "You will return these things to their owners. I will not force you to apologize, but know that Hogwarts does not condone this behavior and should it continue you'll not be there long."

And while we're on the subject of forcing kids to apologize, what good does it do to force a meaningless apology? Never understood that.

My response would be wary.

Dumbledore was talking to him. He talked to him while also demonstrating what was, all things considered, quite a mild punishment. It was a light show, and then telling Tom he had to return the stolen things and apologize. That's a pretty basic consequence for stealing. The ideal consequence for a child wouldn't need a light show at all, but Dumbledore was working with a child who he had no prior relationship with and therefore had no reason to respect his words without a demonstration of consequences. It's the same reason why you need to kick off a new class by being very strict and holding kids to the letter of the rules, and you can loosen up later in the year once you have a working relationship with the kids.

Also, Tom had no role models, carried some deep guilt from knowing that he was responsible for his mother's death, was driven by hatred for his father abandoning him... I agree with you that CERTAIN eleven year olds can be trusted to make rational decisions, but if you are holding an insane child to the standards you hold a rational adult to, then... you're probably pretty flipping stupid.

******* That's part of being an educator: you don't write off kids. You don't assume that they just can't meet your standards so don't even bother, and you don't lower your standards in a way that inhibits their growth and possibly hurts the children around them.

You give every kid the same set of standards. You expect them to behave within your class, and that means no bullying, no stealing, and listening to instructions. Some kids won't meet your standards, but you never let yourself think that they're just not capable of it. You keep pushing them to meet those standards because you owe it to those children to believe in them even when they don't believe in themselves.

Sometimes it's just not going to happen, but as an educator, you never resign yourself to that while that child is still in your classroom. You do your best. ‘Your best' sometimes means putting your foot down and giving a kid a stern talking to about misbehavior, then telling them to go remedy the problems they created (or their stolen toys will keep rattling around in their box being annoying).

Dumbledore had no way of knowing how Tom would respond because all he knew about Tom was that he was magic and apparently used his magic violently, so he did what worked for other kids. He never really got to know how to deal with Tom best, either, because he only ever suspected the worst of Tom's later wrongdoings and only found that watching him very closely after a student died meant that no other students died.

******** I'm not concerned with the behaviour of the kid, which, at that point in time he was. Dumbledore is my concern because he's an adult in a position of power over children who is setting one of his own students up for failure. It's just symptomatic of the general way morality is dealt in the HP world. If you have a fourth of the population growing up in a world where they're presumed to be untrustworthy and evil, it shouldn't be surprising if a lot of them do go bad. It's about setting an example. Dumbledore decided that he was going to go bad not just because he stole from the other kids, kids who beat him up before he figured out how to defend himself, but also because he spoke to snakes. Adults should not be considering eleven years olds irredeemable and treating them as such. That's why we have treatment for antisocial personality disorders, rehabilitative prison systems etc. Developing empathy and compassion when you've never received it is extremely rare, especially if you're a sociopath or have some other personality disorder which means that your internal moral compass is skewiff.

Sorry if I seem overly passionate about this, but I teach at a Montessori school for financially disadvantaged children who are neurodivergent. We have a policy against aggressive behaviour or any punishment that comes across as a threat to the wellbeing of the kid's person or their belongings, and it fucking works. And maybe some of them are headed towards a life of ignominy no matter what but at least I can say that I did my best to ensure that they grow up into reasonably well adjusted people (accounting for their disability) who don't want to hurt other people because that would be wrong, and not because they'd be punished for it.

********* A, a fourth of the school isn't suspected of wrongdoing. That's just Harry's bias. Most of the government officials we see are from Slytherin, so clearly Slytherins aren't discriminated against overall. B, Dumbledore didn't write him off (look at the other person's comment for rebuttals on the bullying and parseltongue.) He said he was concerned about Tom's inclination for violence and cruelty, which any good teacher should be. You can approach a child with compassion while still acknowledging they have violent tendencies.

I get why you're passionate. I do. But I think you're convinced that your teaching methods are the only legitimate ones, and they're not. I was also a special education teacher in a school meant for kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, and our school-wide teaching model was a strict broken windows model which was counterbalanced by a generous reward philosophy. That worked for some kids, and it didn't for others. I also taught high schoolers and middle schoolers in a free range place where they directed their own learning and punishments consisted of a stern voice and little else, and that also worked for some kids and didn't for others. (The pattern I saw was that the latter worked more for kids who had a lot of structure in their home lives, and the former worked more for kids who didn't.) No one model works for all kids, no one model works for all teachers, and just because Dumbledore doesn't use your model doesn't mean he's a bad teacher.

*** I am so incredibly disappointed we didn't see McGonagall use combat transfiguration at the Battle of Hogwarts. She's an incredibly powerful and skilled witch. Your imagination is the limit when it comes to transfiguration, and she should have demonstrated that.

Transform nearby debris into angry wasps. Trees nearby become animated, growing faces with crooked teeth, roots turning into legs, bark turning into overalls, and somewhere nearby, a banjo starts playing...

** “The Battle of Gisenyi”, which is the chapter 83 of linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) is rather good in this regard. I have problems with its inclusion in the book (I think [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][it breaks the story]]), but if it was a standlone one-shot, it is one of the best magical battles I have ever read. And yes, that is one of the things where JKR chronically break the rule “show, don't tell” ... everybody always talk about how Dumbledore is a powerful wizard, but he is almost never seen doing anything.

** He's the one he ever feared because he's the only person he could never fool. He swooned all the other teachers and made all the other students either admire him or fear him and dumbledore was the only one who knew what he was and kept an eye on him, and dumbledore knew of his past too. You can see the fear when he returns to hogwarts as an adult and does the interview with dumbledore trying to get a teaching post and dumbledore just shuts him down and voldemort runs off.
