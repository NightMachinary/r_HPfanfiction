Shocking. On his 23rd birthday well two weeks after his wife Ginny went into labor With their first child James Sirius Potter. A full 10 hours after James had been delivered and Harry had held his son his right hand still aching from where his wife had nearly broken his index finger and thumb while screaming profanity and bloody murder at him cursing his name to the rafters. Promising never again but they both knew it would happen again Ginny wanted a girl after all.

​

Harry was letting his wife and son rest while he went to Sainsbury's down the road for a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee. When a surprise thunderstorm rolled in and lightning struck him. Fortunately there were quite a few Saint mungos Healers at this particular Muggle establishment. They had better coffee than the staff lounge at the Wizarding hospital. So it was a common exodus point for healers needing a break To take a breather perhaps .smoke and talk shop in the back alley of the shop with a cup of coffee and a sandwich in hand.

​

Harry potter was struck by lightning at 4:22 in the afternoon. His heart stopped for less than a minute before healers were upon him. Performing decompression and restarting his cardiovascular system. But before they did that he dropped face down onto the ground, And his spirit started to wander instead of darkness he saw a Quidditch pitch , With a stack of brooms beside him and his father in full Hogwarts Gryffindor uniform Looking expectantly at him gesturing to the Cleansweaps. Next to him.

​

It was a strange out of body experience but very informative his father James spent what seemed like hours just talking to him giving him as much as vice advice as he could on being a new father telling him flat out death had done this as a favor after the whole Voldemort incident. It seemed death felt she owed him For the whole saving the World incident and actually killing and then killing unkillable asshole . So helpfully arranged a near death experience with the god of thunderstorms so James got a few hours or moments in Harry's actual case of life it was only seconds to pass along some much-needed fatherly advice as he should've been able to Voldemort hadn't offed him Before Harry was even two.

​

So fatherly advice from beyond the grave had hairy regaining consciousness gasping for air in a Sainsburys with some melted cheese from his ham sandwich in bedded in his hair. But the first thing he did was not rushed to the hospital or even think the healers but inquire to one of the concerned cashiers were they kept the diapers. They would need a boatload of them it appeared
