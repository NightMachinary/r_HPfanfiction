So idk if anybody even knows what I'm talking about, but I'm looking for DZ2 twice blessed challenge fics or just good demigod Harry fics in general. These are some I can think of right now.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey]])

Are some of my favorite. I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.

  The Sea has many moods, many faces. This is mirrored by its children greatly. The icy seas shift and tide against the shore of a difficult path. Watch as a small ripple becomes a mighty typhoon in the world of monsters, gods, and demigods. Fem!Harry. Years One-Three, complete! Thanks for the support guys and gals!

  Every Half-Blood has one godly parent, this we know: however, Harry is different because of one reason: through the ways of the divine, he has more than one god for a parent - and those parents are NOT happy at being entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will. The solution is simple, give their son the power to make the whole shake and quiver. DISCONTINUED.
