I don't recall this ever coming up in canon. But I'm writing a fanfic and was wondering what the general thought was on whether the invisibility cloak would be rendered useless in the rain. Like in every movie clich√© where they only had to throw water (or even paint/flour) on the invisible person to find them... or if the cloak's magic some how sustained its invisibility even then.


** Assuming there's something to the whole Deathly Hallows thing rather than it just being an exceptionally made invisibility artifact, I'd say that Harry's invisibility cloak is less "invisibility" and more "hole in visual perception." As such, the observers brain would paper over any inconsistencies with rain or flour or whatever and still completely fail to see that someone was wearing the cloak.

Think of it like the holes in your vision where your optic nerves connect to your eyes. If you hit it at juuuust the right angle and you're looking for it, you might notice something, but for the most part your brain just nopes it out of existence.

But for regular invisibility cloaks? The ones made from demiguse hair or are just basically regular cloaks with disillusionment charms on them? Sure, if you're paying attention or its raining particularly hard, it should be pretty obvious someone is there.

*** Is Dumbledore able to spot the cloak in Hagrid's hut? I believe Moody is supposed to be able to see through it too.

**** Best theory I've read for that was elder wand-related shennanigans. Moody's eye seems to be unique - even people who would have a vested interest in being able to see through walls can't, and we know he's buddy-buddy with Dumbledore. So the potential is there that the eye was made using the elder wand.

Or it could just be that Moody is paranoid enough to spot the cloak even through the hole in his vision and Dumbledore seems like the type that would know his mind well enough to notice when it was playing silly buggers with him.

**** I was always under the impression that Mood couldn't see through the cloak, but that he, one, knew from Dumbledore Harry had the cloak, and two, there were other things that tipped him off to Harry being there.

Like when Harry dropped the golden egg, his foot was stuck in the trick stair, Moody couldn't see Harry, but could see through the stairs and just the part of his leg stuck in it, and put two and two together.

Then in the pub, didn't Ron or Hermione hand Harry a butterbeer under the table, either Harry's hand was momentarily visible, or again Moody made an educated guess when the butterbeer disappeared.

***** ...I really like this. Much more than thinking that Moody can see through a Hallow. Thanks :)

** It probably maybe has an IMPERTURBLE charm on it? Like the one Hermione put on his glasses in third year? :) That way water wouldn't even stick to it.

*** It could still be seen slipping off of something.
