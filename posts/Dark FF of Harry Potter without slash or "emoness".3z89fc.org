Hi, I know that there are a lot of similar threads with this theme but strangely they all have slash, not that I have something against homosexuals. So, if you can share FF that doesn't have slash it would be appreciated. e.e'


** Dunno if these are what you're looking for, but they're dark yet lacking slash and/or emoness, so... /Shrugs/

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** I just had an idea for a crazy satire fic - where Lily has twins, with James the father of one, and Snape the other. It does happen. But they'd have no idea, well at first, anyway.

**** No one ever thinks they would enjoy it. WBwL tends to be silly and terrible, plus all the other cliches it forces in....then subverts in such wonderful ways.

The problem with that plot bunny would be due to timing of Snape being an active DE and Lily in OotP. Plus no one can truly think of SS in that manner. Gross.

***** Wrong boy who lived? Not sure

That's why it'd be a unserious one! I find some of the most ridiculous ones hilarious to read - I just finished Make a Wish. I found myself giggling externally, and that's rare.

Maybe Snape polyjuices himself as part of an undercover op, and finds himself trapped, and can't escape without blowing his cover? I don't know, I can't write haha
