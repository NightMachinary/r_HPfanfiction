** Lomonaaeren's recent Litha to Lammas set has a nice one featuring Ravenclaw!Harry and eventual Harry/Theo:

*** Another from the same author, I don't love this one because it doesn't feature enough magic in my opinion, but it's entirely Harry/Theo:

Edit: Sorry, I forgot this one is Gryffindor!Harry, not what you asked for.

  Not expecting that he would get a response, Theo sent Harry a gift to tell him how much he admired him for his defeat of Voldemort. And then, wonder of wonders, Harry replied. The tale of two people learning to see each other.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.
