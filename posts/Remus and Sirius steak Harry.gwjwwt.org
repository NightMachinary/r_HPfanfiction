So I read a fic once, and I want to read it again, but I can't find it, so the plot is Remus is walking in a park and he sees Harry playing in a playground and then talks to this girl who's secretly a witch but had suppressed magic which is why she didn't go to Hogwarts, and she is raising Hermione because she is her sister and their parents are dead, and then they steal Harry because of the Dursley's abuse, and then they break Sirius out of prison and Sirius gets a love interest and then Draco is given to them and then Sirius and Love interest have a baby.


** I suppose that Remus on a full moon might turn Harry into steak, but I can't see Sirius going along with it.
