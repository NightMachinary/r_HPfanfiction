Need some good reading material for my lonely nights this Winter. I'm mostly looking for convincing alternate ending fics (maybe even written before the series ended), and Harry/Ginny fics where they get together a little earlier in the series. Also enjoy good next gen stories. Recommend away...

The Seventh Horcrux by Melindaleo guessed lots of things correctly about the seventh book and it holds up pretty well despite its age.

Also, for canon-compliant marauders, missing moment and next-gen stories check out FloreatCastellum on AO3 and tumblr. She's the best when it comes to canon compliant stories. She's one of the few authors who just get Harry's character right.

Annerb's stories are a little bit AU but in style she's pretty close to canon too.

** If you've never read linkffn(Grow Young With Me), it's book compliant, but not with the epilogue. If you read it (and you should) you'll find out about that. It's an amazing story.

Another post-Hogwarts alternate epilogue story I really enjoyed was linkffn(Vitam Paramus). If you want some kind of expansion on the world of quidditch, as well as a well written story, definitely give it a go.

I don't have much in the way of Harry/Ginny, since I'm not a big fan of it, and I've not really delved into next-gen, probably because I'm scared that the authors will take the horror that was the Cursed Child as canon.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
