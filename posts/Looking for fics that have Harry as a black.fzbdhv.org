I'm looking for complete over 60k words where Harry is a black when his parents and Sirius are kids. I don't mind if it's time travel or if Harry was born in that time I just want Harry to be a black during that time period. Thank you

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
