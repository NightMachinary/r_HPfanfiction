An /in media res/ prompt. I don't intend for this to be the beginning of the story.

To be clear, "Strongest wizard" in this context has more to do with a child's admiration for their parent, than any personal power on the part of Lucius Malfoy.


** The Dark Lord spoke curtly. Two words--an insane command, if it could be interpreted as such. His cracked lips were pulled in a rictus grimace, and he was staring daggers at Draco.

Draco stiffened his upper lip, but looked down at the Dark Lord's chin, then down at his table. He glanced at a young girl that had just joined them. "Miss," he said. Then he gulped and looked down at his hands. "Before," he managed in a quiet voice.

Draco could feel heat from the intensity of the Dark Lord's stare, now. He began to speak. Draco's breath hitched and his heartrate leapt.

"Hit. You've sunk my Battleship."

** Instead of Bellatrix throwing the knife that killed Dobby in Malfoy Manor, it was thrown by Draco just as Harry and the rest were sent to Shell Cottage: Lucius remembered the pure admiration Dobby held for Harry Potter, and he for the miserable elf, he knew Potter probably wouldn't let this go unanswered. He knew Draco's days were numbered, they didn't call Potter the Baba Yaga for nothing.

*** Alternatively: Draco saw the knife in Bellatrix's hand a split second before she raised it. His body reacted to what was about to happen before his mind could even process it. Before he knew it, he was staring at his aunt's unconscious form, blinking the remnants of red light from his eyes. Only then did he register his raised wand, and the wide, terrified eyes of his parents.

*** "Draco, what have you done?" Draco never knew Father to show his temper so wildly, or in such an emotionally confused way. Draco's mask never faltered.

"I suppose that's payback for some of Potter's insolence."

"Draco... How do I explain this..." Father smothered his face in an expression of grief, and what little colour in his cheeks seemed to be gone when he removed his hand. "Draco. That was Dobby, correct?"

"Potter's insane house elf, yeah."

"/Potter's/ house elf, Draco. Do you not understand?"

"What's the big deal? It's just a stupid house elf."

"Draco..." Father shook his head and ventured to the fireplace, grabbing a handful of Floo powder and calling Headmaster Snape's office. Green flame illuminated the Malfoy Manor study.

"Lucius, I am very busy at--"

"Severus, Draco has done something I fear I cannot protect him from."

"Pray tell," Snape drawled, "what has Draco done that could possibly be worse than loosing a group of Death Eaters to run amok in the halls of Hogwarts?"

"He killed Potter's house elf."

"Oh."

** Lucius' shoulders were slumped, his head cradled in his hands, his usually flawless blonde hair in disarray from running his fingers through it so many times.

Draco was beginning to wish he'd never shared his plans with his father.

"Let me make sure I am understanding you perfectly clearly, Draco," said Lucius through gritted teeth. "Of all the ways you could have chosen of displeasing the Dark Lord, you have used this...what did you call it...'whoopee cushion'? Not just a puerile practical joke, but a puerile Muggle practical joke?"

Draco shifted in his seat uncomfortably. "Well, Father, you see, somebody placed one underneath Snape's chair in the Potions dungeon last year, and everyone found it hilarious...perhaps the reason the Dark Lord is so angry all the time is that he needs some levity in his life. I just thought..."

"That is the problem, Draco. You clearly did not just think!" Lucius interrupted. "Go upstairs, now. Begin your packing."

Draco looked at him blankly. "Packing?"

"Yes, packing," said Lucius, finally looking up at his son. His face was a picture of terror. "We are going away, as far as we can. If the Dark Lord ever discovers who placed the cushion, we are as good as dead. I would rather live out my days somewhere where even he cannot find us. Go. Now. I will inform your mother."

As Draco left and ascended to his room, he muttered to himself, "It's only a fart noise. I bet even the Dark Lord laughs when someone lets off."

I'm sure there are fans who like Draco a whole lot more than I do, but I do find him a fascinating character to explore in fanfiction. Most fanfics paint him as a bigoted moron. Some paint him as someone legitimately dangerous. Some paint him as someone redeemable, especially if he gets away from his father.

** I would like to point out that /in medias res/ is *not* "have a few scenes/a prologue in the future and then start the story from the beginning".

In medias res involves the story starting from the middle with minimal exposition, with the reader having no clue what in the world is going on, slowly piecing together the past using context clues. Flashbacks can be used, but the less of them the better since they can completely break the narrative flow.

2. Draco jinxes or pranks Harry in some way before he goes in to the Tri-Wizard First Task enclosure, Harry dies or is grievously wounded.

3. Draco uses his authority as Inquisitorial Squad member to tyrannise students, leading to i.e. a child dying or people leaving the school en-masse, getting Umbridge fired -- essentially he's leaned /too far/ into the role and now he's ruined Umbridge's plans.

4. He retaliates against Harry after the Sectumsempra incident -- he ambushes Harry and takes him to the Dark Lord but everyone knows it was Draco, so he is persona non grata for the rest of his life.
