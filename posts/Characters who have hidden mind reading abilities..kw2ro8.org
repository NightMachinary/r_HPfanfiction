I've been reading fanfic for a few years, and one thing that has always bothered me was how characters just... read minds? Like, they take a glance at someone's eyes and they suddenly know exactly what they are feeling. It might be that my social skills are not the sharpest, but I can't guess emotions by looking at another's eyes. Does anyone know why this is?

An example would be 'She looked at him and saw the anger in his eyes, but also a hint of amusement'.


** Eyes are something that people have put too much stock into with respect to writing. Particularly in Harry potter fanfic where they go into his "emerald green orbs" or "Avada Kedavra piercing eyes".

I don't think you can really glean much from a person's eyes unless they are about to cry. If you want to read a person's mind or what they are feeling or going to say, the face always gives a better tell. Facial expressions like twitching, being unable to look at you, looking down, frowns, worry lines, these are the things that will help a person out more.

No one actually stares into another person's eyes in real life. It's a bit unsettling if you do it for too long and generally you need to be fairly close to do it, so yeah.

*** Well yeah but in Harry Potter it's canon that you can read the mind through the eyes

***** I know, but I like to imagine that every time this stupid writing trope happens. The character is literally reading minds. I was kind of tired when I originally responded. It's like "She saw anger swimming in his dark eyes" Shit, get up the Occlumency shields quick!

** As the eyes are a reflection of one's inner emotions (I guess?), maybe they just summarise the entire process of looking at a person's facial expressions and body language by simply gazing into one's eyes and noting the final inference. Although this would be an instance of telling and not showing.

** I feel like it's just part of 'The Eyes are the Windows to the Soul'. But frankly, its always made more sense to me to explain how characters see emotions in others based on facial expressions. Either way, facial expressions along with the eyes are rather big giveaways for emotions unless someones mattered a poker face (and tbf, not many people do). Dilation of the pupils can indicate happiness, excitement, several positive emotions (or that it's a dark area) while the pupils shrinking would be the opposite. Keep in mind these are overall subtle shifts but could be pointed out nothenless.

But yeah, I've never understood the focus on eyes rather than expressions either.

**** That's not what the author of the post is referencing. More writing than just HP stuff uses the emotion through eyes thing.

** Honestly I write stuff like that but I don't know if it's only in fiction or if I'm just broken but I can't see emotions in people's eyes.

Tears maybe, but all emotional clues I get are from body language and faces if they're expressive

** It's okay when only the characters with good social skills and/or legilimency can do that. And fail to do so on characters with occlumency skills.
