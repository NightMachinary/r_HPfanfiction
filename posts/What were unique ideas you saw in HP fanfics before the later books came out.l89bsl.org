** Check out Angie Astravic's work. The ideas expressed there are pretty unique and part of it is due to being finished before OOTP came out.

*** Angie's an old name I didn't expect to hear. She was one of my favourites. I especially like her Harmless and Easily Domesticated fic. She does have a few groaners in humour.

There was a story called The Sorting Hat (I'll try to find the link later) where the when the hat is put on a person's head all four founders discuss which house it should go in. Can't remember when it came out though.

There was a lot of debate over the Order of the Phoenix and who was in it. Some people had a lot of OC's in there.

** Damn. I can't think of any names off the top of my head(although Angie Astravic is definitely one, someone already mentioned her).

Although, there is one but it doesn't /exactly/ fit your Ask. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/327164/chapters/527529][Eclipse]] is really good. It's drarry and is set around fifth or sixth year. It's been a hot sec since I've read it, but it's really good and there's the perfect amount of fluff.
