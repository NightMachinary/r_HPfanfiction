...that doesn't have Ron bashing? Or Hermione bashing? Or Dumbledore bashing?

I'm currently reading A Cadmean Victory. And its pretty good honestly, if only it didn't bash all the above three characters. Especially poor Ron.(though, it doesn't make any of them as unbelievable as most bashing fanfics do, I'll give it that)


** Ingenio ab Artifex doesn't really bash anyone, though it is first person and contains underage sex (but not graphic, it's literally just shit like "And we had a great thirty minutes together").

There's also Hope and Healing, which is currently updating and I don't recall it having any bashing. Maybe a little acknowledgement that Dumbledore fucked up vis a vis the Dursleys in places, but no invention of non-existent faults to make him seem worse or anything.

**** No u <3

:D

Am I right about the no-bashing of anybody thing? I haven't been keeping up too well - I think I'm back at about chapter 3 or 4-ish? I know you've updated quite a lot since then, but I haven't found the time to sit down and read the rest yet. Looking forward to it though, been a while since a good new Harry-Fleur fic came out (and kept updating :D).

***** Oh goodness. Lots has happened since then, hope you get a chance to catch up!

And yes, you are. Spot on about the Dumbledore bit too. I try to avoid bashing if at all possible

****** Heh. Given how much the definition varies across the fandom, that's always a difficult possibility to manage. I still remember the rather enlightening read of a thread I posted on that a month ago (link below, if you're interested). It's ridiculously interesting how relative bashing can be in such small but important ways.

And I hopefully will over the next month or two - I'll be travelling more often and thus getting stuck in train delays more often. It'll be nice to have a decent block of fic to read on my public transport rides/delays. Northern Rail is a bitch. :)

** Heart and Soul didn't have any Hermione bashing since it was a Harry/Fleur/Hermione story.

The Stag and the Flower is a post DH WIP and I don't recall any bashing beyond the set up required.
