One is a language and the other is a speak of the language. I can't wrap my head around why this is such a common issue.


** Considering just how many people tend to confuse /Your/ with /You're/, is it really that surprising that two fantasy concepts are confused?

*** I consider myself a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, but not necessarily a fan of the English language. I put a proportional amount of research into both. I find the lack of knowledge of the parseltongue / parselmouth distinction more disturbing than the you're/your typo in Harry Potter fanfiction, if only because to be a fan of something is to follow it and try to know it.

English is a tool, but the Harry Potter series is a passion. Or, at least a fun pastime. I use one, and take pleasure from the other. I expect the same treatment from people who claim to write fiction about it from the position of being a fan.

**** Without a good tool use, even passions can suffer.

I don't know, I guess it's because I'm not a native speaker, and I make a decent effort in using the language as it should be (Though I know I fail sometimes), so when I see errors like that, it pisses me off that others don't make that same effort.

Same disturbance, different approach, maybe?

** Yeah! Though my biggest pet peeve is when someone writes Creature instead of Kreacher like, Merlins beard it's his name! Read the book or whatever

*** The name puns painfully deconstructed are one of my pet peeves as well.

Like, the Creature/Kreacher thing is the point of his name. That's the whole joke.

Nocturne alley and Diagonal alley are the absolute worst, though. Also McGonagle and Quirrelle. They sound like chinese bootlegs.

*** Literally! Also when they type out the full name of a character, but don't research it well enough and we end up with something like Virginia/Ginerva Weasley or Hermione Jane Granger. It takes only 5 seconds to google it

*** To be fair, "Kreattur" is Kreacher's name in the French version, one of the few names who are kinda translated in the book. No excuse for the spelling, but Kreattur is prononced exactly the same than "Creature" in French so if someone only watched the movie in VF, it's not so strange he wrote it like it.

** Il est un Français. Il parle Français.

He is English. He speaks English.

I think given stuff like that I can see why people get confused, and it's a far lesser infelicity than some of the sheer lazy fuckwittitude that I see people perpetrate about geography.

** Well, they both sound pretty similar, and parseltongue is used more in the books IIRC. I could see why someone would use it interchangeably for both the language and the speaker without thinking too much about it.

Plus, Parselmouth is kind of a weird one. The more I focus on the word, the less I like it :|

Parseltongue is the language, a parselmouth is a speaker of the language. The books are a lot of things, but they aren't internally inconsistent.

Okay, not really. Parselmouths are people who can speak Parseltongue, the magical language of snakes.
