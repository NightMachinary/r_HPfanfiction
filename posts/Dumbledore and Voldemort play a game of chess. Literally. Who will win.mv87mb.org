** Considering Voldemort is pretty much insane... And after his mind slipped he became much less planned, and much more...unpredictable. I don't even know. They're kind of on even ground here I think. But voldie wouldn't have the patience I don't think.

** If it's not bullet chess or at least blitz, Voldemort doesn't stand a chance.

** Wizards or normal. I remember there was a fic where Voldemort compared his followers to chess pieces to use and sacrifice and when Severus reported the meeting back we got an awesome Dumbledore quote something along the line of "It is at times like these that Voldemort reveals his muggle mindset. As you know Severus, in wizards chess the pieces are alive."
