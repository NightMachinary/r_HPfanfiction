** The muggle incident with Ariana was staged, the muggle boys were there on the account of Octavius Keferson. Keferson was an old school bully who wanted to get back at Mr Dumbledore for causing his expulsion from Hogwarts. Keferson sent the three muggle boys, who happened to be his nephew and friends, to pick on Ariana in the hopes of sparking a magical attack. For such an offence Keferson was sure he could get young Ariana banned from Hogwarts.

The situation backfired and Keferson soon learnt of the grevious injury of his nephew by the hands of Mr Dumbledore. Keferson took advantage of the situation, his nephew taking a tumble down the hill into a rose bush after Mr Dumbledore yelled at him. It only took a few false details and forged death certificate to convince the courts Mr Dumbledore had in fact killed the poor muggle boy and sentence him to life in Azkaban.

Keferson's only oversight was the small key factor he forgot. Ariana was not an only child. And Aberforth Dumbledore happened to witness a very interesting series of events that were very different from the courts records. However justice for the Dumbledore family could not be found. Amongst the struggle to keep their family together Keferson slipped away without consequence.

Of course Albus would think Abe was making things up, Albus was always so sure he was correct, never willing to accept his mistakes until his later years of life. Aberforth had sworn his vengence though. July 7, 1947 Aberforth found Keferson, a hog animagus hiding amongst others in a zoo, bathing in the luxury the keepers offered. It was too easy to take the pig of a mans head. And only so much easier to mount on a wall on the side of a pub. The head always facing the Hogwarts he lost, never in the sights of poor ariana.
