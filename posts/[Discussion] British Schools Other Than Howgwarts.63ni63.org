So I was thinking about the fact that each class at Hogwarts consists of 40 students (10 to a house), and that just does not seem to be enough to school all the magical children of Britain.

If you assume that the average witch/wizard lives to 150 (with enough living past that to make up for those who die younger), at 40 kids/year, that's only 6,000 witches and wizards in all of Britain. That just seems too low, honestly. I could see the population being as low as 10,000, especially with the Grindelwald and Voldemort wars occurring relatively close together, but even that's much greater than 6,000, plus you'd think that that wouldn't impact the number of new wizards born each year. Although my headcanon is that the population is anywhere from 15,000 to maybe 100,000.

Anyways, if only 40 kids are admitted to Hogwarts each year, then there must be other children that receive educations elsewhere. If there weren't, the native population of magical Britain would be in decline. Hell, it should've already been in equilibrium around 6,000 if Hogwarts is 1,000 years old.

My guess is that there'd be a couple other schools that have similar enrollment numbers to Hogwarts, the exact number of those schools depending on the population (for example, at 20,000, there'd be about 133 kids born/year, while at 90,000, there'd have to be about 600 born/year). Hogwarts takes only 40 of those kids, and the rest go to the other schools.

What do you guys think the educational setup is for the rest of the magical kids in Britain?


** I think it quite probable that some of the Darker families send their children to Durmstrang; other families may send theirs to Beauxbatons. There are also innumerable smaller schools that are not counted among the Eleven Schools.

Homeschooling is certainly an option, and I shouldn't be surprised if a great many wizards are home-schooled. It fits right in with the general history of magic as we know it: a secretive art, with knowledge passed from master to apprentice throughout the generations. Correspondence courses are probably also common.

Remember too, Rowling was famously bad at maths; in all likelihood, the Hogwarts class size should be quite different. Canonically, there are 35-36 students per House Year.

*** Yeah I forgot to mention it, but homeschooling does seem to be a likely option. You gotta wonder exactly how the Hogwarts students are chosen though, it must suck for those who're left out.

Not too sure about how many would send their kids abroad, though, as that's probably pretty expensive and the kids might want to stay abroad with their friends and colleagues, which just leads to the same population drain.

Rowling's number issues do seem to be pretty bad lol, although maybe she just didn't want to write down names and houses for more than 40 kids, half of whom weren't even really used lol. If it were upped to 40 kids per house per year you'd have a perfectly reasonable native population of about 24,000.

Also, thanks for pointing me to the whole Eleven Schools thing, had no idea that even existed.

**** People could just deny their Hogwarts acceptance in favor of home schooling too. Read the story of Isolt Sayre and Gormlaith Gaunt. I really liked that bit of additional canon, even it goes even furthur in the black/white tones that everything is portrayed in.

In Canon, Hagrid came and forced the issue, so we don't know how it goes for muggle born really. I dont think that all the parents would be convinced to send their children off to a place they cant ever visit or talk to others about just on the basis of some random funky man/woman coming and putting on some shows and taking them to a magical alley. There would have to have been dissenters and disbelievers and haters. Short of making them forget everything and think their child goes to some prestigious school and use some magic to keep them from asking questions, I don't see how it would be possible.

And of course we know magicals who would prefer home schooling for many reasons, like not wanting to be associated with muggleborns, cost, inconvinience or even just tradition and preference.

*** True, Hogwarts is supposed to be this innumerably large castle, yet we've only gotten as far as seven floors into it, I think? Also, how are there no 'Wizarding Specialisation Tests' for Hogwarts students? One would think that it would be mandated by the Ministry, given how intrusive they are with everything else (your wand being the prime example). I was hoping that we would get five more years of Hogwarts based on that premise, with Harry sort of getting into more esoteric fields of Magic, learning more advanced techniques and spells, learning what field of magic he is truly meant for, etc... While struggling through the aftermath of the war, and the rising threats of New Dark Lords following Voldemort's lead and example.

** There has been a calculation made that predicted the population around 15.000 british wizards and witches.

Rowling once said that Hogwarts houses around 1000 students (~142/year). So one explanation would be that the year of 91 was an exceptionally low populated one, maybe due to the dire time during which they were conceived. We never really get good estimates on other years, so data is hard to come by.

However, if you set your numbers somewhere around the 100k citizen mark, other schools or education paths are a necessity.

I personally like the idea that one big additional branch of education are Master-Apprentice relationships. A Master would be responsible for the thorough education of the Apprentice to at least OWL levels, and may optionally lead his student to NEWTS. However, the purpose of this arrangement is to train a young magical in the craft or magic branch the Master is proficient in.

I also once read the idea that Diagon Alley, the Ministry, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are just the closest the wizarding world gets towards the muggles and muggleborns. Its the world in-between the muggle one and the world of real, profound magic. These other enclaves are more insular and have their own schools, with knowledge they defend viciously.

Another idea, of course, is that there are just a lot of other schools around Britain that are freely accessible.

There really is no limit once you separate from strict canon.

*** Yeah I saw the 1000 student figure somewhere too, but then if 91 was only 40 kids... who knows? I definitely think the war would be a good explanation if 91's an outlier.

The Apprenticeship idea sounds interesting and honestly pretty plausible. I mean, I recall there being opportunities for further education after Hogwarts, and always imagined that there'd be a wizarding equivalent for a college education in a specific field, but craftsmen might have a different system outside of standardized education.

The idea of the magical society we see in the books being an almost in-between world blending some muggle elements with a fully magical people is kinda iffy for me though. I mean, it kinda lessens the significance of the plot if Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort et al. weren't really all they were cracked up to be in the grand scheme of things and there was a more arcane society with its own leaders that outclassed them. Plus, I always saw the magical world in Harry Potter as an evolution of that more mystical magical world after the Statute of Secrecy prevented muggles from interacting with wizards nearly as much. The magical world developed just as the muggle one did, just in a slightly different way ofc. It'd be an interesting idea for an AU though.

And yeah, deviating from canon is half the fun in (reading) fanfics for me. As long as it's done well, it's usually a fresh take on exploring the world and characters in a different way.

**** Yeah, unfortunately the execution of the second idea wasn't very good when I read it. But I did like the idea that there are communities out there that are even more isolated and insular than the wizarding world muggleborns and muggle-raised see at first. I think the idea there came from the fact that a lot of Magical Britain just wasn't very /magical/. I explicitly remember that the author wrote that Ottery St.Catchpole was such a community. When Harry went over the hill to the house of the Diggorys, he'd found a village of a thousand people, a small school that specializes in magical farming, Care of magical creatures and herbology, as well as just a community of magical farmers who all think that Arthur Weasley should've really put his foot down and make at least some of his children go to school in Ottery. Harry then finds enclaves who are even stranger, and had their roots much deeper in british history. Runesmiths who were direct descendants of the last Vikings in the North of Scotland. Enclaves that still practiced druidism. And all of it was a world you weren't invited to if you didn't already know about it.

There was never really talk about there being just way better wizards and witches in those communities than Dumbledore or Grindelwald. They just had different sets of traditions and focused more on some magic. The sheer talent and power of Dumbledore was still respected and admired by them, even if he was taught in a culture that was closer to muggles than they were.

Anyway, I liked the idea, but the execution was sub-par.

** We have this lovely article: [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm]]

Author of that agrees that Harry's year is small, as are the ones around it. Their conclusion based on derivations from muggle culture (so many people per pub in a town, so many workers vs upper admin in Ministry, Qdt World Cup info) is that Magical UK ~ 10,000. Rougly 1:6000 wizard to muggle. /In the UK./

Also he suggests that Hogsmeade is a bustling mini metro of 2000. My problem with this is that Hogsmeade must basically be the cultural hub of Wizarding UK. Yet Diagon Alley has more pull and a wider variety of shops. I think his Hogsmeade numbers are a bit off. Still, he contends that kids from Hogsmeade would be day students (they 'live out') and therefore wouldn't crowd Hermione's dorm. OH! THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!

... Except during Harry's 5th year when Umbridge is carefully controlling access to the school. Would one of her decrees be 'for security reasons, everyone resides'?

[Forgot the chart]

Amongst muggle humans (based on 2000 Census figures)...

- 22% are under 11
- 16% are 11-18 [Hogwarts school age]
- 44% are between 19 and 50
- leaving ~ 18% being 50 or older. This is also when women start outnumbering men

So if 16% of the magical population in the UK and total UK magi population ~10,000... but wait. We should drop their percentage to 12% - due to extended lifespans adding to the over 50 set. 12% of 10,000 = 1200 students of Hogwarts age. Looks like at most half of them are going to Hogwarts.

** For my headcanon, there are a bunch of academies spread throughout the country where small clusters of teachers do their best to cover the basics of Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology, Potions and Care of Creatures. Their programs aim to get the students to pass at least three OWLs by the time they're adults so that they can legitimately carry a wand and get licensed for Apparation and such. The most gifted will be encouraged to try for a NEWT or two.

The value of the NEWT is for the application for apprenticeship to a Master or to work in the Ministry, and obviously these aren't the ones who normally would make it as Aurors.

Since they are generally rural & community-based, their attendance is limited to half-bloods and purebloods, though if a muggleborn were to show up in their range, they'd offer them a spot- partly because they'd suspect someone locally had been 'plying the fields' and just never went back to explain why their poor paramour's child has devil powers.

By contrast, Hogwarts is the Eton/Oxford of schools, though the entrance isn't limited by tuition cost so much as talent and ambition (or legacy).

EDIT: In fact, it could be that Hogwarts only detects and registers the most promising of muggleborns with the rest being referred to nearby academies. The ones we know of were notable (though the fact that they're notable enough for Harry to notice them might invalidate the argument). Lily and Hermione were top students, Dean was an artist, Penny Clearwater was a prefect, Justin Finch-Fletchley came from wealth and education, even the Creevey brothers were audacious in their way, with Colin figuring out the nuances of magical photography in his first year without any guidance.

** Any solution that claims that there are other British schools than Hogwarts needs to answer two questions:

(1) How come Hogwarts accepts Muggleborns? If Hogwarts is so good and so prestigious, why would they turn up wizards and witches for people that have no magical training?

(2) How come the kids of society's elite also go there? Especially those prejudiced against these muggle borns? If homeschooling was an option, for example, why wouldn't the rich just homeschool their kids?

I haven't found any fic that addresses both of these questions well because, to be fair, I don't know if there is even a solution. Until then, my headcannon can't support there being more than 1 magic school in the UK.

*** I believe that the logic would be thus:

(1) Hogwarts accepts Muggleborns because the current Headmaster is famously pro-muggleborn, as were several of the Founders. They're not passing over pure-bloods or half-bloods for Muggleborns, either; from what we've seen, the school doesn't appear to limit the number of students it accepts (there seems to be little evidence to the contrary). The only school that does not accept Muggleborns is Durmstrang, insofar as I am aware.

(2) Because Hogwarts, despite the pro-Muggle sentiment, is lauded as "the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world," according to one (admittedly biased) source. Regardless, it has produced two of the three greatest wizards in the past century: Voldemort and Dumbledore, and continues to graduate competent young wizards and witches. Protesting blood purity is all very well, up until it costs you something (like a quality education).

Furthermore, chances are that the old families have attended Hogwarts since time immemorial; it's something of a status symbol/tradition, and not something they are likely to stop doing. Sending children abroad is taxing in many ways; many wizards and witches have neither the time nor the inclination nor the skill to teach their own children. Hogwarts is also where competent young pure-bloods can begin to form power bases and friendships that will be beneficial in the future.

***** By all accounts, most people do go to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the largest magical school in the United Kingdom, and most people go there. Some extremists probably don't for the very reasons you listed, but the vast majority of wizards do.

Any other schools would be very small, with probably less than a score of students, and they'd offer something that Hogwarts didn't: they'd be close to home, obsessive about blood purity, or offer instruction in more obscure (or illegal) branches of magic. They exist because they offer a more palatable alternative to homeschooling or schooling abroad. It's much like wondering why private schools exist when state schools already do.

** I like the educational setup described in linkffn(The Marriage Stone). Wizards have a very large population than described in the books. Hogwarts is for the cream of the crop in terms of magical ability. After that, there are more "regular" schools that are day or boarding, vocational schools, and then homeschooling for those with barely any magic. This setup is also hinted at in linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

I think this makes sense, since people do seem to have varying ranges of magical ability (ex: Stan Shunpike vs Severus Snape) and it makes sense to separate that way to better educate adolescents. I think canon has a similar setup, with Hogwarts and 3-4 more day/vocational schools that are a bit more local to an area. Also, parents would send their kids abroad if they wished.

** The whole question can be traced back to economics though. [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/60918/what-is-the-economic-system-of-the-potterverse]] has a great summary of what it probably is (tldr its "post-scarcity economy" combined with "late feudal/early bourgeois trade system")

I say this because you have to trace where everyone gets their employment from, resources from, etc. You have a huge government, a sports league that has many teams and lots of players, and lots of rich old families, for some easy examples.

If we assume that people 1) specialize and 2) have an economy based on magical skill combined with resource ownership/manipulation, then we see that we have a school that gives basic education (OWLs) and then a societal path ends up becoming that apprentice-ship based post-scarcity world we know of (all these trade shops utilizing resources, as an example). NEWTs are a way of specializing, and you can either in the public arena or private arena (ministry or business, pretty much).

So, I think that there are lots of kids at Hogwarts, and based on how the society works, has pretty much everyone go to hogwarts but with very different results afterward, and decisions made in it (what classes are taken, tests passed etc)

The point is that you have to run this economy that we see glimpses of (huge gov, businesses, social and economic classes, communities). I don't have a number to tell you for how many students should be at Hogwarts, but I think that there always will be a steady % of Britain's overall population that is magic, and that number has to be enough to service all that Magical England has going on.

** One of the great things about Potterverse is that JKR left a lot of wriggle room. Nothing in canon disputes the existence of other English schools. (In fact, the fact there is whole bureaucracy around magical education, examinations and discipline, means that there is, at the very least, a large number of homeschooled children.)

Personally, I favour a larger wizarding Britain (as is reflected by wizarding society's popular culture, infrastructure and government). This means multiple schools -- although Hogwarts is presumably the most reputable. These other schools would likely have a higher proportion of muggleborns and/or specialise in certain fields.
