Join Harry's daughter at her first year at Hogwarts which house will she be in and who will she meet will she get a boyfriend and what will she do


** First of all, this summary needs work. You should ensure correct grammar and spelling in the summary and you're mission quite a few commas and periods. Second, the title is a bit unimaginative. Third, Lily only has one "l" between the I and y. The summary as a whole could use some work because those are pretty much the basic questions about a first year. What makes your story unique?

*** Look I wrote this at ten pm and I was tired!!! When I wrote this it had all the right punctuation and after I read it I thought it wasn't right either. What should I name it? It's quite hard to think of a title before you have even wrote the story! What makes my story unique? Um let me think I haven't even written the story but please give me tips for my story because it's my first time writing one!

**** Probably the most important thing to have is a reason for a prospective reader to choose your story over the plethora of others, some thing unique and grabbing, whether it be an intriguing character or an AU event. Thinking of that kind of thing also tends to help gain some structure while developing the story, hope this helps even a little.

** Really? One of the most important thing about the story is "Will she get a boyfriend?" She's eleven years old! At least wait until 3rd or 4th year. Who will she meet? Well, presumably she'll meet all the same character that we already know about. Other than the obvious gender change, what makes your Lily different? Why should we be interested?

And lastly: if you want us to review your work, providing a link would help.

*** A note, it's Harry's daughter, so we don't really know who she will meet, also there's no gender change as compared to canon, because again, it's Harry's daughter.

Also I remember 5th grade (age 10/11) as the age people were into dating and getting boyfriends/girlfriends and that kind of stuff so I wouldn't say it's too early for dating to be realistic. Maybe to be interesting for the reader, but there's no reason to wait as long as it's not the backbone of the story.

**** Ah, right. Next-gen. I typically ignore next-gen fics, and so I didn't realize that was the topic. My apologies to the OP.

I guess my school was different. Although I remember having a crush or two around grade five, I don't recall anyone dating. But I may have simply forgotten, or not known. Further, in canon, I don't remember any relationships until 3rd or 4th year. Of course, that doesn't mean there wasn't.

Regardless, I don't think it should be such an important thing that it is used as part of the summary. Unless, I suppose it is a romance. Which I also tend to avoid. So, I guess my personal bias is showing again. So, really, I suppose maybe the OP should completely ignore my first post as irrelevant.

*** Look!!! Well this is me writing the story not J K Rowling so I can change some things. Also you can get a boyfriend when ever you want there is no age limit. My sister has a boyfriend and she is six years old but my other sister hasn't got one and she is nineteen! I am new to this and I don't know how to add a link. Please still give me tips for my story though thank you
