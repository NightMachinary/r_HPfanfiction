** linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel) is about a Hermione who time travels back to 1981 in an attempt to stop Voldemort. Her only problem? She's a toddler.

I know you asked for longer fics and this is only ~30, but I remember it as a good read so I thought I'd mention it anyway.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  “If I do this, you won't have done anything, Harry. You won't exist. You'll probably never exist.” Hermione coughed roughly, the damp irritating her lungs. “None of this will have happened.”Hermione has lost everyone and everything in the war. Left with only one terrible choice, she honors Harry's sacrifice and goes back to change history - back to when it started, back to Hogwarts, and back to the dark days of the first Order. With no friends or allies, she finds herself at the mercy of a very different Albus Dumbledore and must carry out her mission in the face of another great wizarding war. Can she manage to fight her own demons and offer life to another? ca1926Goes AU somewhere in the middle of Book 6. It will be obvious as the story develops.

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M.
