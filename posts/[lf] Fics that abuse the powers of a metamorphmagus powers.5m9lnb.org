I mean think about how badass it would be to be a metamorphmagus your practically immortal save for an ak which could be negates by a horcrux (because you totally would not carry a horcrux with your metamorphmagus self) not that you would do that cut move your body blood loss shuffle that liver cancer rip it out with your goddamn hand dammit why is the extent of the abuse off this to turn harry into a lily Evans clone or to make tonks look Asian I mean just damn.

TL:DR abuse the powers of metamorphmagi for something other than being transgender


** The most obvious form of abuse would be an amazing life of crime. I wonder if metamorph abilities go down to the fingerprints? You know, for secure Muggle facilities.

Seconding how on earth does metamorphagus = immortal? That makes no sense.

*** I think OP is saying "if you're shot, just rearrange your organs", which tbf i have no idea if it's possible in canon. Like if a metamorph became a (muggle) doctor, would they know enough about their body to change internal organs?

**** I just don't think it would work that way. Nor do I think they could give themselves a sex change - they could probably make their external genitalia look right, but ovaries would still be ovaries, not testicles. And males couldn't create a womb.

Of course, who knows if JKR ever put much thought into it.

Do we know if metamorphmagic only affects appearances?

I don't remember anything about that (and I don't think JK actually considered the question while writing canon). I don't know if she's said anything in interviews after the fact.

****** We actually don't, so it's pure speculation. Some people say it obviously does because ... I'm not sure what their reasons are; other people say that metamorphmagic is kind of like the Polyjuice so obviously one can change everything or close to it.

It's really up to whoever is writing it, in the end.

Pretty much my only requirement in a fic is that it needs to be complete, though activly updating fics are OK. I'm not a fan of slash either. I do make the occasional exception however.

So I guess they weren't pregnant concurrently? Because they wouldn't be able to get the second one pregnant after the first one was.

******* I honestly couldn't tell you the name or anything else. I'm not even sure if it's just Honks or if it's Harry/Tonks/someone else. I remember Tonks saying something about there being an "other" checkbox for sex, and her training him in his meta powers. They both decide that having each other's baby sounds awesome. That's honestly about all I can clearly recall from that fic. I can almost guarantee it was a completed fic and most likely over 20,000 words, since that's what I mostly read. That should help thin the list somewhat.

*** If you're talking about Hero Harry, sequel to Brutal Harry, it was actually left ambiguous as to whether or not she died in that scene. For those who haven't read the fic, after getting hit by multiple curses, including a blood boiling curse, Tonks proceeds to transmute various non essential organs such as her digestive tract and reproductive organs into blood and other raw materials as she forcefully expels the damaged flesh.

** How on Earth does being a metamorphmagus make you immortal? AFAIK they still grow old, and there's no instances of metamorphmagi in canon just morphing injuries away. It's basically just a superpowered polyjuice on demand. Go any further than that, and you stray into regular, boring old overpowered self insert Lord Baron Potter-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peeves with a billion wives fics.

*** Well, if you have more or less total control over your cells (you need that in order to change your body like metamorphs do), then immortality isn't out of the question (you can still be killed, but aging? Well, not necessarily)

*** Dude you are way over and under estimating metamorphmagi for instance you cease to produce certain chemicals in your body and certain cells die or fail to reproduce forcing old age if you could properly control the manipulation of your body to get a ducks bill what's to say you can't just start mixing chems in your brain for an adrenaline rush and if you could do that chems to prevent old age and when cells die just manually build new ones while on the contrary a shot to the head or an ak would be certain death. You cannot conjure new material which is why a metamorphmagus could not for instance grow to 9 feet tall on a whim and honestly you don't see Tonks in combat to know if she mends small wounds. There is also the matter of curse wounds which cannot be magically closed for which I would assume applies for metamorphmagi so a sectumsemprs to the chest or lung would still kill you unless you could grow a second hart on your back or lungs on your cheek or somesuch. Then there is also the possibilities of liquidation of non essential organs to prevent oneself from bleeding out.

**** HP magic is a funny thing. You can conjure a chicken, but not a chicken sandwich (Gamp's law of transfiguration). Due to the seemingly random rules of HP magic, you can't rely on extreme amounts of conjecture like you are, only demonstrated feats. And yeah, it sucks that we never get to see a metamorphmagus cut loose, because now we don't know if they can. We can only use the abilities already shown unless we want to start making things vastly AU. For example, if a metamorphmagus had all the abilities you wish to attribute to them, why has the magical community not long been enslaved by the Dark Lord Masquerade: a powerful, nigh-immortal Dark Lord who could be /any one of us/?

See what I mean? If you want to set stories in the HP universe as it is, you have to give reasons your introduced abilities haven't thrown the whole world off whack with their existence.
