Not counting one shots obviously. Mine is 46212 words from the most recent chapter of linkffn(a third path to the Future)


** 40K~ is about the longest I've seen. It could have easily been broken up into individual chapters, so it really didn't do anything for me but cause reader fatigue

*** Didn't Thalarian's fic "Queens Of Darkness, Ladies Of Light" have a 60k word chapter?

Edit: apparently "just" 30k, though the uncensored version may have been a bit longer. Linkffn(3092103).

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

Every. Single. Chapter.

linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

I read a lot but it's probably not the longest in fanfiction from the fics I've read so far. But this is the one I recall.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** linkffn(10914042). Several chapters exceeding 25k. I think one of them might have been close to 40k. (And that's the least of the pacing issues of what started as a good story.)

linkffn(11502532). 4 chapters at 104k total. Sadly on indefinite hiatus.

linkffn(3124159). I believe Chapter 3 is about 30k.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
