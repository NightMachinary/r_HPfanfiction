*** Guns could be OK when they are in-story and used sparingly. linkao3(487663) has a gun in a prominent position in the end, but one of the main heroes is a squib, so it is natural (I don't read that many fem!Harry, but this seems to be good with a solid story and something else than sex and juicy bits, although it is one of shining examples of story where pornography hurts the main story).

But to the original question:

1. Bashing, especially Weasleys, Hermione, and Dumbledore (flawed!Dumbledore á la linkao3(14078862) is OK, manipulative or evil is not).
2. Yes, most of the Gringotts stuff, and certainly “The Heir of Griffyndor” is an immediate end. In the end, Ginny as a goblin warrior killed otherwise good story.

Where I draw the line both in fanfiction and published fiction is when a woman has sex for the first time and 3 inches worth of circular hymen dislodges from her body and sits on top of someone's dick like a frigging mushroom. I don't know what the hecking heck these characters are doing but someone needs to call the female character an ambulance (or apparate her to St Mungo's?) I wish I could say I've only read this once.

***** Okay, I thought I found it, but I'm pretty sure this isn't it. Sounds freakishly familiar though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12635616/chapters/28791567]]

The one I read had 30 chapters or so. And they were long. I remember because it took me getting to the last chapter to realize it was unfinished and there was a cliffhanger. I was so mad.

On Archive of your own I searched for F/M Draco/Hermione and Zombie Appocolypse, but nothing is long enough.

If you want to try finding it, below is a description of what I remember complete with spoilers. I think the spoilers ruin it. But I'm a weirdo who has honestly considered ending friendships with people who consistently ruin the plot twists in books and films.

I>! remember it was a Draco Malfoy/Hermione Granger pairing. But Draco was some sort of chemistry genius. He was also a Death Eater and in Azkaban for War crimes. The war crime been the creation of the virus. Ronald was a Zombie. Narcissa was a zombie. Lucius was hunting muggles so Narcissa could feed. There was a weird dark arts mirror. Potentially Aztec. The muggles were living on the ocean to avoid the zombies. At some point Hermione is captured and taken to a muggle Miliatary facility, I know she was sedated and pregnant. Can't remember what they were doing to her. Pretty sure Draco signed of on it, for some reason. Sorry I read it a while back. I mostly remember the caffeine consumption and insomnia because I needed to know the ending.!<

** I was going to make something like this in two fronts (What makes you to skip a fic after reading the summary and this) but I going to create one front (What makes you to skip a fic after reading the summary).

Movie based stories.

Misspelling names especially *Lilly*.

When characters who has different appearance than books like James has hazel eyes in the books but some fic gave him brown eyes, Weasleys has ginger hair in some fics, etc.. If Lily has red hair it's okay for me as I didn't know dark-red is auburn.

Harry is different (either genius, wise, powerful, got different childhood or something similiar) but canon exactly happens or he behave like an imbecile. Given him hero-complex to do things like in canon.

Good Voldemort and Deatheaters or romanticizing them and sympathizing with them. Voldemort falls in love at any capacity.

More than believeable inheritance (4-6 for me) and goblins can do anything.

Stupid Dumbledore. Evil Dumbledore who is secretly dark lord and want to rule the magical world but doesn't do anything until Harry comes even he can whatever he wants with his influence and positions but he just sat there and wait for Harry to dismantle his plans.

.... I swear on my magic so mote it be.

Lily and James writing who is their secret keeper in their will. I mean look at that way, if they trust Peter enough to make him their secret keeper (they give his hand their and Harry's life) why they go and write something like ''If we die than we betrayed by our secret keeper Peter. We switching him with Sirius etc. etc.''.

Genderbent through some potion/spell.

Edit: I removed anything about grammar because they are not relevant to this post and they are (no paragraphs etc.) common reason to drop the fic.

Edit2: I don't know how to write it as a sentence but I give examples. Harry Potter is not son of James and Lily Potter, Hermione's parent is not her true parents and she is actually is a pureblood. I hate it because this completely and utterly destroy them make them nothing but OC.

** - Expendable magic/magical exhaustion.

- Suggestion that Muggles would win in a war against wizards.

- Weak magic in general.

- Backwater wizards with respect to other magical species.

- Backwater Britain with respect to other magical nations.

- Harry who is weaker than his canon self (magically, mentally, or emotionally).

- Harry paired with someone I don't consider attractive (slash, Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Millicent, etc.)

  The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.

** I'm probably gonna sound picky lol but:

Harry switching houses

Marriage law fic

Harry is the son of the malfoys or some other slytherin family

Multiple lordships

Harry/Susan

Mpreg

Fics where Harry and Hermione are typically young and get married and act like a married couple even at a young age (typically time travel fics)

Harry's parents will be Lily, Snape and James or other characters (as a trio, kind of)

Rushed plots

Lack of emotion, especially in emotional stories

Dealing with goblins a lot

OC's

Stories that pertain mainly around an OC and barely have any canon characters in it

Time travel fics in general. I mean I can't say I wont read one, if the summary seems promising I might take a look but I think it's a bit overused

The Slytherins being super nice/just misunderstood

Annnnd I think that's it

*** Some OC stories are ok but not often. I enjoyed the first Alexandra Quick story for instance. Seriously though can't believe I forgot one of my biggest peeves which is time travel fics in which the timeline is perfectly preserved. I love changes in general though when they're done well otherwise I might as well be reading canon imo.

** I cannot stand fics where the author has made zero effort in the areas of spelling and grammar. I am not talking about occasional mistakes that crop up in almost every story. I am pretty tolerant, and if the story is good then I can plow past a lot. But when a story is a chore to read and you are wondering why the author even bothered, then it is time to move on.

Also, for some reason, I generally skip over femHarry stories unless he is changed during the story as a plot point.

** Training time jump and then the big fight and he uses 3 spells from cannon.

Katanas, there's a perfectly good magic sword in cannon.

When there's romance but in the span of one sentence they both freak out and have a “fight” and then just as fast make up.

The “they betrayed me I swear I'll never help them or be involved with them again” and then he goes and makes nice with everyone a paragraph later.

Bunch more that I can't remember off the top of my head right now.

** Weasley bashing. I know they make it extremely easy, but it's easy to write them out of the story without descending into bashing.

Snape glorification and romanticizing. I don't hate him, but I also know he's irredeemable. Additionally, anything featuring Harry and his precious son, Albus Severus. (It's the reason I never read the Play-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named, which features both Snape glorification/romanticization and Albus Severus). He can only be a background character for me to like a story.

James Potter bashing. Yes, he was a turd in school, but as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ait2lw/stories_where_harry_does_not_buy_snapes_poor/][this]] thread points out, he had reasons to target Snape.

Harry/Ginny based on HBP-Ginny. It's hard for me to like /any/ H/G, but if there's no signs of character development for her, I'm out. Simply put, I don't like any Mary-Sues, for any pairing, and they pop up the most often in H/G (you have to filter a lot for H/Hr, too, but that pairing makes more sense).

Glaring, repetitive grammar mistakes. (For example, sweat ;)). I won't even click on the story if there's mistakes in the summary.

Time travel and then nothing changes.

** -Harry with a different name. Henry, Harold, Herietta or whatever the female version is supposed to be called, it just makes me cringe and call it quits from the start. Its not even the idea itself, I dont have a problem with him sporting a different name for whatever reason. What kills it for me is when the author has such a serious deficiency in imagination that he cant use one of the tens of thousands of English names and instead uses just another version of "Harry"

-Length. If its under 100.000 words, it must come with some really fantastic recommendations for me to consider reading it.

-Really poor grammar. I have no issue with some typo every once in a while, but after a certain point, its just unbearable.

Getting names wrong (such as Lilly, or misspelling them often)
