Molly is one of the more underrated people in the Harry Potter.

She was able to defeat Bellatrix in a 1v1 and cast multiple non-verbal spells, a Patronus and a Protego Maxima while dueling during the battle of Hogwarts.\\
She is talented in food-related charms enough for Ron to think she creates food out of nothing.\\
She is capable of using healing magic and has at least n.e.w.t level of potions.\\
Hell, she was also capable of using the dark arts as well as seen as she used multiple curses during her battle against Bella.

So let's take it up a notch, knowing how talented Molly is, she was hired as a teacher for DADA. Replacing one of the many teachers Dumbledore hired during the years (I'd assume either Lockhart, Umbridge or Snape).

Imagine what kind of embarrassing and/or epic scenes could happen with Molly as a teacher.


** Molly is hired midyear after the twins somehow scare the previous professor into leaving. Dumbledore/Mcgonagall think detentions are too lenient. Either twins must finish year via homeschooling or parent needs to be avalible to deal with them. Since Molly is sahm, she agrees to teach dada.

*** I can see that happening in the fifth book. Instead of Fred and George running away they get Umbridge to run away. The moment that happens and Dumbledore returns everything happens just like you said. I imagine it could change the books by quite a lot
