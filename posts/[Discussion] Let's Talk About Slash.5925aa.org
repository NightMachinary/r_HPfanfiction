No, really. Let's talk about it. Name some of your favorite slash pairings and some of you most beloved fics. Femslash pairings and fics welcome as well.

I'm personally a fan of Drarry and my favorite fic is linkffn(Becoming a Veela's Mate by Chereche). Check it out if you fancy long fics that work on building relationships between two characters before diving into sickly sweet romance.


** I love Deamus and have vague plans to write them one day. I have also written a femmeslash Padma/Astoria (so realistically two OCs). But many popular pairings, like Remus/Sirius or Drarry, I dislike for characterisation reasons, which is a shame. I'd love to see more honest, genuine slash, and tend to find that this is usually written with minor characters.

*** I really like Remus/Sirius because with a few tweaks it could actually be canon and it wouldn't affect the plot at all. And it just ups the angsty reconciliation in POA if they were former boyfriends as well. Heck, I think Remus might actually be a little relieved to be attracted to men since he has so many hang ups about possibly transferring his lycanthropy to his child in-utero. (Of course, his attraction to men is one more thing to hide from the world...)

** I have a definitive "type" when it comes to shipping, which is doomed couples. It explains why I love reading/writing angst so much.

I've tried Harry/Draco but, for the most part, it leaves me cold; I've read Harry/Ron, which works for me. But my first love in this fandom and the one I read above all others is Remus/Sirius (who were my first slash ship).

I will read almost anything with Remus/Sirius as a primary pairing, but my favourite tropes are post-Azkaban and post-moon hurt/comfort.

I've too many favourites to name them all, but some of them are Linkao3(313895; 1061211; 7064644; 7288462)

  There's that phrase Ginny heard sometime, years ago, she can't remember where; to look at someone as though they hung the moon. Ginny heard it and since then all she ever wanted was to be seen like that, as though she herself created someone's world, until it happened and she realised what a fucking responsibility it is to be someone's reason for living, the thing left over when everything else is taken away.

** I like some Drarry, but it is hard to find good ones - a lot of the characterization is awful. And what is with the feminization? And there has to be some work to redeem Draco, generally. I love most of Vorabiza's stuff. And Keira Marcos' two Drarry fics (and the incomplete Harry/Hermione/Draco one, which is fantastic, though currently taken down until she finishes it).

There are a few Harry/Ron ones I like - mostly Shedoc. I'm willing to read mostly anything, though I generally prefer Harry with his yearmates, or maybe an older Weasley brother. I don't really care for Snarry, with Sirius seems incestuous, Remus - no, still too old. Even the idea of Cedric doesn't really appeal, though I'd try a strong rec.

** big fan of femHarry/Hermione. Holly Evans started that way but that sneaky Tonks.... Effects and Side effects would be much improved by a focus on my otp, but harem..

would love some recs..

Jamie Evans (Fate's Fool?) is good, also Tonks. Ashes of Magic is good but no updates and it quits before much of anything happens.

It's hard to find a good mix of fluff and fight scenes.

Oh, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4752228/Philosophize]] does well, she doesn't tickle my fancy particularly but she's good for nice consistent updates, decent writing skills..

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1751050/Poetheather1]] writes some good stuff and has even published in the real world.

The Miss Potter community is active and the list is huge, worth poking around.

I'm not much for male slash and absolutely won't do light/dark stuff.. Harry/LV or poor Hermione/every scumbag in the potterverse.. sometimes all at once.. I can see the challenge of writing it so it works, but ick.. Speaking of ick.. Has anyone seen a Hermione/Umbridge? I've not..

  Barty Crouch Jr. been attracted to his oblivious friend Regulus Black for several years now, and til now, he has been excellent at keeping that from him. Title from the album by Sara Bareilles, which is where all chapter names/lyrics are from. Rated for mild citrus in first chapter, heavier citrus in the last chapter, and language.
