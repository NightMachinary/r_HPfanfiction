Just finished Dear Enemy by GingerTodgers on ao3. linkao3(7447762), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7447762]]. Epistolary story. Very funny and very smart writing. Lots of laughs. When I was reading I was thinking the author is a professional writer secretly slumming in fanfic. IMHO, this author could easily turn pro if they wanted to. Their writing is top notch worthy of any good publisher. Highly recommended.

#+begin_quote
  An anonymous benefactor makes a generous donation to Harry Potter's School for Squibs in exchange for a weekly letter from the Boy Who Lived.What begins as a chore soon becomes the only outlet Harry has to talk about the war, love, life, hope, redemption, his renewed obsession with a certain blonde nemesis and how he really, honestly, believes that this will be the year Puddlemere United reclaim the Quidditch League Cup.
