After starting 'basilisk born' several times I finally managed to get into it and I love it! I. Need more stories like it please, with at least 150k wording


** Do you mean like Basilisk-Born as in Harry who is descended from/is a magical creature, or Harry who ends up back in time and is pivotal in the history of the world (both magical and otherwise)? If it's the former, then well, Basilisk-Born is probably the best of that genre (and isn't that a little sad?).

If the latter, linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is the best if you're okay with some fem!Harry. linkffn(The Wizard from Earth by Morta's Priest) is also good, though it doesn't hit the length requirement you want.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
