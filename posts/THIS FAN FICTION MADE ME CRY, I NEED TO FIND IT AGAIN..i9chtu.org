Okay so I was looking through my Snapchat memories and I saw a video of myself crying over a fanfiction. It wasn't my normal pairing, all I know is that the main pairing was Harry and a muggle called Abby. I remember bits like the fact that he had children and the fact that Ginny died; that was the main reason I was crying but can't remember the name please help me find it!!!

**** All you needed to say was "A muggle called Abby". Grow Young With Me is incredibly popular here, and any number of people would recognize it from that description alone. Enjoy the re-read!

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

***** is there any possibility of sequel coming with grow young with me because it was released in 2015 and it's been a long time now... I would ask the author but my account is new so I'm unable to PM the author due to my account being less than 24hrs old...
