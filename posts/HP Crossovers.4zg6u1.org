Okay i do not care what the other fandom is as long as it about HERMIONE , it's not Hermione/ Ron, it has nor Ron bashing i may not like Hermione with Ron but i love Ron. It's well written, long and complete. I will read any HP/Fandom crossover. I'll list the things I've read stories about and enjoyed the HP crossover with.

Naruto (no sakura/sasuke) Supernatural (no Wincest or female/Dean) Once Upon a time (Swan Queen only) Avatar the last Air bender (Zuko/katara only) Big Bang Theory (Shenny) Buffy (I'm a Spuffy gal) Criminal Minds Twilight Doctor Who X-Men


** linkffn(3983128) - A crossover with Iain M. Banks' /Culture/ universe.

I usually have limited enthusiasm for crossovers, but I'll make an exception for this one. Very well written. A decently done Dumbledore and the smug arrogance of the Culture is nicely captured.

Unfortunately a deadfic. But what's there is at least entertaining.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

** Thanks everyone for the recs. I loved them. I was hoping for more crossover with Hermione as a main character. Where she isnt some anoying girl just there for Harry or whatever main character convenience.

** Using the search bar is your friend for most [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=Crossovers&restrict_sr=on][HP crossovers.]]

For Atla: I would suggest linkffn(Embers by Vathara). Zuko and Iroh centric that would literally replace half of book 2 and everything of book 3. It is a grounded version of the series that centers with the concept of consequences.

Edit: Would also add linkffn(Uchiha Fukurou;Ninja Who Lived) for Hp/naruto fics. Both are reincarnation fics.

  Dragon's fire is not so easily extinguished; when Zuko rediscovers a lost firebending technique, shifting flames can shift the world... Follows "Theft Absolute".

  A year had already passed ever since the Telmarines were defeated. All was well in Narnia. Until one day, a prophecy was revealed and a certain bushy-haired bookworm found herself lost in a world where magic was... different. BONUS CHAPTER IS UP!

** I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy". Buffy/Harry Potter, though it's set in 5th year, so it features the Slayer before Buffy, India Cohen. No Ron/Hermione, and Ron is a hero. Good but ruthless Dumbledore as well. Less stupid Travers too.

** linkffn(7849109)- I'm not usually a big fan of slash, but I really like this story. Xmen/HP crossover that's long and not just a rehash of either universe. And it's active as of April 22.. isn't that nice? While HP begins wildly damaged and OOC, if you continue reading, there IS HOPE for his character to grow/develop to become more like the HP we know and love (maybe stronger too for his experiences). This is possibly the thing that keeps me hooked on this story.

  Stripped of his humanity, Logan became Weapon X. When the doctors were through; he was little more than a remote controlled beast guided by base instinct. In contrast, Harry became Weapon IX and was stripped of his human trappings. Care, love, and compassion were torn from him, creating a superb machine who kills without remorse. Is that all they will ever be? *Slash*
