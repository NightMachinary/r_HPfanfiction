One thing I see quite a bit that angers or annoys me is people complaining about eleven year olds knowing politics E.G. Daphne greengrass. I see a lot of people saying it's not realistic and I disagree because that is most likely something they (purebloods) are taught from birth so they can protect and nurture their family name and station.


** Yeah, that's why child rulers ruled with iron fists through history. Sheer political skill.

^{This is sarcasm.}

*** I mean, there were a few. Most were terrible, I agree with you on that, because most of European nobility descended into Borgia hedonism or Hapsburg inbreeding, among other reasons, but there were some notable young royals who did really well.

So, exceptions, not the rule, but it is possible. Gustavus Adolphus became King at 16 amidst three wars, and managed to lead Sweden into becoming a 'Great Power' of the time, for example. :)

*** Maybe not however from what I see a lot of purebloods use the politics of Hogwarts and Slytherin house for the express purpose of training for the politics of real life not to mention that most if not all those underage have someone else on the actual wizengamot seat.

*** This I agree with it's illogical and I much prefer how a lot of stories now have Harry or other characters find a regent to take the place of the child until they come of age.

*** I do kind of want to see a spin of that trope though - a new Pureblood turns up and gets admitted to the Wizengamot, only to find the membership looks like a mix of Ambercrombie and Fitch catalogues and the cast of every YA movie ever. :D

*** Or someone asks, "why do people like X?" and the people who reply with serious answers all get downvoted. That is not conducive to good conversation.

*** I've never quite understood that either I understand if maybe the story has bad grammar or writing I would downvote it and leave a helpful review but if it's not your pairing or one you like simply write your own story or find another one.
