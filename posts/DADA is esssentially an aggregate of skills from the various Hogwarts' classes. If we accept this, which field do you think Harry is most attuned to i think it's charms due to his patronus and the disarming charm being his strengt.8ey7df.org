To have a good grade in DADA, one must understand the uses of herbology, charms, potions, and potentially transfiguration alongside the ability to recognize and counter dark creatures meaning Harry has to have a good knowledge base of all to be the best DADA grades, yes?


** I agree it's charms. I'm disappointed with the idea that Harry goes into law enforcement forever so my headcanon is that when he's older he's a charms master. Or at least has the equivalent knowledge of one, even if his particular application is more violent than usual.

*** To be honest, I really like the fact that Harry Potter becomes an Auror. It's very "Harry" of him. Yes, he was thrust into most of the canonical problems against his will, but he's very adamant about protecting as many people as possible. He may not believe in the Ministry's justice, but he's a very just person and believes, I think, that everyone deserves justice. Be it negative or positive.

An Auror /really/ makes sense for him.

But, at the same time, I cannot fathom him being part of any ministry for long. I think vigilantism, to an extent, also fits well with his character. But that's an entirely different argument.

**** The problem, I think, comes down to two things. One, I personally doubt he would have any trust left in the Ministry after the events of the 7 books. Two, there was always a sense of him just wanting to have a normal life and shit just kept getting up in his face till he put his manpants on and dealt with it. Becoming an Auror clashes with that. Then again, I thought the whole epilogue was bullshit and out-of-nowhere back when deathly hallows came out, so what do I know.

***** I don't really disagree with any of that. Him distrusting the ministry is why I don't believe he'd stay with them for long. I just find it hard to believe he wouldn't at least give it a try. Maybe a few years.

19 years? That's probably too long.

I think, however, that sometimes people confuse Harry wanting a normal life with Harry not liking his fame - mostly because of where it originates from. Even killing Voldemort, in the end, was mostly Dumbledore's plan from the grave, even though he, of course, was the most important part of it.

Achieving recognition for things he does because of his own merit? There's never really anything that showcases that he wouldn't be happy with that.

****** Well, I was always under the impression that Harry (or at least Hermione) would realize that there's dire need to reform the system. You can't really say "Well it's fine as long as the right people are in charge". I'm talking about major government reform, not just "pass a law for the wellfare of Elves". Disentangle executive/judicative/legislative branches of government, write a constitution that makes this mandatory... etc. Guarantee basic (human) rights to humans and human-like creatures.

There's no better time to do this than after Voldemort's defeat... and everyone just going on playing Aurors and Ministers just seems really meh.

********* But that's pretty extreme. Boggarts are /creatures/, not objects --- if there's a nonlethal way to deal with them, ethically, you should probably use that rather than kill them. Same thing as, say, tigers. No one's asking you to like tigers, who will most likely try to eat you, but shooting every tiger you come across is... not okay.

And anyway, I don't think the Boggart is /truly/ affected by its chosen form's weaknesses. Rather, it doesn't have much knowledge on what a Dementor or some such acts like, and so it pulls all its knowledge of what it should act like from the victim's expectations (which is an effect Riddikulus exploits and amplifies to force them to take the amusing form). As a result, if you cast a Patronus Charm at a Boggart who's pretending to be a Dementor, and you /expect/ it to repel the Dementor, the Boggart will stupidly mimick being repelled. And you must remember they're just an illusion: stabbing them with Gryffindor's Sword would probably be akin to trying to stab a cloud.
