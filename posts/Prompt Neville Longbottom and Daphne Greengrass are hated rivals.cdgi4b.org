Because they come from families who have been competing to run the wizarding world's drug market for centuries. Longbottom Leaf Tobacco versus Greengrass Marijuana.


** The drugs thing turn me off. Them being children of two families who both sell magical ingredients from plants for Potions would be more inline with HP. Neville being good in herbology and Daphne with her Greengrass name. Interesting love/hate relationship though, haven't read a lot of Neville focused fics.

Same, instead of Muggle narcotics, their families should be competitions in magical Herbology ingredients.

**** This and some of the potion ingredients can even consist of illegal parts if the Greengrass sell to more of the darker families while the Longbottoms try appealing to lighter families.

*** I can't speak so much for marijuana, but Longbottom Leaf basically /is/ a magical herb you know. Best weed in the shire! I love the LotR crossover idea of Neville's family producing Longbottom Leaf :D

** I'd love to write this, except that the entire story you think that they're referring to potions ingredients and the like, only to find out at the end that no, they're actually trafficking in high-grade narcotics.

"Wait a minute," said Hermione, stunned. "Since when do you talk about the street value of a calming draught?"

Tracey rolled her eyes. "Oh, Granger, relax. It's just pixie dust and cocaine."

** Hur dur drugs are bad.

Fuck that I love this idea. Picture it - Daphne is okay with muggles because their family is in the weed business. Neville likes muggles because he's a great guy, but Daphne? She isn't about muggles unless it's about money. The Longbottoms could wonder where the Greengrass family is getting all their money because they're cornering the market for herbs for potions but some how the Greengrass family is STILL ahead of them and it 's hurting them.

I can totally picture Neville being annoyed in later years because somehow Greengrass is still up there with herbs and he has no idea why. They start dating and Daphne explains weed to him and Neville gets in on it too. It would be great.

Of course when they're younger Daphne really doesn't have a clue what her family does but it doesn't stop her from taunting Neville. As she gets older she gets it more.

I can also see Daphne explaining everything about weed to Neville and he understands so they go into business together and become power houses.

** Well Neville's the herbology kid of his family so it might be more in line for him to he a new kid on the block and daphne an old blood family in the business.

** On a completely different note, there was this one fic where the 2 of them got together... I think it was one of Starfox's stories (forgot the title).

  Alternate Universe. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
