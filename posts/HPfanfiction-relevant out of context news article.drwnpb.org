I was reading a news article on relocation of Native Americans with the intention of abolishing their communities. And I noticed as I read it that a few paragraphs were quite amusing if you read it in the context of bad HP fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  Another [[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015015279212][government-sponsored report]], on the>! Pine Ridge Reservation!< in South Dakota, spent several pages detailing the marriage trends between "full bloods," "half bloods" and "quarter bloods."

  "The well adjusted and self sufficient mixed blood family that is occasionally seen has tempted some observers to conclude that intermarriage between>! Indians!< and whites will solve many of the cultural problems of the Indian group," the author begins the report's chapter called "The Families."

  However, there wasn't enough intermarriage between>! whites!< and Native people, the author lamented. "It is thus evident that the 'Indian problem' is not going to be solved through the disappearance of Indians by intermarriage with non Indians.

Edit: just to be clear, there is nothing amusing about the source material. It just speaks to how the terms used in HP have haunting echoes in history. Not particularly surprising given what canon models some of the wizarding problems off of.

But the source material is not funny. Realizing that similarity and reading it out of context is, however, a bit amusing.


** Lmao, reading the thread title, I thought it was going to be [[https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/lord-voldemort-jailed-insurance-agent-threatened-clients-who-cancelled-policies][this HP-relevant news article.]]

#+begin_quote
  Identifying himself as "Lord Voldemort", a disgruntled insurance agent sent anonymous threatening messages to some clients after they cancelled policies they had bought from him.

  The court heard that he targeted 33 people in all, including his former clients and their neighbours. The accused also created letters and e-mails that were addressed to his clients, which threatened that harm would befall his clients and their families if one bitcoin was not transferred to the accused's bitcoin wallet. He signed off the letters and e-mails with the pseudonym Lord Voldemort.
