Hi all Looking for a fic.

What I remember is that it's goblet of fire. Harry is friends with some of the beauxbatons girls. There are more then just the three triwizard champions. I think the beauxbaton champion is injured and Pomfret transplants one of Harry's lung for the French girl until they can regrow it
