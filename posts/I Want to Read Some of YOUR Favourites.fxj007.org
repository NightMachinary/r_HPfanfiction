(Tl;Dr at bottom)

Hello [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]],

As I settle into my self-isolation, I find that I have less and less use for a steady sleep schedule, and more and more time during the day. In my opinion, this newfound time could not be spent in a better way than reading fanfiction!

I came upon this conclusion through rediscovering one of my own personal favourite fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5792095/chapters/13349602][a tastefully written romance/hurt/comfort piece featuring the unusual pairing of james potter x snape]] that I could not help but read from cover to metaphorical cover. Meditating on the pure joy I got out of reading my own favourite, I couldn't help but wonder what fics keep other people's eyes glued to the screen for hours on end and leave them with a sense of lingering satisfaction for days after reading the final chapter. If you've ever found a really good fic, you know exactly the feeling I'm talking about.

I don't have any specific type of fic I'm looking for, as long as it's well-written. By that, I mean good grammar, artful storytelling, and interesting concepts. If it's all of those and also 100k words or more I'll love you forever, but anything goes as long as it gets me feeling some type of way.

So please! Whether it's slash or straight or no romance at all, romance or angst or anything in between, please recommend your absolute favourite HP fanfics! It would mean so so so much to me <3

Tl;Dr: recommend your fave HP fanfic to me please! anything goes as long as it's well written


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2359056/1/Quiet]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6813258/1/A-Midnight-Weary]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/]]

Quiet is a now AU post war Harry/Luna oneshot that made me fall in love with the pairing. It's a poignant mixture of tender, meloncholy, and bittersweet as we see a very broken but still living Harry trying to make a life for himself with Luna. Luna in this fic is still very much herself, but older, wiser, and much more aware of the world. I love their relationship in this as it's honest, real, and has more than a touch of loss to it, but you can also see how much they love each other and how they fit together.

A Midnight Weary is a the best example of a "Harry runs away" fic I've ever seen. It's an AU post war oneshot where the Ministry Six are in their last year of Hogwarts, and facing the rise of another potential Dark Lord. It shows the Wizarding World's cowardice, double standards, and ludicrious expectations of Harry and his friends that the book never went into, and how they might inspire a war weary Harry and his friends to simply say 'fuck it.' It goes into detail about their plan and how they plan thei rescape, and shows the very real cost of being a child soldire who has to save the world.

The third fic is called Insurgere. It's a rather unusual AU fic set in the time of Voldemort. Tom isn't sorted into Slytherin, but Hufflepuff, and he learns to shine in a whole different way. This is the fic that showed me exactly how frightenng a competent Tom Riddle would have been, and how much power he could have amassed. It's also a unique look at the potential of Hufflepuff House and if utilized correctly how they could be a very powerful force.

** Linkffn(The Order of Mercy)

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]]) Also this time travel fic. It's one of my absolute favs. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) This Wolfstar series is brilliant in it's character portrayal. I absolutely love it. Angsty with hopeful ending. A bit smutty. Don't let that stop you from reading though. It's soo well written. Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini)

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
