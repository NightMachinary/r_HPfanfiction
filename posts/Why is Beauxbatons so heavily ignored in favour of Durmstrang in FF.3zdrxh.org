In all my time in reading fanfiction, I've only ever encountered a handful of fics which have Harry attending Beauxbatons. And even then, both of them are TWT stories with hardly any time spent at Beauxbatons itself. Durmstrang has stories like Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. The best stories I can think of for Beauxbatons are one of those romances featuring either Gabrielle/Fleur or Deprived and Defender of Beauxbatons. Thoughts?

Anybody looking at this post who has not read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived and would wish to do so, please note that there are more chapters on the DLP forums.

Edit: I always have to overuse the space key. Thanks MacsenWledig.


** I guess it's because the movies made Beauxbatons look like an all-girls school. Or maybe because Durmstrang seems like this badass place you learn dangerous magic, whereas Beauxbatons is for sissies who enjoy fancy food while serenaded by Wood Nymphs.

** Dark Arts.

Beauxbatons its for all intents and purposes French-Hogwarts. Drumstrang is different.

** Durmstrang is portrayed as the dark mysterious school that no one knows anything about other than their Headmaster is a Death Eater and they learn forbidden magic.

Beauxbatons apparently have etiquette lessons.

** linkffn(Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum; 7402590; Defender of Beauxbatons) Don't put a space between linkffn and the parenthesis.

I'd guess the answer to your question is a matter of accents. Setting a story in Beauxbatons condemns the writer to a few extra hours of policing their dialogue to make certain all of the `e's and zhe's are up to snuff.

** My guess is because a large portion of the fandom is all about that #NotAllDarkWizards, and Durmstrang is a school for Dark magic, apparently, so it works out.

** My experience has been the opposite. I've seen more Harry at Beauxbatons fics than Durmstrang. This is likely because of my pairing bias, however. The only Durmstrang!Harry story I have read is Vanishing Illusions by Trelawney's Love Toy, and it is sadly incomplete/abandoned.

That said, I have not seen many fics with Harry going to a school other than Hogwarts. I don't think I've seen a single completed one either.

** "The Arithmancer" features Hermione at Beauxbatons, though not for that long or that detailed - she starts at Hogwarts for a few years too.

** I've noticed, in the US at least, that there is this underlying dislike for France so that may have something to do with it. Additionally, though Fleur is an amazing character not everyone likes her (including most of the characters in the books before the war really kicks in) vs Victor who everyone loves including the characters in the series. Not to mention that I think everyone imagines (or I do, for some reason) that to an extent France was largely unaffected by the war.

** Because Durmstrang is clearly opposed to hogwarts, but we don't have that many evil wizards comming from there. The worst we have is krum, who's happy to cheat in the tournament but otherwise a nice guy- on the sliding scale of malice, he's above umbridge and -to harry- draco, but below fred or george.

Seeing how people see dark wizards in society, and how other cultures define (taboo) dark magic is always interesting. Durmstrang has a foot in the door by clearly being about that.

If i had to find a starting point from the beauxbatons, the best one i could find is wizarding society. That's not interesting enough on its own to catch the interest sufficient to make OCs.
