Recently read The Arithmancer series and found myself enjoying the GeorgeXHermione pairing. Would love to read more! I especially love longer fics that are (relatively) canon-compliant.


** I weep because it's such a good pairing, either one, and yet I see so little. Uh I hope this works.

linkffn(Falling Through Time by Kait Hobbit)

I haven't gotten far, but I don't think it's finished, though it's super long.

*** What I liked about this one is that the author paired Fred and Hermione together in a way that feels natural, without bashing Ron.

Hermione and Ron simply didn't work out.

#+begin_quote
  In what was supposed to be her first ski trip since the war, Hermione wakes up from an avalanche to find herself back at Hogwarts. Despite her search to return home to her time, she is forced to relive her last years at Hogwarts and the War that she knows will claim the faces that now haunt her. In Particular, the face of a certain Weasley that she finds herself slowly falling for.

** The problem with this pairing is that it's hard to find good complete fics. The other fics also don't typically have a OP!Hermione... But you want some fics, so *cracks knuckles* here we go.

Oneshots or Less than 30k words (all FredxHermione)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10878843/1/How-To-Prank-Your-Ex-Boyfriend]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5781439/1/Interference]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5690839/1/Adrenaline-Rush]]

​

Complete fics (above 30k words):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7292302/1/Snipe]] - FredxHermione where they meet before Hogwarts

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12556025/1/Scars-Freckles]]- FredxHermione start dating before book 7 events I think

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12139472/1/Whose-Side-Are-You-On-Anyway]] - is part of a series, this one just covers the events of first year, fred and hermione

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11568740/1/Brilliant-Magic]] - is a Slytherin!Hermione, with George/Fred/Hermione in a triad pairing

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7585918/1/Strange-Bedfellows]] - GeorgexHermione where they live together after the war, Fred dies in this one

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7461451/1/He-Noticed-Her]] - fluffy FredxHermione

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7182157/1/Tale-as-Old-as-Time]] - fred goes into a coma in the final battle and thinks he's with Hermione

​

In-progress:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047276/1/What-If]] - FredxHermione plays on the soul mate idea

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10173342/1/Say-Something]] plays with the amnesia trope, Fred can be super frustrating with this but I'm eagerly awaiting an update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9320401/1/A-History-of-Soul-Bonds-by-Filius-Flitwick]] another triad fic, focuses on how triads can have more power and I think the prophecy applies to the three of them instead of Harry in this one

​

These authors typically have other George or FredxHermione fics. I typically find the fics by checking out the author's other fics and/or looking at their favorites list. I can't say much about the one-shots since I read them all more than 6 months ago, but if you don't like them- they're pretty short so it's not too bad.

** I definitely second Falling through Time by wittyhistorian,I literally love that fic so much! As the previous commenter said, it is a WIP but well worth the wait for chapters, and it's very long already.

Another fave, which may be controversial bc i was really into marriage law fics back when they were the trend and yes i am aware of the myriad of human rights violations a marriage law entails I know they're fucked up but what can I say I like what I like. Anyways it's A Sense of Belonging on ff.net by annewed. It pretty much follows standard marriage law stuff, Hermione and Fred get matched and start figuring out how they're gonna live together and all that. I haven't read it in a bit but I think this included a fair bit of Hermione working at the shop which was fun and cool. This one has been abandoned I think, but the plot had covered their falling in love and stuff before it was abandoned so i am pretty ok with it

  WINNER: BEST HONORARY MARAUDER FIC in the MARAUDER MEDALS, 2016! "Someday . . . you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own. FW/HG/GW, AU from Hermione's 1st year. Cover art by windyshoes!
