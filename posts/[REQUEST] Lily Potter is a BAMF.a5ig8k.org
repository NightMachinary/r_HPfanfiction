Which is a not-WBWL fic, kinda subverting the tropes a little bit.

I can sometimes enjoy a WBWL fic, I just try to accept the fact that the Potters are assholes and/or morons for no reason and try not to think about it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]) kinda tries to explain why they did what they did (fake prophecy and Dumbledore manipulations), but the Potters still feel really stupid in that one.

  When Voldemort came to kill Harry, Lily met him with a SIG Sauer pistol she bought at a pawn shop. Seems Dark Lords die as easily as anyone else when you empty two clips into them. Hailed as the savior of the Wizarding world, Lily has a live baby, a dead husband, the personal enmity of most of the Dark Lord's followers, and not the slightest idea how to put her life back together. Phoenixes have it easy. Burn, die, rise from the ashes. For humans it's a bit different. Sort of.

In another dimension, Voldemort becomes obsessed with Prophecy and discovers that once a prophecy is made, it cannot be /un-made/ -- he is doomed to be defeated by a declaration of magic itself. In an effort to un-make the prophecy, allowing him a chance at success, he begins to focus on time magic, and sends his constructs back to stop the prophecy from ever happening....

Having the same genes does not give anyone the right or privilege to cause psychological trauma and force themselves into their presence/life. Harry and Hermione have a very intimate relationship in this fic and she absolutely has the right to make decisions about what is best for Harry in this situation if he can't.

It's something I'd want my significant other to do for me in a situation like this. Watching out for my well being. If someone punches her for that - especially some arrogant prick who thinks they have a right to see me when I'm close to suffering a mental breakdown even though they don't know me at all - then I hope she punches back.
