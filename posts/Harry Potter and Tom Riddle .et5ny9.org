No, i don't want a Slash fanfic.\\
What im searchin is some fics where Harry and Tom shares a friendship/brotherly or even mentor and apprentice relationship (But has to be some emotion between them, like theyy care for one other)\\
I want Tom Riddle as he is in the diary, charming, smart and cunning, and not how he became as Voldemort, i'know (God complex, mad, twisted)\\
He can be the sabe tom that displeases Muggles or does't care about killing to get what he wants, but i want him to be more like the one in the diary.\\
-No Slash or Fem Harry.\\
-I would preffer something a bit long (It would be wonderful if you guys have something completed, and yes i've already read prince of the dark kingdom)

BONUS: I would like very much if there's some focus on their parselmouth hability, just like, using to tank to one another, or amusing interaction with Nagini or other snakes.


** Well, linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is the quintessential mentor!Voldemort fic. It's sadly very much abandoned, but still worth reading.
