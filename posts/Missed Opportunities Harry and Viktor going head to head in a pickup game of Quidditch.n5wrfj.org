And a friendship is born! I'd love to hear Krum's impression of the Weasley twins as Beaters.


** It sounds interesting, but it has to be said, that Krum should utterly humiliate Harry in a game of Quidditch.

*** That just makes it better! Harry /never/ loses in the entire series, I'd love to see his competitive streak light up against Viktor. And I think it would be a lovely time if he gave Harry some tips.

Viktor doesn't have to lose to still be impressed.

** I think it's Letters linkffn(6535391) Viktor sees Harry has gotten by on natural talent but little training. So he trains Harry to have some real competition.

** Maybe include Cedric in there also, assuming this is during the tournament, and each others takes on playing style, and yes while Krum should win I'd like to he'd be willing to pass on tips and experience to the others.

** I'm planning something like that for the tournament year of my fic. Though they will be able to play together since Harry in my fic is a beater, not a seeker.
