** There's unholy dark!Hermione in linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist).

You could argue that the Harry in this AU fights for the holy cause against Voldemort who uses demons.

But only Hermione is insane enough to invite a king of Hell to her birthday party.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** I'm actually working on something based around this premise, kind of. Still a while before I'd feel confident enough to post it, though.

Do you have any tighter requirements/criteria for your request?

**** No, I meant him being a Christian and considering his quest against Tom Riddle as a spiritual quest or exorcism or something of that kind. I am still on my quest for good Christian fanfics, and this could very well be one of them eventually.
