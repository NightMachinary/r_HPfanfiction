I used to have both it and Draconian on PDF but they got corrupted somehow. I found another copy of Draconian, still looking for Finite though.

Edit: Message for for a copy of Draconian.


** Unfortunately, she pulled her stories for this exact reason. :-/ Too many people sharing her work unauthorised. It's a bummer, because I'm just now hearing recs for her work and would love to read it. :-(

*** Which just sounds like it creates a vicious cycle. Now the ONLY way people can read her stuff is via pdf sharing.

***** I get where she's coming from with the feedback and validation; reviews are important for inspiration to continue on/criticisms. Also, someone tried to sell her fanfic on amazon as their own for actual money so I think it was pretty valid for her specifically to get upset.\\
I don't think the pdf sharing is 'illegal' (because it isn't), mainly because ao3 allows us to download pdfs RIGHT THERE on the top right because it's such a common practice for the sake of ease so she makes no sense there.

*** I'm aware that she took them down and why I just don't agree with her reasoning, people know before posting Fanfiction that it's downloaded and saved and shared. I understand being upset about someone trying to sell it on amazon as mentioned below but pulling it down doesn't punish the person who did that, just the many others who wanted to read the stores. All that said, I still would like to find a copy.
