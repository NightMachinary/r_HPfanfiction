Does anyone else hate hermione and harry x hermione idk it just triggers me.


** Seeing Harry/Hermione gives you post traumatic responses or an anxiety attack? Because that's what the word trigger means.

You can say you don't like something, or even that you hate something, but words have meanings.

** The first point is, do you hate canon Hermione or fanon Hermione? Because there are a lot of difference between the 2 characters.

Now, concerning your question, "trigger" may be a strong word but I also don't read most Harmony fics. Not because I have a problem with "canon" Hermione but because a lot of Harry/ Hermione stories are full of tropes I dislike. After trying to read them for a time and always reading the 3 same plots with tropes such as "Perfect! Hermione" or "Death Eater! Ron", I just decided that I could not be bothered anymore and just ignore the ship.

But it's not like it's just a problem with Hermione. I dislike the tropes associated with her particular ship so I avoid them, but others ships (or AU) are also full of tropes. "Ice! Queen" is a trope extremely common in the Haphne ship (so much that I'm unable to distinguish some fics from each other), and Ron is also often bashed there. "Noble Harry" almost always end up as the Heir/ Lord of tens of House and basically own Magical Britain at 13. Almost all the Manipulative! Dumbledore seem the share the same obessession with Lemon drops . . .

90% of the time, the fics we read are quasi carbon copy of another, older fics. So the trick is to just find a trope you enjoy and just stick to it, no need to be "trigered" by anything.

** Hermione is one of my favorite characters actually, personally I don't understand people who like Ron and dislike Hermione. I also am a big fan of harmony and think it should have been the canon pairing but I dislike most harmony fics, they're always so full of cringy tropes bad grammar and over excessive bashing. I actually really hate seeing Hermione paired with anyone other than Harry if she is in a main pairing especially characters like Draco, Snape, Bellatrix, etc my only exception is Ron when he's actually written well and when it's kept in the background.

** Hermione herself doesn't bother me. I couldn't care less if people do prefer Harry/Hermione, but I don't personally ship them as I like to see them with a more familial bond instead of anything romantic.

** I'm pretty wary of Harry/Hermione stories too.

Mostly because so much of the fandom are ridiculously fanatical about her & they tend to make fanon Hermione obnoxious as hell. Because how dare anyone criticize or point out the flaws of their goddess!

Plus, honestly, it's been done so many damn times. I'd rather read a much less used leading lady.
