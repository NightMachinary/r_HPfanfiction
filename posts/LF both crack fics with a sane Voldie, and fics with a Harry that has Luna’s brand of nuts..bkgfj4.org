I read I See The Moon earlier today, and I remembered a fic where voldie eventually clued into the fact that he was going a little crazy and chose to reabsorb his horcruxes to fix this. Having both in one fic would be amazing, but one or the other is good.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
