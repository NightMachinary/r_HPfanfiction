Is there a fic where instead of being a potion professor in hogwarts, he instead quests for resurrection stone and calling out lily's soul from the beyond to revive her, or he went on revenge quest against the remnants of voldemort. I want to see severus driven by his love for lily doing anything else instead of being a professor at hogwarts. I want to see the character descend into the "darkness" for the sake of reuniting with the loved ones. I want to see love so deep that it corrupts him?


** linkffn(6622580) probably isn't exactly what you're looking for, especially since it's a Lily lives AU, but it does have Snape not teaching Potions and working to destroy the horcruxes because of his love for Lily.

** Technically, a minor plot where Dumbledore as thanks for Severus' spy services, gives him the resurrection stone for closure some time during HBP, is fully canon compilant. Just saying.
