** I strongly believe that all feedback is valuable feedback, even if it is done in a rude manner that could be taken as 'hate'. As a writer, you should welcome all kinds of criticism and work to improve. Anyone that deletes bad feeding, even if it was troll feedback, loses a lot of credibility in my eyes.

*** Yeah, I think I've only had to delete one comment, and that was clearly spam ("The secret tO moRE $$$" is obviously not a real comment). The rest of the time, I figure that even if I don't like or agree with what they had to say, they went through the effort of leaving a comment, and I should respect that they cared enough to do that. Since I respond to reviews, I just reserve the right to /not/ respond if they are too rude about it - but then, I haven't had to exercise that right.

** I didn't even know you could do that. I only ever delete negative reviews if they're nonsense from guest accounts, I think it's completely childish to go further than that. There certainly are reviewers who, when I see their names I think "Oh, bloody hell, here we go..." but it would never occur to me to ban them.

Out of curiosity, what sort of reviews have you left him previously?

** I'm firmly of the opinion that if one chooses to publish work and solicit feedback from one's readers, then one should be willing to take the bad with the good.

Do you occasionally end up with complete bollocks in one or two reviews? Yeah, sure, but they're utterly irrelevant. If there's substance to the negative review then they are, by definition, not bollocks and should at least be considered.

But then some people just want to hear the echo of their own self-applause. Seems a bit pointless to me, but to each their own.

** A lot of authors ban any and all mildly negative comments as being "flames". Authors get to decide how people review, and if people want to live in a world where they want to believe every word they write is utterly perfect and no one should ever criticize them...

Well. It's very sad for them.

But I wouldn't say it's especially common among the best authors: if people want to improve, they'll take all info under account.

** When I wrote and published my first story, I had a few reviewers who pointed out legitimate concerns with my story (I was quite awful back then), and some who had other issues with it. I got into a bit of a back-and-forth with one guy who seemed to take it really personally (turned out later that I'd accidentally sunk his ship and he was quite unhappy with how I'd done it), but I ended up just not replying to any more of his messages.

I'm really stumped as to why you'd block people from /reading/ your stories, unless you had an ego the size of a room and thought that you could punish them by stopping them from reading your story without logging out first - and even then, you'd only affect the people who enjoyed reading your story enough that they'd still want to after their 'flame'. It seems quite counterproductive.

**** It wasn't a Harry Potter story, but basically one of the characters made a dismissive and somewhat mean comment about the other. In context, it wasn't surprising or important, as the other part of the ship wasn't a main character in either my story or canon - think of it like Harry/Luna or Harry/Fleur shippers levels of frequency.

** I don't. I'm not even entirely sure /how/ to ban people. Partly because the vast majority of reviews I get are positive or are constructive feedback, I've only gotten one or two that are legitimately nasty. One was something about how I should get cancer and die... Which, you know, could totally happen at any time, but if I spend my life worrying about it I'll never get anything done. As with cancer, so with digital cancer. If I cared, I'd never upload online to begin with.

I have no idea. I've never had a review rejected like that, but it seems like poor form to remove one because you didn't like it. Were you rating the story on its merits or on your own personal preferences?

** I welcome most reviews save for "moar plox" and that ilk where there's no substance. "This is good" reviews are nearly as bad. "You said this in chapter x, and this in chapter y, which is correct" are my fsvorite reviews because they either point out my error or I get to give them an esoteric education in grammar.

Where are you getting banned at though? If i could do that on ffn, i'd like it.

** bad reviews no, flames for no reason? ...seriously considered it, but it is more fun put their username in an authors note and call them out on their idiocy.

I've considered banning anonymous reviews but then I figured out hey, if they want to raise my review count with 50 posts that say "nice, plz update" or "any news on an update?" then let them...

I have asked in comments for people not to post reviews that don't have content... reviews are my reward for posting my stuff and if they aren't satisfying then they aren't really worth anything but padding.

Even flames that make me angry are kinda addicting...

** No. I don't see value in it. Mind you I also don't see a lot of value in reviews either - who is the person doing the review? How are they any more qualified than Joe Bloggs to offer their feedback? I have professional readers and editors for that sort of thing.

The other possibility is that this person writes simply as a hobby and they aren't trying to write as a "job". They may not be interested in "improving" and not want to deal with multiple paragraphs about it.

Did they actually request feedback? Or did they just post a story and therefore people assume they /want/ notes/feedback/critical analysis?
