Edit: What I meant are stories where Harry and Fleur are married to each other. Not an affair!


** linkffn(Champions by Thor's Shadow)

Harry saves Fleur' life in the second task and now has to marry her due to the life debt and her Veela magic. Sounds cheezy and rush but they have a good development and I loved it.

**** Honestly, it is what I expect based on how their original characters are in the book. Harry will do as Ginny asks for a long time before he snaps. And Ginny does not at all seem to be the character to like it when that happens. To me she feels like a my way-or-the-highway-kinda person, she also sounds like a fan girl and not at all interested in Harry, but only in The Boy Who Lived.\\
To me tat indicates that they will split, and will split violently

*** This is a great story, the romance is somewhat cheesy but in a cute way, and you are moved to root for them pretty easily. Still ongoing with somewhat frequent updates.
