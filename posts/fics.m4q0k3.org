Can someone please recommend me a slash fic? I'm very starved of slash fics right now.

But anyways, I'd like it if it was harry/draco (my otp). But other than that, it could be either harry/blaise, harry/theodore, or harry/omc. I guess I can tolerate harry/voldemort. Please no harry/snape or harry/lucius. I just can't read those types of fics and I've seen way too many of them while I was browsing. And yes, I know I'm being sort of picky with this.

It must also be either dark harry or grey harry. No light harry. Also, it must have dumbles bashing and weasley bashing (mainly ron and maybe ginny). I would prefer Hermione bashing but I can tolerate a fic without it.


** This sub gets the hives the second you mention slash. Try [[/r/HPSlashfic][r/HPSlashfic]].
