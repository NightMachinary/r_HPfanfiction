The latest chapter of /Hermione Granger and the Silent Country/, "Look Both Ways," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** This is one of my favorite series. I especially enjoyed Men Who are Resolved and According to His Own Nature! Also, I have my own head canon about boggarts playing a part in>! Gryffindor hazing rituals, so to see how you wrote the Death Eater initiation ceremony was really cool! !<Thank you for writing! :)
