:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been trying to find this fanfic and I need help.

Things I remember: 1) Ron didn't want kids. Hermione has a binder with names picked out.

2) Severus found her crying in the hall.

3) hermione's parents has a home for squib children.

4) Hermione and Severus set Harry and draco up with each other.

5) The last time I read there was only pile 15 chapters but it was being updated regularly.

That's all I remember!


** It really annoys me to see posts like this get downvoted, because it's clearly because of the pairing. People are not "wrong" for liking what you do not like.

*** I know... I really don't have an OTP I just like to read; this was a really good fic and I'm sad that I can't find it. Hopefully someone will help.

*** Totes. And this ship does have some problems, but the requested fic sounds like some post-war drama/romance that I could really get behind. She's not his student anymore--he can't give her detention, and if he tries to give her anything but compassion she doesn't have to put up with it. I'm sold. Gonna trawl Ashwinder, and I hope I find it.
