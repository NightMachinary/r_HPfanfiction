Hey guys,

the title says it all I guess!

Still, please no slash and (if possible - unless very very good!) no Harry/Ginny!

Thanks, the stage is your's!


** I have a thought in my notes related to this. Basically Dudley becomes braindead from getting kissed by the dementor. At the end of the fifth year, when Sirius falls through the veil, his body vanishes while his spirit roams London for a little while until it reaches Dudley's body, where he takes control of Dudley's body.

The plot bunny never really progressed beyond that, but Sirius inhabiting Dudley's body could be a fun jumping off point for a fic. What does Sirius-Dudley do? Go back to school, help hunt horcruxes, etc.

My thought wasn't that Harry would purposefully let Dudley get kissed, just that he wasn't able to stop it in time.

** There's a fic where Harry recruits Winky after Fourth year and all 3 Dursleys end up Dying to the Dementors, and Dawlish gets pissy about it. I don't think it was intentional, though. Can't remember its name though.

** Leaving Dudley to the dementors on purpose, or by accident?

I mean, suppose that Harry didn't realise that a Dementor would actually try to kiss Dudley (because he's a muggle and poses no threat) until it's too late, or they're too far a distance from each other for the Patronus to reach and save Dudley in time, or maybe Harry's out of practice (and badly affected by Cedric Diggory's death) and he only manages a wispy shield for himself?

*** Because Dudley tormented him for a decade and the expresion "I wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire" certainly has its roots in reality. Definitely not the most moral decision, but there is at least one person whom I'd leave to that fate if I had the choice. Would I regret it later? Possibly.

I could totally understand Harry making that decision and it would be poetic, if brutal justice for Petunia and Vernon because had they treated Harry well, he would have saved their son. It would certainly be more believable than the average "dark Harry" story where he rapes Hermione and Ginny after eating Hedwig.

***** There was one where he ate Hedwig in some ritual (saw it mentioned here last week) and plenty where he becomes a rapist.
