Concept: There is a second hidden society within the wizarding world that operates much as the wizarding world works with the wider world

Two separate directions this could go:

1. There is a muggle government group that goes around to wizarding events and helps minimize damage, using high tech tools to do so, and memory wipe machines to keep the secret. They were formed when Muggles realized the Wizarding world was causing a lot of spill over damage but kept secret because wizards would go bananas if they knew the muggles had tools that could counter their magic. Maybe they invite promising members of magical society to join them and ride herd on the greater wizarding society.

2. A secret muggle-derived wizarding society founded by half-bloods and muggleborn who realized how broken wizarding society and went and formed a separate, more advanced wizarding society. They consider the wizarding world just not worth spending the effort on when magic lets them build an entirely separate society without the first knowing. Muggleborn wizards are approached when they graduate Hogwarts to ask if they would rather join this group. Memory wiped if they refuse and 'disappeared' in a way it looks like an attack if they want.

Note I am not looking for the (pretty standard) "muggle or deviant wizarding group wants to take down the current order so forms a hidden group to work toward that". It is pretty standard in "muggle intervention in wizarding world" stories. I don't mind if everything falls apart, but key here is the system is set up to create a separate society into perpetuity. (Like the Statute is)


** Something major happens in the wizarding world, and the Aurors are called in. A mysterious Muggle agency comes to clean it up and disperses the Aurors by showing them a top-secret order from the Minister. Then a secret society of house-elves in suits appears bearing the highest-level authorization codes, taking over the case from the Muggles. A herd of centaurs ride in and claim the incident is beyond the elves' understanding, invoking the name of the Eternal Overseer and causing them to shake in fear.

Then come Unspeakables and reveal it was all an elaborate social experiment. A few decades back they had a really slow day at the office and decided to see how much they could fuck with people. Bit embarrassing, really, that it got so out of hand.

Edit: well, I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ddbzza/requestprompt_behind_the_statute_of_secrecy_us/f2h0p4e/][gave it a try]]. It was funnier in my head ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*** Dawlish had seen plenty strange things during his career, but he wasn't ready for what greeted his Aurors when they Apparated to Dartmoor. An orb blacker than black hovered above the wetlands, purple energies lashing out to vaporize anything they touched. He tilted his head back; already three storeys high, it was growing before his eyes.

"Merlin's beard," he murmured before steeling himself. Pretending you knew what you were doing was an important skill for a Senior Auror. "Listen up. Tonks, round up some Hitwizards and evacuate the nearest settlements. Proudfoot, report back and ask for further instructions. The rest, put protective charms---what's that noise?"

The Aurors exchanged confused murmurs. Tonks was the first to glance skyward and gasp. Three fat-bellied machines---pelihopters, if he recalled right---approached from the west, the noise growing worse every second.

The machines alighted near the shocked Aurors, and the infernal noise ceased. Muggles in black armor spilled out and swarmed them. Dawlish raised his wand, then becoming a target of a dozen firelegs, lowered it.

The man at the front lowered the visor of his helmet. "Major Hunter with the MI7. We'll take it from here."

Dawlish opened and closed his mouth several times before finding his voice. "/Take it from/---aren't you a Muggle? Do you have any idea---"

"Right back at you, Auror. This is beyond your pay grade." The major pulled out a parchment. "Rest assured we have authorization."

Dawlish gaped at the Ministry's seal, then waved his wand over it.

"It's genuine," he mumbled.

Proudfoot swore, and Dawlish felt like doing that himself. The Muggles were spreading out, erecting strange machinery, and cordoning the sphere with a yellow tape. What in the blazes was going on?

The major waved him off. "You should withdraw. Things might get messy." Turning to his people, he barked, "Activate the spatial stabilizer!"

"Activating," a woman replied, pressing buttons on a contraption until it spewed a blinding crimson ray at the sphere. "Power at twenty percent and rising."

A hum filled the air, causing several Aurors to cover their ears.

"Youse stops that right now!" a voice squeaked.

Dawlish scanned the twilight for several moments before glancing lower. His jaw sagged: it was the oddest house-elf he had seen. Its black robes appeared meticulously tailored, and its eyes were hidden by mirrored sunglasses.

"Identify yourself," Hunter barked, lifting his weapon.

"Youse being rude," the house-elf said. "Listens well. Today's authorization code is beings five-five-c-tango."

Hunter's weapon wavered. "What did you say?"

"Nobby not likes repeatings himself." The elf crossed his arms. "Youse check right now."

Hunter goggled before tapping his ear and entering a hushed conversation with whoever was on the other end. At length, he lowered his weapon and straightened up. "My apologies, Nobby. You have command."

Nobby nodded. "Tooks you long enough. First, youse be turning off silly machines, then youse keeping rabble away." His bulbous eyes flicked toward the Aurors. "The Council be cleanings this mess."

"Yes, sir." Hunter saluted, then motioned to his men, who advanced on the Aurors.

"Hang on," Dawlish said. "Hang on a bloody minute! Are you taking orders from a /house-elf/?"

Hunter chuckled darkly. "You lot don't know anything, do you?"

Proudfoot sputtered. "/You're/ just a bunch of---"

A series of cracks drew everyone's attention to the sphere. Countless house-elves surrounded it, clasping their hands to form a living chain, then began a chant that sent a shiver down Dawlish's spine.

"A rare sight," Hunter remarked. "It's only the MI7's highest echelons that deal with the Elven Council directly. You better make yourselves scarce."

Dawlish planted his feet. "I'm not moving until you explain what the hell's going on!"

Frowning, Hunter raised his fireleg; the Auror squad lifted their wands in response. The uneasy standoff continued until a rhythmic noise echoed in the distance. /Hooves/?

A cloud of dust rose into the sky as a herd of centaurs crested a hill. The elves' chant broke up in surprise. Hunter appeared as shocked as Dawlish was, and Muggles and magicals alike trained their weapons on the newcomers.

The centaurs slowed to a trot, and the tallest of them approached the elves, heedless of the weapons directed his way.

"We saw a black cloud eating the stars," he thundered. "Desist, young ones, this is beyond you."

"What big horse man do?" Nobby shooed him with his spindly arms. "Youse go back to forest!"

The centaur rumbled in laughter. "Does the Book of Prophecies mean anything to you?"

Nobby's eyes went wide as saucers. "How do youse know about the Book That Guides All?"

"We wrote it," the centaur said. "As it is said, when Jupiter is in the house of Venus..."

"The Star-Eater returns and devours all," Nobby mumbled, sinking to his knees. "Forgives us, Great Ones, we not realizes..."

The centaur nodded magnanimously. "No harm done, friend. We must now do as was foretold."

The elves scooted aside, and the centaurs trotted closer, conferring in hushed tones.

"Bloody hell," Hunter muttered.

Dawlish cleared his throat. "Do you feel like explaining /now/?"

Hunter glanced at the house-elves blocking them from the centaurs and sighed. "At this point your guess is as good as mine. I always thought the Council were top dogs, but..."

"The centaurs are guiding everything from the shadows, then?" Tonks piped up.

"Sure looks like it. It's been one revelation after another. Thank god that's over..." Hunter's eyes bugged out as he peered at something to the side.

Dawlish followed his gaze to an oval of blue energy hovering in the air. A grey-robed male figure stepped through it, then another, their faces obscured by shadowy cowls.

"I told you to be careful!" the first said. "It's the third time that you lose it in the time stream..." His head turned, taking in the gathered. "Oh dear. See what I mean, Bode?"

The second hurriedly crammed half a ham sandwich under his cowl. "Blimey, Oleander'll have my head for this. Watching them secret societies was his favorite amusement."

"That's why you need to calibrate carefully!" Croaker strolled by the Aurors and the MI7, stepped over the stunned house-elves, then stopped before the centaurs barring his way. "Excuse me."

A centaur rumbled, "This is no place for---"

Croaker tutted, then vanished to reappear within an arm's reach of the sphere.

"Youse be not touching it!" Nobby cried.

"Our readings were off the charts!" an MI7 woman added. "The energies'll vaporize you!"

Croaker produced a black rod and stuck it into the sphere, mumbling incantations until the sphere abruptly popped. An enormous concave bowl was left in its wake, and at its center, a cube that sucked up light itself. Skidding down, Croaker stuck it under his armpit and made his way back. Dusting off his palms, he regarded the gathered.

"Just a minor malfunction on our Spatial Discombobulator." When the cube emitted a rumble, leaking pure blackness, Croaker walloped it. "Happens all the time."

"I don't suppose you gentlebeings could ignore this little mishap?" Bole said mournfully. "Just continue conspiring as usual, that's all I'm asking. It's the best entertainment we have at the office."

Croaker smacked his forehead. "You can't just /tell/ them that, Bole!"

"Explain yourselves, wizards." The centaur leader pulled a bow from his back. "Are we but puppets dancing for your amusement?"

"Youse be pulling the stringses all along?" Nobby asked.

"No, no," Croaker said. "Of course not."

Hunter sighed. "That /would've/ been ludicrous---"

"We only started this," Croaker said. "It was a slow day at the office, see, so we had a competition on how many conspiracies we could stack. Planted a few ideas, made sure the right people were in the right places... Bit embarrassing, really, how far out of hand it got."

The centaurs stomped their hooves, the elves snaped their fingers, and the humans erupted in yells. Croaker and Bode strolled nonchalantly to their portal, their figures blurring to let several projectiles zip past. A dozen steps before the portal, Croaker reached for his ear.

"Yes, Head Unspeakable, we're about to... Yes, I understand. /Everyone/?" He considered the frenzied mob. "No, no problem. It will be done." He handed the cube over to Bode. "The game goes on, he says."

Bode perked up. "Still have a chance to win my bet about who'll catch on first, then."

Croaker rummaged in his pocket before withdrawing what looked like a miniature blackboard. "Excuse me gentlemen, ladies, Beings! I know you're confused, but if you look here, all will be explained!"

At a gesture of Croaker's wand, the blackboard ballooned to an enormous size and lit up displaying---

Dawlish squeezed his eyes shut, and said out of the corner of his mouth, "Don't look!"

There was a chorus of murmurs, then a light bright enough to daze him through his eyelids. A silence fell. Dawlish could take it no longer and peeked. Not much had changed, except everyone's eyes seemed hazy, and their postures too relaxed.

"The Star-Eater is vanquished," the centaur leader thundered. "Speak not of our meeting, little ones." He motioned to his herd, and they trotted off.

"Wes done cleaning youse messes," Nobby said, and one by one, the elves disappeared.

Hunter addressed Dawlish, but didn't seem to actually /see/ him. "We neutralized the anomaly. It's best you forget we were here."

Dawlish nodded machinely, unsure how he should play along. His team all peered at him with glassy eyes. When a hand landed on his shoulder, he whirled around and was met with a shadowy cowl.

"You always tell me to be careful, Croaker, but look, you missed one," Bode said. "/Obliviate/."

Deep in the bowels of the Ministry, in his resplendent office on Level Nine, the Head Unspeakable reached into the bowl of lemon drops on his desk with a blackened hand.

"Just as planned."

** The first direction is giving me strong MIB vibes. I know that "strength of steel wings" has a secret muggle society that is working to expose the greater wizarding world instead of help them hide it.

So if this MIB type system was set up by the different world governments and they all worked together to keep the statute of secrecy going, where would the conflict come in, in your opinion? Would it be that the wizarding world and the MIBs clashed over a particular case and therefore started working toward cross purposes? Or maybe the wizarding world stopped helping the MIB's and they had to kick it up a notch and they start recruiting real magical folk to their side? hmmm. There's lots of possibilities for this what are you thinking?

Your Second Idea is a bit harder to pull off I feel like because so many muggleborns being oblivitaed would definitely raise the hackles of any magical ministry I think. Do you think that the current wizarding ministry just wouldn't care if all the muggleborns went off and started their own country? It might be interesting if this was like an established world where they had separated from them decades ago and now see how they are living in these separate worlds. Very interesting. Are you planning on writing one of these?

*** I remember reading Flying without a Broom linkffn(1604214) , which had the American aurors be the MIB (with muggles just seeing someone wiping peoples memories with a glowing stick and immediately assume it is the government covering up aliens). It was just a side point, but it did get me thinking that it would be neat to have a MIB like organization run into Harry & Co.

​

I kinda assumed in both scenarios you would have the same problem as the statute has: There are Tens of Millions of Muggles in the UK, but only tens of thousands of Wizards. So your secret organization would only have hundreds of members. Even if a few of them were good enough to take out an entire ally of wizards and the ministry response, they would have to fear if all the wizards organized to oppose them.

For the muggle case, you could make it so they have to keep membership in their organization to people who have a natural defense against Legilimency. Or alternatively, people who have some natural defense against scrying or prophetic magics.

As for the fear, I would imagine they would be scared of the situation in Harry Potter and the Iron Lady linkffn(12212363) . Where muggles knowing about magic brings Dumbledore and Voldemort to stop fighting each other (although not necessarily work together). Doesn't have to be a real threat, just enough that our group of hiders believes it is possible.

Alternatively, they could be confident in their ability to decapitate the wizarding world, but not halt every actor. In a world where a single wizard could cause enough misunderstanding with magic to cause WW3, that could be enough to avoid coming out in the open.

​

(I note both of those can be applied to the Statute with wizards vs muggles: Wizards can be scared that even if they eclipse their muggle counterparts, magic coming out could unify all the muggle governments against a common enemy and no Wizarding government can stand up to 6 billion muggles. Alternatively, they can be confident they could decapitate all standing muggle governments/organizations, but not that they could stop all muggles from learning about / trying to counter magic. A world with a million muggle resistance cells could be terrifying if having a thousand muggles die to a single wizard death is still a good trade off for the muggles).

​

I don't think the (prejudiced) parts of the wizarding world would care at all if Muggleborns set off on their own. I think they would care if that group started becoming powerful enough to show them up...

Anyway, first thing is always to see what is out there. I like this idea, but I have another non-HP writing project, and if I do a HP fic I'm thinking on the idea of a Muggle education professional getting sent to Hogwarts instead of Umbridge, which has been something i've been developing for a while ;)

​

Still, this one has some potential.
