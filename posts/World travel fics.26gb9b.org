I've read too may fics that are centred around England and have found myself to enjoy fics in which Harry leaves. Bungle in the Jungle for example is one of the best I've read. I'd also like stories which are AU as I find slight changes as knowing whats coming is boring as hell. No slash please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]]. Crack. Completed. Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

The Wise One trilogy, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1194522/FarenMaddox][FarenMaddox]]. It is a Sirius raises Harry fiction, and the first book (IMO, the best of the three), they travel around the world.

*** I've just read the wise one trilogy from your recommendation, thanks, it was quite enjoyable. The first book was the best out of the three, I didn't enjoy the second book too much as not a lot actually happened but the series on a whole was worth a read. I don't understand why the author wrote the final chapter if he's not writing a series of sequels though, god damnit theres so much potential there.

**** I just read the trilogy last week as well. There was a thread about a week or two ago recommending it - so they deserve the credit.

** The first part (~12% of the story) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]] has Harry travelling all over the world with his family, trying to escape from various government agencies.

Warnings to consider (also, spoilers):

- Death Eaters are often not killed so that they can be rescued by Voldemort from prison later on or be retrieved (e.g. /Ennervate/) just then and there, during the skirmish itself.

- OP has a weakness for martial arts and Japanese cold weapons. Reading this story often felt like watching a 6/10--7/10 quality anime.

- Snape is Voldemort-aligned and nerfed in all his abilities.

- Dumbledore and Voldemort are intellectually downgraded.

- Harry is OPed.

  - One would expect from someone with so many powers to be less [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsISUseless][useless]] and more productive, but that's not that case here.
  - The ending is very disappointing. Harry not only doesn't use his powers to their full potential during the story development itself, but also goes full retard in the finale and manages to ruin the world without even any “assistance” from Voldemort.

- (later books spoiler warning) There is a rather stupid death plotting for N. Flamel.
