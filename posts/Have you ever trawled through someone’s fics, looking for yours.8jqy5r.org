Just what the title says. Have you ever scrolled through the works of an account which you suspect may have plagiarised one of your works? Ever trawled through a compilation fic to see whether they've put yours there? I have. I knew someone wanted to use my plot (including butchered versions of my own original characters and settings) - they had asked me and been gently turned down - and I periodically have to check their compilation fics to make sure they're not doing it behind my back.


** Ha! My docs aren't NEARLY good enough to plagiarize!

*** That's what I thought as well. Still didn't stop someone from posting it under their name.

*** I'm sure they're better than you think. They always are. I know mine are good solely because I have an editor who -a) Makes them so and -b) Tells me so. We have an extensive editing process..

*** I've had a fic plaigarised from me before that was so bad that I never even bothered to post it from FFN. I was almost offended.

** I have had someone ask me to use ideas from my story and agreed they could, but only checked to see if they ever posted their own twist (which they hadn't when I checked). However, with your story, even if they decided to go against your wishes and use it...can you actually do anything about it? (I don't know and am genuinely curious)

*** I may be using JK Rowling's characters and magical realm, but it's very loosely with my own plot, many of my own characters and at least one major setting/location of my own, so yes. I can report it to the site admins and should have a case. They want to use my original plot, as well as shadows of my original characters and imitations of my original settings. It's mostly my intellectual property.

That doesn't sound like plagiarism. It's only plagiarism if it's word for word either in part or in its entirety. If they are copying your plot and borrowing your characters and settings but rewriting it in their own words, there's nothing you can do. That's fanfiction I'm afraid. It must be pretty annoying for Rowling too.

***** I still see it as taking something which is not theirs. Literally all they do is change names and switch a HP character for another HP character. They have written my story, not word-for-word, but action-for-action, setting-for-setting, dialogue-for-dialogue. When we write fanfiction, we use characters, settings and prompts, but make the story and the world our own - usually. We still have a right to our intellectual property.

****** Yes but that is essetially what fanfiction is. How many stories out there are basically the canon books rewritten with minor changes or an exchanged character that basically changes nothing? I'm not saying it doesn't suck, because it does. Im in agreement with you there, but unless whole passages are lifted word for word, I truely don't think much can be done. I'm pretty sure the act of writing fanfic waves any claims we may have had to parts of it under intellectual property. However, i am not a lawyer and thus very well may be wrong and probably am.

*truely* is actually spelled *truly*. You can remember it by *no e*.\\

** No, no one's ever likely to plagiarise my work; it's not popular enough. If someone reused 'my' plot or world or characters but written in their own words, I might not like it but there would be nothing I could do and I'd feel an idiot if I tried. That after all is what I'm doing with Rowling's material. But that's not plagiarism, it's just derivative.

*** I believe there is a point where it does become plagiarism, where it adheres so closely to your plot and uses characters so much like your original characters and settings so much like your original settings that it might as well be the same story, but perhaps with a different protagonist or with a different coupling. My main worry is that I had seen drafts of this person's work and they clearly didn't have any understanding of my characters to imitate them with, but it was so clearly fanfiction of my fanfiction that anyone reading both works would immediately see the connections and the poor quality of work would reflect on me as an author.

Yes. I daresay that's what Rowling would think too if she was ever daft enough to read HP fanfiction.

***** I mean POOOOOOOR quality. There are some fanfiction authors who are pretty darn good authors and the quality of their works amazes me to see. To think one book series could inspire such greatness in people is insane. That said, they're mostly the ones that use Rowling's world and a few of her characters as a basis for something bigger, more complex and so incredibly in-depth. I like to think I'm nearing that league. I put an immense amount of effort into my work, and it is far more to me than just Harry Potter. It has a mind of its own now and, if I changed some names and tweaked the magic, it would be its own original series entirely. Also, E.L James.
