Is there anywhere online that I could find a concise list of all the descriptions of Hogwarts and all the key locations there in.

I want to build on what has already been described in canon to make my story more real

#+begin_quote
  (This work of fiction borrows Jurassic World, the theme park and its dinosaurs.)Mankind has always tried to gain control of all things around them, making themselves the higher authority. They never know when is enough until destruction occurs and they are left to pick up the pieces. But even then, they still don't learn their lesson.What happens after the newly opened Jurassic World threatens to face the same incident with the Indominus Rex?
