For me it's a few things...the top being the word "girlfriend" in fanfictions that involve romance, especially fanfics that have a gritty, realistic aspect to them. I feel like the term, "girlfriend" is just too...childish and it breaks the fic for me.

Other phrases and words include,

"He didn't know why but [insert amazing magical happenstance]"

Any situation /not/ involving tragedy in which Harry tears up.


** "For the greater good" is always accompanied by blatantly evil Dumbledore.

Also, constantly referring to people with titles like "The Slytherin Prince" or the "The Golden Trio".

I hate that one, especially when it's not used ironically. Harry saying "The Golden Trio is whole again" after reconciling with Ron or such... That is enough to put me of the story completely.

Also I'm slightly annoyed by the way Hogwarts uniforms are solely based on the movies in most fics. I'm not sure why though, considering there are other popular things from the movies that I don't mind (although I prefer Bellatrix not throwing an AK at Sirius, gives an opening for a character that is a tad more complex than 'just sheer crazy').

***** Eh... That wasn't a dig at Ron. I was looking for an example of extra-annoying usage of the term and I happened to have read a fic in the day before writing that comment that had such an occurance, so I used that. I may not like Ron, but I'm not making random jabs at him in a completely unrelated thread.

I just think that it makes your characters /very/ unlikable if they refer to themselves as 'Gryffindor princess', 'golden boy', 'golden trio' or anything else like that unless it's done with obvious irony. If anything that line was a dig at the Harry in that fic ;)

*** It's not so much every instance of "girlfriend" or "boyfriend" as it is the way it's used. A more serious, gritty fanfiction can easily break the suspension of disbelief through using the term too much or changing the writing style to match the fanfiction.

My current example would be Vox Corporis, which I am enjoying, but the way the author uses the terms just doesn't work, in my opinion.

Words like "boyfriend/girlfriend", "high school", "lunch break", "commute," etc, references to a very normal, everyday life, can pull you out of that immersion. Like, when you see the world "commute", for example, you link it to "oh shit I have to get up and go to work tomorrow". When you see the word "high school", you could link it to "oh shit I have to go to school tomorrow". Bam, gone immersion.

Personally, I would say that. It's completely distracting when you are trying to conjure a setting up in your mind if you have all these out of place words.

I was trying to read a Teen Wolf fanfic once and there was just something really off about it, but I didn't know what it was, and then I realised it was British English when one of the characters said something like "Oi!

I think the word can be used for emphasis, but mostly by people trying to sound formal and, when used by kids, grown up. I can totally see Percy Weasley saying things like "It's very good to see you again" from the age of seven up until he's a crotchety old man yelling at kids to get off his lawn.

An exception to 'very' being formal would be in a situation like this:
