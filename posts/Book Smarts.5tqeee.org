I am currently reading linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer) which is pretty decent, even if it does include a somewhat unfortunate number of cliches. One of which is the propensity for characters to somehow learn what is ostensibly really complicated magic faster than the Hogwarts curriculum would seem to consider plausible.

Then I realized this isn't really a cliche, because it's basically canon. Hermione could pull off an expertly cast [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Protean_Charm][Protean charm]] in fifth year, even though such a spell was NEWT standard. Hermione doesn't have an ambitious bone in her whole body, she doesn't frequently learn magic because of the potential uses but rather because it is part of the assigned or projected course work. Besides which, she spends a lot of time helping Harry and Ron with their homework or writing excessively perfect essays for class. Imagine if she had been sorted into Ravenclaw instead and liked learning for its own sake, not just for getting perfect scores on tests. Imagine a Hermione who spends all her time in the library finding /new/ things, rather than just researching for a more comprehensive essay. What might she be capable of by book five?

From another angle, Tom Riddle was able to create a Hrocrux while in his sixth year; arguably the /darkest/ magic, the most potent incarnation of enchantment and ritual, and within the capabilities of a sufficiently motivated Sixteen year old kid.

Skill in magical combat is of course based on a number of factors like ingenuity, creativity, casting speed, etc. However, general magical 'power' can be considered as something else all together, and is dependent more on accumulated *Knowledge of Magic* than the more technical applications of dueling. Learning how to properly cast a spell is pretty easy, remember; Harry mastered the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Charm][Summoning charm]] in what, a few days? A week or two? Getting good at performing a particular spell just takes a bit of practice, which most magicals simply don't bother with.

How quick can a brand new Hogwarts student get to the point where they can start throwing around impressive magic [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UunqBAHBDo8][like this]] if they actually apply themselves? How soon can the Protean Charm, or other similarly complex magic, be found within the grasp of a Student with the requisitely precise diction, fine motor control, and keen mind for visualization? Understanding theory is of course essential when you want to start spreading out on your own, but as any college student could tell you; you forget a lot but can still muddle through so long as you remember most of the essentials.

A /lot/ of fics make use of something like a 'magical core' to explain power differences, but there is no such thing alluded to in canon. This is less about 'what makes a powerful wizard?' and more 'how hard is it, all other things being equal, to become powerful?' which varies a lot from fic to fic, with some making it trivial and others making it nearly impossible save for the insanely foolhardy.

Any recs for fics with believable power curves are welcome as well.

edit: Consider the problem like this: You are an eleven year old muggleborn who has just received their Hogwarts letter. You are relatively smart, though not excessively so. You have decent hand-eye coordination, and can speak a little of a couple languages so your pronunciation is good. Your family is comfortably middle class, so while you won't be buying one of every book in Flourish and Blotts, you can afford an extra dozen or so used books each year. You don't mind merely getting decently solid EEs on your course work if your interests lie elsewhere. Your stated goal in life is to do something blatantly impossible and/or reality breaking, like building your own version of Hogwarts from scratch in a single afternoon, or opening a stable wormhole to every planet in the solar system.

How long will it take for such actions to be placed on the 'things I can do' list?


** I have personally always liked subscribing to this policy. Partially because a lot of fics focus on the science of it, and I myself am fairly STEM oriented as a CompSci major. I like my stories to be internally consistent, which means that magic taking no energy at all is more acceptable than the idea that turning coal into diamonds somehow takes up more magical energy than conjuring or vanishing something. Magic plays fast and loose with energy conservation and physics, so I prefer to discard the pretense that any energy is used, besides mental strain from visualizing concepts.

  “How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in spite of himself.

  “Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn't she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn't have killed Sirius.”

  “That's stupid,” said Ron.

  “It's survivor's guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin's tried to talk her round, but she's still really down. She's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!”

  “With her --- ?”

  “She can't change her appearance like she used to,” explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.”

******* You could, but on the other hand we do know that her son changed appearance (even if only superficially, namely his hair) basically on a whim or even less than a whim. As such, with it being something that you learn to control in order not to change rather than something that you'd learn to control in order to be able to use, I think the possibility of it being that she doesn't bother is really low. Sure, it could be said that she simply clamped down on it so tightly that nothing of her metamorphing abilities leaks through, so to say, but I think something like that genuinely counts as a result of shock caused by something traumatic which means it could be “not coming that easy to her” to a high enough degree that it would still count as completely stopping. Really, I think it it were genuinely losing control to the point where it would be harder for her to control her gift then she'd not remain completely the same all the time.

Though, obviously, it could also simply be something Madame Rowling wasn't very consistent on. Though, considering that Taure tried to actually get what was and reach for consistency, well ... I'm not sure if that being the case affects his work as far as I see it.

*** That's an interesting point, and an author can vary how well it applies to particular magical disciplines in their stories.

Research and novelty require understanding. Rote performance requires proficiency with the basic operations required. In wand magic, the basic operations seem to be wand movements, pronunciation, and focusing intent -- things that every Hogwarts student practices. With that, it makes sense for a student to learn new spells relatively easily.

In potions making, I get the impression that some of the operations aren't written down clearly, so the skill is in figuring out an exact recipe from the description. But in potions /research/, you need the skill and knowledge in determining how ingredients combine, how to divine the effects from the ingredients and the required ingredients from the desired effects, and what sort of heating and stirring you need to make it into a proper potion rather than an explosion.

*** Is 'experience' different from 'practice'? because I call 'practice' something easy to achieve through repetition of the material, and an important, but not essential, part of gaining power. Trying (and mostly failing) to play a specific song on the guitar is 'practice' and eventually leads to you being good at playing /that song/.

I would think 'experience' is more about general familiarity with the totality of the topic and an ever increasing knowledge of the details. Reading Alchemy 101 isn't going to make you Nicholas Flammel, but performing the various transmutations in the book and reading other support texts and so on will gradually increase your 'experience', and depending on the time spent doing that, might come pretty quickly.

We seem to define ambition very differently? Learning things for the sake of themselves (like a Ravenclaw) is the anti-thesis to ambition. Hermione most of the time does things for the sake of something else: Better grades, her education, being helpful to her friends. This is all centered around her ambitions (being recognized as a top student by the teachers; a career; defeating Voldemort). Hermione is certainly the most ambitious of the main characters. If you think she isn't ambitious, how do you categorize Harry or god forbid Ron?

*** Harry is pretty ambitious.

I think of ambition as being a drive /towards/ something, an objective you want to achieve which will require effort, and then exerting that effort.

Hermione isn't ambitious because she doesn't struggle. She has an easy time of class, she wants to get 110% on everything not because it /gets/ her something, but because 'being a good student is what good children do' and she wants to be thought of as a good child. But what is it /for/? She isn't using the teacher's perspectives to /get/ anything, to ensure she was made Prefect or Head Girl or get an in at the Ministry or... anything. Being the teacher's pet in school when school ends at 17 is a means to an end, but Hermione treats it as an end in itself.

Ron has /an ambition/, to play on the Chuddley Cannons, but he is /not/ 'ambitious' because he doesn't want it hard enough to exert effort.

Harry is a /little/ ambitious, because, while he doesn't have many goals, when he realizes what his goals are he isn't afraid to exert the necessary effort.

Everyone wants /something/, it isn't just wanting that makes one ambitious.

I don't share this particularly dim view on her character. Do you think she's stupid? Where does this interpretation on her motivations come from? Is it based on anything except your own cynical world-view? Getting good grades and studying a lot seems like a good strategy to have a successful career... if it weren't for Voldemort or blood-prejudice. Even in Year 2 it's obvious that Hermione doesn't just study for studying sake, considering the whole Polyjuice incident, she's clearly capable and interested in applying her knowledge to reach her goals (which is like one of her defining characteristics in subsequent books; your view on her character honestly baffles me).

Harry is the typical "Hero's Journey" type character. He's just thrown into situation and overcomes them out of necessity. In my opinion struggling only barely relates to ambition. Harry always only sees the next obstacle and figures out a way to solve it, there's rarely some kind of planning and goals involved (in the case of the Horcruxes hunt he's just a tool going along with someone else's plans). He has surprisingly little agency for a protagonist and no ambition to speak of. It's not like he's diligently working on a way to rid the world of Voldemort from Year 2 onwards. No, even in Year 6 he is still obsessed with what Malfoy might be doing and seems annoyed by having to get information out of Slughorn that might be vital to the war effort.

Something being an 'ambition' IMHO necessitates you doing something to achieve it. If you don't it's just a daydream/fantasy. It seems pretty obvious to me that Ron is merely compensating for his inferiority complex with his brothers and hasn't even tried to figure out what he wants. He's like multiple steps before even reaching the stage of self-reflection where he could have an ambition...

***** Yes, Hermione is extremely unintelligent in most senses. She thinks that House-Elves should be freed despite not reading any books on the subject (other than books that would support her argument). She refuses to look at a PUREBLOOD wizard's view of the situation, and she even goes as far as leaving clothes out for them to remotely free them without their consent. Thus making more work for the single house-elf that is free. She is the very definition of a liberal in short. She wants to be progressive for the sake of being progressive, with no other motivation. Hermione's goals are never shown, she just exists.

I agree with the Harry point, Harry was thoroughly un-ambitious for someone who came so close to being in Slytherin. Maybe that was his path to greatness? Maybe the distraction of being liked caused him to forget many things? I feel as if Harry is more oblivious than anything, rarely doing anything unless being told to do so.

Not a daydream or fantasy if in the Mirror of Erised. That's like saying what Harry saw was a daydream or fantasy too. Maybe his true ambition was to get his parents back? Rowling herself said that he would choose the resurrection stone over any Hallow.

*** Ravenclaw and Slytherin don't have a monopoly on knowledge.

I agree that Hermione doesn't really pursue knowledge for its own sake. She lacks the curiosity and creativity that I associate with true academic brilliance, so would make a surprisingly poor Ravenclaw.

But she doesn't really show a lot of ambition either. She doesn't get good grades in pursue of some grand career goal and she helps her friends /because she is a good friend/. For me, an ambitious person has one or two lofty, long-term goals and is singly dedicated in their pursuit of them. Hermione is very Hufflepuff in her pursuit of knowledge: hard-work for its own sake and to support her friends.

Frankly, I think Ron shows the most ambition of the golden trio. He works hard to get on the quidditch team and shows a desire to get out of the shadow of his brothers. Harry shows a bit within each book (saving Buckbeak, stalking Malfoy) but he's pretty reactive across the series as a whole.

You seem to imply that ambition necessarily has to be self-centered. I disagree vehemently. If your ambition is to achieve world-peace you're incredibly ambitious, even if it doesn't involve personal gain.

Things that Hermione Granger is ambitious about:

- becoming a stand-out student (Hufflepuff is the opposite, they don't want to stand out at all)
- seeing her friends survive and succeed academically (and the way she helps her friends isn't very Hufflepuff at all: A Hufflepuff would never confound another Quidditch Keeper in order to help their friends, it is extremely unfair)
- ensuring the survival of her parents at great personal cost
- freeing the house-elves, even taking up knitting in order to achieve that goal
- ridding the world of Voldemort (Harry would be completely lost without her in Year 7, he'd probably starve or suffer hypothermia after a few weeks, because he's not actually doing anything to achieve his goals except attending)

There's a bunch more, but I grow tired of this list. Let's face it, Hermione is the most Slytherin of all the characters who aren't straight up evil (and even she has a severe edge to her when she tries to achieve her goals... stealing potion ingredients, disfiguring traitors, cheating). You seem way too much influenced by how Slytherin House (House Evil) interprets ambition, which is only half the picture.

***** We're talking ambition here, not cunning. I agree that Hermione develops a cunning streak -- but keep in mind, a lot of the examples you provide are done on behalf of her friends and/or require bravery.

Anyway, onto your list:

- Ambitions need to be an achievement (i.e. proactive). /No-one/ wants their friends or family to die or fail. When Voldemort is out to get you and your friends, fighting back is just self-preservation. If anything, I'd say those would be loyalty and bravery, respectively.

- How is 'being a stand-out student' an ambition, in and of itself? Unless you're a glory hound, that's not an achievement. Hermione's stand-out-ness is a by-product of her intelligence and hard-work.

- I forgot about SPEW. Freeing the house elves is a very noble ambition--one that is fogotten after OotP. I'd also argue that SPEW arises from her loyalty to muggle values. Even the way she carries out the 'peaceful protest' is very muggle. Not that Slytherins and muggles are incompatible, but I'd suggest that a Slytherin would take a more nuanced approach.

Also, I think you're pigeon-holing Hufflepuffs. Cedric was a stand-out student and an exemplary Puff.

Well yes, but this is exactly the point at which ambition seperates from a mundane type of outlook. Yes, no-one wants their friends or family to die, but very few people would go to the lengths that Hermione does to achieve that goal. This is what makes her an ambitious person... she doesn't just hold that idea, she's actively working towards it. Very few people would make their parents forget all about themselves and send them to Australia in order to ensure their safety. Ambitious people set a goal for themselves and work very hard towards it. Need to defeat Voldemort? Okay, I guess we need to destroy his Horcruxes first. How do we do that? A beaded bag might be useful, we'll need lots of resources...

No-one would object to being President of the US, but it needs a certain kind of ambition to actually try to do it, come up with an insane plan that everyone mocks and then actually /become/ president.

This whole thing really centers around the fact that Rowling fucked up big-time with Slyterhin. There isn't a single student in that house who we see that's truly ambitious (certainly not Malfoy; he's just a pampered prince). The only two who come close are Slughorn and Snape (if fate hadn't conspired against him, I'd imagine him trying to become the worlds greatest potioneer - not wasting his time teaching kids). It's even worse in the cunning category.

I didn't mean to do that, I was generalizing their characteristics. The house system is too stiff to account for all kinds of people. Being ambitious certainly doesn't prevent anyone from going to Hufflepuff, but it's not something that I'd associate strongly with Hufflepuff. Ambition mixes very well with bravery for example, because you need to take risks, but Hufflepuff falls more into the reliable category to me (which is perfectly fine as well, just a different approach).

I don't think we know enough about Cedric's motivations to make a judgement call here, but he's probably the exception in Hufflepuff. If it's about the money then a hard worker would look for better ways to earn it other than risking their life in a blood-sport and I can't see the glory aspect as appealing for Puffs.

** So I don't actually buy into the idea that students can somehow get super good at magic as fast as possible. The people we've been shown to do exceptional things either worked long and hard on it (e.g. the Marauders becoming anamagi) or the thing wasn't that exceptional (just because Hermione could /do/ the protean charm doesn't mean she understands Charms to a NEWT level. That's like saying someone who knows how to take a derivative before they take Calculus is gifted because they know advanced material. Yes, they are, but no they're not some wunderkind).

  From another angle, Tom Riddle was able to create a Hrocrux while in his sixth year; arguably the darkest magic, the most potent incarnation of enchantment and ritual, and within the capabilities of a sufficiently motivated Sixteen year old kid.
#+end_quote

Also, there's nothing stating that the Horcrux Ritual is particularly difficult. Just that it's obscure. Personally I'm a fan of the Prince of Slytherin approach that it's just super obscure (and has alternate conditions that aren't related ot magical skill; won't say more due to spoilers).

Realistically, if you spend all your time outside class learning Magic, you could get good at it. Just like how the kids who spend all their time painting outside of class can go on to become great painters. But it's not a fast process at all. It takes /years/ of dedication to get not-so-bad at it.

*** On the flip side I do buy into the idea that someone could get good at magic fast. The topic of rituals isn't really covered in canon but I imagine there is far more available than just creating oneself a new body using blood, bone, and flesh.

Assuming they all require a form of sacrifice I can see the entire spectrum being labelled dark. Someone like Tom Riddle would gladly do something like sacrifice a human for an improved mind or ability to wield magic.

**** See the issue with that then is why doesn't everyone else do it?

If it requires a live human to be sacrificed, you'd expect there to be people who snatch up muggles or (Fullmetal Alchemist spoiler) [[/spoiler][that the government sacrifices convicted prisoners and uses them as sacrifices]].

If it's possible to get good quickly, there should be some reasonw hy not everyone does so then, and I don't think "dark magic" is enough to dissuade people. What if you had to sacrifice someone who trusted you completely and you valued more than anyone else? That would be interesting then, I think.

Exactly! In the linked fic, Harry gets, not a huge boost, but not a small one either, from simply carving runes into his skin with a knife. Sure some weenies in Hufflepuff might not be interested in that, but virtually everyone in Slytherin and Gryfindor should be covered in scars. There's some waffle about it requiring a good mind for math, but then it's stated to be the sort of thing they teach in Arithmancy in like, 4th year which kind of kills that explanation.

But it's not necessarily quite so clear cut because of something called Opportunity Cost. It has lots of implications, but the one which matters here is the population of Wizarding Britain, and in general the Magical World. Simply put: it is possible, if the population is small, that things which are beneficial in retrospect are non-obvious. /If/ the Horcrux ritual is *really* rare, it is possible that lots of people who would be willing in principle to make a Horcrux will simply not get the chance because they never encounter the books which describe it.

It is /possible/ to 'win the lottery' by finding a dusty tome in a forgotten corner which details the ritual 'Becomus Goddus' the requirements for which are relatively mild... it's just no one read it thoroughly before. The odds just decrease significantly with population size. But if there are only a few thousand Wizards...

****** The other problem with that 'win the lottery' scenario is that someone must have done the research to come up with the ritual. And then they either didn't use it for no satisfactory reason, or they used it and nobody since decided to try to follow in their footsteps, or they hid away their research very well -- in which case how did you stumble across it?.

You might, for instance, say that Salazar Slytherin was a squib or even a muggle who learned a science behind rituals and used them to gain magical power through raw genius. Then, after Hogwarts was built, he hid his research notes in the Chamber of Secrets. Tom Riddle adapted the ritual to make himself stronger, but out of respect for his forbear, he left the original notes in place -- but he didn't add his own ritual.

Years later, Harry discovers the original notes and has to figure out how -- no, I can't write Harry so OOC as to figure out a complex ritual from a sheet of paper. Hermione reads the notes, starts applying the ritual to the families of muggleborns (starting with her parents), and tries to defeat Voldemort with numbers. Luna Lovegood looks at it and decides to apply it to herself and nearly dies in the process, but with a complete lack of self-preservation tries again and, with Hermione's help, they figure out an approximation of what Voldemort did to himself. It's nowhere near as effective, but the version they settle on is a lot safer.

Still has the problem of why no one else applied the same principles. After many generations of improving the craft, someone would come up with more impressive works.

****** There's also the discussion that Harry actually botched his rune tattoos, and he's really lucky that he didn't end up dead or a vegetable, which might be another reason that people don't dabble in that sort of thing

******** Sure, if it weren't for the fact that the use of runes in the way Harry did apparently fucks with your mind in a major way.

One of the first examples of runes Harry uses on himself, is one which will make his physical body mature faster. The problem is, that aside from the whole 'you're growing more quickly so you have to eat more' thing, the rune also massively lowers Harry's inhibitions, increases his lust, and makes him prone to anger.

I mean, would you choose to carve that kind of tattoo into your skin (especially since you can /never/ remove it)? Would you allow your kid to get that kind of tattoo? If you were the government, would you make an effort to curb this sort of usage of runes?

** I've seen a couple of times the view point that magic is just too ordinary for witches and wizards to get excited about. I mean, in theory, we could have high school students learning advanced stuff, and nerds and sporty types do. We have computer geeks who can do incredible stuff at age 14 that is comparable to Hermione learning the Protean Charm, and making Polyjuice, and etc. But most high school students don't. I am well aware there is an incredible range of things I could self learn, and I think they are awesome, but I can't be bothered. High school students can learn how to do an adults job better than them, especially with technology. Some mechanically minded teens could modify the hell out of a broken down old car and turn it into something cool. I had to google before I could /do an oil change/. Yet in theory, there's nothing stopping me from becoming an awesome enough mechanic that I could fix my own car. A 13 year old martial artist or boxer could kick my tiny ass, never mind a 15 year old. An average 13 year old? I could fend em off or outrun them. Probably.

So yeah, Patronus are awesome, but since Dementors apparently usually give little trouble, and Lethifolds don't hang out on the aisle, and kids have no more need for them than a normal kid would need to carry pepper spray in a good neighbourhood. Very handy in case of attackers, but the likelihood of needing it is small. So adults who go into law enforcement or travel to dodgy countries learn it, but kids don't get taught it.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
