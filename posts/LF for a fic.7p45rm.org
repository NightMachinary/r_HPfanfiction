There's this fic I read on FFN and the scene that's stuck in my head is one where Harry looks in to the Basilisk's eyes loads of times and he dies, but he comes back real quick and everyone is like Harry stop. Also, Neville has a pet boggart that Dumbledore accidentally kills. Can someone please help me find it

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.
