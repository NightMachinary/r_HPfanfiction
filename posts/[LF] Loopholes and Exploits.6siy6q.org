So, in a lot of fanfiction, the writers seem to have a common idea that wizardkind have no common sense or logic and I was wondering if there was any fic that took that notion to the extreme. It can be a SI or an OC, I don't really care, I just eant to see some crazy shit. Thanks a bunch!


** Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk

Lots of bashing, but demonstrates lots of instances where the magical world has no common sense.

**** Yeah I read a lot of that and those scenes really put me off and were a big reason I stopped reading the story. That and y'know, the shear implausibility of the whole story. The suspension of disbelief required to read that story is ridiculous.

*** I feel like the Ministry would have a department dealing with those sorts of things. In the real world making money from fraud, selling drugs, etc is easy. What is hard is disguising your ill-gotten gains.

Like for example, an unknown wizard starts depositing large sums of money in a new Gringotts account? Doesn't list any employment on his taxes/deposits? Or lists fake information that doesn't hold up to a simple background check by Gringotts (Goblins are very meticulous)? There are tons of potential red flags that would lead to an investigation. I'm sure the Ministry works closely with Gringotts (They didn't win those Goblin Rebellions to not get concessions) and other financial institutions to ensure that wizards aren't using magic to profit off of the Muggle world.

Not to say that profiting off of Muggles is impossible as a wizard. More that it would require extensive money laundering and financial cleverness to avoid getting busted like Al Capone was.

** One of the neat inventions I saw in a fanfic was a switching spell attached to a hoop that was linked to a box.

Gold passing through the hoop would be exchanged for dirt in the box.

Gold is everywhere in microscopic amounts.

[[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gold-ocean-sea-hoax-science-water-boom-rush-treasure]]

He spelled the hoop to sit beneath the surface of the ocean and let the currents push ocean water through it.

The dirt he put in the box would slowly be replaced by gold sand. He would empty the box out and toss in more dirt occasionally.

Technically speaking he would have been able to run massive amounts of regular dirt through the hoop for the same effect.

This would also be a good way to get huge amounts of aluminum since it's the most common metal in the earth crust but is mostly loose particles in the soil.

** HPMoR, for all its flaws, does this. Petunua marries a scientist so Harry goes into Hogwarts with a strong science background.

I forget the name, but there's alao a one-shot wjere Harry uses Magical Contracts to make Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc. lose their magic.

Linkffn(Almost a Squib) does this with a lot of Harry's canon decisions.
