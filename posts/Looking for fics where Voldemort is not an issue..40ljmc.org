Either he actually dies in 1981, or was killed earlier. I remember reading a fic where Harry mentions his parents were killed by some wannabe Dark Lord the the aurors hunted him down and killed him. I don't really care why or how.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** He didn't die on Halloween in Emperor, though. It's HBP compliant, meaning Horcruxes are a thing. And that's not even a spoiler, considering it's heavily hinted at in the beginning and out right said early on. Regardless, I think OP would like to know this. [[/spoiler][And although he isn't a large issue at first he comes back to play a fairly significant role later. How significant exactly, we don't know, since Marqis Black hasn't updated in a year and the arc is ongoing.]]
