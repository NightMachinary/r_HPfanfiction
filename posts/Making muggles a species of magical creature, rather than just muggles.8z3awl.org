Essentially, I'm thinking of writing a story where the planet is much more magical, and also thinking about how unlikely it might be that muggles, as they are, would still end up such a dominant species. So I thought, instead of muggles just being... muggles, the only un-magical intelligent/sentient species in a world brimming with magic, what if muggles were magic?

What if muggles were a species of magical creature, in the same way mer-people and centaurs, only instead of underwater breathing or divination, muggles had access to a magical ability that would have let them survive and prosper on a more magical planet, to such an extent that maybe the Statue of Secrecy is just a quarantine, to stop muggles from destroying the other magical creatures.

But the flip-side is this; what ability could one give muggles, while keeping them, and their society and people, "normal"? What ability could muggles be given, that would keep them muggles, instead of "elves by another name"?

At first I thought about restricting some important human quality (like "imagination" or something) to muggles, but that tactic would just result in making wizards (who, not being muggles, would lack this quality) more alien, rather than muggles more "magical".

So far the only good idea I have is this; muggle religion actually works. Enough muggles believing in something for long enough, actually makes that thing real. Superstitions like "silver hurts werewolves", or "iron hurts fae" work not because werewolves are actually weak to silver or fae are weak to iron, but because muggles believe they are.The muggle heroes and knights of old could slay dragons with swords because enough people believed in them. With enough belief, even gods like Zeus and Thor could have actually walked the Earth, and on a smaller scale, the "lucky charms" and "little rituals" of individual muggles actually have some power.. And now, in the modern era, wizards are getting worried about what might happen if the muggle "pipe-dream", the all-knowing, all-powerful God so many modern muggles believe in, actually comes into existence.

But that's just one idea. Thought I'd come here, to the biggest repository of people thinking about Harry Potter I know of, to ask if anyone has anymore. Bonus points if it:

A) Keeps muggles as muggles, instead of "not-elves".

B) Gives a Dark Lord a compelling reason to want to conquer muggles.

C) Could potentially give a muggle character stranded in the Wizarding World some agency.

D) Still lets Wizards be awesome.


** Maybe technology? The whole tech doesn't work with magic could be because that's muggle "magic" and it doesn't work with other types of magic.

Not sure how well this would work throwing darts to see what sticks.

*** thanks! I thought about that, and also saw some posts around about how maybe technology and science are just "muggle magic", and wizards are so wacky because they now live separate from muggles, in a universe governed by wild magic and spirits. It think the quote that said it best, paraphrased, went a little like this:

When a muggle fires an arrow from a bow, what matters are things like air resistance, the weight of the arrow, gravity, etc... When a wizard fires an arrow from a bow, all the matters is how the wind is feeling.

And I liked that, because it would explain why wizards would use magic for everything, even when it's just as easy, or even easier, to put the wand down and do it by hand. Without using magic to get their way, wizards can't trust the universe to cooperate or even stay the same for a few seconds, but muggles can.

Unfortunately I couldn't figure out a way to scale such a subtle reality warping ability down to individual muggles, without giving them something like minor, on-command anti-magic. And I really, really hate anti-magic.

** I don't understand the point of this exercise. The defining characteristic of muggles is that they are non magical. Why keep calling them muggles when they aren't muggles anymore.

In any case, this whole idea sounds so massively AU that you might as well just move everything to the planet Krypton.

*** eh, I feel like I've seen things more AU than this, and the fact the OP specifically states they want to keep muggles muggles makes me think they're looking for something that preserves most of HP canon. The idea they present seems to be something most muggles won't even notice, unless pointed out to them, like how in Percy Jackson not many mortals know gods actually walk among them.

Essentially, this doesn't "too AU" at all to me.

**** Don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say it was "too" AU, I just think it would be extremely AU. I don't think it's automatically bad, just because it's very AU (which is the vibe I'm getting from your post).

I acknowledge your point about how it might be done while keeping canon intact, still can't wrap my head around the idea though: It's like saying "I want wizards in my fic, except they should be incapable of magic."

***** eh, i think saying that everything might as well be moved to "planet krypton", makes me justified in thinking you meant "too AU", because otherwise what did you mean by that statement? That's not putting words in your mouth, that's basically what you said; what else could it mean, other than "this feels too AU"? I just use quotes cuz I felt the sentences get too messy without them.

Thanks for acknowledging my point tho. I think our main disagreement is that you think the main component of a muggle is "completely non-magical", while for me (and I'm assuming the OP), it's just "normal people, but not wizards/less magical than wizards". If Harry Potter took place in the Xmen Universe, I would still consider mutants "muggles", for example, because, despite having amazing abilities, they aren't wizards.

For me, this kind of change is less "I want wizards in my fic, but they can't do magic", and more like the "I want wizards in my fic, but wandless magic is easy and seers can accurately predict the future, animagi can turn into basilisks, wizards have creature inheritance, and runes do epic things etc..." fics we see all the time, where the magical world is a lot more magical than in canon. Only while those fics raise the magical ceiling, so to speak, I think OP wants to raise the magical "floor". To make the world more magical not by making wizards more powerful, but by making muggles a bit magic.

Because there's nothing wrong with moving everything to planet Krypton (of course Krypton itself was in jest). I don't see why this should still take place on earth and if you think that's "too AU" for a fic that's your judgment call and certainly not mine ;) (I've read many good fics that don't take place on earth, in fact one of my favorites barely mentions earth). It's a better idea to do it this way because you have to imagine this new world where muggles have some form of magic from the ground up, and don't take baggage from canon - that doesn't make sense anymore - for granted.

But if they have some form of magic many questions come up. Is the statute of secrecy still in tact? If yes, why? Are they unaware of their magic? If no, does that mean the magic is so mundane that it can't be separated from other mundane things? Why call it 'magic' then? If they are aware of their magic the statute of secrecy makes little sense and we are already in "massively AU" territory again. Certainly nothing we know about the history of our world or the fictional history of the magical world in the HP universe should apply anymore. Again, it might as well take place on planet Krypton.

I'm really interested how it could be done while keeping canon intact (except when the magic of the muggles is meaningless and why do it at all then?).

******* The point I was trying to make in my main point, which I now realize wasn't very clear, was that I wanted muggle magic to be something subtle. Something that muggles, if they weren't specifically looking for magic, could realistically think is just part of the natural world. For example, if I wanted to make "imagination" muggle magic, I would make mind magic the most powerful kind of magic in the setting, and I would make imagination the best defense against it. Essentially giving muggles, from the perspective of the other sentient beings, this wonderful magical ability to create pictures and sounds and sensations in their own heads, an ability that makes them almost perfectly immune to the ultra strong mind magic somehow.

Or to go even more AU, I might even change a bit of magic to be more like DnD, where wizards have to actively "hold" spells in their mind in order to cast them, limiting the number of spells they can actively use that day to the number they can keep in their head, and have imagination make that task incredibly easy, to the point where wizards like having a muggle along on adventures in order to act like a living library of magic.

And yet all this stuff, based on imagination, wouldn't seem like magic to muggles. Because we take "imagination" so for granted, that it took us until the modern era to realise that some people actually don't have visual/audio/tactile imaginations, and that aphantasia (the inability to form mental images) is an actual thing. People with aphantasia dream in "concepts", don't actually "see" anything when they talk about imagining things, and apparently a lot of them truly believed everybody else was just using flowery language when they talked about imaginary stuff.

You know what, I might actually just go with that. I was worried that making something normal about muggles "magical" and unique to them, rather then giving muggles some magic, would make the other sentient beings too alien. But aphantasiacs still act like normal people, can be just as smart and creative, and lived among "normal" people for millennia without actually getting noticed, or even noticing themselves that something was wrong with them, so that can't be the case. And this way I don't even have to worry about explaining why the setting still looks so similar to canon, or why muggles still act like normal people, side-stepping all of your concerns; with the Statue of Secrecy in place, muggles would never notice that imagination was magical, until they were told about it.

There would even be a bit of symmetry added to the whole "wizards don't understand muggles" theme canon has. Wizards have magic, and don't understand how muggles can live without it. And I can easily see how many muggles wouldn't be able to comprehend how a wizarding mind could even function without a mind's eye.

And magical imagination could serve to only enhance canon as well. It would add another layer to the Jacob-Queenie relationship from Fantastic Beasts (to a legilimens, muggles have pretty, colorful minds compared to wizards), and perhaps another twist to reasons canon-legilimency prodigy Voldemort and fanon-legilimency expert Dumbledore have such differing opinions on muggles, and why the only teacher of legilimency in Hogwarts was the half-blood Snape. I could make legilimency the only kind of mind magic that really works on unsuspecting muggles, and also the primary vector wizards like Mr. Weasley use to "ogle at the wild life", so to speak!

Thanks for your input, and more specifically thanks for clarifying your point about "Planet Krypton". In the beginning, like the other guy, I did think you were telling me that my idea was to AU and outlandish to be a good fic, and that I should just give up on it, but I now I see that wasn't what you meant at all :)

** Interesting premise. Maybe make it so that muggles are capable of slowly becoming magical, over time, given the right stimulus? Like how in DnD, a Level 20 Fighter isn't going to be casting any spells, but that doesn't change the fact that they are capable of many, many, superhuman, downright magical feats.

** This kinda makes me think of another magic system. I'm not sure if its from the magician or something.

But the main idea is that 'humans' don't have magic but some can harness it. A.k.a. they steal magic from their surroundings. They manipulate and harness the energy that surround them and transform them. So they have to account the amount of ambient magic. Unlike HP wizard where magic comes from within.

This will kind of make muggles/magician powerful in the presence of magical being but not in general. Essentially we already harvest natural earth energy (solar power, geo thermal and hydro energy) to create electricity to do neat stuff. In a way,its possible that technology in essence absorb ambient magic and either overloads the system or ends up drying the 'power source' and magic dissipate around them. Though very few can wield magic via artifacts/technology that can be classified as truly magical, a sort of channel or spell storage/converter .

This will make muggle more dangerous to wizards ad why using magic around them is considered as dangerous. Since they aren't inherently magical but over exposure in a presence of a magician could allow them to fling powerful and dangerous magic using your own energy. To harness energy to shape reality, to twist and transform energy to something else. It is why some old purebloods believe that muggleborn steal magic since magician can harness ambient magic, while it is incorrect since magician in general has no internal magic... In a way you can get how the misconception started.

It make me think of wizard radio, it works like radio except it works with magic instead of electricity but has the same function. Or Arthur's car, or why there's a misuse of muggle artifacts department. Some could short circuit, catch on fire or explode like a freaking miscast spell. Circuits, chips, code and other tech stuff can be like the equivalent of runes that overloading it could fry the system. Heck, have you seen someone coding, it's mind boggling how capital letters affect a string in a code.
