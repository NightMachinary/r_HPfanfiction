Like the title says I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry is slightly more eccentric personality and has an odd sense of humour and/or a disregard for authority figures and rules. Something that'll have me in stitches laughing. Like linkffn (Twists of Fate)


** Oh, I found a great fic with a highly eccentric Harry earlier today, though it has a lot of other POVs

!linkao3(A Station South of Canon)

Harry is a horcrux, therefore Harry is nearly indestructible. This has had profound effects on his mentality.

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.
