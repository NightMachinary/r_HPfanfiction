I feel like I've read everything worth reading, which I know isn't the case, so I desperately need some suggestions. I've gone back to some of the longer threads on this subreddit where people have posted their favorite fics, and most of them I've already read. Does anyone have anything that they haven't seen recced here before? I'll read WIP as well as complete, though obviously I would prefer it not to be abandoned.

I like both het and slash, and I also like gen fics without any shippiness, but I don't really like harem fics. I really like to read Harry!centric stuff but at this point I think I'll read anything good.

Please help!


** It might take you a while to get through, but I would recommend trying these search terms: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&lan=1&r=10&len=10&s=2][Sort - Reviews, Language - English, Length - >10k, Status - Complete]] and then maybe add/subtract whichever characters (I usually go +Harry -Draco -Snape). Then just scroll through those til you find something you haven't read yet. After that, try looking up some of the favorites on the bigger name profiles, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][ARedHair]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eoldcrow][Old Crow]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7ESarah1281][Sarah1281]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/Clell65619][Clell65619]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eatruwriter][atruwriter]]. I have ton on my personal page as well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enedryos][here]].

The alternate host sites such as [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/index.php][Adult Fan Fiction]], [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][Harry Potter Fan Fiction Archive]], the [[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/][Fiction Alley]] group of sites (listed on the right sidebar of that page), or any of the other archives listed [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][here]] don't often get recced here, so maybe try one of them too.

Sorry you're having such a shitty day, and I hope it gets better =).

edit: I'd recommend going through some of the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=flair%3A%22request%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][request threads]] here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] Someone recommended using the [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net][DLP Scryer]]. I don't use it often, but my usual search is +this+.

edit: I just realized that search terms link didn't work, so I'll just tell you what they were:

#+begin_quote
  Summary Keywords: -slash -"what if"\\
  Required Characters: Harry P.\\
  Excluded Characters: Draco M. Lucius M. Severus S. Tom R. Jr. Voldemort\\
  Language: English\\
  Wordcount Minimum: 5010\\
  Chapter Minimum: (sometimes 2, sometimes 0)
#+end_quote

edit2: Some of the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=flair%3A%22suggestion%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][suggestion flair'd]] posts are worth looking at as well.

*** Thanks for the reply! I often browse through using those search terms (except that I usually do >50k or >100k), but I haven't looked at any sites other than ff.net and AO3 in a long time so that's a good idea.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows]]

Sirius and Remus ^

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]]

Deathly Hallows from Neville's point of view. Canon and worth the read. ^

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241479/1/Letters-The-Year-With-the-Stone]]

Both Dudley and Harry get a Hogwarts letter. Harry gets put in Slytherin and Dudley gets put in Gryffindor. Not a bad read, though mildly depressing at times.

I hope these help. I'm sorry you had an awful day. :(

*** I saw this recommendation for Letters: The Year with the Stone yesterday and just finished reading it. It was a very good read, especially considering it's one of the few fictions I've read where Snape was something other than an utterly evil bastard.

** These are all Drarry fics.

I just recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9771843/1/Kitty-Kitty][Kitty, Kitty]] and loved it so much I started looking for similar stories. Haven't found anything written quite that well yet, however.

I've recommended it before, but if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5401510/1/Talk-to-Me][Talk to Me]] it's worth checking out. I reread it rather often.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721089/1/Draco-s-Boy][Draco's Boy]] is full of angst, one of those abusive!Dursley fics. But it's written very well; I couldn't stop reading once I started.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2186498/1/Yorkshire-Puddings][Yorkshire Puddings,]] and [[http://thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3848][A Labour of Love.]]
