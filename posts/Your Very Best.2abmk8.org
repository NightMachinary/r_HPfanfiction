** By far my favorite fanfiction is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] by kayly silverstorm. I've read it many times, and it never gets old. It's sad, funny, hopeful, and poignant. Wonderful characterizations of Harry and Hermione, and my favorite Luna ever. Also a great Neville. It's pretty gen, but references canon relationships.

"Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour."

I also have some humorous and/or fluffy one-shots that I reread often when I need a pick-me-up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard]] by HalfASlug. Canon relationships, and takes place at Ron and Hermione's wedding. Very funny. "There's a reason that adults don't usually play hide and seek - especially when they are nothing more than overgrown children."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8657707/1/Floating-Feathers-to-Foulweather-Friends][Floating Feathers to Foulweather Friends]] also by HalfASlug. "31st October, 2001. Hermione, at the end of an average day at work, remembers a not-so-average day she had ten years ago that changed her life in every way. Trio friendship fic." HalfASlug is my go-to when I need trio friendship stories -- there are more that I won't link to here, but I'd recommend checking out their other works.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8892557/1/The-Chronicles-of-the-Dark-Lord-Ginnymort][The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort]] by respite christopher. "Dedicated to my friends in the Teachers' Lounge. Lord Voldemort's attempt to possess the soul of Ginny Weasley was successful, but his triumph was not without consequence. Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] by opalish. "After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5397329/1/The-Desk][The Desk]] also by opalish. "Crack oneshot. Malcolm Baddock fails at office warfare, and Harry teaches his desk to speak." Opalish has some of the best short humor writing I've read. I'd also recommend their other fics.

*** It seems that way in the beginning, yes. But he has been training for two years in Ally's trunk, plus he was loved and cared for. So, there should be big changes, but in no way Gary Stu-like IMO.

**** The one thing I really like is that it's not a Manipulative!Dumbledore fic. It's a human Dumbledore who is too stuck in his own beliefs who sees his perfect world crumbling down and he can't do anything about it. Very well written, I think.

** My two favorite works right now are both unfinished, and probably abandoned. Doesn't stop me from re-reading them every now and then though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk. /Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7073352/1/Right-Place-Wrong-Time][Right Place, Wrong Time?]] by Shan84. /It was just another boring day at Borgin and Burkes for Tom Riddle... That is, until a certain bossy, crazy-haired witch stepped through the entrance. Is this your usual time travel story - or is something else at play? HG/TMR/

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

The best I've read. I ticks all the boxes I had and then some. Even after the huge plot twist it keeps on going! Read It 2 to 3 times due its length.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen]]

The Story which made Harry/Tonks my OTP, though Summer of Change was the first I read. This was much more on a relationship driven story and I reaped the befits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero]]

Great start this ones got. and though It drop off a lot towards the end, it's one of the best written 'Wrong BWL' stories I've read. As well as the first.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion]]

HUGE Ron bashing here. Pure crack. A great and funny read If you are that kind of person.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]]. All of Taure's work is amazing, but I would suck a dick for another chapter of this. Honestly I would suck his dick for another chapter of any of his stories, I think.

EDIT: Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] by enembee. Absolutely amazing. The sequel is fantastic too.

** [[http://hpmor.com][Methods of Rationality]]. Not everyone's cup of tea. Overpowered Harry, overpowered many other characters, a good dose of insanity.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/109558/chapters/151674][In Loco Parentis]]. Deals with a lot of real-world problems. [[/s][Spoiler]]

*** I actually really liked MOR. What made me stop following was the chapter with the army game. I actually loved that chapter most of all, but it was that part of the story that made me realize that Less had absolutely stopped writing about Harry Potter and made a completely new character altogether. And smart Draco is always weird to read. Anyway, my 2 cents.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866813/1/A-Whiff-of-Competition][A Whiff of Competition]] throws you into a world of Professional Quidditch that seems to belong to its author, izzo. It's unique and frankly addictive. Sadly, it hasn't been updated in months, but if you're looking for a good read, look no further. Canon ships, focusing on Oliver Wood/Katie Bell.
