I read a fanfic story where Tony DiNozzo from NCIS becomes Harry Potter's guardian. But now I CAN'T FIND IT!!! Help please?

Here's the highlights I remember: Professor Lupin finds out Harry lives with the Dursley's. Remus is tells him that his cousin Tony was listed in the will right after Sirius as a potential guardian. They send a letter to the goblins to verify this and Gringotts sends a letter to Tony. Tony gets the letter and drops what he's doing to get to England. After Harry gets off the Hogwarts Express, Remus takes him to the bank to meet Tony.

In the story, Tony is a wizard. He's the American version of an Auror and is the Wizarding liaison to NCIS. (Although not very many people there actually know this).

Tony makes plans to leave NCIS and move to the UK so Harry can keep attending Hogwarts. I think he takes a job with the ICW. He and Harry are staying with another cousin, Lord Paddington, and his wife and his son, Crispin, who is a healer at St. Mungo's.

The story ships Gibbs/DinNozzo and Harry/Hermione. I also remember them having all of the Weasley's over to visit and going to the World Quidditch Cup with them and then using emergency portkeys to evacuate all the minors back to Paddington Manor when the Death Eaters attack.

Anyhow, as you can see, I remember a lot of the story. But I can't remember the title! And I can't find it! I've looked everywhere I can think of and done searches with as many combinations of key words as I can imagine, but no luck.

Can anyone please help me find this story?


** I think I've read this one before. Is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14824227?view_adult=true][Disturb the Universe?]] I don't know how to use the linking bots

*** Thank you! It looks like it is, from the brief summaries I can see. It looks like the reason I couldn't find it is that the author has moved it to the members only section of AO3. So, I've requested an invitation to join!
