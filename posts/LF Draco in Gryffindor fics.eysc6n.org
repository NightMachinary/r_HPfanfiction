I know, I am trash; my current read list is barely updating and I'm tired of scrolling through favourites on FFnet. Searching for this on A03 is a nightmare.

I've seen requests Slytherin!Hermione, Ravenclaw!Hermione and Ravenclaw!Harry but I'm looking for some good ol' trope and cliched-filled Gryffindor!Draco. (or Theo, or Blaise, or Daphne, or Tracey, or Millicent, etc... if there are any of those.)

Ideally not crack, don't care for specific ships so send me anything (although I'd imagine most are Dramione or Drarry). Preferably not a canon rehash, but I'll honestly take anything at this point to just get this out of my system.


** I am writing a fic with Gryffindor Draco. linkffn(Scrambled Sorting)

It is very humour heavy but it is NOT crack. Features Gryffindor Draco basically taking on several of canon!Harry's roles, such as becoming the youngest seeker of the century or going down the third floor corrridor to defend the Philosopher's Stone

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

** linkao3(78824). I have almost no recollection of it, but it has a Gryffindor Draco and I bookmarked it at some point

[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Gryffindor%20Draco%20Malfoy/works]] . That's the tag for searching for it on AO3, btw

*** Thank you for the story and the tag. It's different to the one I tried with on A03, so I'm hopeful this time around :D

  AU. Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to go back, she can't resist getting involved when she realises her memories may be the key to thwarting Voldemort's plans. But can staying lead to anything but heartbreak for her?
