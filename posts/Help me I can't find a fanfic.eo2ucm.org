Posting this again cus somebody told me to use a different r/ thingie (thx btw)

Hi, Idk if I'm using this app correctly and the only reason why I installed it is to ask this question: There was a marauders fanfic, probably on ao3, Sirius had an eating disorder, he went really skinny, his mom made him buy new robes with Regulus, Sirius's parents abused him like in 99% of Sirius fanfics, Sirius had a heart problem, fainted a couple of times, etc... I hope this was detailed enough for magic internet people to know what I mean. Pls answer, I'm looking for it for ages, it doesn't let me sleep at night, I NEED it. Thank you for your time


** I'm pretty sure this is the one you are looking for:
