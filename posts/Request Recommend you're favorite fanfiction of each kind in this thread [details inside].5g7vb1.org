So basically what this is, is a thread where people would recommend one story of a certain kind for a certain pairing of their choosing. This will be explained better in the following example.

The categories will be broken down by:

1. Best post-epilogue story:
2. Best war-time story:
3. Best AU story:
4. Best 'during Hogwarts' story:
5. Best time travel story:
6. Funniest story:
7. Best !crackfic:

And so on. People could add a category they thought should have been included in their replies if they wish to.

So for example, in terms of H/Hr, for best post-epilogue fic, I would recommend:

Best post-epilogue story: Unlike A Sister linkffn(6574535)

Basically, what this does is gives us HP redditors a guide to what the best story in its respective 'category' for each pairing.

If you like this idea, feel free to leave the pairing you wish to write about in the comments followed by your list.

Also, if anyone has any suggestions as to how this can be improved, feel free to leave as a reply to this post.


** Best war-time story: linkffn(8303194)

Best AU story: linkffn(5353809)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** OK on mobile now so I won't be formatting just yet. Listing these fanfics down now, so anyone who is particularly interested can google. I will try to offer some new FICs that are hopefully different from the usual fare that gets passed around 1. Post epilogue story A Little More Time by Jesse Paula's.

A fix fic where Teddy Lupin tries to save his parents in the Battle of Hogwarts by pulling them into his future. This was one of the very first fic I picked up and enjoyed 5 years ago. The character interactions are great, the internal logic is consistent, especially about the time travel where it provides a solid explanation for how Teddy manages to break the Time Turner and why only him and his parents could pull off that feat. I like these kind of fiction where they don't touch canon and help to explore lesser known characters or what comes after the main series

1. War-time

Hermione Potter by MaryRoyale

Hermione gets reborn as a voice inside the head of Hermione Potter, twin sister to James Potter. Shenanigans occur as you get to watch a !Noble plot play out as Hermione, James, Lucius and others of that era act like stiff-lipped aristocrats and Hermione manages to carve out her place in that male-dominated society

1. AU

Harry Potter and the Master Ball by Mr. Chaos

The plot of Harry Potter in the Pokemon World, in short. Hogwarts teaches kids how to battle and raise Pokemon now, spells are now Pokemon, Noble Houses are now Gym Leader and the whole world is set in the region of Avalon, which now shares the world with Kano, Johto and other regions from the games. World building is top-notch and the Pokemon Game characters are generally handled well too. Features an acknowledgement of Badass Lily who was the one that actually defeated Voldemort

1. During Hogwarts

Renegades by 1991Kira.

My favourite !DarkHarry fic and is surprisingly idealistic, in the sense that Harry's attempt to be unfeeling and sociopathic, to damn the Wizarding World is undercut by his love and bonds he has made with his friends. Also unique in the sense that the events are told through various character Pov, which help cuts down on mindless exposition when the author needs to world build. Features a Ron and Hermione that actually have other goals than to help Harry and whose visions are supported by Harry in turn. I particularly like the discussions on the prophecy as well

1. Time travel

Dead woodpecker 's time travel fic

So you say that Harry, if he ever times travel back, should just tell Dumbledore? Well guess what he, Ron and Ginny did that and yet the story is not easily resolved. A compelling and intrigue fic that manages to make the Weasleys antagonistic without bashing or love potions tomfoolery

1. Funniest

Hagrid teaches Harry Occlumency. That should be all. Hagrid's mannerisms are well portrayed and the conclusion is pretty nuts

1. !Crackfic

Champion's champion by Driftwood. Really drives Ron's negative traits up to 11, this is the only Ron Bashing fic I'm fine with because it steers off the realm of unbelievability on various occasions.

** *Best post-epilogue story:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - It's set when Teddy is a first year (and is fully canon and epilogue compliant), and it's a great story. It's a nice way to experience Hogwarts being just a school during peacetime (not that there isn't a bigger story; there is), and it captures a lot of the playfullness of the first 3 Harry Potter stories.

*Best war-time story:*

Don't really have one.

*Best AU story:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - My absolute favorite fic. I think I've re-read it like 10 times at this point, and every reread you notice more and more little details. Basically, the author takes every single WBWL cliche and trope, crams them into one story, and rolls with it. And it's utterly fantastic.

It has Competent Lockheart, Competent Pettigrew, Funny-Asshole-but-still-Decent-Guy Snape, Smart Draco, Actually-Well-Developed Ron the list goes on. Just a warning - the first year (until the very end) is pretty meh (and the first 10 chapters are complete trash). It gets so good though after the 1st year.

*Best 'during Hogwarts' story:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]] - an average tuesday in McGonagall's life. Hillarious and very canon-compliant.

*Best time travel story:*

Don't really have one lol.

*Funniest story:*

See best crackfic (below), or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]]

*Best !crackfic:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] - The author write a very cliched story, and the characters become self-aware about what's going on. Ron and Harry discuss Weasley-bashing, McGonagall and Voldemort discuss the importance of minor characters, and Dumbledore makes a case against Harem stories. It's all hilarious and all good fun.

*** Contrary opinion: /The Ilvermorney Champion/, /The Vanishing Cabinet of Time/, and pretty much everything else by that author are flaming heaps of garbage filled with the worst, /worst/ fanfiction tropes and gaping flaws in logic. Even more unforgivable, the quality of the writing is abysmal - and for fanfiction, that's saying something.

Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
