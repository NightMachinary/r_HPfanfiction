** When a Veela Cries is a good one. Though you might not be a fan of the intro (it's quite unrealistically brutal), if you really don't like it, it's worth skipping ahead until the sections of the plot in France which provide the foundation for his time in Durmstrang. The intro is basically just used as an excuse to untether him from Hogwarts and all the stuff he knew before. The Durmstrang and France sections are really worth sticking with it though, IMO.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
