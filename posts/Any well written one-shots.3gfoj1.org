It's always been difficult to find them but lately I feel like I'm really in the pit haha. I've always loved how succinct some one-shots can be and how a talented author doesn't always need 100k+ words to enthrall their readers.

The few that I can recommend are really excellent and worth reading, I'm not terribly picky of what I read so it's pretty varied.

*** Probably too many fics! But we can try again to make sure:

ffnbot!parent

Edit: It worked! But some recs seem off. This happens when more popular fics with the same (or very similar) fics exist. The solution to this involves 1) adding the author name to the bot request, 2) using fic links, or 3) using the fic IDs.
