** You might want to provide a "What If?" or two, here. Because there are scores of Master of Death Harry stories. A fast search turned up 178 of them without even looking.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/search/?type=story&ready=1&keywords=MoD%21Harry]]

That is only on ffn, too. There are many sites with thousands of stories and very many of them deal with the Hallows in some way. That doesn't even start down the cross-overs list where being MoD is usually what keeps Harry alive into another dimension.

** You probably already know this one, but just in case:

Linkao3(The Heir of the House of Black)

The pacing is a bit slow but the characters are top notch.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)
