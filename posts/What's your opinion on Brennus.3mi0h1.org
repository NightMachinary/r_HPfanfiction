I do like him, in spite of his Weasley bashing. He is one of the better H/G writers out there (obviously, compared to the wish-fulfillmenty style writers). He takes fan tropes such as Slytherin!Harry or Forced Marriage and applies a new twist on them. In addition, the main plot of the stories flows quite well, IMO. The romance is often there, without being too in the face, for those who don't like in-the-face stuff.

What do you think?


** If the fact that I'm still watching Doctor Who is any indication, I'm good at tolerating a lot of cap in favour of something good possibly blooming. The thing about Weasley bashing though is it's basically a giant sign in Christmas lights saying "I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE CHARACTERS ACTUALLY ARE", which is why it's always such a deal breaker for me.

** My opinion of him remains what it was.

  Brennus condenses all the worst elements of H/Hr fics into his HG fics, which is why I dislike him. Ron Bashing, Dumbledore bashing, stereotypical Molly characterization, Muggle weaponry, One-sided relationships with the girl dominating (at least in /The Thorny Rose/). He could just write Ginny as a lovesick gold digger and complete the damn checklist.

His recent Dumbledore bashing one-shot only reinforces my opinion of him being a shitty writer.

** Love him. If he writes it I read it. He's one of the few that I've felt the urge to re-read.

** His stories are entertaining so far, but his Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing is getting repetitive.

I don't think the 'dominating girl' thing is that bad in Thorny Rose series. After they shoved that guy off the astronomy tower, Harry took the lead in the relationship.
