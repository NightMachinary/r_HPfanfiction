I've been thinking lately about the whole trope of Voldie having a secret child from one sycophantic lady or another, and I started to consider a different scenario:

During his first rise to power Voldemort was a normal young man, by which I mean he was just as human as anyone else. He also felt like he wanted to assert his dominance over the muggles and all that other typical dark lord bullshit. Now what I've stated so far is simply fact but I'm going somewhere with it, I swear. What if, because he has the same biological functions as any other human Voldemort, like Genghis Khan, ends up unknowingly (and I'm sure he doesn't care either) fathering a whole bunch of children all across the UK as a result of his participation in his own raids.

Death Eater raids were notoriously awful, and while a lot of the carnage was just killing muggles and other undesirables, we can also assume that physical assault was a part of their regular torture arsenal. After an attack in come the ministry with their obliviators to "clean up" the mess and preserve their precious Statute of Secrecy. The result is a whole bunch of pregnant muggles who don't remember what actually happened to them.

What if in the earlier years during Voldershort's many attacks the number of "muggleborns" spikes. Since nobody in the wizarding world seems to give a shit about genetics, because science seems to be nonexistent in wizarding society, plus paternity testing wasn't really available until the late 1980's. Therefore wizarding UK never comes to realize that a fair majority of their muggleborn population is actually related to Tom Riddle.

This isn't accounting for all the other Death Eaters who were also doing the same thing. The blood purity movement could be responsible for all of the muggleborns and they just can't seem to put two and two together and make the connection!

Is this something that exists already in the HP fanfic world? Or am I just up way too late thinking too much on too little sleep?

*** I came here for just that, imagine the confusion in harry's second year when near a quarter of the school understands him talking to the snake, while the slytherins collectively have an identity crisis with all these muggleborns exhibiting this super rare trait of the person they idolize (whether that is slytherin or voldie is open to interpretation)

**** Imagine all the Muggleborns starting to talk in Parseltongue as a secret language - because let's be honest, that is what children and teenager would do with a language only a small group of people can use. And every time they do that adults who were in close proximity to Voldemort start twitching and get nervous.

***** Poor Poppy is stuck trying to find ways to undo the jinxes they cast using parseltongue (I know, parselmagic isn't canon, but it is fanon that I like), and pulling her hair out as she realizes that there aren't any healers that can because of how much the UK wizarding population shunned speakers.

Or would it make the treatment of 'muggleborns' that much worse

*** Given that memory charms are a thing, even if they're not as easy to cast/use as fanon would believe, this is a grim bit of fanon I could see as being very realistic if Harry Potter weren't a YA series.

Heck, there are love potions (we see a prime example of this with Merope and her muggle love-slave -- that's basically what he was) and the simple /confundus/ charm.

There's also polyjuice, though I suppose that'd be fairly rare to the average witch/wizard, too.

And, the darkest of the lot, the /Imperius/.

A wife or girlfriend fucking someone she thought was her husband due to being magically confused? A man fucking someone he thought was his wife/girlfriend, and the resulting witch getting knocked up?

Hell, what would stop a darker witch or wizard with no scruples (honestly I could see some darker pureblood families doing this) towards muggles seeing an attractive man or woman walking down the street, promptly placing them under the Imperius or just stunning them/abducting them when no one was looking, taking them into an alley or motel room somewhere, "doing the deed", then covering their tracks one way or another?

Less than a year later, you half a half-blood bastard (in the /technical/ definition, not the insulting one) being born.

In a more realistic in-universe look, I wouldn't be surprised if one or two "muggleborns" per Hogwarts' yearly student crop were actually just half-bloods born from rape. :S

**** Exactly. I've said it a lot, it's sort of a hobby horse but rape is so hideously common in Muggle life. In the magical world where there are so many opportunities to make it easier and impossible to trace? It's really terrifying

*** Do you have a link?

I remember hearing of a similar fic that had Hermione and Percy as recurring characters. In that fic, there was a secret department at the ministry that kept track of illegitimate offsprings of wizard-muggle unions, the history of which the muggle parent was left with no recollections of. The reason the secret registry was established was in order to make sure that no case of accidental incest occured; as indicated by this paraphrasing of a character in that fic, "Keeping the blood pure is good, but you can't have the blood getting too thick. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing." The secret registry location also served as a hang out spot where the wizarding progenitors of the "muggle-borns" would get together to boast about the accomplishments of their offsprings. I also remember Crouch Sr. being Hermione's true father in that fic. Anyone know where I can find this fic? Looking for it till this day.

** I'm following except the part where you call this the sort of thing a “normal young man” would do. A normal young man might try to date or seduce a lot of women, and I can see wizards having an unfair advantage in the dating game, but rape is something else. Don't go insulting half the human race by saying that rape is a normal thing for them to do.

*** I mean normal in the sense that biologically he is a typical male human being, not suffering (as far as we know) from any ailments that would prevent his body from responding to base instincts and/or procreation.

This goes with my assumption that the new body that Voldemort constructs in the graveyard in GoF is no longer fully human, so doesn't have the same biological urges as a typical human body. Also, I just can't imagine that his new body is anything but completely smooth like a Ken doll.

** My assumption was always that the disgusting phase of the Horcrux preparation ritual was to eat the fetuses of his children as well as the container and then he'd shit them (similar to some mpreg fics) but his soul would confuse them with living beings and attach themselves to the containers. So Voldemort's children would be his horcruxes.
