I remeber, a while ago, reading a very good though sadly unfinished fic.

It has: - James as a sole parent to Harry (who isn't the boy who lived but Neville is). - Lily was killed when Harry was 7 by Antonin Dolohov. - James is head auror - James taught Harry since he was young how to fight/do magic so Harry is a couple of years ahead. - James vowed to avenge his wife's murder and pretty much made it the endgoal of his career.

And he succeeded, the fic starts off with an epic fight between James, Dolohov and a bunch of death eaters. It looks like James is going to win but then Voldemort makes an appearance is someone else's body and James is killed. Harry is starting his 4th year by this time.

I can't find said fic in my favourites and can't find it by searching some relevant scenes either. Anyone remember the name of said fic? It should have around 50k words.

Thanks a bunch.

** I remember that it explored spell lore a bit. Like there's more than one fiend spell. I'm sure that water spell that killed lily was a fiend spell. There's was one scene where James used both the water and air fiend spells. I believe it was leaning more towards Tonks in terms of pairings.

  In a dark world, a haunted Harry Potter is not The Chosen One. After great loss, however, the heralded mind of his generation will surmount legends to avenge those he loved. Amidst a bloody Triwizard Tournament, infatuations of the heart, and things that truly go bump in the night, his path lies nebulous. Yet there are fates worse than death.. In fact he's counting on it. AU. Harem

*** It's strange though. I thought I bookmarked it and at the very least fav'ed it but apparently no. Maybe it's been deleted.

*** Nope it was a really dark fic between 20k and 50k words. I think it was going towards either a Susan Bones, Tonks or Fleur pairing.

After James died Harry went over to live with the Bones family.

Most vividly I remember the first chapter fight scene which was super cool. James used some giant transfigured tree monster to fight off death eaters and then used his last powers on a super dark spell that was an air variation of the fiendfyre spell. Oh and Dolohov killed Lily with the same kind of spell but based on water.
