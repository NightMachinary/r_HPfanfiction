Harry Potter traveled back in time because Hermione's created group became Muggles with magic weapons who hate Magic. In Harry's past life he was friends with Theo, and enemies with Daphnie. In this life, he befriended her and became her mentor. I believe Daphne was an assassin, in Harry's first life.


** This I think.
