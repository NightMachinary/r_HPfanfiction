*** I can see him feeling "forced" to join by circumstances, especially the discrimination against half bloods and muggle borns which would be a big issue for someone with so many aspirations like Snape.

Also the fact that he was a halfblood Slytherin who was constantly humiliated by Gryffindors, so that can't have made his life easy on his house. Associating with the "dominant power" aka DE might have been one solution to feel safe within his own house.

So it was a combination of awful circumstances, peer pressure and having no easy alternative.

Sure, he could probably do things like moving to another country and he surely had the talents to be accepted in other places, but it is a big decision to pack up and leave your life behind, shitty as it might have been.

That is not to say I like Snape, I don't, but I can at least on some level didn't simply take the mark because he was an evil moustache twirling creep. Yeah, it was ultimately his decision, but it is not like the man had easy alternatives, so I can see his side a bit.

** I think one thing that sometimes gets lost in other's writing is that Snape was only a spy for three years. Depending on your time period, his misery isn't because he is suffering under the thumb of Dumbledore/Voldemort; it's largely self-made. He had the whole interwar period to live a life, even if he were stuck teaching potions at Hogwarts. This isn't really explored. What was his thought process that he was given such an unbelievable second chance at reinvention and he largely threw it away?

** People butcher his character. In canon, Snape is /funny/. He is sarcastic, witty, snappy, eloquent, and smart. I remember that a lot of times, reading his lines made me either chuckle or laugh.

/What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?... Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be Hogsmeade."/

/"Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent'./

And many more. And people just miss that. Even good and fairly renown authors fail to mirror this character. The worst atrocity you can commit to Snape -- regardless of whether you think he is good or bad -- is to make him /dull/. And too many people do that. So, please, if you're writing Severus...retain that wit!\\
Edit: I want to add that one of my personal favorite lines is his very first introduction to potions class. 'I can teach you to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper on death.' Brr. I still remember how that brought chills down my spine. That was just such an eloquent opening, that really made you feel part of a /magical/ school. 12-year-old me was /awed/. /That/ is Snape.

#+end_quote

This line is also one of my favorites, and one of my biggest pet peeves about Snape is when people misquote it. It's "bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death," and the fact they changed it in the movies epitomizes most of the problems I have with them.

The verbs in that quote refer to the process of potion-making, so "stopper" isn't some fancy old-timey way to say "stop," it's referencing the act of putting a potion in a bottle and closing the bottle with a "stopper." So if you're "stoppering death" you're not brewing a healing potion or some elixir of life, you're brewing a /poison/. And the distinction makes kind of a big difference to Snape's characterization right off the bat.

Besides, if potions to "stop death" were a part of the Hogwarts curriculum, Nicholas Flamel wouldn't be such a big deal. If real-life chemistry is anything to go by, pesticides would be much easier to make.

He has a kind of biting, sarcastic wit that reminds me of a less-angry George Carlin(especially the post-90s Carlin), which I find most fanfics I have read that prominently feature him get wrong by either making /too/ mean-spirited, or more commonly not mean-spirited enough - depending on if he's being portrayed in a protagonistic or antagonistic role.

/"Severus was very interested in where I went every month." Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "We were in the same year, you know, and we--- er---didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be--- er---amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it---if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf---..."/

it's very obvious that Sirius' intent was to goad Snape into going to the Shrieking Shack by piquing his interest. He did this on purpose.

Now, the most reasonable explanation to this is that Sirius wanted to spook Snape -- a kid suddenly confronted with a werewolf, who wouldn't be scared? -- but the even more obvious consequence of his actions is that Snape would have been grievously hurt or killed.

Whether Sirius thought it out that far, I don't know. He is, like a said, a kid, although once again, he has that Black blood.

Cause the way I see it he hated Harry so much because he represented every one of his failures: driving Lily away, having his most hated rival step into what he thinks should be his role, and then failing to save her from his own actions. His appearance would especially be a punch in the gut, what with her eyes staring out of his former enemy's face.

Make Snape Harry's biological father and most of that gets thrown out the window. True, not all of it, depending on how he came to be the father, but I do think that the animosity would be significantly lessened.

Do I think he will suddenly become a caring person? No. Do I think he would act decently if Harry was adopted? The idea is laughable. Do I think he would be able to hate his and Lily's son? No, I do not.

** Trying to redeem him. A good deed does not wash away a bad one, and no matter how you want to interpret canon, he voluntarily joined the magical Nazis and was happy to set up some family to die for the Dark Lord's favour. He didn't even defect because he was appealed by whatever he had to do to get into the inner circle, it was just Lily. He was obsessed with the wife of another man and made no secret out of it. He did not ask for her husband to be spared, something Voldemort easily could have done.

And he made no effort to be a better person afterwards, he abused his position to bully children in his care. He was Neville's bogart for fuck's sake. Snape, and not Bellatrix "I turned your parents into vegetables" Lestrange. He never changed, which is evident from the way he treats his students.

He can try to atone for his crimes, but he will never be redeemed. Without some major changes to the world, any redemption will either feel hollow or very forced (Jacobs Apples has this issue in every of their stories). Canon Snape chose his shady Death Eater friends over Lily, and that was before his worst memory. He chose his path by joining the Death Eaters and he only defected because he wanted revenge against them. He is not a nice person, he is an abusive arsehole who happens to be the enemy of the enemy.

********** Because Rowling had some serious issues pining after her ex husband when she wrote the last book (and maybe HBP, not sure about the exact time line) and basically wrote the whole Lupin Tonks romance as "fix him" arc and reduced the best background character to a moping mess. But that idea is somewhat popular in media.

I mean, Lupin is as close to her mother age wise as she is to Harry and Harry is probably more mature than Lupin ever will be by the time he ends up in the TWT.

Another thing is that lycantropy is supposed to be an AIDS parallel (which IMO is a little offensive to AIDS victims, who do not turn into monstrous killing machines unless you feel like throwing shade at all of Africa).

**** I think what they mean when they say Alan Rickman, is that Snape in canon isn't a good lookin dude, “greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin” (SS 126) he walks confidently and like a predator because of the confidence that he can kick the crap out of anyone and everyone (bar some exceptions) because of his stint in the Death Eaters and the war. He isn't Alan Rickman who was a very handsome man with shoulder length black hair that came out of a loreal commercial and a very string jaw and Roman nose. When people in Fanon describe Snape, it's usually the same, a tall pale skin man with dark hair and even darker clothes that walks down corridors with a perpetually billowing robe and a deep resonant voice. There isn't much of a variation either between different stories like how some people commented above, people write Snape very dry and almost annoying. They make it seem like hes always fishing for Harry and Co. to get expelled for breathing, that he was just a moody teen in a mans body. Snape is sharp as a tack and is as cunning as the serpent his house represents, they wash away all of the bad he did with happenstance redemption arcs and some just completely 180 his character from canon into a white night that's been misunderstood. I personally don't agree with the idea Snape is a good person, and I've gotten in to many fights about it on this site about it so j wont say anything about his qualities as a teacher but people make it seem like Snape was a spy for like a decade? In canon he was a spy for Dumbles for about 3 years give or take, not everyone believed he was a spy, people didn't like Snape LONG before he was a professor at Hogwarts because once upon a very short time ago he was one of those blood purist, terrorists. Something like that isn't forgiven that easily, let alone forgotten, so when people build these groups in Fanon that hate Snape because he was a poor teacher and only because of that, its unrealistic and unreasonable. Another thing that I kind of touched on earlier, is that Snape was a freakin badass in canon, the dude was apart of the inner circle as a half-blood, he was a master brewer younger than anyone in their generation and strong/smart enough to also hold a mastery in Defence against the Dark Arts and the Dark Arts whilst also being a Master a occulemns (spelt somehow) and is no slouch when it comes to Legillimency because Dumbledore trusted him to teach Harry to defend his mind against Voldemort, someone we know to be almost unparalleled when it comes to the mind arts. In the final battle between him and Mcgonagall, he was able to not only defend himself against a proven Transfiguration Master and Battle Mage whilst also using those same spells to kill/incapacitate the Carrow twins who weren't exactly slouches when it came to power. So many people under power him or atleast over power everyone else to the point that he isn't really a threat and is more of a support fighter and a nerd. Many people don't like Snape because of who he is as a person, but at least hes fun to read.

** Justifying each and every of Snape's faults. No, he didn't bully Harry and Neville to protect his cover as a spy. Alternatively, being a bad teacher doesn't mean he is an irredeemable monster. He is a complex and interesting character who's made mistakes in his youth, and now genuinely tries to atone for them, with varying success.

Making Snape always be calm and composed. He acts like that, sure, but underneath he is a bundle of neuroses just waiting to bubble over, especially in the years when Voldemort is back.

A lot of writers aim for sarcasm and cutting wit, but end up writing Snape simply as a rude jerk. Which, to be fair, he often is, but he wouldn't treat everybody the way he treats Harry. And a lot of writes go overboard with that as well. Snape's bark is worse than his bite.

I also really hate when people gloss over Snape's background. Yes, he talks posh, but he grew up in a poor Muggle neighbourhood in a mill town. He probably spent a lot of time in his first years at Hogwarts trying to get rid of his accent, for that matter. I grit my teeth every time a fic makes him live in some "Prince manor" and be a connoisseur of classical music.

In shipfic, making him either a sex god or a repressed virgin, both options are just ridiculous. Especially if the latter is justified by being a spy for Voldemort. There was more than a decade of peace! Plenty of time to get laid. Snape is not that ugly except for poor hygiene, or do people think teachers in boarding schools live like monks?

Finally, I hate it when I can tell that the author clearly meant Snape to look like Alan Rickman. I love Alan Rickman in everything except HP, he is a great actor, but he is not Snape. Especially if it's a pairing with someone younger, and it becomes clear that the writer imagines movie!Snape, my mind instantly goes to those heavily photoshopped posters for DH, where Snape looks not a year younger than sixty, all wrinkled, and seems to be wearing a corset to hide his belly, and I get really creeped out.

**** I don't know, I can see Snape as a virgin... though ONLY if the story has no romantic interests for him. Snape's the sort of person who would rather lament the things he DOESN'T have, than appreciate what he DOES have. He spends so much time focusing on what he lost, or never had to begin with, that he doesn't see (or perhaps he doesn't WANT to see) that he still has so many opportunities to make things better for himself and others alike.

So I have no problems thinking that when he lost Lily, Snape decided "if I can't have her, then I don't want anyone," and resigned himself to a life in celibacy.

That's canon Snape, at least, or Snape in fics where there's no romance for him. If the fic DOES have a romantic story for Snape, then obviously Snape in that story is less self-destructive and actually capable of getting together with someone who isn't Lily... and in that case, sure, he could have had a few flings in his day.

He was an asshole of a teacher but I see that as part of him not wanting to teach. He's definitely a potions prodigy and when you combine it with an asshole personality, not desiring to teach, and consider he probably spent a lot of his free time working on potions. So I see his horrid teaching as he hates teaching people who don't like or care about potions or show it the respect it deserves especially seeing how easily potions accidents can happen and turn deadly. I hate when authors make it out that he's a teacher nobody can learn from because surely he would have gotten fired eventually if he was that bad.
