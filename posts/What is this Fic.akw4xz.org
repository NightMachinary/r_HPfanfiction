I read a story a while ago featuring an independent powerful Harry Potter. I basically only remember him getting into an argument with Snape, and then kidnapping him and beating him up with a metal pipe while being masked, in a dungeon. I think he trained Dumbledore's Army as his army to fight Voldemort, and asked Hermione to keep him grounded and prevent him from going dark.

This might have been a time travel sorry or an AU. Sorry I don't know much, but I appreciate any ideas.

Okay, that didn't work. Lol.

*** What do you mean?

Btw, after beating Snape up he visits him in the infirmary and tells him not to mess with him.
