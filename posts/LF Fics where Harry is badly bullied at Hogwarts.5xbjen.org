Be it because he's a little Slytherin firstie, thought to be the heir second, thought to be a cheater fourth, or anything in between. I want fics where Harry is bullied and bullied bad. Bonus points if he snaps or leaves.

Bashing, dark!harry, crossovers and slash are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut-focused plot, genderbending, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

** linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl) - Harry is an Evans in a world where the Dark Lord rules magical Britain and Snape is headmaster of Hogwarts, but Hermione still gets to attend even though she's a Mudblood. After all, why be the superior breed if there are no inferiors to abuse? So, really it isn't Harry vs. the school so much as Purebloods being taught to be good little fascists and Harry trying to stand up to them.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).
