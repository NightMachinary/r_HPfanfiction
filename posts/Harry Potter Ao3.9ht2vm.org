** Fics like supernatural, Harry Potter and Sherlock are dominated by slash on AO3. There are far more than this but I'm blanking. AO3 is kinda like the home of slash fics nowadays, considering a vast chunk of their combined fics are slash. I don't know details, but I assume another poster will fill you in. AO3 is also different in that it allows explicit material, as it does not have ads in its site. This encourages people to write their fics in more sexual detail than they would in FF.net. Which means a lot of sex. Which then means harem sex. There's always a chance that those kind of fics will be purged on FF.net so they put it on AO3. That's my take on it anyways. You'll probably get a more informed response later on.

****** Not even just advertisers! AO3 exists to be a place where fic writers can put whatever they want, basically. There used to be a huge problem with the TOS on sites (LiveJournal, FFN, etc.) getting changed with no warning that ended up with a bunch of fics and accounts getting deleted - usually because of slash.

On AO3, readers are expected to police what they read, instead of the site policing what anyone writes.

****** Yes, the point of AO3 was to create a site by fans, for fans, where we owned the servers, so fics couldn't be purged without warning and fan content creation couldn't be commercially exploited by outsiders. Look up the history of the FFN purges, Strikethrough and Boldthrough on LiveJournal, and Fanlib to learn about some of the incidents that led to the creation of AO3.

** I think the different sites go through shifts.

I started reading on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] but ended up moving to Ao3 because it seemed to have fewer crap postings and a distinct lack of pre-teen contributors. There were also a few mass exoduses from [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] when content was removed without warning, pissing off a lot of authors.

But over time, I'm finding more interesting work on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] again with authors who are not also posting on Ao3 so I'm shifting back over to it.

** Ao3 accepts content that ffn doesn't (mainly, explicit sex). That creates a different type of writer and attracts a different type of reader to the site. Even if sex is not what the reader wanted in the first place, the fact that there is more sex means that there is more shipping, and most shipping is M/M (the reason for this is a whole other story), which leads to an increase of non-explicit slash as well. The fandom, realising the differences between the content of both sites, will post/read stories in each site accordingly, so that divide gets bigger and bigger.

Is my theory, anyway.

Also you should know Ao3 can now filter /out/ tags, which is ridiculously convenient and might help you with your problem.

** AO3 was created specifically as a haven for people whose works were being deleted from the other popular sites at the time because they were "obscene" (sexually explicit, slash). It was the safe space for LGBT-centered stories, especially those involving sex. So you're basically going into a site that was created for slash fic and getting frustrated that there's so much slash fic.

**** Different fandoms have different activity levels on AO3 vs FFN. Some fandoms are more active on one, some on the other. ASOIAF likely has a larger presence on AO3 because the nature of the canon means there's a high likelihood of explicit sexual content and graphic violence in the fic, which would be riskier to post on FFN due to its content restrictions. FFN also forbids fics by certain authors like Anne Rice known to dislike fanfic and while GRRM isn't on the list, he is on record as disliking fanfic, so some fan authors may consider it too risky to post on FFN in case their policy changes, which may be another reason for the difference.

Harry Potter, on the other hand, had a huge presence on FFN for years before AO3 even existed, so it has an enormous archive going back ~20 years with hundreds of thousands of fics to attract both new and longtime fans. Many of the HP fans who left FFN and moved to AO3 were people whose fics were deleted in the FFN purges of sexually explicit content, so that's part of the reason there's such a high percentage of explicit fics on AO3. The founder of AO3 was also an HP slash fan (mostly Harry/Draco), so many of the early users were her friends and followers, which naturally included a high percentage of HP slash fans (self included, though Remus/Sirius was my OTP), so that's another reason there's so much slash on AO3.

*** It depends on what you want, a certain character as the lead, something shippy, story based, crack, AU, etc... sadly there's no DLP for asoiaf.

I'd start by checking out the Ao3 which has like 20k more than GoT and asoiaf combined on ffn and look for yourself. I'm probably not the best person to ask cuz I discount a fair amount of fics because I just really dislike the idea of certain pairings like Jon/Sansa, Arya/Gendry, and Jaime/Brienne, well not so much this one I just don't care to read a whole fic about it.

I read a really interesting take on jon/dany a couple of weeks ago, that's 250k, still being updated, and the writing is pretty good. It is extremely slow burn tho the story starts with dany being born. I believe Jon is like 12-13 right now, but it is speeding up.

  Swayed by the powerful words of a dying queen, Stannis Baratheon takes in baby Daenerys Targaryen as his ward. In the North, Eddard Stark is ordered to raise Jon Snow to wed and dishonor the Targaryen princess, by bringing bastard blood into her line, and ending the Dragons forever. Across the continent, and across the Narrow Sea, the wheel continues to turn, and the Great Game commences. Thus begins a series of events that would change the fate of Westeros forever. Familial relationship between gruff Stannis and his ward. Eventual Jon x Dany.

*** Don't know specifically what you like but some of these are pretty popular in the fandom.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2854958/chapters/6399425][Our Choices Seal Our Fate]] by DolorousEdditor: This is my personal favorite fic of any fandom. It's just short of 582k words long and the premise has Rhaegar winning the Battle of the Trident. The fic mostly follows the Starks (primarily Jon) and has lots of things going on. Some of the things include pretty much all three factions of Rhaegar's children disliking the others (Aegon/Rhaenys vs Jon vs Joffrey/Myrcella/Tommen), Robert wanting revenge after his defeat, and the Others returning. Not going to say how the things unfold of course. The only problem is that it hasn't been updated in about 2 years.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4005610/chapters/8998063][Kingdoms at War]] by Deathwalker: This is my second favorite at 666k words long. It involves Ned managing to escape and has Robb wedding Margaery instead. We see how those two events change the War of the Five Kings making it pretty Stark-centric. Gets about one or two updates a year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9430127/chapters/21341330#workskin][A Song for Dragons]] by Doublehex: Another favorite of course (413k words). Has Jon not joining the Night's Watch but heading to Essos instead. He gets roped into joining Daenerys' entourage where they eventually become lovers along with any complications that would arise from their relationship. Has lots of worldbuilding; used to be updated every 1-2 months but now gets updated whenever the author is able to (6+ months usually).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8425864/chapters/19306879][Valar Botis (All Men Must Endure)]] by sanva: At 169k words, it pretty much features an immortal Jon. Every time he dies he retains his memories and gets sent back in time to the moment where he finds Ghost. We follow his current life. Don't know much about the update status but the writer is working on the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10838280/chapters/24058194][When the Snake Bites]] by Avery_Fontaine: This is a shorter fic at 52k words that features a world where Rhaegar defeated Robert at the Trident. Even though Rhaegar won there are still houses who despise House Targaryen. In order to avoid having them use Jon as a figurehead of rebellion, Rhaegar marries Jon off to Arianne hoping to isolate him in Dorne to prevent any rebellion. However, this Arianne is just as ambitious as her canon self. Still updates occasionally.

I had a couple of more I wanted to put but my descriptions are making this post long enough as it is. I'm recommending these because these are pretty popular so chances are you'll like at least one of them (hopefully).

** Well, archive is rather infamous for the amounts of slash and outright sexual content. It's basically the adult version of FFN after they did a purge on that type of content a couple of years ago.

You have to keep in mind that most of these authors either have absurd ideas how gay relationships work (I mean, I am not gay, but I am pretty sure that gay people do not behave like in the average slashfic). They basically ship the actors or go by the logic that if one man is hot, two are even better (which is the appeal of lesbian porn to guys after all).

"You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

*** I'm partial to fics with a more sane version of Tom Riddle/Voldemort. So far I've found a few exclusive to Ao3 that are non-slash.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - (521k+ words, frequently updated, currently starting year 5) A Slytherin!Harry WBWL fic. Has some common tropes, but very well executed. In my opinion the writing style and quality is top notch.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] - (187k+ words, frequently updated) A "Harry travels back in time to raise Tom Riddle" fic.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/36855666][Antithesis]] - (353k+ words, frequently updated) A WBWL fic with a much darker tone than the usual. Lots of Stockholm syndrome.

**** The first one I would count as a pairing story and the last one I'm already reading on ffnet, but thanks.

***** Why do you count it as a pairing story?

Somehow I failed to see Antithesis on ffn when I looked. Thanks for the heads up.

****** The tags, such as "It's a surprise!," suggest that the pairing is an important part of the story.

******* Ah I see. The first 500k words don't have any significant/lasting relationships though.

*** the Island of Fire series by Esama is fantastic. HP + most of Hogwarts gets in a portkey accident at the end of the 1st task in Goblet of Fire. They end up on an island in the middle of the ocean, and then have to figure out how to survive. It isn't really very long, but it is well worth reading. And this Esama has a lot of slash stuff in the rest of his/her works, but this one is not.

i've also come to the same conclusion as you though- if you aren't gonna read the slash, AO3 isn't worth trawling through.
