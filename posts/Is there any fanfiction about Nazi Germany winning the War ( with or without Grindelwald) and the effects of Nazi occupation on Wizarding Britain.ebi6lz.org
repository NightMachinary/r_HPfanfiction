For the past few days, I have been imagining Tom Riddle Jr. leading the British Resistance to Nazi occupation. After all, according to canon, he lived in Wool's orphanage in his childhood and the Second World War (and the Blitz) happened in his teenaged years (which made him fear death so much that the rest is the seven books of the Harry Potter series).


** Arguably the best rendition of this would be linkffn(The Skitterleap), though much of the story is focused around the action with the world-building as an aside.

** I have had this idea:

Hermione time travels to 1938 and kills Riddle in his orphanage. She also went on to kill a bunch of Death Eater families of her time. As a result, Nazis and Grindelwald won the war, and she had to clean up an even bigger mess.

***** Oddly enough, in all the fanfics I've read, the traditionally Slytherin Pureblood families were either pro-Grindelwald behind closed doors, or they preferred to take the isolationist stance of just warding their homes and Diagon Alley against Muggle explosives. In most of the Riddle-focused fics I've read, wizarding Britain was depicted as being nearly oblivious to the Blitz, thinking 'who cares what the muggles do to each other since they can't hurt us', meanwhile the Muggleborns (and Riddle) were the ones who experienced the bleak reality of the war.

It would be interesting to see a different take on things.

I never mentioned Hogwarts. It's already a given that Riddle's death would be irrelevant to the war effort, so I wasn't including him in "those deaths in England".

*** If you want full crack, do one of those time-travel fics but with Harry and Hermione going back to kill Riddle, but due to freak magic they spawn into the bodies of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun ca. 1934.

Early enough to make big changes to the Third Reich, somehow dealing with Grindelwald (Riddle is a quick kill), taking care of crazy Nazis and, at the same time, making sure that Stalin does not steamroll all of Europe like he historically did the Baltic States (and later on what became the Warsaw Pact).

** My idea is that Riddle's British Resistance is composed of both light and dark characters from canon. This would actually be a Wolfenstein: The New Order crossover. They eventually meet their canon counterparts, and Riddle and Voldemort have a final showdown. Both Voldemort and the Nazis are defeated

** Not exactly and it is just one-shot, but linkao3(17975003) is kind of close.

Concerning time travel to kill Tom Riddle, I prefer linkao3(15430560), but the problem is that the main hero is so disgusting, it is hard to read.

Are you thinking of a different fic by any chance? In that one the time traveler never had any intention of killing young!Riddle.

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** There is a beautiful fic that is recommended a bunch of time around here. Where Harry goes back to Tom's era. And after a discussion with Dumbledore, the duel between him and Grindelwald happens way earlier but Grindelwald wins. And quite quickly, Hogwarts is taken over. Of course, Tom is furious (he only has his one diary horcrux by then). And he escapes with Harry through the RoR or something. They try to survive but with Harry and his saving people thing, they become the vigilantes against Grindelwald in the UK and the only hope people have. (I think Minerva plays an important second role, too). But the ending was so, so sad and heartbreaking, I've kinda blocked the memory of it and totally lost the title (I just know that it was on FF.net). ")

But it went much more in depth about the impact of occupation on the students and then the country than any fic I've read (and better than the books). The whole vigilantism and organisation was realistically built up. And it totally put any grand idea of the OotP to shame---even though it was mostly led by two teenagers and the adults always followed them.
