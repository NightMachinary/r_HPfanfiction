While I love the Harry Potter series; and grew up with the series, much like everyone, there's a lot of little things that make me want to roll my eyes, or facepalm, or shout: Come on!

One of those things was that Harry did not use the two way mirror that Sirius gave him, like come on; Sirius gives you a two way mirror, where you can chat with him, and you don't use it?

I can understand being worried; but the fact that he didn't even think to use it?

So; any stories where Harry uses the two way mirror to check on Sirius.

Note: No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione.

I would rather have the story be completed as well; if possible.

No Harem Harry.

No super OP Harry (A little smarter or powerful than he was in canon, but nothing too unrealistic).

No Weasley bashing please; as I love that family.

Other than that go nuts.

(Dang, is there no story that has this plot point? It doesn't even have to be a major thing in the story, can just be a small part; or mentioned or whatever).

Either way, please feel free to write this! Just message me when you have the first chapter up/message me to see if I want anything else in the story. (I can give you more ideas).


** Haha yeah, this has bugged me for ages - that he never opened the bloody present and didn't find the mirror until it was way too late. Broke my heart.

That said, I've been obsessively following this fanfic, where Harry does use the mirror here and there, however it's AU from 3rd year on so I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for. But it's really good!

This is splitting hairs, but Harry didn't know what it was. He didn't even open the thing until after Sirius died. All he knew was that it was a way to let Sirius know if Snape was giving him a hard time, but he resolved to never use it because he didn't want to give Sirius a reason to leave the safety of Grimmauld Place and possibly get himself captured.

I mean, Harry still should have at least checked what it was, but that's a different sort of criticism of his actions.

*** I just hate how much of a dropped Chekhov's gun it was, tbh? It felt to me like it was ultimately just a reason to make Harry feel more terrible about himself because the whole trap was easily avoidable, and then seeing Aberforth in its shard once or twice in Deathly Hallows just didn't feel like enough payoff to justify the mirror's existence.

So he could have still contacted him, if he was that worried about Sirius. He at least knew it was a way to at the very least see Sirius, if he knew that much about it. (Not meaning to sound like a jerk; that wasn't my intention).

**** To be honest Harry is not a bright kid. There are so many things that just never cross his mind and it's truly like he's an observer in his own life, just moving from one moment to the next.

He learns he's a wizard and instead of getting into learning magic---even though he's constantly in awe of the capabilities of magic---he just wants to hang out with friends and solve mysteries.

Yes this! I love the series for nostalgic reasons and mainly because the world the fandom built around it (art, fiction, theories etc). But reading the books itself is sometimes soo annoying!

That said i don't remember any name of fics where Harry uses the mirror sorry.

*** If you feel like writing one, feel free to do so! (Note no pressure, merely offering this as a fic idea or an already made story with this idea). Would really like to see this written, I'd write it myself; but I haven't written fanfiction in years; don't know how well I'd do.

**** Thanks, but I mean I wouldn't write it myself! None of my stories take place during Hogwarts years because I'm really just over them, since we had all of canon and lots of fanfics all during it! I only write post Hogwarts or pre-Hogwarts, or during-Hogwarts-but-elsewhere-in-the-world AU's and OC's stuff! :) I'm just really REALLY bored with the same characters and the same locale and the same plot beats all the time that's like 99 percent of fanfics...
