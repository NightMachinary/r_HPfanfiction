  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

** linkffn(12317784) Stepping Back

linkffn(12511998) Wind Shear

Harry/Bellatrix.

I recommend reading Stepping Back first, Wind Shear is really good, but it is a slight let-down near the end.

linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is

no paring.

I read this one recently and found it to be a nice, short and entertaining.

/Bonus recommendation/:

linkffn(11993367) Crossing Lines

this one isn't really what you are looking for, but it involves both time-travelling and James Potter/Lily Evans. Instead of Harry though, this time we see /Fred and George/ being thrown back in time. Also rather short and with no paring.

Hope I helped you.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** Linkao3(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil)

Ironically this fic has the same name as the other one that's linked but it's a different. One of my absolute favorites. Hermiony and Harry travel to the past. Pairings. Hermione/Remus & Harry/Sirius & Jily is also there but James is still trying to woo her

  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?
