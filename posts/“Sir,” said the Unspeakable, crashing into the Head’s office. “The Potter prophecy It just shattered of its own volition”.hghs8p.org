** "Fuck!" Said Croaker, Head Unspeakable. "I wanted to be there when Moldyvort died!"

Turns out, murder by muggle means destroys horcruxes too.

*** Heh. I was thinking that something happened that literally made the prophecy invalid, shattering it, not that Moldywarts died.

Common fanon has the prophecy orbs go dark once they're fulfilled, as opposed to shattering.

**** The concept of fulfilled prophecies going dark is somewhat based on canon though

From Chapter 34 of OotP...

  Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf. *Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs*.

There /might/ be some correlation.

***** Could be. Honestly there's no way to say.

Could be just due to age, like one from the last millenia having a dim glow, and fresher ones glowing like a star.

Or it could be scope of the fortelling, like a prophecy that holds the fate of the world glowing like the sun, while one that would only affect the village of Ottery St. Catchpole would be as dim as Goyle on a bad day.

**** For what it's worth, I did rather enjoy Rorchach's Blot's linkffn(Old Soldiers Never Die), which basically has Harry leading an army of squibs against the Death Eaters.

TL;DR: Vernon kills Harry, Snape does some potion mumbo jumbo that restores Harry's body and kills the scarcrux, which travels back to all of the Dark marks and kills most of them and the horcruxes. Voldemort escapes into Bellatrix's mind. Prophecy was pretty much shattered and a new one in sprouted.

It's not my cup of tea, but I only found it because of fatfingering on my phone.
