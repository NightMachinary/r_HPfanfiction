In bashfics, the fact that Ron never studies and is really stupid without Hermione and Harry to help comes up a lot but he totally does study. First of all Ron basically has the same grades as Harry with Harry being just one grade higher in DADA and like 70% of all scenes in the common room have the trio doing homework and it doesn't look like anyone is helping him. There are also a bunch of scenes of just Harry and him working without Hermione around at all. So why is this specific thing always brought up? It's stupid and directly contradicts canon!


** I guess because in canon he's the most vocal when it comes to complaining about the amount of work. He's an average student, just like Harry (if we were to compare the grading system with the American one, having a bunch of B's and C's doesn't make you brilliant). He doesn't remark himself in any way in class and probably neither does Harry (it's just that the books are written from his perspective). The only advantage the latter has is his reputation and practical experience in DADA, oh, and the Prince's instructions in Book 6 for potions. Still Ron is one step above other classmates in his year considering he becomes Prefect.

There's even a scene where Ron helps Harry, believe it or not, in book 3.

#+begin_quote
  Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.

  “You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.

  Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say anything.
#+end_quote

--Prisoner of Azkaban, pg 148 (First American Edition 1999).

By Hermione's reaction, Ron and Harry copying from each other seems to be a regular thing. That's probably why they have similar grades.

Canon means nothing to these people. The fact that Ron regularly matches Harry grade-wise disgusts them. Don't expect a few canon-backed quotes to stop the bash-fics though.

I'm not saying this is true for everyone but some people, like me, are generally surprised by canon sometimes. I've read so much fanficiton that I forget some things aren't in canon or are. That can blow my mind on a reread when I notice something.

**** One of the biggest change I see happening quite discreetly in fanfic is the change of the power of magic. In canon it is quite variable, some spells are insanely powerful and do mind blowing things (like space altering magic) and at the same time the spells known by your average wizard are... Not that great ? Like the spells they use in combat are actually not that strong overall, the muggle ways of war being far faaar more deadly and efficient, and that's someting I often see modified in fanfic to make magic far more potent at nearly everything. As if it would offend them that even such an unnatural force had limitations.

Hermione and Ron's relationship in the movies won't work without growth from both characters, but we don't see that in the movies.

And you can only apparate once you are of age, so at 17 years old and after classes given by the ministry. Side along apparition is tough and even tougher with a trunk and animal.

** Yeah, Ron being lazy is stupid. He just isn't a bookworm but he is a fairly good student. It's the same thing with Harry - in many fanfics Harry "starts" studying and suddenly he is at Dumbledores/Voldemorts level. They say Harry was a lazy student before that but that isn't true. He isn't a Hermione Granger but he is actually a above average student - he does always do his homework (as teacher I can tell you: that is above average) and he studies hard to qualify himself for the courses he needs to become an Auror. He just isn't as brillant as Dumbledore or Voldemort (or even Hermione). He is a prodigy in flying and DADA but in everything else he is pretty average.

** Making Ron lazy is an easy way to excuse why he's not accompanying Harry & Hermione (normally for pairing purpose, but also convenient for Harry having conversations that bash Ron with someone else in the library, or just any plot that normally should involve Ron). In the longer term, it's also commonly a trigger for Harry/Hermione to snap from Ron asking to copy their homework.

It's kind of weird that writers went out of their way to bash Ron when it's perfectly normal for Harry to have minimal (compared to Ron) interaction with Neville, Dean, and Seamus when they're also sleeping in the same room for years. The writers could just arrange for Harry to meet someone else in the train, becoming fast friends with Neville, who, while timid, is actually considered fine by the Gryffindors even before his character development (have anyone ever complained about Neville losing so many points from Snape?) so he could easily become Harry's friend without bashing Ron, same goes for Dean, who is also Muggle-raised, Seamus didn't have any problem with Harry until her mother refuse to believe Voldemort return, and even then he still joined DA, so it's easy to have Harry not being close with Ron without changing much of their personality if any.

**** And overhyping it is done by those who like the game (I have a friend like that). It's always hilarious to hear arguments about the amount of possible moves when any strategy game from the 1990s surpasses that metric significantly. Likewise, unlike fanon often makes it out to be, chess is not a trainer for strategy and being good at chess does not qualify for command anymore than being good at Starcraft does. There's a reason why the Prussian general staff came up with Kriegsspiel in the 19th century and was swiftly copied by everyone else despite chess being around.

Don't get me wrong, chess can be a fun broad game, but it does not make a commander and that trope really annoys me (not only in fanfiction).

It's not that being a good chess player makes you a good strategist, but good strategists are also good chess players. Considering that Ron's skill at the game was mentioned as far back as when he was eleven years old, it's not a reach to assume that it comes from him just naturally being a good strategist.

****** Three things speak against chess being an indicator of command abilities. Both players have perfect vision over the position of all pieces, which is completely unrealistic since for most of the time, you'd struggle to even keep track of your own positions. Secondly, all pieces can only move in predicable fashions, severely limiting the possible avenues of attck. You cannot flank on a chessboard. And it is turn based, so it does not allow you to simulate situations where more than one "front" require the commander's immediate attention (eg Battle of Hogwarts attacks from the front and through a secret passage).

It is a game and its military applications are a long-standing trope (also in movies and such), but not one grounded in much reality. The only aspect of Chess which you can transfer is predicting moves, but that's a lot easier since there is no camouflage, recon or vision mechanic.

******* I mean. I get what you are trying to say, but at 11 Ron was an amazing chess player on a board where he could see his friends moves and react accordingly, which like you said sure doesn't mean he is automatically a great strategist...

But i think the thing that DID prove, again at 11 years old, that he at the very least had the capability of being a great strategist was when, ya know, he guided Harry and Hermione through a giant ass game of chess where he did not have an aerial view of the board and had to instinctively react to the parts he could physically see in front of him, ya know, like in a real battle? And then went on to make sure his team won even when he had to sacrifice himself to do so.

Like the other person said... not everyone who plays chess is great under pressure when they can't see all of the variables... but most people who are great at commanding are also pretty damn good at Chess. And I think 11 year old Ron definitely proved he was great at leading through "faux chess war.".

The Wikipedia article is pretty telling since it mentions the early war games (chess with terrain features and military pieces rather than classic chess ones), and that these games were dismissed by the military for being way too unrealistic to be of any military value. And if that applies to chess derivatives aimed at being more militarily accurate, it applies to chess doubly so.
