After a little over 9 years, I have just finished the last chapters and epilogue for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer][Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer]].

It's an AU where magic works a bit differently from canon, with the caster's belief being a key element in the effectiveness of spells. That goes double for prophecy, and when Ron Weasley makes a prediction that comes true, things change.

It's a semi-serious, semi-humorous story that starts 3rd year and goes until near the end of graduation. It is not crack, except for the omakes, which very much are.

A few "warnings" for people who don't want to read certain kinds of fanfics:

1. This is an AU. One minor change that reviewers frequently complain about is that Harry knows about the prophecy already in his 3rd year. In this story, it was public knowledge that there was a prophecy about Harry and Voldemort and he found out about it about the same time he found out the truth about his parent's death.
2. Around the end of the story, like, the very last few chapters, I have Harry and Hermione end up together. The relationship does not really play a major role, but if you just can't stand Harmonie stories at all, well, you've been warned.
3. The magic system differs from what Rowling presented in a very specific way. If you are a hardcore stickler for things not diverging, well, they do. Prime example: The Killing Curse is not an automatic death. A random mook hitting Dumbledore with that spell would not succeed. The more powerful the wizard it is cast on, the stronger the caster needs to be for it to work. Voldemort is special in that nobody has ever survived /his/ Killing Curse, which is why Harry doing so as an infant is such a big deal.
4. This story bucks the trend of "evil" Dumbledore and edgy Harry. Harry is pretty forgiving, and I got a decent number of readers who quit because they think Harry should have never forgiven a few incidents or thought he should blast Dumbledore or something like that. If you want "Independent!Harry" and expect Ron bashing, this will not be your cup of butterbeer.
5. There are a few character deaths. If you can't stand that, then maybe this isn't for you.

Hope some of you enjoy it. It took a while for me to finish it, but it was a lot of fun to write.


** Congrats! Finishing a writing project always deserved to be celebrated!

*** Oh, almost forgot - love the killing curse idea! Always bothered me that the curse was sort of an easy out for any low-rank sadist. The idea that people actually need to be stronger than the person they hit makes using it as frequently as Voldemort does not only a show of power, but also his absolute certainty in his own strength.

It also doesn't make it so that people can just tank those hits, since you wouldn't really know if you could survive unless you did.. actually really looking forward to starting this.

** I like the lack of bashing in the fic. It's not the perfect fic for me, but it was a great read.\\
I hope you do more like it in the future.

*** Thanks! I don't think I have any Harry Potter fandom stories still open, though. Now that this is finished, I'm going to write an original story idea and only work on existing, unfinished fanworks when I get stuck or need to take a break from my own writing.

** Oh wow, you wrote that?!

I just finished it! I don't use FFN that much, but the concept intrigued me and I was absolutely hooked. Your end of chapter omakes were always hilarious but the writing of every chapter was always excellent; I felt genuinely upset when Trelawney died which was really juxtaposed with, say, the cannons winning the league because people believed in Ron believing in them. Excellent work.
