Okay, so I know this is a long shot, but I've been looking for this story for years now. The only reason I know it existed at one point is because I drew Harry and Draco dragon forms. I know it was from around 2009/2010, which is about when I read it, and that Harry and Draco were dragons and mates. Their dragon forms each had a name - Draco's was Kirios the Spirit Dragon and Harry's was Tanek the Wrath Dragon. I'm pretty sure Draco got pregnant in the story. Again, I know this is a long shot since it might of got deleted during the FF.net purge of like 2010. But couldn't hurt to try
