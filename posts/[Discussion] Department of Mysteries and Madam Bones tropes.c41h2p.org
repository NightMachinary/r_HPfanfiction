Am I the only person who is starting to dislike the trope where the department of Mysteries has magic no one, not even Dumbledore or Voldemort, heard of? Their department was broken into my 6 teenagers and death eaters. Or Amelia Bones magically being the solution to magical Britain's problems. She was just there in book 5. She did just as much as McGonagall and then was killed my Voldemort.


** Amelia Bones is just an easy competent member of the ministry that isn't Dumbledore. Amelia Bones is a character that has the potential to be important if written correctly, people just don't do it properly.

The Department of Mysteries having things that Voldemort or Dumbledore don't know about is fine honestly, it is supposed to be a secretive department and it is supposed to be studying things most wizards don't know about.

*** But then they get made hyper-competent. An example is in a Sinyk fic where they capture Dumbledore.

I like viewing them as a bunch of magical researchers. So a bit like scientists than spies and FBI agents.

**** I can kind of allow that I think. Partly that's a conservation of detail issue -- it /is/ weird the lab tech from CSI is also conducting the arrest but you can only handle a finite number of named characters.

***** I always loved either the idea the unspeakable s are a bunch of people who truly try to study magic, their sole jobs is better understanding magic---not being super skilled special agents, that's what aurors should be imo.

Magical researchers who - Magical Britain being what it is - got their jobs based on nepotism, and who regard any form of systematic inquiry as a lot of nonsense, and the scientific method as a lot of /muggle/ nonsense. When they make any kind of advance or discovery, it's largely by accident.

** As often with fanfics, I have nothing about the idea but a lot of problem with the realisation.

The DoM is the closest thing of a research lab in the Hp univers, so it could be understandable they know one or 2 thing Dumbledore never learnt about. But this information doesn't have to be usefull, and should not be over powered. The upper limit for me should be to give them an acient artefact they were studying that could potentially be used to seal/ kill Voldemort even with his Horcruxes (if only they could activate it . . .)\\
Or they could have one of them who studied a lot of soul magic and developed an item/ spell that can be used to locate Voldemort Horcruxe (but only after he has been calibrated to Voldemort's soul thanks to a Horcruxe, and only to a limited radius like km2).\\
In both case, they should not have a team of super agents able to take down anyone they wish to, or a "ritual" to clean a Horcruxe without destroying it.

​

As for Madam Bones, she is a very high ranked member of the Ministry with a reputation to be tough and honest. She would probably have been a better minister than Scrimeour was (and it's probably is why Voldemort killed her). But she is not a super lady who, had she lived, would have won the war in 3 weeks even without Dumbledore.

The problem of most fic that use them is that some author don't make any difference between a plot device and a plot killer. This 2 idea are nice to create divergence point from canon and create interesting story arcs, but if they do everything in 2 days without any intervention from the hero, then there isn't any story anymore and it's boring.

Also, seriously, Dumbledore and Voldemort are the 2 best wizards around, no one in Britain can compare to them. Rokwood was an unspeakable who became a Death Eater (and not even the most dangerous one), and the whole Battle of the DoM show that its security either suck, or Voldemort has enough influence on it to lower all the securities. If Croaker (or anyone the author put at the head of the DoM) was as strong as Voldemort and Dumbledore, he would have played a role, not stayed invisible for the whole time.

*** I think you are vastly underestimating the detrimental effects of Dumbledore's obsession with secrecy. He hoarded all important info on defeating Voldemort and only passed it on to three undertrained teenagers, leading to the unnecessary deaths of hundred if not thousands (depending on how badly you think Rowling depicted the size of Wizarding Britain) of people. The Order does basically nothing in either war. Put in the hands of a group of competent wizards such as Bones in a position to cleanse Voldemort's influence in the Ministry, and a group whose entire purpose includes keeping secrets like the DoM, and yeah I can see the war taking a much shorter time.

Of course, this is all intentional (I would hope) plotting by Rowling. Without Dumbledore's secrecy obsession, the war takes like ten minutes instead of seven books. Then again if Voldemort was actually competent, he'd have made his horcruxes from rocks and dropped them in the ocean.

**** I view him sending off Harry on the hunt with only 6th years of an average education as unforgivable.

That being said, the ministry was definitely corrupt. I also think other order members should have been involved.

**** For all his faults, Dumbledore need for secrecy is one of the few things I agree with.

Dumbledore whole plan would have taken one leak to become useless, since while Voldemort is arrogant, he is also not totally stupid. Had he known his secret was compromised, he would have change the hiding place of his horcruxes, or just tried to create another.

Also, one thing Dumbledore learned from the first war was that no secret was completely safe. He himself trusted Petigrew, and he betrayed him. It is also known that Voldemort had people working for him in the Ministry, worse he even managed to infiltrate the Department of Mysteries. And this is without even mentioning that Voldemort is one of the best, if not the best Legilimens in the world, meaning the information could be divulged without betrayal.

So who could he trust? The DoM was infiltred before, it could happen again. Madame Bones may be safe, but the one working under her may not be, and he fairness may also mean she would want to respect the protocole and talk with the Minister. Minister who is a spineless coward who could divulgue the information to "look like he is doing something" (something that his successor could also have done), try to save his hide by selling the information to Voldemort, or just be an idiot and talk about it with "his great friend Lucius". Also the only reason his Undersecretary is not a Death Eater is because she doesn't have his Mark, she is still as bad as them.

Even among the Order, there isn't really anyone whose contribution would be worth the risk to divulgue the plan (hard to search Horcruxe when you are teaching Transfiguration at Hogwarts). In the end, he only told Harry because his is a "sacrifiable pawn". It seem bad but Harry is someone who he is sure would not betray his trust (partly because of he trusts him, partly because he is already marked for death by Voldemort anyways). His friends may be a risk, but he would probably fail without them so they are a necessary risk.\\
And finally, he told Severus. I am convinced Severus was the security of his plan. It was someone he could trust that was high ranked in the enemy rank, able to lie to Voldemort and with most if not all the informations he had.

Had Harry failed, Snape would either have been the one to finish the job, or the one to recruit new pawns.

​

Dumbledore secrecy may be seem responsible to the death of hundreds, but considering the price of failing, I think is was a worthy sacrifice.

***** We're going to have to agree to disagree. I'd go point by point but there are no real answers, just opinions and speculation.

And that is why there is fanfic :-)

** I like the idea of the DOM being mostly just a bunch of researchers, but I also see them as sort of like containment. When something shows up that /really/ shouldn't be in circulation amongst the common populace (things like the Veil or similarly powerful and mysterious things that nobody understands) they have /one/ team that goes and, ah, appropriates these things for the safety of the people.

Seems like the kind of thing the Ministry would do.

It also sort of matches with what we see in Canon. The Time Turners aren't really understood, so they're all stuck in a room where they can be safely watched and kept track of (in addition to the obvious safety issues). The Brains are downright dangerous, the Prophecy room is rather self explanatory (as is the Veil room) and most other rooms are rather similar. They have all of these things for study and containment. It should be noted that the DOM is not intended to keep things (or people) /out/, but rather to keep the experiments and such /in/. If you don't belong to one of the rooms you won't have too much trouble getting back out; if you're an experiment God help your soul.

TL;DR- The DOM is almost entirely researchers, but sometimes research requires fieldwork so they have /one/ field team that collects any artifacts that need collecting and do any fieldwork that is required. They have few outside defenses because their rooms are meant to keep their experiments in, not people out.

--------------

As to Madam Bones, had she not been competent and powerful Voldemort wouldn't have killed her personally. If she lives she is useful, but the people in power will still hinder her greatly.
