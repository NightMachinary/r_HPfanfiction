We sometimes hold these threads where writers are invited to link to their ongoing stories, but here I don't just want you to link. I want you to /sell/ me your stories. What is it about? Why did you write it? Why do you think I really ought to read it? An exercise in self-promotion! I, for one, would much rather hear more about a story than just a short summary and fanfiction.net's limited tagging system before getting into it.


** linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop)

My latest series is a realistic take on the Lord Potter trope combined with a Slytherin!Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

Provided the brief summary didn't scare you away, here's a bit more about the fic and why I decided to write it. I find politics to be really interesting, and the Lord Potter trope is pretty cool when done right. Unfortunately, there's a huge shortage of stories that make it realistic (ie no child politicians, Harry isn't the lord of everything). After doing a bunch of thinking and a bunch of reading on Wikipedia, I decided to incorporate a couple more aspects. Firstly, Ron. Ron typically gets treated poorly in the fandom, and I wanted to write a piece where Ron embraces his intelligence and is more ambitious than in canon. Secondly, I wanted to write a Slytherin trio because I find fics like that to be interesting, and also few and far between. Thirdly, I wanted to write a Voldemort who embodied the cunning aspect of Slytherin house.

When you combine a more realistic take on Lord Potter, a competent Ron, a Slytherin trio, a cunning Voldemort, and a side dose of worldbuilding, you get the Chessmaster series.

** Thread title made me think we were getting money. ;(

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834801/1/The-Coven-of-Albion]])

(Edit: I went ahead and changed the title to the one I've been meaning to switch to.)

It's about a Harry who runs away after an accidental Apparition and a friendly snake lead him to realize his magical abilities. However, it's not really an Indy!Harry story, his relatives in the Black Family learn about him soon enough and rescue him from a descent into darkness.

While I'm only just getting there plotwise, it is to ultimately be a story of religious faith and love as Harry grows accustomed to and accepts the pagan religious practices of his new kin and the beings they ritually place their fates in the hands of (especially Morgana, who shows up next chapter).

It's not a well-trodden story type in HP fanfiction, and despite my own current disinterest with religion, it's still interesting material for a story. At best, religion and religious practices serve as window dressing in most stories so I'm pretty excited to give it a go and explore it from Harry's perspective mainly.

** I wrote linkffn(Limpieza De Sangre) to see how many people I could con into thinking Harry and Lord Voldemort would be a thing. I mean that's not at all why I did it. >.>

In all seriousness I had two things I wanted to explore for a while. One was Wizard life during WWII London. The other was a female villain in Harry Potter. Since I wasn't really coming up with a good plot for either I combined the two. Some later tweaks ended up making it not really about either of those two ideas. But such is life in planning.

What's it about? As a whole it's just a reimagination of Harry's fifth year with in a world where Tom Riddle was born Emily Riddle. I never really liked 'Evil because Evil' style of villains and wanted to explore what could actually push an orphaned girl raised entirely by muggles that was repeatedly forced back to London during the Blitz could turn into the Greatest Dark Witch of the age.

But a lot of it is more about subverting expectations and how the choices people make in their lives stick with them for a very long time.

You definitely achieved your goal of subverting expectations, I had no idea where the characters where going yet nothing seemed out of character. The end was heart wrenching and left me genuinely upset.

Thank you for all the time and effort you put into this book, I haven't fell in love with a story this much in a long time fanfic or not.

** linkffn(12745758)

/No longer alone/ is my response to the rather surprising lack of "Harry has/gets an honorary big sister" and "Harry gets adopted by someone besides the usual suspects" type of stories. There are a few fics where he ends up with the Tonks family, but those generally ship him with Nymphadora instead of keeping their relationship platonic. I write a story about Harry getting a family, not some fast-paced action thriller. The focus is on character development as well as showing more of their life. While Harry-centric, other characters also have their own thing going on and are not just there to serve the plot. Most notably, the Black sisters have their own side plot from Andromeda's PoV. And perhaps most importantly, I try to avoid overpowered characters as much as possible. Harry at age 14 will not outfight Voldemort or Dumbledore. Politics are more than "oh shit, Lord Potter is back, better bend over", even if they are no central element of the story (Harry does not hold any title or office).

**** The rating is for language, non explicit sexual situations (to come) , mentions of child abuse, mentions of Death Eaters atrocities (including rape) and overall heavy topics (Black family stuff like forced marriages, marital abuse). Nothing really outstanding, just lots of little things that make it questionable for children aged 12. Remember, M rating means 16 not blood and gore.

Despite this the overall narrative is light spirited. Plenty of jokes (including sexual humour, banter and Harry being believed a fictional character by an OC) and some gallow humour.

And, at least according to my reviews, I write good Quidditch scenes (group stage of the World Cup).

** linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179)

The story is about Harry becoming a literal five-headed dragon. It's /not/ a power-wank fic, though. Sure, Harry's now strong enough to give Dumbledore pause, but that's not the point of the story.

Rather, it's the story of a boy whose mind was shattered and each of the pieces given a voice of its own (a bit like if the emotions from /Inside Out/ could talk directly through the girl). It's the story of a boy coming to deal with the changes his growing body is undergoing (both draconic and puberty-related). It's the story of a boy finding a makeshift family in the form of his friends and teachers. It's the story of a boy given a second chance at growing up. It's the story of a boy finally given a chance to love and respect himself.

/We, Harry Potter/ is not pure fluff, but it's by far the fluffiest thing I've ever written. It's also anti-bashing, celebrating those characters that are so often bashed to death in this fandom. A good, competent Dumbledore (who's not evil), a kind and fun Ron (who's not an idiotic ultra-jerk), and a smart and respectful Hermione (who's not a controlling, bossy, authority ass-kisser).

P.S. I updated it yesterday.

This my attempt at putting a bit of the zaniness of Discworld into HP by having Harry raised by the Wyrd Sisters.

It's dialogue heavy, and I've done my best to have every person/faction develop wildly different assumptions that resist all attempts at clarification.

So far it's mostly an elongated 'who's on first' gag, but it has a few serious moments that I'm really proud of, and overall has been a blast to write.

*** Some constructive criticism, 3 chapters with less that 5k words stops me from even opening this fic. Consider 4-5k per chapter.

** I'm writing a couple of fics that I haven't posted anywhere yet (I have a bad habit of abandoning projects part-way through and don't want to get anyone's hopes up by posting the first part of a story with no idea if I'll be able to finish it).

One started with the question "What if Gilderoy Lockheart were /actually/ as acomplished a wizard as he always claimed?" I figured first and formemost he'd go and have his own adventures, instead of stealing other people's, and from there I developed him into a kind of cross between Daniel Jackson and Indiana Jones.

The other big idea I've got occurred to me while I was playing WoW, specifically running old raid content solo. By the current events of the game, players are epically powerful movers and shakers of Azeroth. Practiacally everyone knows their name. They've faced threats to the world that would make lesser mortals turn to jelly. And I wondered what a Harry Potter who had faced everything a raid-capable, level 110 character from WoW would think when faced with Voldemort. The thought made me giggle.

My plan is, once I've got a backlog of chapters and am in the swing of writing, I'll start publishing on FF.net. Maybe somewhere else, as I like the idea of embedding links to references (I also read With This Ring, and like the intertextuality and multi-media possibilities that posting to a forum allow a storyteller).
