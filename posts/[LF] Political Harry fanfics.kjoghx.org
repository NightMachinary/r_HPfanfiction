I've read many fanfics involving politics, and I want more!

​

/I've read: The rise of wizards/

/Savior of magic/

/Benefits of old laws/

/Novocaine/

/A marauders plan./

/The accidental animagus/

/The cadmean victory/

​

So, if there is more, please let me know!

​

(I don't like Harry / Hermione, Harry / Voldemort)


** Blood and Water and Pureblood Pretense are both pretty good.
