I personally think an average Hogwarts graduate can destroy a few city blocks a average auror a small town a powerful auror a average sized town a auror like moody could destroy London then there's Grindelwald Voldemort and Dumbledore who could destroy a area like Iceland and then there's Merlin and Morgana Le Fay who could destroy a continent like Australia.


** I was thinking on the same lines, only in reverse, like, what kind of muggle firepower would you need to take down a wizard? For an average hogwarts student, a bullet would do. The bullet travels just to fast to be able to cast any sort of protection. For an average auror, i think a guided bomb would do the trick, for voldemort, dumbledore&grindelwald, a small nuclear bomb, and for merlin, maybe one of the biggest nuclear bombs, like tsar bomb or something, i think no matter what spells you know and are able to cast, the intense heat, pressure and radiation will kill you eventually.

*** Harry takes an iron ball moving a 150 MPH+ to the skull and only cracks it. He then falls off his broom and survives with that cracked skull. Wizards definitely have the resiliency to survive bullets.

Indeed, surviving bullets is not a rarity in the real world either. It's not like in the movies where you get shot once in the chest and you die instantly. Even lethal shots into the brain may not disable an attacker.

I would also caution you against reconciling scientific models of the world and magical models of the world. Magic overrides these "mundane" models in the HP books. Spells are not related to muggle ideas of energy. Conjuration of water alone is a massive amount of energy, as much as and greater than nuclear weapons. It's clear that magic does not operate under muggle scientific models of the world in HP. As another commenter mentioned, Dresden is a great book series where magic does operate under scientific models of the world.

Instead, magic overrides the mundane in HP. When Dumbledore transfigures something, he changes the nature of the object. He doesn't exert energy on the object to change its chemical bonds and atomic orientation. Magic is conceptual.

Muggle firepower is always at a disadvantage against wizards.

Bullet? Bomb? Nuclear bomb? A shield charm works. Or they can apparate. Or they can employ a myriad of other spells.

**** I never though about it this way, i guess you are right, and magic does overpower muggle firepower, good arguing, good sir!

*** I think wizards as they mature magic saturates their bodies so they are multiple time stronger and faster than a muggle and can put up shields in time so someone like Dumbledore who is very magically powerful would be insanely fast and a sniper bullet if it hit him would just bounce off his skin

**** I think you are overstating just how far magic augments someone, It obviously does to some degree otherwise Dumbledore would not have managed a perfect breaststroke at age 115. This is especially true if you decided to take the phrase "perfect breaststroke" literally, and not harry just being inexperienced. If you're doing it properly and pulling your upper body out of the water on each breath, it takes a lot of strength and endurance to keep going.

All that said a sniper round not even penetrating his skin is ludicrous. If wizards were even remotely that durable then the troll in book 1 would have been either been a non-threat OR so have muscles so strong that levitating and hitting it with it's own club would have done nothing but annoy it.

*** The Dresden Files has some fun with this. Dresden says the best way to kill a wizard is with a sniper rifle. He's dead before he hears the shot and can get defenses up.

Then you have a Warden (think Auror) luring a nigh-immortal monster into a nuclear testing ground and apparating away just before the boom.
