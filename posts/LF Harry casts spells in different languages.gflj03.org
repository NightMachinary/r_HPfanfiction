Some of the Spells in Harry Potter are Latin, I remember one is African, some aren't even proper Latin and are just pseudo Latin. I want Harry to realise this, and think "Maybe if I find a more solid Magical Language" and try out other things from Myth/History. Medea of Colchis was seen as one of the greatest witches of all time? Why not try casting spells in Greek. The Sumerians were flat out the strongest of all time? Let's learn Ancient Babylonian.

Even funnier if he botches it and every time he speaks the Language he chooses at all, the Spell happens, whether he intends it to or not. "γαμω" cursed Harry as Bellatrix and Voldemort caught up to him. He then recoiled in horror as they proceeded to do unspeakable things to each other that Harry no longer remembers due to self obliviation upon using the distraction to escape.


** African is not a language.

** I haven't studied Greek in years, so what does γαμω mean? It's a singular first person verb and that's all I know. Dr. Mallen would be so disappointed.

Anyway, why do languages activate spells? What if he cast in English? This needs to be answered before an author can write a fic with this. I'm sure I've seen something with this though, so I'll look.

Edit: African is not a language. Did you mean Afrikaans?

Edit 2: I just sat down for some research. There are canonically spells not in Latin or pseudo Latin. Episkey? From επισκευή. The killing curse is Arabic if I remember correctly.

*** The African language I was on about is Sidiki, but there are so many african languages that i was generalising as I couldn't remember which one, I just remembered it was an African Language. Alohomora is based on the West African sidiki dialect.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]] has different languages as bases for spells, though the main character is Tom (not the barman) and it's not called into focus. Good fic, recommended.

** Fact checking for others

Google translate - γαμω (gamo) = 'bugger' or 'fuck/screw'

Avada Kedavra is based on the Aramaic אַבַדָא כְּדַברָא, avada kedavra, meaning "let the thing be destroyed". J. K. Rowling confirmed this during an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 April, 2004, where she had this to say about the spell's etymology:

"Does anyone know where avada kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed.' Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine."

For those unfamiliar, Aramaic is an ancient language made popular by the Assyrians throughout the Middle East and was in common use as a trade language in the time of Jesus.
