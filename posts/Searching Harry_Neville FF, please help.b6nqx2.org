I'm searching a specific fanfiction but just can't find it :( it was posted on Fanfiction.net I think

I remember that Harry comes into a water creature inheritance and needs to take a partner/mate. Plus Snape was a vampire in this one and did go a little crazy. In the end he chooses neville, cuz he is a water creature too. Please if anyone know what Titel this fiction is or can post a link I would be super happy :)

*** I'm so sorry that English is not my first language and that my autocorrection is spelling words out for how they are written in my language (German) =_=
