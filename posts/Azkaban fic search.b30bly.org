Greetings my fellow readers!

I'm looking for a fic where Harry is imprisoned in Azkaban. He escaped from his cell and runs into the center warding room of the prison. He then somehow overpowers or inherits the wards and becomes Lord Azkaban. I think he then sets up some sort of safehaven from Voldy. I've tried searching on Scryer and Google but don't think any of the fics I saw are the fic I'm looking for.

Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2208427/2/Earl-of-the-North][Earl of the North]] has elements of this, but isn't quite what you listed. He becomes Lord Polarix instead and teams up with Bella.

*** Yeah, I saw that one but it doesn't match. I don't think the fic I was looking for had any sort of romance
