Second in a planned series of stories in a universe where Tom Riddle was sorted into Gryffindor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15607950][Men Who Are Resolved]]

Summary: Albus Dumbledore must solve a persistent problem involving one of his third-year students. There is nothing to fear.

Also, part one of the next story in the series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15608064/chapters/36238929][I Have Killed a Man for Wounding Me]].


** How utterly terrifying. It reminds me of a Lewis quote,

#+begin_quote
  “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”
#+end_quote

I'm not sure you're really going in that direction, but it made me think of it. You may consider me subscribed to /I Have Killed a Man for Wounding Me./ I am curious if Harry has survived like in canon, or if he has died with his parents. I look forward to it's continuation, as well as that of the whole series.

*** I'm not deliberately heading in that direction but it wouldn't surprise me to see the story adopt a little bit of that tone.

** Subscribed!

This is a fascinating AU; I'm interested to see how you expand on the reversal of some core Canon concepts, as the whole mirror-image concept regarding the DE and even changes in characters' personalities is really intriguing.

I'm also really appreciative of the fact that your spelling and grammar is top-notch :)

*** Thank you! The technical stuff is a biggie for me, and I'll almost always drop a fic if there are more than a few typos. I've been keeping myself alive through college by grading essays, so at this point I can't /not/ see them.

I also write original fiction, which means that I have to try to be at my best even when I'm writing this stuff, to make sure that I don't see a drop in the quality of the work that makes me (a little) money.

**** Ah, if you can PM me a link to your original fiction (not sure if sub rules will let you link it directly), I'd appreciate it!
