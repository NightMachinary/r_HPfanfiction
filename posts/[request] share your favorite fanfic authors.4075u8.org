[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991]]

These are the only authors that come to mind that have managed to combine novelty with quality writing in their works, creating some of the few fics I've actually been /excited/ to continue reading, rather than just passively interested.

Isn't the entire point of a vampire that it's dead? A living vampire isn't a vampire, it's a chupacabra...

*** well i say better a living vampire than a sparkling one and thats apparently still valid ;) Also, I'd easily see it as an inbetween , like a born vampire is still alive and the heart beating but needs different diet etc. but when s/he dies s/he'll become a 'real' vampire (undead). I could totally see that. In this specifc case of sanguis reatus it's a ritual gone bonkers, so he didnt go vamp the usual way - and didnt become an usual vamp.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
