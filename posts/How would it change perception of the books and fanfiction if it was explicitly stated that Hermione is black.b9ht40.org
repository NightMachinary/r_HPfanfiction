Let's imagine that in the first book it was explicitly stated that Hermione's black and consequently in the movies she was also played by a black actress.

What would it change? Would readers feel differently about her? Would it change ships and the shipping wars? How would it change fanfiction in general and your stories in particular?

Your thoughts?

** The most likely scenario I can imagine is that people would misinterpret Draco's blood-purism-based racism of her /all the time/, and the "racism based on skin colour isn't a thing on the Wizarding World" bit of canon information would be hopelessly buried while people would take it even more for granted that the Death Eaters /really are/ just a wizard version of the K.K.K. than they already do due to the movies' depiction.

I'd like to think it wouldn't have affected shipping very much, except inasmuch as the hypothetical black actress playing Hermione in the movies (or, indeed, /any/ other actress playing Hermione in the movie) might not have been quite as unexpectedly beautiful as Emma Watson, and therefore might not have had as many teenage crushes on her.

One of my favorite conflicts.

And yes, wizards are not exactly master strategists. I think a more realistic take on a large scale wizarding war would be very interesting. Perhaps less of a terrorist conflict/coup like in the books and more England v France or the magical aspect of WW2.

****** Voldemort and Dumbledore are both effectively weapons of mass destruction compared to other wizards, without either of them the bigger number of wizards controls the government and the Death Eaters just lack the support to effectively take over and keep power. They only really managed to gain power because Voldemort was killing of the people that would be a threat. We see that during the battle of Hogwarts where just after Harry made the defenders resistant to Voldemorts magic the inhabitants of Hogsmeade and defenders of Hogwartsmanaged to crush his army.

******* No, Voldemort's Death Eaters were defeated prior to their showdown because Voldemort called off the attack after he gained the upper hand. In the end, only he and Bellatrix were left standing. His forces had been defeated at that point due to poor resource management.

Also, the Death Eaters managed to demonstrate a massive, staggering incompetence during the battle. Armed with magical equivalents of automatic grenade launchers, flame throwers and energy shields, they were defeated by arrows and kitchen utensils. And let's not even mention their frontal, uphill assault of a fortified position across hundreds of yards of open ground.

The defenders lost 50 people through the entire battle, and that number might include house elves and Centaurs. Three from the Order, two from the DA (or just one if you think Lavender made it). Going by how feared Voldemort is, that is the Death toll you expect from his opening salvo. Not the entire battle. Therefore I would not consider his actual impact that great. Moral certainly, but he wasn't just tearing through the defenders like an armoured battalion would through cavemen.

People when they think Dramione, I'd bet that most of them think of Emma and Tom, which is one of the reasons why it's popular -- they seem to go together. I don't know if that would hold true if you switched out the actresses. Same with Harry and Hermione. I'm not sure about Romione, how it would affect people's views of that ship.

There is also the optics of the actress to consider. Emma is, by anyone's standards, a beautiful woman. If she were replaced by an equally beautiful black woman, the ships might not change at all except for those whom race matters more than beauty.

Yeah, yeah.

But I think we can accept calling dark-brown-skinned people "black" and light-pink-skinned people "white", by the same "eh, close enough" metric that one can call orange-haired people "red-headed".

A lot of people being wrong together does not make them right. This is precisely the same reasoning for calling Native Americans "Indians" (/everyone/ called them that, and, not knowing any better, most of the 'Indians' who spoke English accepted it as the English name for themselves), but at some point since then, we grew up and realized it was stupid (and vaguely insulting) to keep calling them that obviously inaccurate name, and so we managed to normalize "Native American" as the alternative.

I said that I can accept use of "white" and "black" as terms about skin color --- skin color is an actual, objective physical trait that you may want to use when describing somone --- replacing the more accurate "light pink" and "dark brown". I do not, however, condone use of the terms in a "racial" context --- "blackness" or "whiteness" in my conception is purely a matter of physical appearance, not ancestry. Ethnicity is a thing, but ethnicities are a lot more numerous and complex than "white", "black" and "Asian", for which reason this classification is a purely artificial construct. And since having the "race" construct has historically led to racist thinking and policy, we should steer clear of it.

It also would explain why Hermione is such a bossy outspoken know-it-all who must succeed in every avenue. If she felt she needed to prove herself or stand above the rest, especially as a black girl of wealthy middle class - and possibly migrant - parents, then she would bury herself in books and constantly word vomit knowledge and rules even when nobody asked for it.

Because they were raised on it, or decided to mostly conform (like Harry)? It's difficult to see a problem when society says it's fine and normal and you don't need to worry.

** Hermione's character is that of someone very privileged and, dare i say it, spoilt. and by changing her race I believe this would effect her character. Her character is that of a privileged, spoiled upper middle class white only child who is a know it all. Changing her race would change her experiences and thus effect her character,

*** ¨shrugs¨ I don't know. I could be overly optimistic about the level of racism in 1990's Great Britain, but if her parents are both higher-class and well-educated, wouldn't that be more than enough for her to grow up "spoiled"? Especially considering that she has very little social contact outside of her family prior to Hogwarts, as we know, so if any lingering prejudice is to be had on the streets, she would have little experience with it.

**** She could still be spoiled in terms of material things and her own importance, but there's this innocence about the wider world and a faith in authority figures that I don't think an intelligent young black girl would have. Being upper middle class isn't a perfect defense from racism and racism doesn't all happen on "the streets". Upper class enclaves can be hotbeds of racism too, racist laws and policies are written and lobbied by /people/ they don't just mysteriously appear. One particularly insidious experience with racism that many PoC encounter in their childhoods is that there are rules or authority figures that tilt circumstances against them. Hermione would have surely experienced this to some extent in school or in pubic spaces by the time she entered Hogwarts had she been black.

So black Hermione could still be: a bookworm, intelligent, strong willed, tactless, uncaring of her appearance, brave.

What black Hermione probably wouldn't be: blindly trusting of authority figures and teachers, a stickler for rules, the person that says "Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed, before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed --- or worse, expelled."

What black Hermione probably would be: more immediately understanding of Harry's conflicts with Professor Snape, less trusting of Mcgongagall and other teachers, much bigger reaction to house elf enslavement.

***** I think that's a valid thought but I know many upper class Black people who come from primarily Black cities, that don't have the same distrust for authority that you are ascribing to many other Black people.

If we assume black Hermione is from generational wealth and had a private school upbringing, then she could definitely have white Hermione tendencies.

****** There are primarily black cities in the UK? News to me. I assume you mean neighbourhoods or the UK equivalent?

Of course I discussed probabilities and not absolutes. I'm not saying every black/PoC child is a budding revolutionary, I'm just sharing from my own experiences. The reason why I think Hermione would be more likely than an average black child to be aware of racism at 11 is because of her canonical intelligence, she's a very special child nit even counting magic. But yes, she absolutely could be a sheltered princess.

** To be honest when I read the books growing up I honestly imagined Hermione as black never made a differnce to me untill the movies came out and I was like hey didnt see that coming but white washing wasnt on my radar because I was quite young reading and watching the films.
