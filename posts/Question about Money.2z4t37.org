I have noticed this trend in fanfictions, usually when Harry finds out he has money. The authors always have amounts like 400 knuts and 5,000 sickles in a bank account. Why is there anything more than 28 knuts ( 29 would be converted into a sickle) or more than 16 sickles (17 would be converted to a gallon)? It doesn't make sense to me.


** If you have 4 5€ notes in your pocket do they magically become a 20€ note? No , and while i understand that it is a magical bank i think that it's pretty normal to find lower cut currency in a vault. It's a VAULT for crying out loud.

** Well, it appears that Gringotts keeps customer assets as physical currency. If you deposit 1000 galleons, 1000 sickles, & 1000 knuts, that is precisely what you'll have in your vault when you next take a peek. Your deposit won't automagically turn into 1060 galleons, 14 sickles, & 14 knuts.

However, if I go down to my local Wells Fargo/Citi/Bank of America to open an account, and deposit 1000 * $20 bills, 1000 * $1 bills, and 1000 * nickels, and I later go to check my balance, I won't have those same assets. I will simply have an electronic account with the value of $21,050.00.

I think therein lies some of the discrepancy between what we read in HP and what we expect based on our own experiences.

*** Thank you, this is what I was trying to get at. When Harry goes to get money, it makes sense, as there are piles of knuts and sickles. But when he asks for a bank statement in many stories they list all the knuts, and not just the total balance, which didn't make sense to me.

** This irks me for a somewhat different reason. When Harry first sees his vauit in PS, we're clearly shown that there are more Knuts than Sickles than Galleons. Make Harry wealthy if you want to, but come on - if anything is in the millions (or shudder: billions), it really should be the Knuts. :P

Not really. It's all perfectly non-descriptive. It's heaps of one, columns of the other and mounds of the rest, but there's no scale. It's a lot of money of money for Harry -- certainly a lot more money than the Weasleys have in their vault -- but it is not A Lot of money. Stories that make Harry wealthy go down the well trod path of the heretofore unknown /Potter family vault/.

Money isn't that important in the books anyway -- apart from the fact that the Weasley family doesn't have very much. Really, the whole Knuts to Sickles to Galleons is just a gentle joke about the fact that British money used to be weird until the 60s or so.

**** Ah, fair play. Heaps seemed more plentiful than mounds to me for some reason - I'll just call it headcanon and leave it out, lol.

Agreed - money isn't very important in the books, but many fics make it so, and that's the point. Wizards and goblins (British ones, at least) don't seem to give a lick about the metric system.

**** It's not that unreasonable that he would be wealthy, since James/Lily didn't feel the need to work.

They had no way of knowing how long the war would go on, or how much worse things would get. They're parents, it would be pretty irresponsible of them to just hope things wrapped up before Harry's fifth birthday, or hope that when the bank account ran dry, James (much less Lily) would be able to waltz into the Ministry and put in an application.
