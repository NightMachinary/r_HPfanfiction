:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know this fic was written by mibamonster on ff.net but it seems to have been deleted. It was abou Lily and the Marauders finding a book full of (usually terrible) fan fiction about themselves and each chapter would be them reading a different one and reacting to it.

I was just wondering if anyone knew where to find it in full or any details on why it was deleted. There was also a fic that was included in the marauder's companion that was a separate fic outside of it written by the same author about Remus Lupin and an oc called Emma. I'm wondering if that still exists either.

It would be really sad not to be able to read it again because it was the only fanfic I was really invested in while growing up.
