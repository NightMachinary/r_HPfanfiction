A lot of people in this fandom don't like SI fics because of how bad they are.

What are some things you dislike about them? And how would you like them to be change?

Comment your thoughts and let's make this into a post Authors who want to write SI fics, can come and read through in order to improve their writing.


** The best SI fics I've read have a few things in common. - They tend to skip the ‘oh I'm meeting ROB' or ‘oh no I'm in the Potterverse time to panic' scene. Those scenes are boring and serves no purpose. - Definitely not first person POV. First person only works if you're introducing an unreliable narrator, and let's face it, no author wants to admit themselves as an unreliable narrator. - Tie-in to above point: it's entirely written from the perspective of other characters. I remember one example where the SI comes across as a sociopath to others, because they know the other characters aren't real, they're fictional. Why should they care about a fictional character's wellbeing? It was really fascinating.

There are other elements to them, but they tend to vary by genre, by tone, and setting. - If you're going for realism, then the SI will face a lot of struggle. Unless they also gain like a care package of memories to help them function, they'll have no idea of wizarding customs, locations, celebrities, anything that isn't explicit in canon. - The SI isn't going to be OP in the end. Sure, they'll be better at studying than actual Hogwarts students because they're kids, and the curriculum is designed to appeal to kids, but I sincerely doubt an SI could crack a mystery of Ancient Runes that wizards and witches over the course of centuries couldn't.

** 1) Give your character dimension.

Every human has negative characteristics but most SIs are godlike beings. My SI isn't a good duelist so she makes up for it with runes and rituals. In contrast, if yours is a good duelist, make them bad in charms or potions. It's just so unrealistic for someone to be good at everything. That's what Dumbledore and Voldemort are for.

Look at canon characters: Harry was sassy, brave, and loving but he also had a bad temper and was pretty oblivious. Voldemort was a super smart magical powerhouse but he was also a genocidal maniac. Snape was a fucking badass but he was also a total asshole. People are complicated. Characters should be too.

2) Don't drag the beginning out.

Most SIs I‘ve read start at birth and the authors burn themselves out by second year. It's tedious and tbh we really just want to read about how you're changing the plot, not what it was like to grow up. We already know what that's like. We want some action and romance and mystery in the Wizarding World. (or whatever it is you're writing about).

(In mine I had two chapters and a prologue giving a sort of overview of her first six years at Hogwarts and most of the comments were thanking me for it.)

3) CHANGE THE GODDAMN PLOT

What's the point of a SI if everything stays the same as canon? I might as well just read the series again! There's a Percy Weasley one shot where they drop out of sixth year, run away to do a horcrux hunt, and then straight up murder Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries.

4) You're an adult living with children.

Most SIs don't take that into consideration. Most SIs die as teens/adults and are reborn into the HP universe. No one hardly points out how awkward and terrible it would be to live with a bunch of third graders.

In addition to those living conditions, you've also got to blend in. You'll have to dumb down yourself down immensely. Think of writing styles. I legitimately know how a twelve year old writes essays.

** I'm not a great critic, but I can tell you what I've enjoyed previously in SIs. I really prefer when SIs distance themselves from canon groups, I dislike them inserting themselves into the golden trio or becoming the 5th marauder. This typically means a non-Gryffindor character.

I've also greatly enjoyed fics where adults get sucked into an adult. They still have to learn magic and pretend to be whoever they were. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/][Magical Me]] does this well. Reading about an adult interacting with adults can offer more choices and avoid some awkward situations.

Actually changing the plot is important even if that means anonymously notifying Dumbledore. However, unless it's pretty short new challenges need to pop up.

Something important to consider and that I don't see discussed often is what type of fan the SI is. Have they only read the books? Seen the movies? Do they remember literally everything that happened? Do they read a lot of fanfiction? How has that influenced them? Do they get confused between fanon and book and movie canon? I know I do sometimes.

Additionally, what do they feel their responsibility is (if at all)? Is just notifying someone of the Horcruxes enough or do they need to be personally involved in their destruction? Is stopping Voldemort enough or do they need to stop all the Death Eaters? What about after? Do they feel the need to free house elves and advocate for creature rights?

** I think there are three main problems:

1. SIs tend to know that they are in a story, or otherwise are genre savvy, which breaks the 4th wall and therefore ruins your immersion in the story along with the fictional world's sense of realism.

2. SIs tend to feel like intruders in the story, usurping positions of importance from the true main characters.

3. Things generally go far too easily for SIs.

So the key to writing a good SI fic is to write a character who belongs in the world, who doesn't feel like they're usurping the role of the main characters, and who faces genuine difficulties and conflicts.

Which is to say, the key to writing a good SI fic is not to write an SI fic.

*** I disagree. You can totally write an SI and have things go wrong. It's only a matter of creativity.

1) Voldemort figures out you're on a horcrux hunt and makes new ones or moves his old ones. You have to try to remember everything you know about him to figure out where it would go.

2) If the SI catches Pettigrew, will Voldy stick to his GoF plan? Will Barty still be Mad-Eye or is he hanging around with Voldemort instead?

3) Congratulations, you've got Umbridge fired! Now the Ministry brings in someone competent and everything is twice as hard.

Just because most SIs don't change the plot doesn't mean and SI can't change the plot.

** I think the best way to do it is if the SI is older and only has a very marginal knowledge of Harry Potter. It's the only way to avoid OP characters and also tackle psychological tension and questions that I feel a serious story featuring reincarnation should tackle.

Everyone in threads like this complains that SIs end up being OP mary-sues, but let's be real, if you are active enough on this sub to post/comment, an OP mary-sue is exactly what you would become if dropped into the Potterverse. We're really invested into this world here. I lost counts of how many threads I saw ripping into how unrealistic it is for kids being so blase about magic and it's capabilities. I lost count of how many threads I saw detailing how complete world domination could be achieved with even the most basic knowledge of magic. I lost count of how many threads I saw of people complaining about certain issues in the WW that could be easily fixed with just a shred of common sense. And I lost count of how many threads I saw asking 'if you could do one spell, which would it be' and the answer be the Imperius Curse, which I would also pick, actually. Most of us wouldn't just dedicate a great deal of time to learning magic, but wouldn't shy away one bit from whatever ritual we'd find to shortcut our way into even more power, or use the Imperius to ensure financial stability. I'm sure most of us would begin our magical training pretty much instantly once realizing where we are. Occlumency, Legilimency and wandless magic would be the daily bread and butter, and then 'discover' the wizarding world asap and begin buying books and learn them like a maniac.

No matter how much people complain against OP SIs, I have no doubt that most users on this subreddit would be able to graduate Hogwarts by the time they get their letter, if they appeared in the universe as a toddler.

An interesting twist would be if you bail out of the country as soon as possible and go to a different school. I would like that because even though the SI would still be incredibly OP compared to their peers, and soon enough even teachers, but the novelty of a new school and magical country/culture would still keep them on their toes.

​

Edit: Another interesting twist is if you are born into a magical family from canon. Maybe Draco had a twin that died at birth, and for whatever reason you are flung into it's corpse and take it's place. This will add a lot of tension and decisions you literally can't shy away from and detract from the fact that you are a mini Dumbledore before even taking your OWLs.

** I have one single advice I haven't seen here: MAKE YOUR SIs APPEAR IN DIFFERENT ERAS THAN THE BOOKS AND THE MARAUDERS! Make them school friends with Dumbledore and change history, make them someone who goes at Hogwarts pre WW1 or 2. I want to see the OT be massacred at the end of the fic. Pwease!
