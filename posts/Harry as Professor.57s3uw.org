Stories that have Harry end up being a professor and living that life for all it entails. Hogwarts, Durmstrang, wherever. I'm not looking for genius teenage Harry teaches his peers, but more of a realistic story of an adult Harry who after/during/before the war decides to teach.


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12121323/1/Put-Your-Curse-in-Reverse]]) is Cursed Child canon compliant where he becomes a professor somewhere halfway through. It's a sort-of sequel to another story of hers though (which is also good).

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there. (Sequel, switches POVs)

  Harry is Teddy's adoptive father. What will happen when Harry follows Teddy to Hogwarts 10 years after the war to become the new Defense professor, while Snape has returned as Potions Master? With Neville, Luna (married) and Charlie on staff as well, it is bound to be an interesting time. Eventual Snarry but very slow build.
