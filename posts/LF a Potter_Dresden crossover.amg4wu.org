I don't recall the name of this but it was a really fantastic read. The author dropped it for a long time and I want to see if they picked it back up.

Story was Harry Dresden (of Jim Butcher's universe) is tapped to teach DADA and brings Molly with him. Molly gets sorted into Slytherin and gets made fun of for how she makes potions. Harry nukes Fenrir Greyback.


** I'm a giant Dresden fan, and I have a bit of a crossover addiction. I'm 90% sure you're looking for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3758850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-White-Wizard][Harry Potter and the White Wizard]]

The Greyback fight is chapter 11

*** YESSSSS, and it looks like there is new material!

This is one of the best-written fanfics I've ever found. It actually reads like a Potter story, and Dresden is portrayed like he should be.

Any other recommendations for Dresden/Whoever crossovers? I need more Dresden since god only knows when Peace Talks is gonna drop.

**** You mean any Dresden crossover, right? My favorite Dresden fic is a crossover with GOT, A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault by Puzzled linkao3(7551730). It's a fantastic fic in which Harry and Maggie are stranded on Planetos and *things* spiral out of control and soon he's known across the world as the Wizard of Braavos...

****** You should also check out Todeswind's fics if you haven't already. They are top notch action/adventure with patented Dresden chaos. Crossover with Stargate

The first is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8005922/1/God-s-Eye][God's Eye by Todeswind]] with alternate POVs in fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11445721/1/Shattering-Occam-s-Razor][Shattering Occam's Razor]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12695952/1/Visions-of-the-Pantheon][Visions of the Pantheon]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12822232/1/Endless-Pantheon-Letters-from-Home][Endless Pantheon: Letters from Home]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/endless-pantheon-manifest-disaster-stargate-dresden-files.648080/][Endless Pantheon: Manifest Disaster]] and sequel [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dresden-files-sg-1-endless-pantheon-gods-eye.232344/][God's Blood By Todeswind]] linkffn(8005922,11445721,12695952,12822232). The are on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and spacebattles (which get updated much sooner).

I also serious love [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/percy-jackson-the-dresden-files-ceaseless-flow.407257/][Ceaseless Flow by Ryuugi]] which is a Dresden/Percy Jackson cross. Percy's the main character though, but I love his Dresden verse worldbuilding. Ryuugi has some other Dresden crossovers you might also like. Just check their spacebattles fics.

**** Best Dresden crossover imo is the one by todeswind, the endless pantheon, starting with God's Blood. Sg-1 crossover, but done almost seemlessly.

Unfortunately, not really. The spreqd isn't nearly as wide as with Potter. White Wizard is one of three Dresden fanfics I can say I enjoyed.

The others being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5430338/1/Broken-Mirror][broken mirror]], a part of a larger series. The first story has Jade court vampire antagonists, and they are terrifying

and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7258374/1/Fair-Vote][Fair Vote]] which you may have read already. I read it ages ago, so the details are pretty vague for me. I remember it being very well written and the protagonist was suitably outclassed by the villains but it did get pretty /weird/ near the end.

***** Good news, Butcher is up to chapter 43 of Peace Talks according to his website. Bad news, after he finishes it he's doing his steampunk series' next book instead of another Dresden Files.

With 15 books already in the series I trust him a lot more than GRRM or Patrick Rothfuss. He's gonna do it. Like, I know it's been four years since the last book, but in that time he's published the first book of that new series, gotten divorced and dated and gotten married to someone new, and dealt with having a house built, so I totally cut him some slack, he's earned it.

I don't worry about that so much. Don't quote me on this, but I /believe/ that when Butcher was writing Codex Alera, his word output for Dresden Files didn't slow down significantly.

I think he works mostly in bursts. Some days he might only get a few hours where his fingers touch a keyboard, other days he will be holed up in his office, forgetting to eat, missing sleep, annoying his wife but getting hella work done.

  She was a Prodigy unlike any other, the top of her class, the best of the best. Now, she is but a remnant of her former self. Pyrrha Nikos, Huntress and friend, was thought dead. But she lives in a new strange world without Grimm, without Huntresses. She is lost and alone, save for one ally. Harry Dresden, Chicago PI and Professional Wizard, is more than happy to help Pyrrha home.

** linkffn(Lost Soul by Perspicacity). Says it's complete, but feels more like a start to me.

linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005). Didn't grab me, but YMMV.
