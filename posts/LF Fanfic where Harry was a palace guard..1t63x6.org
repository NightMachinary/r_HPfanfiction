It was set in the regular day and age. Harry and a couple other Order members where to guard the Queen of England. I'm pretty sure I saw it on FF.net, but can't find it for the life of me.

Also, if there are any other fics out there where Harry is a placed to guard someone important, I would like to read those too.
