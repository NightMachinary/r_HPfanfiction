I was going through threads about outdated stories and everyone talks about how ideas like super extreme bashing, Edgy!Independent!Harry humiliating everyone, stories built around bashing 'The Order of the Flaming Chicken led by Dumb-ol-dork' used to be big a few years ago but have (thankfully) been bashed themselves now by the community.

This made me think: what are the dominant trends/ideas you've noticed in recent stories? Take recent to mean whatever you want. Which of these do you think might end up looking like horrible clichés of their own in the future?


** Ron seems to be getting some rehabilitations these days.

Daphne is still increasing in popularity.

There are some decent new Voldemort centric fics.

Several popular H/G authors are returning to the fandom after hiatus.

If this is still the case, I don't know for how long this will continue. Already, I think there may be grounds to argue that a "Susan boom" could happen in the next few years. And I for one would support that shift, lol.

Not exactly a recent trend, but a lot of next-gen stories make up some new antagonist which basically implies that Harry's generation failed to build a lasting peace and basically created the magical equivalent of the Versailles situation (which canon actually appears to be because there is little mention of a proper clean-up after the war) or repeated Chamberlain's and Dumbledore's mistake of trying appeasement.

I mean, I can see Harry saying "fuck it, I did my part. I died for you lot!", but only if the next decision is to abandon Britain altogether with his entire family.

And since this is not a case, it ends up bashing the adults to create a plot for the children. But unlike Fudge, Dumbledore and Crouch, we were rooting for Harry, Hermione and the Order. And their failure means that the characters we like fucked up big time.

** Oh boy, I have [[https://i.imgur.com/2xMtG9x.jpg][bingo card]] just for you.

- In recent ages, I've noticed less Weasley bashing, or maybe I'm just not bothering to open them up if I see "bashing" mentioned in the summary. Ron seems to be getting fairer treatment instead of a lazy, selfish, sabotaging glutton he often gets characterized as, to make Harry fall into the arms of other characters like Daphne or Susan. Molly Weasley still isn't treated with as much sympathy, though.

- Harry has a more diverse range of love interests these days, not just your standard Hermione vs. Daphne vs. Luna. Katie Bell, Romilda, and Cedric have all become popular options.

- "Problematic" shipping for Harry/Voldemort and Harry/Tom Riddle have also taken off. I guess the people writing them don't bother try to hide them or stay in their niche these days, as it's become more popular enough that authors don't try to "excuse" themselves or justify their ship to other people who think it's wrong or gross. At least this means that there's been a spin-off effect of well-written Voldemort/Tom characters in fic, who aren't just one-note villains. I love me some fics that explore Voldy's delusional mindset or Tom's troubled pre-Hogwarts days when he thought he was "Special".

- "Intelligent" Harry stories have moved away from the Lecturing Harry cringefest of HPMOR where an 11 year old tries to educate adult teachers. Newer ones often have a more fallible, balanced characterization where Harry is observant, sharp, and often too sassy-mouthed for his own good, but don't make him an OP power wank. And I also think there have been more stories written from other characters' PoV, or making minor characters major players instead of the standard golden trio, and giving them intelligent characterization too. I've been finding and reading more fics with Hermione and Ron as an MC these days as a result.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

**** Disclaimer: I find the best Voldemorts with depth, nuance, and three-dimensionality are written by authors who also write ship fics. They usually handle characters better than writers of action fics... so reader discretion advised.

linkffn(8988616) Voldemort's PoV is so weird and delusional he straight up feels like an extra-terrestrial (which matches his looks). The prose and worldbuilding are very good.

linkffn(11261838) Intellectual Diarymort. This author writes pretty good Tom Riddle, and while they work his arrogance, superiority, and lack of empathy into the story, they never fully commit with a no-holds full-on villain Voldemort.

linkffn(7932144) Kidnapper Diarymort. An older but still good Tom fic. I really love Diary AU point of divergences, as 16 y.o. Tom is still reasonable without being NYAAAH Voldemort, and 12 y.o. Harry is still malleable/naive enough to be converted into the dark side while not knowing any better. However, once Sirius and Cedric die, he's already grown up and turns into an angsty mess.

linkao3(15873207) Ruthless and dark Diarymort. This author writes a good unhinged Tom, who is willing to do nearly anything to get his way. Voldy is the guy who rebirthed himself in a soup made of his dad's bones. This Tom is pretty similar. Underrated, really gives off the vibes of "Solace in Shadows".

linkffn(12406174) Tom raises baby Harry fic. Lighter and softer than the others, but I like it because even a father figure Tom is mean and callous and hates children.

  In recent ages, I've noticed less Weasley bashing, or maybe I'm just not bothering to open them up if I see "bashing"
#+end_quote

This mostly. There are way too many bashing fics and increasing. I just don't bother reading them and if it is not said explicitly but its still there i drop the fic. Same for mary sues, unless they are Humor genre.

** Maybe I've been subconsciously leaning towards them or something, but I've noticed a lot more gritty, dark, scary, or super sad fics (or combinations of the above) this last year than I remember being a thing. Yes, there's always been some graphic M rated fics, but those are usually for gore, language, or rape - not (non-sexual abuse) emotional devastation, unnerving subtle horror, etc.

Also, the fics in the scary, depressing, etc category are becoming longer and much more well written lately. I'm loving that more of these are popping up, but again, it could just be me finding ONE and subconsciously going after more. I also think those kinds of things will age pretty well, because there's no risk of them becoming SO popular that everyone starts doing stuff like that all the time to the point of cliché.

**** Have any recommendations?

Awhile back I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds The Image]] by RubbishRobots, and really enjoyed it. I know pretty much NOTHING about Dr. Who (it's a crossover), but the way it was written didn't seem to make it necessary to know much. I really loved the way the author wrote about Harry's fear and reactions to the Weeping Angel, and the whole story had a very creepy crawly anxious feel to it.

Some other good ones are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13113518/1/The-Room-of-Lost-Things][The Room of Lost Things]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13154319/1/The-Room-of-Forgotten-Things][The Room of Forgotten Things]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13051321/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Shadowed-Patronus][Harry Potter and the Shadowed Patronus]], all by deadwoodpecker - those are mostly 'eerie' and 'hopeless' compared to outright creepy or scary. Both 'Room of's are pretty dark, as well.

Then there's [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/11851.html][Wake the Dead]] by Syn - hopeless, creepy, bleak.

I'm always looking for more, though!

***** The one that I've been following most recently is the Freedom Series by Sensiblytainted on AO3, but I can't link to it because it violates rule 5.

It is such an in depth and well written series. It really draws you in and captures your attention.

The first work is done and the second is in progress, but the updates are quite regular.

Also, please, please, please read the tags if you check it out.

Edit: Thank you for your recommendations! I'll definitely look at them!

** It's always been a trend to portray Sirius and James as idiots who are impressed by someone casting 'wingardium leviosa' and can't solve a simple question so Remus solves their homework for them. There are exceptions of course. I don't even know where it comes from, McGonagall calls them 'exceptionally bright'.

It doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon though.

*** Not really a recent trend or cliche, though, just an occasional trope that pops up every once in a while. Definitely an unfair characterization of them from what we've seen. And in something like Yesterday is Tomorrow by Kneazle is a fun read, even though the core conceit is that James needs some extra tutoring.

**** It's always been there, always. I haven't actually witnessed a time period where people defended them as they're now thankfully defending Ron. And if you keep up with tumblr it's as strong as ever, even stronger now than before.

Also a huge part of it is young author's need in Lily-centric fanfiction to bring attention them down to show how awesome she is, not by having her do extraordinary stuff, but by bringing them down.

That's not how it's done

** Hermione bashing seems to be on the rise during the latter part of the 2010s, as a reaction and 'corrective' to the endless bashing of Ginny and Ron during circa 2004-2014. It reflects a general trend in fandom itself during the past few years, people are more willing to defend Ron and criticize Hermione.

** draco and draco/harry continue to be very popular

tom riddle and tom/harry fics. are also very popular

snape hate and snape bashing are increasingly prominent in fandom spaces, and writing and characterisations of snape become increasingly less nuanced and interesting

though, snamione and snarry continue to trudge on. i think snape/hermione is more popular than snape/harry now where it wasn't before. of course, snarry continues to be propped up with significant contribution by debtheslytherinsnapefan, like atlas holding up the sky

While I feel the first part of this might be true (though, that may be because I participate in a greater range of forums than I used to) I don't think the writing of Snape is suffering. If anything the opposite is true with those of us who write him taking greater care to show the striations of his character.
