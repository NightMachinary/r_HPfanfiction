What the title says. Looking for Harry using different magic then cannon and most fics.

So instead of him almost always using DADA, like books and movies, he instead uses other magics.

Maybe he is Gifted At Potions. Or a Runes Prodigy. Or a Charms Master. Etc etc etc


** FlameThrower and their stories on Ao3.

Of a Linear Circle is a monster story (11 books and counting) but it has elemental magicians, magical masteries, secret organisations, family forrest's, fucking everything. Harry becomes a master in blood magic and metamorphmagi and there's masteries in potions and just jesus christ there's so much amazing amazing plot and magic and history and eugh it's completely incredible.

Swung by Serafim has Harry being brilliant at Potions too.

** There's this fic where Harry is a runes prodigy and later pretends to be Death. I think. It's been a long time since I read it, but try it. I'm pretty sure it's a good read, I don't tend to remember the ones who aren't.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** This one is still magic but it's approached in a different way with a really interesting take on the theory behind how magic works. It's a long one and I really enjoyed reading it. Linkffn(10136172)

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.
