Harry is secretly a dark lord but he rules from the shadows and everyone sees him as a light lord. He wants to reunite the purebloods against their common foe the muggles of the world. He thinks that he can do it best by keeping his dark side a secret from the light and convincing the world that he is a hero. He recruits Luna, Fleur and Bellatrix (As his spy against Voldy). I guess this can also be a writing prompt if anyone is inspired.
