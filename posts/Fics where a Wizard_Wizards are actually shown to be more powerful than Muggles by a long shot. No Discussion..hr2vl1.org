As in they have wards that can withstand Nukes, and the ability to erase whole cities off the map with ease. I remember Voldemort was able to destroy several villages. I want more of that. Not fics where a Muggle firearm can penetrate a Protego(I hate how much i've seen that). Hell, Wizards even have their own magical version of Nukes(Fiendfyre?). So I want a story where the Wizards are shown to be leagues above Muggles. "Wait, it takes you guys hours to just get to 'blank,' why not just Apperate there?" Stuff like that.

Also i'm not asking for a discussion thread here. If you wish to discuss this stuff, create a post. I'm actually looking for stories, not debates.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** I really like the exploration of both sides in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/Saviour-of-Magic]])

Edit: I forgot to note that it's quite some time since I've read this and - especially the start of the story - doesn't get into muggle vs magical that much, but if you bear with the story it will have a very thorough comparison!

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

Ginny... I personally don't like her as a character, but she was pretty close to canon. She has to be attached to her boyfriend 24/7, gets angry, throws ultimatums when she doesn't get her way, and fights for what she wants. When you look at it from another angle, it doesn't look pretty.

****** Mmm. Her casting bat bogey at Malfoy two minutes after getting on the train for the first time was not canon, nor is her yelling and swearing at Hermione. Which also happened on the train before she stepped foot into the school. The kid was shy AF in canon at first and wouldn't talk around Harry let alone get into a screaming match with Hermione the second time she was around him.

Honestly, turning character flaws up to eleven and then focusing on those is a form of bashing. I agree with you about her as I'm not a fan either (which is probably why I found it so funny) but you have to admit that she was essentially a caricature of the love-potion-Ginny trope.

** Alright, so this fic holds a special place in my heart. It's one of the worst fics I've ever, /ever/ read in my close to 20 years of reading fanfiction, but I always reccommend it whenever magic>>>muggles comes up. It has some insanely well written magic technology. When Harry meets Tony Stark, they literally dominate every single one of the MCU world's markets simply because Harry is the only source of magic, and Tony has the brains to come up with stuff that people want.

linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe)

Read at your own risk. Every single plotline falls flat at the end, the Harry is the embodiment of everything that's wrong with the "Good Guy Harry" trope and they actually managed to turn the Black fucking Widow into a 2-dimensional indy!Harry Daphne Greengrass.

*** Oh, I know /one/ fic worse than this one that isn't a dedicated badfic like /my immortal/ or /MOR/.

It's about a Harry that falls through the Veil, which turns out to be a Stargate that is locked to another, abandoned planet.

Sounds neat, right? Harry in space, surviving amongst the ruins of an alien world. Would be a great fic.

However, the entire 'other planet' thing lasts about half a chapter, and is for some reason used to power him up by having him fight against a bunch of Jaffa who he absolutely annihilates. When he finally returns (I forgot how, but it was a massive asspull) he turns the indy!harryness to eleven, returns to England which has basically not changed at all. He goes to Gringotts and gets his BloodTest™. After which he finds out he is Lord Potter™, Lord Black™ and Lord Peverell™. He, naturally, combines three Lordships into one, calling himself "Lord Potter-Black-Peverell".

But wait, there's more! He then insists that all who see him call him by this /ridiculous/ moniker, including Hermione, who fled to america when Harry "died". For some reason. And he didn't tell her he was back. So when he contacts her and says "oh btw I've been back for like 3 months" and she understandably is pissed that he didn't so much as say literally anything, he /threatens/ her for using his first name and not his moniker. He says something along the lines of "I have enough political power to make sure you're never hired by anyone, ever. I'll force you to live in poverty".

But wait, there's /more!/ Luna, of course, is a Seer™, who conveniently becomes cool and hot and not at all completely insane, and is then used to tie up the Stargate plotline in its entirety by handwaving it away using that canon's events.

It might've been the worst fic I have ever had the displeasure of reading.
