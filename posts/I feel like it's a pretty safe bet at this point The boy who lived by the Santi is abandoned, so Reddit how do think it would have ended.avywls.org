** I would guess based on the summary that he winds up going dark, but mostly to impress/fit in with Calypso. Story was showing some signs of that. Seems unlikely that he would've joined Voldie or anything, but there was definitely potential there for him to do some messed up things (especially if Calypso was coerced, harmed, or forced him into it).

*** Yeah, he was definitely leaning toward dark toward the end so I don't see that being an impossibility. I can't really see him joining Voldie tbh he loves his brother/family far too much to do that but him being a third faction wouldn't have seemed so unlikely considering he might have been shunned away if his parents found about his wealth of dark arts knowledge.

** during a postgraduate trip to the tropics in search of ancient tribal magics, harry and calypso have a fun stay at a touristy muggle beach resort. its the catalyst for them to slowly start to realize that their childhoods and perspectives are kind of fucked up and weird. they settle down and have a couple kids and chill the fuck out.

** One bit of speculation I've read is that that fumbled curse Calypso accidentally took for Harry early on had rendered her barren (which is why her father had cancelled some betrothals etc., even before they became a couple); and that Harry would set out to cure that and end up delving too deeply into Dark magic.

Sounds kind of misogynistic, now that I write it out---as if Calypso's value is in her ability to bear children---but who knows?

*** Yes, evolutionarily speaking, a woman's primary value is in her ability to bear children. Biology is misogynistic, which is why that reality is reflected in societal values and norms. Men are less valuable and are more expendable precisely because of these reasons, so biology is also misandric. There's an evolutionary reason for sexual dimorphism and for the expression of different roles for the sexes within society.

That aside, I see no reason what's wrong with the goal of restoring your wife's fertility.

**** Yes, we all know the facts of life.

Author's (hypothetical) choice to write the story around that is still the author's choice and something we can criticise. For that matter, this was a speculation I read years ago in a venue I no longer remember, so it probably says as much about the speculator (and about me, for remembering and repeating it) as about the author. What it says, I don't know.

** The story is listed as Adventure, not Drama or Tragedy or something like that, so I think in the end Harry was going to be a dark wizard, not a *Dark* wizard. Also because I prefer it that way - very few fics end with a happy Potter family.

The problem of secrecy with his parents and Nathan's suspicions about him would develop to very serious levels as Harry learns more and more dark magic, gets more involved with Calypso, and becomes more closed mouthed. There would be some pivotal point where he realizes that he has crossed a line, or that he's about to, and he sort of rethinks what he's willing to do. He realizes that his family wasn't entirely wrong to be concerned, even if they are a bit ignorant and biased.

I would expect at least one good scene where Harry (possibly with Calypso, /maybe/ even Krum but maybe not) barges in to save the day, leaving everyone gaping at his sheer magical prowess. Not before he's 17 at the least though. All this hyping up his prodigal skills has to pay off beyond academic achievement.

I don't see him actually straight up dueling Voldemort to win, not sure how that'll really be dealt with. I also have no idea what the details of his future with Calypso would be. I actually kind of hoped that in the end she'd be villain and Harry has to turn on her to save someone or something. I doubt that's truly where that was going though. Maybe it was going to be a bit of the reverse - Calypso joins fully with Harry and they deal with her father.

I think Harry's descent into the Dark Side and his redemption would be the main conflict and climax of the story, with Voldemort mostly being dealt with off screen just like the rest of the canon plot has been so far. I expect Harry would play a pivotal role, but a different role. Maybe he's the one who hunts down the remaining horcruxes and gets his hands awfully dirty dealing with Death Eaters along the way. If he has to deal with evil Calypso that would be something that his parents would probably sympathize with, traitorous close friends and all that, even if they know he shouldn't have gotten involved with her at all.

In the end the Potters are a happy family and Harry has some complicated and mixed feelings about Durmstrang. Nathan goes on to play professional quidditch and Harry gets something of an apprenticeship with Dumbledore.

Edit: I just found out there's 5 more chapters on DLP. Predictions may be subject to change.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
