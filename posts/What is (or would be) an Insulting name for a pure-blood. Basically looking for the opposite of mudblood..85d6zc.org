Looking to use the word for a scene I am writing. What would be a good word? Pure Filth? Pure Trash? Let me know your opinions. Thanks!

********* Really? Because I remember most if not all the Quidditch team, minus Harry, becoming very upset by it. Alicia Spinnet reacted almost as strongly as Ron, and she barely knew Hermione. James and Sirius got quite mad, too, during Snapes worst memory. So while I'm guessing you meant Ron, there's actually a few purebloods who got angry.

I seem to recall Lily also becoming quite upset by it. Dumbledore told Malfoy off. Snape forbade Phineas Nigellus from using it. Harry, ditto with Kreacher. All halfbloods or Muggleborn.

********* It should be but it established itself from the same source as the other two terms in the trifecta and in direct opposition to a very unwieldy term. Additionally it builds on its directly opposition in visual imagery as well as social group to 'pureblood'. Therefore it gets away with it. Your term doesn't.

********** When ever I get into an argument and it devolves into name calling I tend to use insults back of the same kind but try to up the "intensity". I am not saying your wrong just pointing out its on purpose because I always thought of it as a response to mudblood being used. Like malfoy calls someone a "filthy mudblood" and they say he "is full of rotten, old, staleblood from his inbred ancestors" and then coin the term. It's intentionally derivative.
