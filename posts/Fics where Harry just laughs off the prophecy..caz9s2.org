Even if he does go into battle against Voldemort and the DEs, I just want fics where he thinks the prophecy and Divination as a whole is stupid and he lashes out against anyone railroading his life because of it.


** So...out of curiosity, would you prefer fics with "It is written, only Harry Potter can defeat Voldemort" Fanon!Dumbledore, or "Forget the prophecy, the prophecy is bupkis" Canon!Dumbledore?

I've seen a lot of the former, but I don't think I've ever seen the latter in a fanfic...

*** It's kind of amazing how the whole discussion in HBP is ignored. And, I think, it has to be the former bc the only person Harry has to lash out against with the latter is Voldemort himself.

**** Because Dumbledore's words and actions don't match up. He might have proclaimed 'the prophecy is stupid' but he still set up everything for Harry to fulfill it. It was probably just a fail-safe in case the prophecy /was/ true, but in order for that to happen, he'd have to believe it was possible.

***** There's more to the convo than Dumbledore calling the prophecy stupid.

  "Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!"

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it. "

  "Of course you would!" cried Dumbledore. "You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you. . . which makes it certain, really, that --"

  "That one of us is going to end up killing the other," said Harry.

  "Yes. "

Words match up just fine to me.
