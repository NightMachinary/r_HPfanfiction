Also, imagine harry striding through school with a nundu cloak, six inch lucite platforms, a pimp cane, his fingers bejeweled with rings, a violet wide brim hat trimmed with nundu fur.

Followup question: i know there's one story where harry acts like a pimp with hermione being some sort of size queen. Any other pimp!harry stories out there? Not really something i'd usually read but mental image is compelling atm.

**** Do we know that for a fact? I don't see why it would take 100 wizards purely because of its breath. If it didn't have thick magic resistant skin, one hidden wizard with a surprise stunner could do the job, no? It takes 6+ wizards to deal with a /dragon./ I don't believe it takes 100 wizards to deal with a nundu purely because it's big and can breathe something that can kill you.

***** Eldon Elsrickle was a Wizarding thief who kept a Nundu to guard his house. He stunned it when he arrived and revived it when he left. Until he forgot to stun it one day and got eaten.

This is from the Wonderbook game where the history bits like above where written by JK Rowling.

Newt Scamander in the Fantastic Beasts movies also has a nundu which he can presumably keep under control. Which is even more bizarre when you consider he was the one who wrote the "100 Wizards" statement.

I think this is best explained by JK Rowling's lack of consistency. But "Nundu's are incredibly dangerous on the offence but have no magical defence" seems a reasonable in world explanation.

"It's a nundu-hide cloak, for your information. Some of the strongest protective wear in the world."

"Yes, but...it's a fursuit."

"Well, it wouldn't be very good if it left parts of my body exposed, would it?"

"Harry, it has a /tail/. And for that matter, paws and a head."

"I will admit that some liberties were taken during the creation process for the purpose of aesthetics."

"Harry, when your archnemesis comes along and sees you in this...'nundu-hide cloak', what do you think he's going to say?"

"Who, Voldemort? He can't talk, last I saw he had a whole set of Hungarian Horntail hide! Wings and tail and horns and everything!"

** Nundu's are probably the most overrated creatures out there. They might have a "disease-ridden breath that can wipe out entire villages" but we have airtight suits since the sixties so I don't see the problem with hunting them. They might be difficult to subdue but if you just want to kill it grab a Level A/Class 1 hazmat suit and an anti-material rifle.

**** No, that's the entire point of this comment. Sometimes magic is not the right tool for the job. A bubblehead charm would be pretty useless since it does only cover your head (and I would not bet my life on it being airtight) and they seem to resist subduing magic pretty well.

**** A SAM would have problems locking onto a dragon. The IR ones need a heat source and the radar ones have a minimum altitude (and tend to filter out slow-moving targets). Not that a regular AA gun wouldn't do the trick, but a SAM would have serious issues.

****** But is the dragon's heat source visible from the outside? Their fire is certainly hot enough but could you lock onto it when its jaw is closed?

Most radar-based SAMs have a minimum altitude below which they cannot lock onto targets. Depending on the system it is somewhere between 50 and 500 meters so a dragon could stay below that altitude and be safe.
