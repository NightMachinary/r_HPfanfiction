I've made a "request" for any fanfics regarding this pair, I've gotten some, and good ones at that, but not many. Soooooo... any good fanfics with Harry/Cho? (I've read the autumn swan, and its reboot)


** Autumn swan? Any pointers? And just finished linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gang of Giggling Girls by Glee-chan), which is actually much better than the initial impression (and unfortunate title) suggests, and it is in the end Harry/Cho.

*** Autumn swan, the original is good, but falls off, I read it when he was already abandon, but from the reviews, the author took a 4 year break, rebooted it, but lost interest and abandon it as well.

  Suppose Cho said yes to Harry asking her to the Yule Ball. What kind of relationship could they have developed? HPCC AU Reboot to "Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan."

**** Has the author confirmed he abandoned the reboot? Last update was in 2019. I also PM'ed the author for a definite answer but haven't heard back yet.
