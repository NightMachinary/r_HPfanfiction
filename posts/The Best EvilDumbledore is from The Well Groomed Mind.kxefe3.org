The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali(FFN) isn't a perfect story, and that's worsened by the fact that it isn't finished, but I think it's the best story with an evil Dumbledore. Obviously my personal preference.

Basic overview, Harry breaks the mental conditioning laid on him by Dumbledore after his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire.

Why do I think it's awesome? We don't know Dumbledore's motives. We know his actions, but we can only speculate as to his motivations. Dumbledore becomes fucking terrifying by the third task. No Lordships. There are consequences for everything. Harry can't just tell off Dumbledore and Dumbledore will lose.

Harry is a fourteen-year-old. A clever fourteen-year-old, but he can't duel Voldemort or anything without dumb luck and plot armor. The story follows him, so if you haven't read I won't say more than that. Hermione has flaws, and so does Ron. The story follows how the change in Harry changes his relationships with them, instead of revealing that they're evil or whatever else bashing fics like. A lot of the story is devoted to Harry trying to find his own identity, made a bit more literal by the fact that he had his mind modified.

Additionally, they build out the effects of the abuse from the Dursleys, without just using a single potion to fix it all. This might be a personal preference, but the Dursleys don't go with the three Bs*, which is so much better. It expands the effect that the canon story would have had on Harry, with different issues that occur from malnutrition. Malnutrition is a cause, rather than an effect, in medicine and I love that the story explores that.

There is a lot of worldbuilding, but it's all built on the framework of the canon. We see more of the story of Tom Riddle, the story of the generation before Harry, and Barty Crouch Jr.. Tom Riddle isn't the good guy either, even though he's very present.

*Bat, Belt, and Buggery. Referring to stories where they make the Dursleys psychotics. I dislike those because I find criminal negligence to be horrible enough, and I think that trying to make them more horrific implies that neglect isn't abuse.


** I think the best way of writing an evil or manipulative Dumbledore is by leaving his motivations, thoughts and future plans a mystery for the reader, and instead leave clues throughout the story and make him somewhat of a background character, but still one that influences things.

It's not really fun when you have half a chapter dedicated Dumbledore, explaining why he is doing something and what he is planning to do with Harry in the next chapter...

As for the story you talked about, i literally cannot stand fanfics where Harry is written from a 1st person perspective...

*** I think it's worth it. I personally prefer third person though.

** I second your rec. This is probably my favourite version of Barty Crouch Jr. and I can still remember the horror I felt as Harry began to understand what had been done to him.

** Isn't this the author who wrote a [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8647909/1/Shattered-Fairy-Tale][oneshot claiming that Dumbledore (a teacher with no authority in the muggle world) not stepping in when he sees evidence of an unhappy (not abusive or neglectful, but certainly loveless and generally colourless) childhood makes him responsible for Voldemort's actions (which include the attempted murder of an infant, mass murder, and genocide)?]] No offense, but I find it /very/ difficult to believe that she (I'm assuming "she" based on the username) wrote Dumbledore as a remotely compelling villain, given that context.

**** I did read a bit of it back when I was first getting into fanfiction, but I dropped it once it became clear that Dumbledore was /the/ antagonist, not /an/ antagonist. Having the Death Eaters be the heroes is and will always be a deal breaker for me.
