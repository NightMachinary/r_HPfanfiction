** So instead of running from a group of bullies that are significantly bigger than him he instead decides to fight all of them? And that's supposed to turn out good?

*** The OP doesn't state that is has to "turn out good." He just asks for fighting back. I could easily imagine this being a compelling bit of writing - Harry tries to fight back, awkwardly punching, and starts getting stomped hard. But even "stomped hard" is in the context of like eight year-olds, so all Harry is getting is some really bad bruises and scrapes.

Eventually Harry has had enough of their shit and goes completely fucking berserk - fists flying everywhere, but more importantly biting the shit out of whatever he can get his mouth on. A child's arms/fists may not be very strong, but the human jaw is a scary thing.

So maybe things escalate to the point where both Harry and Dudley end up hospitalized, and Dudley has to be on like three weeks of IV antibiotics b/c human bites are taken /really/ seriously by medical professionals, and Harry's got some cracked ribs, broken wrist, etc.

So now you've got two kids in hospital, and that's definitely going to get some police attention. They investigate, Harry mentions "sleep under the stairs" and suddenly you've got a pretty believable way to get Harry away from the Dursleys years before canon starts.

At what point does Dumbles show up? Does Harry go fucking ballistic when he realizes that he's an important wizard and had to be hospitalized for them to even care about him?

All in all, I could see "finally starts fighting back against Harry Hunting" being a pretty good way to start a Slytherin!Harry or Grey!Harry or even Dark!Harry fic.

**** When are you starting this crack fic and where can I find it???.... I will say yes he didn't really specify whether harry would be the victor or not, I was just assuming that a kid that will soon take down the dark Lord wouldn't loose fisticuffs by an 8 year old

***** This is what fanfiction request for. Wishful thoughts brought to life. I've seen a few where Harry fought back, angry enough to lash out with even a little magic. Of course, he got his ass beat black and blue.

****** The thing is, you asked for (I'm assuming canon circumstances) an underfed, short kid with no training in melee combat to take on a group of stronger, taller kids (Dudley and gang were larger since canon Harry is malnutritioned and short in PS). You disqualified accidental magic or Lily's protection. You also took away any avenue of using force multipliers like traps.

There is no way Harry could win under the circumstances you set. If you would not insist on fists, it would already be a different story.

******* He doesn't have to win for the event to have enough of an impact to drive a story. Maybe he learns that fighting back only gets you hurt. Maybe he learns to never fight fair. Maybe it isn't a full on fight, and he just punches Piers in the face or whatever and they're kids so he starts crying and the situation falls apart, Harry learning that sometimes a small act of resistence is enough to turn the tides.

My point is that just because you're not thinking broadly enough doesn't mean that it's not a valid request.

**** I think it's a pretty fair assumption, unless somehow Harry is getting trained by Mr. Miyagi secretly everyday inside of his cupboard.

If you stated Magic could be used, young harry accidental magic that's kinda plausible but other than that you're either asking for a Harry that somehow becomes the karate kid with no training or Harry getting beat up because he's either to stupid or too prideful to run
