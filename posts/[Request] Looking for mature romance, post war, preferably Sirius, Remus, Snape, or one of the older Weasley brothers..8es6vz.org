Can be with Hermione or a female OP. No time turner fics please! I'm older and not really into teenagers so I'd like characters age 25+ Smutty is great but I do want a well written story with a strong plot.

Thanks, this subreddit is really great :)


** I hope you get some recs because I'd be interested to see them too (maybe not with Hermione though). I suspect there aren't very many to choose from

** HG/SS :

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3626724/chapters/8008317]] This one starts almost right after the battle but moves quickly and covers years of their lives. It's one of my favorite fics I think, it's comforting and pretty well written. Pretty peaceful (with a few plot elements to make some waves at some points of course), but nice and interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11053807/1/Sin-Vice]] You probably already know this one, there's a time turner involved but not in the usual way. Really one of the best older HG/SS fics that take place during the war.

I know I have read lots of others but I don't have them on hand unfortunately. Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten is great but you've read it already I guess.

HG/Voldemort/Tom Riddle

Yeah, not for everyone, but I happen to enjoy them a lot :

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/451982/chapters/775208]] This one is probably my favorite fics of all time. Adventure, magic, and most importantly, a really good Hermione. I enjoy HG/TR or HG/LV fics but way too often she's shy and weak. In this one she's really badass and their relationship, as weird and dysfunctional as it is, seems believable and not too unbalanced. It's a bit dark, obviously.

Abyss and Ascent by Lunalelle ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/163596/Lunalelle]]) are both good, but very dark. Their names speak for themselves, Abyss is dark and horrible - HG is captured as a teen, powerless, and deals with terrible stuff (non-con, abuse, etc). It's sequel Ascent is also dark but HG returns as an adult, and this time she's in control. It's not really a romantic pairing, just a dark but interesting story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7499274/1/The-Scientist]] That one is HG/TR, non-magic AU, TR isn't a psychopath. Really well written, one of my favorite of the genre. HG is a law student and TR is her teacher.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades]] HG/LV, I really like this story, the plot is great and quite unique. The ministry is a threat to both the Order and the Death Eaters so they form a temporary alliance to fight back.

I also had a really good Hermione/Lucius story but I can't find it anywhere. They've been married for years but nobody knows because nobody cared enough to notice. I'm gonna search for it again just in case.

Anyway, we have similar tastes, I also find myself less and less interested with stories about teenagers, but I tend to prefer Hermione paired with darker guys (I mean, I read HG/LV so... can't really go more evil than that haha).

** You can't really go wrong with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] by Loten. Though it's not post-war, it's got a mature Hermione and a well-written Snape, slow-burn romance, an amazing plot, and one of the best endings I've ever read. My all-time favorite fanfic and I've read thousands. Enjoy!
