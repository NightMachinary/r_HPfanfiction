  "Harry James Potter!" Hermione scolded.
#+end_quote

Whenever I see that in a fic, I want do to a "needle scratch" out of the story and have him turn on her.

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione Jane* Granger! You are not my mother! My mother is dead, and I'm not looking to replace her with a self-important CONTEMPORARY who thinks she's in charge of me!"
#+end_quote

This is especially bad because it usually occurs in what is supposed to be a Harry/Hermione story. If you treat your alleged partner like a child, that is not healthy and does nothing to sell me on the pairing. (I've said before: I'm /willing/ to believe in a Harry/Hermione pairing but the author has to /convince/ me because it never, ever was in canon. This does the opposite of convincing me.)

I did a search of the books. His full name "Harry James Potter" occurs exactly four times in canon:

- Twice in his trial (OotP)
- His OWL results (HBP)
- The reading of Dumbledore's will (DH)

*Screw revisionism. People can have the same name.

*Edit: Wow, thanks for the silver!*

** I couldn't agree more.

I find this problem often appears simultaneously with characters (almost always women that happen to be his partner?) that seem emotionally erratic.

It's not normal that every time something bad happens (and I mean everything from a real, actually scary, fight to being called a bad name), the girl breaks down in fear/fright/paralysis/tears and needs a strong unaffected man (normally Harry) to calm them down and stay functional.

It's not normal that when the girl always breaks into tears at the drop of a hat, and needs time to cry out their happiness before they can eat their breakfast every morning.

It not normal that immediately following that, said girl is trying to be a mother (using your three name rather consistently) because their teenage man decided to play a prank/have an alcoholic beverage/do literally anything not prescribed by school rules. And said man immediately accepts that lady is right... Because that's her job?

Honestly, I can never figure out what the intent is for these characters. Is it some weird Mary Sue fantasy which I just don't understand? Is it drama/romance writing where the skills of the authir just doesn't have the capacity to represent their idea? Or maybe just some weird misogynistic mind-set which is bleeding into the writing?

Personally I find it extremely off putting when I read works like this, which sometimes have some really interesting novel ideas and plots for their stories.

Edit: changed my description of the characters to be more appropriate

**** "Ronald BILLIOUS Weasley!"

"Uh-oh," Ron says with a nervous giggle. "I think she found us."

"Harry. James. POTTER!!"

"What wash your firsht clue," slurs Harry, as he concentrates on not dropping his bottle while attempting to put it down.

"I leave you two for FIFTEEN MINUTES because I needed to escort a Firstie to the dungeons, and THIS is what I come back to?!"

Hermione is well beyond steamed or even fuming, but Harry's somewhat confident that she's still not yet livid, so while Ron's dander is well and truly raised, Harry raises his bottle instead. "Want some?"

After a short pause while his two best mates stare at him incredulously, Hermione huffs before flopping down between the pissed Gryffindors, snatching the proffered bottle before Harry could change his mind. "I need a drink," she groans out. "It took me fifteen minutes instead of five because Professor Snape decided to interrogate me over why I was escorting one of HIS Firsties, instead of one of HIS Prefects." She takes a pull from the bottle before huffing in indignation once more. "I swear, you'd think he was trying to punish the poor Firstie for getting lost and and asking for help from the first person she came across, all while trying to somehow make it my fault enough that he could take away House Points!"

At this, Ron nods sagely, bumping his shoulder against Hermione's. "That's what I've always told you about him, innit? Snape's a bloody tosser."

As his two friends once again start to bicker over Snape's professorship, Ron's language, and whatever tangents those bring up, Harry lets out a heavy but happy sigh, brushing his bangs out of his eyes as he opens up another bottle. Exams were finally over, stress was being vented left right and center, and his care package from home had had a wonderful selection of spirits. If this was what being a Sixth Year was like, then he felt confident that the next year would be a breeze.

Of course, later, he'd blame that overconfidence on the alcohol.

*** I suppose I can see that as, "I don't do it but others might." I don't remember ever calling my friends by their middle names except in jest (but I have a bad memory when it comes to my childhood). I only did that to my younger siblings. But I can see that children are more likely to scold their friends than adults are, because they're still learning socially acceptable behaviors.

Certainly, as an adult, I don't think it's my place to scold my adult friends. I might tell them that I thought their behavior was misguided, or ask why they did something, but honestly only if they brought it up themselves.

** I honestly *hate* when girls treat these boys like children, like they are their mother! Like the slapping at the back of the head? What if the roles were reversed? I don't know why people romanticise girls treating their partner like that, I couldn't ever hurt anyone like that! Especially not for a stupid reason like eating, being ‚Äústupid‚Äù, not doing something or just saying their honest opinion!

(Now I'm going to move over to RonxHermione, for a bit) Listen Hermione, I love you and all- but you are *not* his mother! Stop telling him to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù, or do his homework! You are his friend (Maybe girlfriend, depends on timeline)! You are not there to raise him, help him out! tell him to shut up! I know how he can act, and I know it can be very frustrating but it's honestly so annoying to sit here and read about you basically controlling him, acting like his mother?! pull yourself together, neither of you are perfect but you can improve, I know it.

Hermione, *you are not his mother, nor his sister* you have no right to act like you can lecture him!

Ugggghhhhh, I can't type it all out but I want you guys to know how much it frustrates me to see the unequality in these relationships! and toxicity, abuse and sexism.

I'm sorry but I hate when people make personality examples as well, and use gender, the ‚Äúgirls are timid and uncertain, and boys are rude, cocky and always think they're right‚Äù is so so aggravating!

While I'm taking about it, everything can go both ways! Sexism, Racism, Harassment and so so so so much more!

Please, think of how it would be if the roles were reversed.

But getting back on topic, it gets me so incredibly mad when the relationships are toxic and abusive but it's fine! because the girl was doing it, the guy either deserves it or she's just being cute- *but either way, girls are just pure, cute, innocent beings... *

As you can see by my rant, which does not even compare to everything I want to say, and I'm sorry if I'm being overdramatic, and it's ‚Äújust fiction‚Äù bit this matter awakens a rage in me that just- bleh. G Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah! As you can probably see from the rant above this, I really really really REALLY- uh, reallly hate unequality!

Book 5: 2 instances in the /last chapter./ (That actually makes it nearly five books in between mentions!)
