** Because a hot actor and not putting your money where your mouth is makes up for a long list of war crimes and six years of racism and sadism.

*** Realistically, it's probably more than six years of racism. Like, is there /anything/ in the last two books that indicates that he's genuinely rethought his views on blood purity rather than realising that he hasn't got the stomach to personally enforce those views? 'Cause I can't think of it, if there is.

** No... just no. Draco Malfoy is the least redeemable Hogwarts student of the bunch (aside from Crabbe, who dies). I can't think of legitimate canon divergence which would end up at a point where Harry and Draco might be in a romantic relationship with each other. It's even worse than Dramione, and that's saying something. Harry and Draco would never, and I repeat, /never/, get together.

*** Hahaha. As a die hard drarry fan, I have now taken it upon my mission to prove you wrong, and write you a believable drarry fic. Like, it's true they hate each other, but I firmly believe that if they were to be put in a situation where they managed, through some sort of cosmic twist of fate to find some solidarity, idk.

**** In order for it to be remotely believable, Draco's divergence from canon needs to happen early. And I mean like pre-COS kind of early. After his actions to bully muggleborns in the second book I don't think Harry would ever try to find some good in him.

Also both characters need to magically become gay, but it's fanfiction, so I'll let that one slide.

***** I agree very much about the early divergence. After what Malfoy did to Hagrid and Buckbeak, especially his enjoyment of Hagrid's misery, Harry would be more interested in sucking a rusty piece of barbed wire than Malfoy's cock.

As for the make them gay bit, make one gay and one bi. That won't be nearly as unbelievable given the distribution of sexual orientations (1-2% homosexual and 3-5% bi).

***** I think the divergence could potentially happen later. Though, I do agree that it would need to happen pretty early. Like, most likely before Voldemort rises again.
