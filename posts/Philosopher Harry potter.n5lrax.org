As the title suggests I am looking for a fic with a Harry that is interested in philosophy and has debates with other people. He could meet Nicholas Flamel in first year, maybe even read Salazar Slytherin's journals in the chamber of secrets, Remus Lupin would be interesting as well. When Harry starts using philosophy quotes people may start looking at him as another Dumbledore with his wise words lol.
