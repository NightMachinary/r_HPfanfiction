I got a blank page when trying to publish a new chapter at FFN, and it didn't go through. Afterwards, going to "Manage Stories" and clicking on any story produces this message:

Tried asking on FFN forums, but same result, blank page after submitting a post ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyone else or is it just me?

*** Just once, but I was editing in Document Manager for a while, maybe that's why. Guess I'll try again tomorrow.

** How do you spam publishing chapters?

And I thought FFN's allowance of bullying(ie - Critics United) was ridiculous.

** I think it's a site-glitch that's going on. There's one in the forums too that won't let users post new topics or reply to current ones.

Now, I haven't tried this myself, but you could try and upload the chapter through the FF app. I've seen on Writers Anonymous that users have been able to reply to/post new topics through the app. If you're able to do that with the app, I'm going to hazard it'll also let you upload a chapter.

** I didn't get the spam notification, but I haven't been able to upload new documents lately unfortunately, getting an error message.

** Might be a lot of people getting this error. Only a single crossover story posted in the last 24 hours? I don't think so. =\

** I think it's gone. The problem, not the site. I'm subscribed to some forums and have been getting the notifications.
