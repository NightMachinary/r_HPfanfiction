Hiya.

I've been messing around with FanFiction for a while now, and have accumulated hundreds of hours of writing and studying the art of writing and story craft in general. As it's 1PM on Saturday and I've got fuck all to do (got stuff to do now, I'll return to this), I'm going to put some of it in this post in case my digitised library of this shit is somehow destroyed. And also to be helpful. Feel free to add what you wish in the comments.

I'm going to submit this post now, and return to it once I've prioritized what I think is important when writing, it'll be a few mins.

*BOOKS ABOUT WRITING*

They say you don't get better at writing by reading about writing. I don't know who said that, but they're wrong. Find a copy of [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06W5KC2ZR/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Invisible Ink]] by Brian McSomething, I'm sure if you search for "Invisible Ink Brian McDonald Filetype:pdf" in Google that the Internet God will reward you or something.

Now why would I recommend /that/ book in particular? Well, the title about that book "Invisible Ink", makes a whole lot of sense when the author educates you on specific techniques that, on the outside, seem innocuous and "add-ons", but in reality you see them holding the structure in your favourite stories. I do not wish to reiterate the entire book, but there's a concept of the "Armature" the author brings up which changed the way I look at storytelling ENTIRELY. It is no exaggeration to say this is likely the best book on writing I will ever read.

Worthy mentions:

/On Writing/ by Stephen King (while since I've read it, but I recall it being very inspiring and informative).

/Stein on Writing/ by Sol Stein (not completed it, but very, very detailed and informative about the entire writing process

/The Anatomy of Story/ by John Truby (extremely useful, not read in it's entirety, but I recall putting some things I learned here immediately into practice.

/(More to come)/

--------------

*BOOKS IN GENERAL*

It should go without saying that to write good stories, you must read good stories. But that also isn't enough. After writing stories, reading better ones, and improving your own stories, you will begin to see flaws in other amateur writing. What I suggest you do at this point is find a book you particularly enjoy the writing of, then copy it word for word, paragraph by paragraph. Get an idea for what it /feels/ like to write work you admire. What patterns can you see between the word choice and array of sentences in the paragraph to make it so palatable to you?

Get inside the authors head. Why did they write /this/ in /that/ way? Every sentence, every word -- every punctuation mark is there deliberately, a dance of a quarter million words, waterfalling in such a way as to grab your very valuable attention. What worked? What didn't? And most importantly, why?

/(In progress)/

*THINGS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY*

Your FanFiction idea isn't the next Great American Novel. It's FanFiction, and you likely have a thousand ideas buzzing in your head. Interesting plot points, inspiring Original Characters, a new take on Diagon Alley, a resplendent description of the best magical trunk to hit the market. There are so many unexplored things in the world of Harry Potter.

Here's the catch. You can't always fit them all in the same story (you knew that, I'm sure), and in many cases, the ideas you have simply /don't fit/ in the world of a particular story. You know they're good ideas, you want to use them, but they don't fit. What gives? Here's an idea. Don't shoehorn them all into the same fic, spread the love. (read more about this in the comment section).

*** Aye. If you've got a good story. Streamline it, make it the best it could be. You don't need to create sprawling epics, they'll give you headaches. You'll only find heartache. Start small. 20-50k words. Then rewrite that a bunch of times until it looks like something neat. Large stories with complex motivations on multiple sophisticated characters just sounds like a recipe for disaster.

In fact, I don't just think it will be a disaster, I know it will be a disaster. I've planned three such epics, and am in the middle of whittling one big story down into what should hopefully just be a two part series. I'm slicing away at the growth now until I can get the story arrow straight. No need to divert into meaningless worldbuilding. Everything should move forward the plot or build character, and nothing else until you know what you're doing.

** *THINGS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY*

Your fanfiction idea isn't the next Great American Novel. It's fanfiction, and you likely have a thousand ideas buzzing in your head. Interesting plot points, inspiring Original Characters, a new take on Diagon Alley, a resplendent description of the best magical trunk to hit the market.

Here's an idea. Don't shoehorn them all into the same fic. A good idea is a good idea whether it is written in one large story or broken off to accentuate another story. Some things just don't fit in a particular story. Maybe you /don't/ need that Original Character. Maybe the romance is just a bit much, and perhaps it could just be a love interest instead of a full blown relationship, that way you retain the entire point of the story without bogging it down with luvvy-duvvyness. I'm not a fan of romance stories, as you can tell already -- I'm very blunt.

Here's an example from my own (in-progress) stories. It sucks that I'm just going to fucking outright describe some of the plot, but you it's a good example:

#+begin_quote
  My problem is that Harry needs to be extremely powerful, and capable. He must be a skilled fighter, in his own right, able to fend off adult opponents by the age of 13/14 (to fit my timeline). He must /appear/ to be a strong candidate to defeat Voldemort (given sufficient time to train), but I've also increased how competent Voldemort is. He isn't mad, he's just very pissed off and has five decades of prodigious study and real-world experience to trounce Harry with.

  Now what to do? I must make Harry, power-wise, on equal-footing. I don't like to believe that witches and wizards have different "power levels", but it fits the story much better if they seem unusually capable from a young age. It adds to the sense of equality, inevitability . . . destiny.

  So with this basic premise, my problem is two-fold.

  1. Make Harry powerful, realistically

  2. Make Harry skilled, realistically

  If I just make shit happen, it becomes a power-wank crack-fic. If I build these traits sensibly, it becomes a neat little story with interesting character development, world-building, and should immerse the reader far better. The characters won't be Gods, they will earn whatever accolade's they need to win.
#+end_quote

Now I needed to look really deeply at dueling. My main characters will all, at some point, pull out the big guns. But they /can't/ all fight the same. In my world, at the Ministry of Magic in year 5, Harry and co. should have got /DESTROYED/ by the Death Eaters. In my world, you get what you earn, Harry and the others didn't earn their win. They didn't sacrifice to further their study. And when fighting at the high-end, I needed to make it more than flashes of light and elemental power. I needed to abstract away from casting. The methods of fighting must reflect the character.

Voldemort : chaotic, uncontrolled, unbridled. /Likes to play with fire/, this gives you options as a writer. He can destroy the environment. What's the point in making them fight mano-a-mano if you can just make Voldemort /stomp/ and let loose a concussive wall of magic. He's a wizard. Let him wiz-out.

To go on a tangent -- it's very boring to read power-wank training montages. You know what is interesting? If that training comes at a price. Say . . . a relationship, or school grades (some people drop out of school and start successful business. It's all about how you set your priorities. If I took a kid out of school at age 11, taught him chess with Grandmasters, then brought him back into the population at age 17, he'd be a dumb fuck, but he'd also destroy them at Chess. It's all about prioritization.

Why do so many authors do this? I find it unbelievable and immersion breaking for Harry to have those power levels that early. If you want him effective in fights that early, use his almost perfect invisibility cloak or Lily's protection, but it's really unbelievable for Harry to just smack adults around in a fair fight.

Play to his strengths and have him win by being underestimated, creative and lucky, not through skills which would be practically unobtainable for him at that point.

**** To put it bluntly, authors do it because they're writing stories they would want to read. To me, the Invisibility Cloak is OP and is an "only works once" device in any given situation.

I understand your thinking behind using Harry's strengths, not making them up. But you're thinking too much into it. By "Fending off opponents" this doesn't mean wiping the floor with them, it means just about surviving.

This is all made up stuff, it doesn't matter if the character is OP for their age, you just need to make their journey there a bit more believable. It is not unbelievable that a talented student could reach adult-levels of spell-casting /in certain aspects of the discipline/. After all, a student doesn't have anywhere near the obligations of an adult, and if the kid focuses on a particular part of magic they could become very proficient indeed and outstrip adults within that slim scope they've focused on.

You see this all the time in the real world with students going to Math Olympiad's at age 13 and far outpacing talented students in the scope of the competition, a young student may focus completely on Discrete Mathematics, while a math graduate will become a specialist in something else in addition to a wide breadth of knowledge underneath that.

Simply put, if you had a talented kid at Hogwarts, give him the inclination to study hard (i.e. Voldemort wants to kill me), then have him ace his classes, focusing on the ones that matter in outright combat (Charms, DADA, Transfig), then in addition to that, have him trained in combat through, say, a dueling and drill himself with similar and more powerful foes, then have him get real-world experience against less powerful opponents . . . you see. There's a gradual acclimation of knowledge and subsequent application of the knowledge.

This way you can have your powerful character, but then he might come up against a barrier that requires Arithmancy knowledge, or Potions expertise, or requires an understanding of Ancient Runes. And he'll have no idea what to do.

Dumbledore was seen as a strong candidate to defeat Voldemort because he could fight him to a standstill and force a retreat. If Harry barely escapes, no one would think that he had the potential to eventually defeat Voldemort. To be seen as someone with that potential, you would need to do a lot more than just escape.

#+end_quote

Magical combat is a lot more complex than mathematics, even at that level. For example, during the duel in the Ministry Atrium, Dumbledore and Voldemort use magic which Harry can barely describe. To be successful in a fight at that level, he needs at the very least post-NEWT knowledge in Charms, Transfiguration and DADA. How is he supposed to have that at 13?

That sounds like it would take at least a decade to get him to the point where he'd be able to challenge anyone noteworthy. Harry was struggling with silent casting at age sixteen and after a year of training with Snape, his teacher was able to mock Harry's incompetence at the end of HBP, and Snape is someone of high, but not outstanding combat ability.

Most of the feats Harry does to earn his reputation were luck and +plot armour+ Lily's protection, not something he did himself.

Stronger than adults that train a lot, with better experience, better knowledge of their own body and with more time to dedicate to training than teenagers still in school? Pretty sure there's none.

The issue isn't fictions where Harry/a student is stronger than the average, it's fictions where one can keep up with the best of them all while being the same kind of wizard (excluding the The Gamer "crossover" trope where he's a video game character and thus not on the same scale than the others.)

***** A teenager beating up a senile senior is a different story than a fourteen year old trying to beat up a grown man. Harry has no way to get "combat training" at that time, especially since magic is difficult to learn in canon. It takes Harry days to learn the bloody summoning charm, which is just a spell with no tactical concept behind it. You saw how easily he was bested in every fight with an adult (Voldemort, Lestrange, Snape) until the plot armour kicked in. And that was after the DA and his OWL preparations.

I was never talking about a senile senior, that would be disingenious of me(though I see you don't have that problem). I was talking about any kind of adult.

Good thing we're not writing canon then. Besides, I disagree with your interpretation of canon.

He was never meant to learn anything much in DA, but teach others. His DADA during the OWL year was taught by a purely theoretical, zero actual knowledge teacher. In fact, if you really think about it, the only good DADA teacher Harry ever actually had, that was both competent and well-intended was Remus Lupin, and that was during third year. Severus and Moody might have taught him well too, but they will have undoubtedly changed the curriculum to fit a year of students who went through Quirell, Lockhart and Umbridge. Besides, we don't know how effective the DADA course would have been /anyway/ since the wizarding world had fallen into complacence about the dark arts after such a long period of peace. We know for a fact that not everyone out of Hogwarts is automatically a master of defence, since Rowling makes it obvious most wizards and witches wouldn't be like that.

Aside from my tendency to get really into something for a short period of time and then drop it, this is what keeps me from being able to write actual stories. I like reading stories with good plotting and character development, but when it comes to creating something myself I'm way more interested in worldbuilding. The story would just be a vehicle for showing off the worldbuilding.

Then make Dumbledore more useful. Stop following JKR's footsteps of writing children's story with the usual "useless adults" trope. Make everyone contribute, make every key player have their moments, and finally, tactical positioning is far more important than raw combat power anyway. Gallant duels will no longer be necessary if you can deliver your firepower against an unsuspecting and unprepared enemy. War is all about deception and fighting UNFAIRLY!

Make use of Tonks's metamorphus ability, make her the super infiltrator.

Make use of Dumbledore's alchemy power, and let him develop aerosolized basilisk venom.

Voldemort may have super destructive power, but he had to identify a target first! In fact, like in modern Muggle warfare, any Magical target that could be identified could also be destroyed. Voldemort may be super strong in offense, but a Killing Curse cast at his unsuspecting back would still destroy his body. And his Death Eaters would be of course far far more vulnerable.

** *THE MOST USEFUL TIPS I HAVE*

A silly quote, but it struck a chord with me. I realized after reading this that I was thinking about writing too much:

"I'm a legit human being, and this is a story that actually happened. Even though it's make-believe, believe it yourself, bring every detail to reality."

Basically, I wrote a story that started like:

"I'm a /bonafide/ classmate of Harry Potter, here's how it all /really/ went down."

--------------

To put it bluntly, /REALLY/ get into the heads of your characters. At the very least, spend some time envisioning who they are, and how /that person/ would be feeling in the scenario you've put them in.

To expand on the quote above (wrote this off my head just now):

#+begin_quote
  "It was insane being at Hogwarts with Potter. You've heard the stories but you can't /really/ imagine it. I did alright myself. I was a couple years older than him so missed the really crazy stuff, but while I was there I studied decently hard. With Hufflepuff you get a ton of help, and I breezed through my classes until OWL year. There was always something going on with him though -- every damn year.

  "He was the youngest seeker in a century, it goes without saying. Fucking ridiculous talent on a broom. But he trained hard at it, seemed to like it a lot. I think that made people get used to him a little when he would celebrate with the others like a normal kid. Made him a little less odd, with his scruffy shoes and messy hair, and that weird scar everyone tries to catch a look at.

  "I was in the hall when his broom arrived. Nimbus Two-Thousand. Bought by McGonagall, obviously. No one gave a shit though, catching the snitch with his mouth is still the best thing I've seen at the pitch, maybe a close second would be that Patronus Charm he did. What was he, twelve, thirteen? The kid's a beast. No idea where he pulled it from, I heard he was taught by our Defence Professor for most of the year, but still, a fucking Patronus Charm. That's Auror-level spellwork. And he was a teenager. No one knew what exactly he was capable of, after that. Well, I did get a bit worried when he turned out to be a Parselmouth, but that's a whole other story altogether.

  "What next . . . ah, Quirrell disappeared after he and Potter were involved in some fight deep under the castle. No idea what happened, there's dozens of different versions and takes on it. All we know is Quirrell died, no burial, no body. Just an announcement he'd died. And Potter in the Infirmary. We're looking at Sprout as she's telling us this like, we can add two and two, you know.

  "Twi-Wizard Champion. And the rebirth of Voldie. I feel I can say his name properly now that he's gone for real. Voldemort still makes my ma' squeak, so I've started referring to him as Voldie since Potter got him. Feels weird, like I know I should be happy, but it was appalling, the two years before Potter ended it. Appalling. Worst years of my life, easily. My final year in Hogwarts was, of course, Umbridge. Not sure what exactly happened to her, when Shacklebolt became Minister apparently Potter had a few things to say, last I heard she was in Azkaban in the cell next to Rita Skeeter.
#+end_quote

I could go on and on and on with this sort of shit. To make a grounded Harry Potter story, sometimes you need to embrace the absurdity of it. Maybe have another character outright comment on crazy stuff.

/Believe in the legend of Harry Potter. As an author you have so much leverage in making him a believable, young Dumbledore-level warrior./ Look what happens above just by including an external perspective looking-in to the madness.

Whole and altogether mean the same thing here, so that's a stylistic error. A big and enormous one. A funny and hilarious one. I'm so sorry and I apologize. You know what I mean, you understand me.

You're smart, and I like your prose. I am reading Harry Crow of all things right now, so take that with a pinch of salt. But I don't think you're giving as much value as you could by simply describing what goes on in your mind during your own writing process. Do you even think about structure and such when writing a story, and if so, what are those thoughts? If not, why do you think you can teach anyone else to write, since you do it unconsciously? Get to the point, that's what one good quality I'd like to see fellow muggles learn from the goblins. But since I assume you're a muggle like that, this is the real world, so if there are no wizards either, there are no goblins as well, so I guess nothing supports my opinion, so feel free not to.

Do we get any links to your works?

EDIT: Actually, never mind, your affected sneering attitude aside, I have spotted two more mistakes after that last one, and I'm suddenly not as impressed by your shtick. But by all means, everyone else can surely benefit from your wisdom.

#+end_quote

You do realise I wrote those paragraphs off the top of my head, and didn't go back to edit them? That being said, it's dialogue, and people fuck up their words often enough. I think I'll leave it in, authors privilege.

This is amateur writing, we're not pros, and you shouldn't expect perfection. Should I stop writing altogether because you found fault with my work? If you have better advice, then share it with the community.

#+begin_quote
  But I don't think you're giving as much value as you could by simply describing what goes on in your mind during your own writing process.
#+end_quote

Okay, I'll try to give an example of what happens during story creation in the baby stages. Before I put anything to draft, I need to actually give a shit about the story. It needs to mean something to me personally, something I think I can do justice to by sharing to the community. It can't just be a rehash of another similar fan-fiction or a common trope. If someone else has already written it, I am wasting my time.

Therefore, my story might spawn out of an idle thought I have. "Hey, I wonder what Quirrell was thinking during first year?"

From there, I need to think, it'll be like a little conversation with myself that I'll put on paper.

#+begin_quote
  "OK, where is this story going?"

  "Quirrell's an unwilling host, he didn't want it, Voldemort tricked him."

  "An unwilling captor? But why would he even go looking for Voldemort in Albania?"

  "He wasn't, was he? He was researching vampires etc. in Europe. Maybe he just happened upon Voldemort, an unlucky encounter."

  "But Quirrell was smart, wasn't he? He'd avoid it."

  "Perhaps Voldemort incapacitated him, then while nearly unconscious, possessed him."

  "Wouldn't Quirrell fight that? Maybe he did fight it?"

  "And how would Voldemort react to that? Wouldn't Voldemort want a way to regain control, to shut the resentment?"

  "Quirrell was changed coming back from Albania, maybe it's Voldemort's doing. Caused by him fighting so much? That's why he stutters, jumps etc."

  "He'd be happy when Voldemort is defeated at the end, then, wouldn't he? Even though he himself dies?"
#+end_quote

... basically something like the above happens. It won't all be a single, linear conversation. I might have one question on paper, then think of something else while at work. Then coming home on public transport I'll think of another thing. And then I'll join it all together in a document and see what connects.

The end result is, "Quirrell is the unwilling victim of possession, he fights against his captor, pays the price, and we'll just retcon the ending so it's like Quirrell winning. Perhaps Quirrell acts without input, Voldemort takes control, which is why he deteriorates when he touches Harry, but doesn't when shaking his hand in the Leaky Cauldron.

#+begin_quote
  Do you even think about structure and such when writing a story
#+end_quote

Like three-act, five-act, seven-act etc. Inciting incidents, foreshadowing yada-yada? I know the theory and refer back to it as needed. Sometimes I'll peruse a writing book and have a technique spelled out for me, then I'll use my better understanding of the technique to enhance my work.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, never mind, your affected sneering attitude aside, I have spotted two more mistakes after that last one, and I'm suddenly not as impressed by your shtick. But by all means, everyone else can surely benefit from your wisdom.

Your delusional sense of entitlement and superiority aside, I've literally no idea where you're going with that. And I'm not sure why grammatical mistakes negate literal years of experience writing fiction. I'm not a professor, just a 22 year old bloke offering a perspective and some advice. Do you think I get paid for this?

I upvoted, for what it's worth.

** My stories are all guilty of this. it's somewhere between proud and cringe.. I get daily favs and follows for something I wrote 9 years ago. I see so many things I could have done better,

edit edit edit.

redline appx 60% of what is written and save those ideas for another story.

try to write something with an original idea, or at least different from too many others.

** *MAKE IT PERSONAL*

But anyway, away from that /tangent/, making it personal means finding something valuable in your life, and introducing it to your writing.

For example. I've recently been getting into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I've been reading up on training regimes, curriculum's, belt-hierarchies. Things like that.

I then thought of magical dueling, and how such structure might apply to that discipline. You see, I take a very hard line on spellcasting and spell-competency.

I'll lay it out real quick in regards to competency.

1. Dumbledore / Voldemort / Grindelwald. People at this level are so expert in their combat that the only thing that differentiates them are the mistakes they make. Can their opponent take advantage of their mistake before they make up for it?

2. = Aurors. Dark Wizard catchers. Super dangerous profession. Highly proficient mages only. More powerful than the average person (i.e. not going to back down when in a confrontation, just as a basis for their character, this then reflects in their spellcasting).

3. = Joint with the Aurors, are the powerful Dark Wizards and Witches. Lucius at the lead, then Bellatrix, then Snape, then I will say . . . Dolohov.

4. = Professors. Flitwick far in the lead, then Snape, then just behind him is McGonagall, then who cares. Massive skill in a specific domain, and significant skill in a separate range of domains. Why the professors (in general) are below the above? Well I figure the professors won't be putting their skills to the test under high-pressure situations where the stakes are life or death. This causes people to freeze. People who retain their skills under pressure are simply better than those who don't. Death Eaters and Aurors train under pressure, ergo...

5. DMLE personnel. Average mage. Capable of learning specialist Charms as needed for the job, but not the weird stuff like the Patronus Charm, that's just unnecessary punishment. Might not even be able to apparate at the lower rungs.

6. Average mage. Gets through Hogwarts or some other school. Does alright. Then works in magical architecture. apparition is a bit naff, bit dangerous, like. Best leave it to the pros.

7. Students. Defeat multiple Death Eaters? Fuck off with that bullshit. At this level, Death Eaters are practically God to you. Beg for forgiveness or play dead. You have no other options. You will be flattened by non-verbally cast Dark Magic and your last image will be of your decapitated body. If it was Voldemort, it only means you die quicker. You have no real defense aside from a Shield Charm untested in combat. Your offensive spells are inaccurate and ineffective, meanwhile your fitness is sub-par unless you're an athlete.

8. Idiots.

9. Ronald Wea-- just kidding. Pettigr-- just kidding, he's an animagus. But still Pettigrew.

--------------

But the above is just the "competency hierarchy" that I set up in me head. What about legitimate fighting skill. How is that developed? Does young Dumbledore have something the others don't? Could he beat anyone at any age?

No. He worked at it. Trained in combat for decades. Perhaps took dueling lessons under the greats of his Era. Perhaps he was a dueling champion once before he settled into Hogwarts. We know he fought Grindelwald after settling in at Hogwarts. I refuse to believe he was simply the destined defeater of Grindelwald. He trained, developed skill, refined that skill. This takes years of failure to perfect your combat to the level where you can defeat a Dark Lord with the Elder Wand. But then again, that was a very personal duel, so who knows what happened. Maybe Grindel didn't want Dumbledore to be upset after killing him, so let himself be taken prisoner. Who knows?

Back to dueling. How doth one learn?

Dueling competitions. Learn skills at Hogwarts, come home. "But I wanna use my wand papa." "Well sign up for dueling son, you'll be able to use your wand on the stage. If you make it pro, you could tour with a pro dueling squad and get famous and make a fair amount of money from sponsored cloaks and belts and shoes and beards.

But what if I'm Harry Potter and really powerful and need to get to Dumbledore level skill in a short time? "Well I suppose you better make it pro, young, or disguise yourself, go into amateur dueling tournaments with adults, get fucked up for a few months until you learn silent casting, solid shield, arrow-accuracy... get better, continue getting better . . . still need to get better. Perhaps an international tournament? New locations . . . potential for Original Characters . . . spells in other languages to defend against and learn to attack with . . .

You have so much room to explore this. Go nuts.

** *FINDING IDEAS*

I find ideas for fanfiction stories from literally anywhere. I'll sometimes lay awake at night jotting ideas down just because my mind won't shut up about it. I HAVE to write it down otherwise I'll forget it (I'll lost many /great/ ideas this way that I thought I was sure to remember in the morning).

Here's one such thought I had a few nights ago, scribbled awfully, I'll try to rewrite it nicely here.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort allows anti-Muggleborn practices and rhetoric to take hold not out of personal hate for Muggleborn (it's Muggle's that Tom hates). He uses anti-Muggleborn agenda as a /strategic attack vector/.

  Bigots in power = sensible Muggleborns stay away Bigots in power = qualified Muggleborns being rejected from roles, limiting their influence Voldemort can then use Muggleborn's abuse as a method to get skilled ones on /his/ side. He can use this as a method to /poach/ muggleborns. Muggleborns can be power-hungry too, and you can be damn sure Voldemort would take advantage of that to thin the herd of the opposition. Or maybe they don't work out and he just kills them after the fact.
#+end_quote

But how would Voldemort handle all of this? I think it's simple really. To create a really /scary/ Voldemort, have him collect allies from all over the place. I hate the idea of Voldemort just controlling people through the Imperius Curse. It's a weak, unsustainable method. Following his rebirth surely Voldemort is disgusted that his hard work hoodwinking these people has come undone. There must be a more permanent way . . . perhaps by realising he can give a carrot . . . or the stick? Instead of just the stick. Perhaps this would be a better Voldemort . . . a more compelling character, with richer motivations, and problems of his own to deal with . . . perhaps he wouldn't install a puppet dictator, and would give the Minister leverage to keep the boat from rocking . . .
