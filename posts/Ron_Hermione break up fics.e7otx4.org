I never gelled with this pairing. I would prefer it to be from Hermione's PoV as I'm not a fan of Ron, but if there's a good Ron one I wouldn't be opposed!

Mostly I like to read about the fallout, not the actual degrading of their relationship. Bonus points if Hermione tells off Molly.

(As an aside, I also enjoy Harry/Ginny break up fics even though I love the pairing.)

I'm a slut for bashing anyone so I don't mind it in the recs. Any length, complete or in progress, is appreciated.

Thanks in advance!


** [self ad] I normally prefer the canonical pairings, but I was disgusted with all those so poorly written Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione breakups, that I have decided to write one of my own, linkao3(20141410).

  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.
