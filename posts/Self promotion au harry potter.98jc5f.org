Only a couple chaps so far but I'm excited for where the story ls going to go. Any and all feedback is welcome!

Linkffn(12995623)


** Too much rehashing going on, imo. I don't see what purpose Chapter 1 served at all - it played out exactly as it happened in canon, with only extra detail added in and some insight into James and Lily's characters that could have been integrated without the rehashing. The second chapter was better as it introduced a point of divergence in Remus taking Harry instead of Harry being left at the Dursleys. Yet the beginning half of the chapter was superfluous at best, and essentially, was copied word for word from canon. I can understand how some rehashing might be necessary, but honestly, I think you might have been better off just starting from where Remus appears at Privet Drive and if you really have to, the beginning of Chapter 2. Chapter 1 is pointless, imo.

Otherwise, it's far too early in the story to tell much about your plot and characters. I hope this doesn't dampen your excitement for the story; just keep in mind that these are my opinions, and as the author, you would probably have a better of idea of what parts are really necessary to build your story and what parts you can do without.

EDIT: Removing spoiler tags since I realised the information is in your summary anyway.

** Some thoughts in addition to what I already wrote:

- I understand if you don't want to spoil the plot to the whole world, but find someone whose taste you respect to whom you could outline the story from start to end. By the time you've written down a chapter of prose, if a beta-reader comes back with a comment about poor plotting or characterisation or bad fanon or something else that goes beyond minor edits, you are going to be invested in what you've written, and it will be very difficult for you to scrap the chapter and rewrite it to incorporate the advice. Hash out the high-level stuff before you commit it to paper.

- The fic seems to ignore the value of Sacrificial Protection. Consider that at this point, the Order has just seen Fidelius fail spectacularly and tragically; one of its most trusted members was apparently revealed as a traitor and nobody knows who else might be one; Dumbledore, at least, suspects that Voldemort has taken precautions against death and might come back---and he doesn't know when; and there is an unknown number of vengeful Death Eaters and sympathisers at large. When epic magic falls in his lap, magic which just stopped an unstoppable curse, and which will provide an inviolable sanctuary against Voldemort and his agents while Harry lives under the same roof as Petunia, as well as lesser protection against them when he is at Hogwarts, he would be a fool not to grab it with both hands.

  I don't know how to resolve that. Maybe Voldemort, while trying to find James and Lily, but before he got the information from Peter, tracked down and murdered Petunia, leaving Harry with no close blood relatives? That might be a good PoD.

  I do think that if you abandon Sacrificial Protection, there should be some description of how its lack and the logistics involved constrain Harry's childhood. Maybe even some close calls.

- I don't know where the story is going beyond what's in the Summary, and, like [[/u/herO_wraith]], I am a bit sceptical. Even if you don't end up bashing Gryffindors, what's the /point/ of putting Harry in Ravenclaw? Are Gryffindors not allowed to be smart, or something? For that matter, why would Harry all of a sudden become the (idealised^{1} ) Ravenclaw type? He had a profoundly Gryffindor personality in canon, is going to grow up surrounded by Gryffindors, and will get to see how his stepfather is being oppressed by society. All this sounds like a recipe for someone who---even if he is brilliant and studious---wants to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not: a Gryffindor in the mold of Dumbledore and Hermione.

- What are your plans for Hermione? In vast majority of Smart!Studious!Harry fics, she actually does /less/ than in canon, because a lot of what she brings to the team in canon, Smart!Studious!Harry can do for himself---and he usually does it far more efficiently, and acquires none of Hermione's downsides in process.

--------------

^{1} --- In theory, Ravenclaws should be the scientists and the inventors. In canon, though, those roles go to the (courageous) Gryffindors and the (ruthless and ambitious) Slytherins. Ravenclaws are mostly paper-pushers.

*** Lily's sacrificial protection will work differently than in Canon, the blood wards still work the same as long as Harry can call it home, but in my fic Harry doesn't have to live there to keep Lily's protection (that works different than Canon) if he did it would only strengthen the powerful blood wards.

Honestly there is no MAJOR plot point of Harry in ravenclaw other than to be a little different, and like I said I wanted to get away from Canon Harry who acts before he thinks. I could've put him in Slytherin or Hufflepuff but I put in ravenclaw for a few reasons. His head of house is a half breed further driving that point home. I wanted to play with Luna love good more. H/hr is my otp and while I guess I could justify having them both in Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw makes more sense in my mind for Hermione especially and without Ron to hold Harry back...that being said I'll say again there is no bashing of any kind, I'm doing something different with Ron's character that's a little fun, a little pointless.hermione will be Harry's rock, the person he will always turn to for help.

OK, that's a pretty significant divergence. This is a matter of taste, but I think that there is some benefit to economy of changes to the setting. When someone starts reading your fic, they assume that setting elements are as canon, unless otherwise specified. There is some benefit to asking "Can I make the story work without springing this on the reader?"

#+begin_quote
  without Ron to hold Harry back
#+end_quote

This is probably not as relevant to your fic, but I don't think that's fair to Ron, because it's just as accurate to say that Harry held Ron back. Indeed, if you look at their OWL results, Ron got exactly as many as Harry, and in every OWL they both passed except for DADA, Ron did at least as well as Harry. (And, Harry's DADA may have benefited from favouritism: did anyone else get an opportunity for bonus points for casting a Patronus?) All that without Ron having Harry's raw athletic talent. In short, don't sell Ron short.

** This really isn't something I'd read but I've currently got little else to do. Like I said, this isn't something I'd normally read so you should take everything I say with a grain of salt, its not going to be positive my biases have already set me against this story.

First, your summary.

#+begin_quote
  'After the death of his parents Harry finds solace in Remus Lupin, who raises Harry as his own. Walk [through]-> (*is this word needed*?) with Harry in his adventures at Hogwarts as he deals with a tragic past, unwanted fame, unusual friends and a prophecy that spells an inevitable conflict.'
#+end_quote

This bit is interesting. a tad generic but that's not the end of the world. The other bits are less so. That being said, while they're a bit outdated stylistically they do tell the reader what they want to know about the story. That being said, as a reader I'm already worried.

First thing I see is Ravenclaw. Now, personal biases obviously apply but honestly I think Ravenclaw is the worst house for a protagonist. Griffindor are typical heroes. Slytherin can be anti-heroes, batman would have been a Slytherin. Hufflepuffs are some of the nicest people. Hard working and dutiful are easy traits to spin into a hero. Those houses all have things that make me sympathetic to the MC's plight. I can support a hard worker doing their best against all odds. I can support the bold leaping into danger without a thought for their own safety to do what they must. I can be interested by the careful planning of a cunning mind. How they're willing to do what must be done, the cunning folk who will use any means to achieve their ends. How far is too far? Ravenclaw on the other hand. Who cares about bookish? There is nothing in their traits that leap as good traits for a protagonist. They can be great people but I'm not sure about great protagonists. I'm more worried I'll end up with a [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] brat who looks down on everyone from their intellectual high horse. Again, the traits of Ravenclaw can make good people but I don't see good protagonist material there. Have you read linkffn(5142565)? Its everything I dread about a Ravenclaw MC. The magic might be interesting but the character is a dick and I really don't care if he lives or dies nor would I bat an eyelid if he suffers. Given that he's also raised by Lupin in that story I can't help but fear for your story.

Next thing I see, Hermione. Deep joy. Now, putting aside my own dislike of the character within the fandom I'm disliking that she's also in Ravenclaw. It makes me think you've got a thing for that house. When you so actively promote one house over the others, deliberately moving them away from Gryffindor. It makes me think the story is going to have bashing. You've not been subtle in your summary. Hermione is a good Gryffindor, she goes there because she admires Albus Dumbledore. Her speech in the potions chamber of the first book tells you all you need to know. When she casts aside books and cleverness and tells Harry why he'll be a great wizard. She already has cleverness, she doesn't care for it as much as she admires the other traits which is why she wears red and gold, you see the brilliance of her character, she's clever and she knows it but under pressure she can admit that she's a long way behind in being a good person, she's aware she is an annoying know-it-all but is trying to change because there are more important things like being a good friend. You'd best have a good reason to have moved her and it better not be bashing of Gryffindor but not wanting to smear you favourite character with the same brush. It occurs to me that Hermione is almost certainly your favourite character, likely the pairing for this story assuming it has a pairing and you're shoehorning it all by moving her into Ravenclaw.

Animagus. Oh for fucks sake. The single most overrated bit of magic within the fandom. I'm old enough to have read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animorphs][Animorphs]], I might even have watched the TV show, but I still don't think its that interesting. Clearly its pretty central to your story for you to have highlighted it in the manner you have. I suppose it makes sense if Harry was raised by one of his father's closest friends that he'd be interested in it as a way of bringing him closer to his father's memory but does it matter that much? Compared to the ability to shape reality at your whim does the ability to turn into an animal really rate that highly? I can feel a slow creeping sense of dread as I check your title. Phoenix, please no, please have not done it. Please not the phoenix animagus. Sure, I subscribe to the [[https://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/][Jim Butcher opinion that your characters should be special. They should be exagerated]] but bloody hell a phoenix? Take a moment to think about the colour scheme of a phoenix. Its red and gold. Think about which house has those colours. Think about which character has a phoenix and which house he was in. When Fawkes helps Harry what house is Harry in? I think its clear that there is a link between Gryffindor and Phoenixes but you've made it abundantly clear that you're going to be all about that Ravenclaw. Oh and Hermione gets the skill to. well there goes special.

Elemental Dumbledore? The man is already the most talented wizard since Merlin what else does he need? Why on Earth is this necessary? I've never once thought it was needed. Harry Potter magic is incredibly flexible it seems so unneeded.

Okay, those are my expectations. Lets open up the story. First chapter.

So, the first divergence you've made from canon is you've given James his wand. In the books it got left on a sofa in the living room. What has this added? Well I guess you've got an action scene of sorts. You go into a bit more detail about their escape plan, all that does is remind us that Peter betrayed them. Peter has already got them killed, is this extra twist of the knife really needed? I already knew he was bad. You've introduced your werewolf laws. I guess that's interesting. A harsher wizarding world, it helps explain why werewolves would flood to Voldemort's side. This whole section is very much telling not showing however. There are a few obvious mistakes in capitalisation there too. The rest of the chapter basically plays out as canon and I'm not really sure what the chapter achieved other than introducing your anti-werewolf laws in what I personally find to be a slightly clumsy way. Maybe I'm missing something but James having his wand bought Lily a few more seconds but the end result was exactly the same. Sirius' little transformation added nothing unless the uncontrolled shift foreshadows trouble that Harry will have in the future. In the end I feel like I'm missing something but not in a hooked way, more I'm wondering why this chapter was needed.

The second chapter actually has something happen. We see a change with a meaningful result. I assume that last line was another reference to an uncontrolled transformation so I guess that first chapter did add something after all. I'm not convinced that anyone would bother to go through the process of learning to be an animagus if you can't control it. It's a choice, not an affliction unless you've changed that too. You're also missing a word or rather a name.

#+begin_quote
  'Have you talked to about this?' Dumbledore asked.
#+end_quote

That name might be quite important and you're missing it.

In summary I'm worried about the direction your story will go and I'm not convinced your first chapter added anything. The second chapter was better but short, especially considering the first half was basically taken from the book. The writing itself isn't bad. Its not the best I've seen but its better than the vast majority. That being said while the content is decent I'm not sure about the overall direction.

*** Well first your concerns about bashing and ravenclaw, it is not my intention to bash anyone. And the reason for the switch in this story is his different upbringing, Remus raises him to be careful, and crafty. He's individualistic, h/hr is my otp and I don't want a jump in without thinking Harry. Animagus I feel is needed, since he will be living with Remus, and it was originally going to be a pheonix, but now I might change that not because of his house, (also the Lions are associated with Gryffindor not pheonix's that may be your headcanon but not mine) but because Harry will also be an elemental at some point and Dumbledore is the perfect hey I'm already well versed in this art let me teach you character, and his element won't be fire so for that reason I'm kinda turned off of the pheonix animagus, even though I've never read a pheonix animagus fic but maybe that's because I've only gotten into fanfiction in the last few months and so far I've limited myself to h/hr. I felt the rehash of Canon was nessasary? Do you agree? Should I of just started from Remus apparating into pivet drive? Added a little on the end? Thanks for the feedback

#+end_quote

The grandparent was talking about colour, not specific animal. Also, phoenixes in HPverse are associated with courage, passion, pride, and self-sacrifice, not curiosity, intelligence, or other traits (in theory) associated with Ravenclaw.

Anyway, I agree with grandparent about the OP animagus form. As a general principle, unless Harry makes specific efforts to get a phoenix form, it's an unearned powerup if he does, and it's going to leave a bad aftertaste. And, if he does make specific efforts, you need to come up with a reason why /everybody/ who wants a powerful animagus form doesn't do it. Dumbledore wanted to take over the world when he was growing up. Why doesn't he have one? Voldemort would love an immortal form. Why doesn't he have one? And so on. The only fic I know where someone deliberately engineers their animagus form is Hermione in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief from Starfox5)---and she works to become an ordinary housecat.

More probable forms for Harry include

- dog or wolf: Admiration for his step-father.
- stag: His biological father.
- falcon or swallow: If he still enjoys flying and Quiddich, and especially if he likes playing Seeker, these families of birds are distinguished by catching prey (other birds and insects, respectively) in the air.
- owl or raven: If you want to go full Ravenclaw, though owls aren't actually that intelligent.
