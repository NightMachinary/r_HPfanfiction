#+end_quote

Published books aren't a guarantee of quality, obviously. Harry's frequent tangents rarely add anything to the narrative, and they're often just scientifically wrong. That's not a subtle bit of characterization, as a superior writer would have made it, either. The narrative presents him as being wholly correct in everything except the occasional social or moral failing. The jarring shifts in tone are also very unwelcome. Taking a comedic story and abruptly shifting into rape apology is not a clever way to shock readers, and it's not even presented as trying. Harry just thinks "muh enlightened morality, clearly it is healthy to think of rape as okay, it's all society's fault" and that's that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Interdict of Merlin is absolutely not ubiquitous. I actually don't think I've read any fic with it that wasn't a recursive fic of HPMOR. It's a ridiculous idea that doesn't even come close to holding weight when examined.

#+begin_quote
  and it popularized the trope of temporary transfiguration.
#+end_quote

Temporary Transfiguration has been a thing for almost as long as HP fanfiction has been a thing, because early writers were kids who didn't like the idea of mice stuck forever as teacups and hedgehogs stuck as pincushions.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe you knew who Quirrel was since the very beginning and so that caused you to roll your eyes at every scene he appeared in.
#+end_quote

I rolled my eyes at every scene he appeared in, but his identity wasn't the reason why. Was it even supposed to be a mystery? I thought the entire point was that readers were supposed to know it was Voldemort from the beginning.

  Published books aren't a guarantee of quality
#+end_quote

They do have a certain minimum standard. A book published the traditional way will have, at the least, gone through an editor. You can say Harry's segments are scientifically wrong but unless you bring up specifics I'll roll to disbelieve. And when you say the narrative always presents him as correct---well. Maybe you just stalled out after a few chapters and never saw him learn to lose because he was being an idiot, bash himself because of course breaking into Azkaban is not the smart thing to do, berate himself because Dumbledore, because Hermione, was right all along. And saying the story thinks rape is okay? Are you actually trying? Draco says that, the person that Harry thinks of as having been /raised by Darth Vader/. He spends the rest of the story persuading him to leave behind his abhorrent and bigoted views.

Alright, you think the Interdict is ridiculous and have never seen it outside of HPMOR and fanfics of it. Your personal experience does not trump mine. Maybe I've just read more Harry Potter fanfiction than you have. Regardless, saying this little mechanism is ridiculous is something that makes me almost certain you're a troll.

Temporary transfiguration has been around for a long time, but HPMOR popularized it. Look at the dates that the trope became so widespread.

Readers were supposed to know from the beginning who Quirrel was, but then a bunch of people thought it was a fake out because Quirrel was too obviously Voldemort, so the author decided to play along and remove the one bit of text that explicitly confirmed his identity at the beginning.

I said I would have given you some leeway, if you'd only read a few chapters. I won't, obviously, because your reasons are childish and nonsensical for the most part. The one thing that holds merit is your claim that some scientific claims are wrong. Some are very, very simplified, sure, or outdated, or even hypotheses instead of theories, but I'd like you to go ahead and point out the claims that are flat-out wrong, without any basis in reality.

#+end_quote

They actually don't and for the same reason I'm putting forward - an editor's evaluation of quality is subjective. If you read HPMOR, you might be familiar with Worm by Wildbow. Wildbow turned Worm in to look into publishing it, and one of the editors recommended having the bullies in the first chapter say "Take that, you worm!" to properly connect the title to the story. The entire fanbase immediately mocked it and haven't stopped even now. Wildbow even acknowledged that it made sense, from a certain point of view, but the fact remains that that editor had no sense of subtlety or theming.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe you just stalled out after a few chapters and never saw him learn to lose because he was being an idiot,
#+end_quote

Yudkowski himself said that this was a ploy by Voldemort to get Harry to accept losing because, you know, Voldemort wants his destined opponent to lose.

#+begin_quote
  bash himself because of course breaking into Azkaban is not the smart thing to do
#+end_quote

Harry isn't wrong for the Azkaban trip because he has no actual rationale to go. This is another example of bad writing. Yudkowski established Harry as someone who plans and self-evaluates, but he has zero reason to go on the jailbreak mission. Like... literally no reason at all. Harry /makes a mistake/, but he isn't wrong. It's like in the canon Philosopher's Stone, when Harry and his friends mistakenly set foot in the third floor corridor and come face-to-face with Fluffy for the first time. That's just a mistake, not them being wrong about anything.

#+begin_quote
  berate himself because Dumbledore, because Hermione, was right all along.
#+end_quote

Hermione was /not/ right all along. She adopted many of Harry's beliefs, and those become the majority of her character. Her nonspecific morals are never clearly defined, and the only time they make a difference is when Voldemort has to dress up like someone trustworthy to get her to obey him, which she immediately does.

Dumbledore deliberately withheld information from Harry that would have explained his behavior. He's the same as Harry, but with knowledge of prophecy. Mistrusting him was not a mistake on Harry's part.

#+begin_quote
  And saying the story thinks rape is okay? Are you actually trying? Draco says that, the person that Harry thinks of as having been raised by Darth Vader. He spends the rest of the story persuading him to leave behind his abhorrent and bigoted views.
#+end_quote

Harry doesn't blame Malfoy, and instead thinks that anyone raised in wizarding society (or pureblood society, at least) would think that way... except that basic human empathy is and has always been a thing, and rape has always been viewed as a horrible crime, and what Draco would have been willing to do is objectively wrong, and it is objectively his fault for joking about it. Not to mention that 'Darth Vader' in this case was raised by the same society, so he must also be blameless, right? Unless as an adult he's supposed to have overcome that... but by the generally-accepted stages of moral reasoning, Draco himself should have over come that, as well.

#+end_quote

Remember that you're trying to prove that HPMOR is objectively high-quality. You used the Interdict of Merlin's ubiquity as evidence for that. Please link these heaps of fics you're talking about. As an aside, canon disallows this - it's completely AU. Harry and co. learn tons of spells from books, including Sectumsempra. It is ridiculous to put this into the world of Harry Potter without massive changes. Any reasonable society would have heaps of mnemonics literally everywhere to capture knowledge that can't be passed on.

#+begin_quote
  Temporary transfiguration has been around for a long time, but HPMOR popularized it. Look at the dates that the trope became so widespread.
#+end_quote

It's always been a thing, again. Barely any fics mentioned it, except as an aside. It was actually one of many quibbles that canon adherents kept reminding fanfic authors, because canon is that Transfigurations last forever until dispelled, but having McGonnagall assure a worried Hermione that the frogs/mice/whatever will turn back to normal eventually has been a common throwaway line since fanfics started.

Wow, what a broad, sweeping, and totally wrong evaluation of human nature. The literal fucking fic you're defending defies that point, when it talks about how many soldiers in war just won't shoot, because they can't bring themselves to intentionally kill someone else, even with wartime propaganda and psychological training. Plenty of Nazis helped Jews escape, and far, far more were intensely uncomfortable with what they were doing, or preferred willful ignorance.

Your /opinion/ of human nature (despite tons of conflicting evidence) is not a supporting argument of any objective evaluation of HPMOR.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/how-does-transfiguration-work.8354/]]

I like the casual implication that if something continued after HPMOR, then it must have been popularized by it, though. Unless you're asking me to read EVERY Harry Potter fanfic, categorize them by permanent Transfiguration, temporary Transfiguration, or not mentioned, and then examine the rates before and after HPMOR. In that case, I have a counterproposal - I just proved that it was a trope present way before HPMOR. YOU defend your own claim that HPMOR influenced all these new works the easy way - message the authors and ask them if they got the concept from HPMOR.
