** I liked this characterization of Arthur here: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377]]

Fair warning it's a original character insert as Ginny's twin, in case that is not your thing. In progress but updating regularly.

***** yep. 1. I use a screen reader so can't skim read and 2. I am curious so even if something isn't for me I'll at least read half of a chapter.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] has scenes I think you would like. Arthur doesn't get much screentime though, compared to other characters at least.

I think his position in the Ministry played a vital role for one of the more important characters. (And this sentence makes so little sense that I'm tempted to delete it altogether.)
