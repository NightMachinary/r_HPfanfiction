In most political Harry Potter fanfics the politics are broken simply between light, neutral and dark. Why is it so simplistic in nature? If it's something to do with the number 3 ( 3,7,13 where powerful numbers in the books I think) why not have 3 sets of 3? Liberal, moderate and Conservative for broad strokes and break each between liberal, moderate and traditional groups. A true liberal would be like Arthur Wesley everyone treated equal, liberal traditional people could be Augusta longbottom or Molly Weasley (muggles and half bloods are equal but people have roles expected of them) Liberal moderate voters are in between. Moderates are kinda in shambles. Some may believe all wizard and witches are equal but not have breeds. Maybe some want only magically rasied half bloods ad equal. Conservative traditional people are where your find most of the lifeblood death eaters. Conservative liberals may want purebloods to remain on top but are still willing to appear good buy freeing up lower positions for muggleborn or half-bloods. Thoughts?


** My first thought is that it might require a lot of OCs. As an author and a reader I tend to shy away from that, but maybe others have other opinions.

*** Makes sense. Most fanfictions at least the most I read doesn't really go passed Hogwarts.

** Because that would require a lot of world-building and, more importantly, a lot of the dynamics would come from the interactions of the various fractions with each other.

Also, given the general inspiration from nobility and the size of the magical world as well as its fixations on great individuals, it would boil down to fractions based around characters (eg Dumbledore) rather than around an agenda. And if you introduce more fractions, it ends up with a lot of plots along the lines of

#+begin_quote
  "Lord Black's alliance with Lord Green to lobby for tax exemptions for good X, which they both deal in while being antagonistic towards Lords Greengrass and Parkinson over a border dispute dating back to 1546. Lord Greengrass is also allied with Lord Miller, who refuses to intervene because that would put him at odds with his cousin Lord Green. Meanwhile, Lady Northe is opposing Lord Black because that would mean less profit for her since she produces good X and does not want to compete against the Black imports. Which brings in Lord..."
#+end_quote

And that's just such one dispute out of dozens of similar nature.

And while that could make a very interesting read along the lines of GoT books 1-3, you are looking at a massive project with hundreds of thousands of words and enough notes to fill an external harddrive.

*** That's exactly what I was thinking about. It would explain why the liberal faction didn't seemingly do anythin since the fall of Voldemort. Dumbledore doesn't have full control of the liberal faction. He could control the true liberal faction Augusta Longbottom controls the Liberal Traditional side and the Potter family used to lead the Liberal moderate faction.

I would have liked to see Grindelwald as the Liberal dark lord. He wanted to bring the wizarding world against the common enemy muggles. Maybe have the initial followers of Voldemort where anti Grindelwald. Maybe the conservative section wanted to go back to the way things were or the traditions were changing to fast.

**** I think that the biggest mistake you make is thinking in modern terms, possibly even biased by your national perception of them (liberal in the US or UK is very different to liberal in Germany for example). Most of their motivations and agendas do not translate well into the magical world.

Fractions would either be centered around characters like Dumbledore, common interest (eg merchants, land owners) or around marriage alliances more along the lines of noble fractions. Especially if the seats are hereditary. You are in the Wizengamot and get to decide on what your agenda is. You don't have to fulfill election promises or make popular choices, you have a seat and are going to use it according to your own interests and morals.

** The problem with such a split is that in the canon timeline, there's basically two sides: The side that fights a genocidal monster, and the scumbags. You can't really have a meangful political conflict when Voldemort's around - you either close ranks with the good guys, or you support the wizard nazis through inaction.

*** I guess a political situation is basically post Voldemort. If used during the Voldemort it possibly gives character X a reason to do Y. I guess basically just small fluff if it's not looked into. Like Lucius Malfoy keeps Arthur Weasley in his job to keep a pureblood as a department head and Arthur not having allot of political clout helps. Lucious can easily discrete him if need be.(world cup fiasco)

*** You can have plenty of underhand resistance through political intrigue. And Voldemort only ruled for eight months. Other than that, there's plenty of time for politics which are not as black and white. And even Voldemort's supporters can probably be divided into opportunists, believers, frightened people, coerced ones, and those who join him because he adresses their grievances when no one else did. And Voldemort's public face probably also had some agenda to attract the people, so you could have a group which agrees with the general ideology but not Voldemort personally and another who shares the goals but disagrees on the methods.

Most of those groups aren't nice, but there's certainly room for different shades of evil.

** I've always been bemused by the idea that you could be a neutral in the war against Voldemort. If you're not actively fighting him you are, at best a collaborator.

It's like the German trope that if there are 14 people sat at the table with a Nazi, what you have is 15 Nazis.
