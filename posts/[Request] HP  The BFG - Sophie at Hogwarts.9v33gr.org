I just watched the BFG again (the live action film) and suddenly wondered if there are any fics where Sophie is a witch, either pre- or post-BFG (though I think she's about 10 during that, so post-BFG is most logical).


** I haven't seen anything along those lines. Come to think of it, crossing The Witches would be a lark. Having another uncannily intelligent rodent bent on killing the better part of the country and all that.

** There are some Howl's Moving Castle/ HP crossovers if you would also like a different Sophie.
