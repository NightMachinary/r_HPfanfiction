** Well, Harry certainly believes this - or at least, believed this at one time. In HBP he calls himself "Dumbledore's man through and through" - which is both genuine and naive. After Dumbledore's death, Harry realises how very little he knows about Dumbledore personally. It is in DH that Harry questions - he questions Dumbledore's ideals, his motivations, his secretiveness. All of this is dependent on Harry /not/ having the greatest measure of who Dumbledore is prior to that.

Can they be said to have a close relationship /eventually/? In DH, Harry comes to understand Dumbledore like few men ever did. He, and he alone, gets significant details about Dumbledore's planning and motivations and past from Dumbledore himself.

Was it close from Dumbledore's end? There are only two people in the world who Dumbledore trusts to any significant extent - Severus Snape is one, and Harry Potter is another. Very few people have as much faith in Harry as Dumbledore. Dumbledore cares deeply for Harry's wellbeing, and loves him as much as he can love anybody.

But the thing is - Dumbledore didn't want any of that. Infact, Dumbledore considers his love for Harry as one of his biggest weaknesses. /Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now?/ asks Dumbledore at the end of OotP. He then answers his own question - /I cared about you too much./ If their relationship does become genuinely close, it is in spite of Dumbledore's wishes, not because of it.

In the end, Dumbledore and Harry understand each other better than almost anyone else, and admire the other person greatly. That probably does mean they have a close personal relationship, even if it is far from the traditional mentor-mentee relationship. But still, Rita Skeeter isn't entirely wrong when she says this:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh yes," says Skeeter, nodding briskly, "I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy's best interests -- well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence."

** There can be two reasons. Either because people misremember the books or they could be taking an outsider's perspective. Remember people know it was Dumbledore who hid Harry away from the Wizarding world. Ignore what you know and think about what other characters know.

In first year Harry Potter falls off his broom. Dumbledore comes to the next match to make sure he's safe. Harry Potter does something, rumours are flying and Dumbledore rewards him with enough points to turn the house cup in his favour.

Second year not much happens on the Harry Potter and Dumbledore bit except for the rumour that Dumbledore's pet phoenix helped Harry slay Slytherin's monster.

Third year, ignore the Sirius stuff. Harry Potter has an issue with Dementors so at the quidditch match Dumbledore drives them off, too slow to stop Harry fall but quick enough to save him before driving them away. Next match Harry Potter is capable of shooting the same spell Dumbledore used to drive away the dementors. Who knows its Lupin teaching him?

Fourth year, closed door meetings about the GoF and tri-wizard.

There is enough circumstantial evidence and rumour that if you don't know better you might think they were close.

** Because they should have had that sort of relationship, based on narrative tropes. Harry was Dumbledore's successor, so Dumbledore should have been his mentor. They were in similar situations of having to defeat Dark Lords, and Dumbledore had experience fighting Voldemort. But Dumbledore won through violence, and Harry won through magic.

** It was shallowly approached and a waste of potential, I think. Why in the world would anyone see them as close, I wouldn't even risk a guess other than wishful thinking

*** I've seen it described as close in a number of fics lately. I agree that it was a waste of potential in canon.

** It is simply perception of others seeing Dumbledore speak with Harry seemingly more. Students in the school seem never to have spoken with Dumbledore unless in trouble yet Harry is seen by many dealing with him and I doubt Ron would have hidden or not fanned the rumors with jokes and comments. But mainly people perceived Harry as the defeater of Voldemort and Dumbledore was his better in many eyes so no doubt they assumed he was mentoring Harry.

(Basically: The people are stupid and assume.)

** it is odd. the ease with which harry talks to dumbledore during the end of year discussions might imply a more casual relationship that happened alongside the books. perhaps he spent a lot of time walking around his school and talking to the students, and he talked to harry a lot. it's probably unlikely given that one awkward conversation about harry possible sleeping with hermione, but, why would everyone think of dumbledore as a good and helpful person if he spends his life locked in a tower like a hermit.

it's like harry being 'powerful' but somehow manages to go through six years of schooling and only learning about 8 spells in total. you just have to assume if harry wanted to transfigure something he probably could. he did learn more but it's never useful in the story.
