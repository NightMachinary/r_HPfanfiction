This one has Harry and Hermione be deeply in love at age twelve and when they kiss every problem in wizarding Britain. Every horcrux is destroyed and all the Death Eaters are weakened.

Harry finds out he is a wizard and Lord of 35 houses, He meets his new betrothed from an UNBREAKABLE marriage contract. He the boy who lived in a cupboard begins acting like a uptight dick and lectures muggleborns about how they are acting incredibly rude and not following etiquette in a society they were introduced with little to no warning and no preparation.


** Worst I've ever read? Gabby and fleur are talking to Dumbledore because beauxbatons burned down and they need to transfer. Fleur is so distraught that she needs to be fingered and more by gabby while talking to dumbles. Dumbles ignores this cause that's how veela are and tells them the only way they can transfer is if they enslave themselves to a British wizard. They demand harry who comes in trailing Hermione and ginny in collars and leashes and little else and dumbles leaves to allow harry to begin the slave bonding ritual. Sprinkle in some horrible grammar and filter through what I assume is the mind of a 13yo with only theoretical,if that, knowledge of sex and sit back while your brain tries to crawl out of your head amd throttle you for inflicting this on it

Then he goes back in time, creates Dementors, lives through history, including 200 years locked in solitary under the Ministry, and escapes when he realises he's reached his original time.

** - Harry is raised by goblins
- isn't allowed to use a wand so decides to use the Sword of Gryffindor instead
- he and Hermione pretty much fall in love during the first train ride to Hogwarts
- Harry has to declare Hermione "his betrothed" in order to save her from stupid goblin laws in the second year, Hermione's dad goes mental upon hearing this and Hermione and her mom tear him a new one
- I'm pretty sure there were huge beaches or islands owned by Harry where he takes either his entire year or the entire school on a class trip
- Harry constantly refers to Hermione as "my betrothed"

--------------

Here's another one:

Harry and Hermione and a number of talking portraits of different people like Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius are holding what can be best described as a press conference in Hogwarts where they are revealing what happened in the 7 years at school. This is followed by the author doing incredibly athletic ass pulls to explain how everything in canon was actually Ron's fault and anything that puts Harry, Hermione, Snape or Dumbledore in a bad light was hand-waved by "You only saw what we wanted you to see" and "it was just a prank bro". There's the usual bashing of Ron and Molly, I think. Oh and did I mention Hermione gives 11 year old Harry a hand job?

****** Yeah. That fic was just plain disgusting trying (and failing) to disguise itself as smart and pranky. Anything Hermione did that irritated Harry in canon was explained away as her being "caring and compassionate" and Harry's ire was "just an act". But when Ron did those exact things, he was "selfish and nosy" and didn't trust his friends. The mental gymnastics going on there were Olympic level.

If not, then I believe you may be mistaken. If you want to change the future, you'll have to change it in a way so that your future knowledge isn't useless. For example, if Harry time leaped to 4th year, just before the maze challenge, he'd be able to save Cedric, but if he stopped Voldemort's ressurection, then suddenly, what will happen next is unpredictable.

If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.
