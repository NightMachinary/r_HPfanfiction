Comment down your favourite writers. What specifically do you like about them? Is it their writing technique or their plot planning. .

. My two favourites are:

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] ... for his magicians' realism: following the spirit of the canon very well.

** I really like the way Lomonaaeren does plot and worldbuilding stuff, Realm of Song is exquisitely Tolkien-ian.

Realm of Song - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1423924]]

Joe, 'cause nobody writes 'Beat-Poet Harry looking into mysterious ancient shit he probably should not be looking into' better than him.

Wastelands - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

Unfound Door - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door]]

Gomez, because I really enjoy their portrayal of abuse in Hope and Healing and they do slow stuff real well. Also I've chatted with them on this sub occasionally/read chats they've had with others and they're a delight.

Hope and Healing - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13855500]]

Taliesin because Grow Young With Me is a truly exquisite thing and anyone that can create something like that is a beautiful-souled sentient indeed.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence][TheBlack'sResurgence]] Hands down, in my opinion, the best one out there. Consistently high quality and the stories he published so far are incredible. I do hope to see more from him though. He also creates a phenomenal opponent. You really don't see much thought put into your common Fanfiction counterpart. His /Stepping Back/ Tom Riddle is a perfect example of that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4788805/The-Sinister-Man][The Sinister Man]] While I only read /The Prince of Slytherin/ I find myself consistently checking my email to see if a new chapter has come out. The ability to create a believable world is extremely underrated and I think he deserves some high praise for his creative adaptions of common Fanfiction tropes and twists on the Harry Potter Canon.

Both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7037477/DarknessEnthroned][DarknessEnthroned]] also come to mind, though I, at this point, have only read /Letters/ by TheEndless7, and /A Cadamean Victory/ by DarknessEnthroned. Latter sadly one had one large complete story, while I, until now, didn't have the chance to read a few of the others from TheEndless7. (Definitely am planing it though.) Similar to TSM they really manage to twist the Harry Potter canon believably, allowing them easily to jump on my list.

Lastly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9153648/][OfMiceAndLice]] probably the least special of the bunch and hardly on the level of TBR, TSM or the other two, but I really enjoyed his latest story. I recommended it a couple of times on this site already. I think in a couple of stories, if he ever finished one, he would be on the level needed to make this list justifiably. I like his world painting though, he manages to create a vivid picture with his descriptions and I actually like some of his OC's and Characters in general.

** The first one which comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4314892/Colubrina][Colubrina]]. I love the variety of her work and how she plays with different tropes, writing styles, and aspects of the characters. Not all of her ships or plots are directly appealing to me, but I still try just about everything she writes. Plus, The Pretense is one of my all-time favourites.

Other authors who come to mind are: [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/aTasteofCaramell/pseuds/aTasteofCaramell][aTasteofCaramell]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/nasimwrites/pseuds/nasimwrites][nasimwrites]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/24216/Lady-Altair][Lady Altair]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1472545/BirdG][BirdG]].
