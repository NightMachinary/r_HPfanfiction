** Linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement) has a diamond in the rough Daphne that seems to be written deliberately counter to the ice queen trope.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** A Game of Style and Brutality features one of my favorite portrayals of Daphne; a lovely, genuinely kind person, that has real chemistry with Harry.

linkffn(7711029)

Contractual Invalidation features a more "traditional" fanon portrayal (sneaky, has a temper, wannabe aristocrat etc). However her character is fleshed out really well - and there's no Ice Queen nonsense, her temper runs hot, instead of cold. And most importantly, the pairing is really well balanced, in that Harry can stand his own against her, but without overshadowing her. Which is really rare.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  The most disturbing thing was the pool of blood. The coffee table itself was literately dripping blood onto Daphne's tan carpeting. Judging by the amount on and around the table, the smell in the air, and her friends clothes, the first conclusion someone would have had would have been she murdered someone in her sitting room. This was not an unfamiliar situation.
