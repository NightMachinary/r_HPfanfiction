** [[http://siriusxlily.livejournal.com/12723.html][Smoke Gets In Your Eyes]]. I read this a very long time ago so I don't clearly remember my thoughts. Here is Coffee and Chocolate's take on the story:

#+begin_quote
  A canon-compliant Lily/Sirius fic that manages to (fantastically!) document how Lily migrates from one Marauder to another without being dreadfully angsty or making her seem like a fickle shrew. Nellie writes with an entrancing voice that creates perfect imagery and captivating characters. What really wins me over is the excellent dynamics that she writes between the characters -- Lily and her conundrum between James and Sirius -- and how, despite it being a Lily/Sirius fic, she manages to fill in the transformational gaps for James from “arrogant, bullying toe-rag” to love of Lily's life and the Lily/James moments are precious. The final scene is possibly one of the best fanfiction end-offs I've ever read; it takes my breath away every time.

** I wrote this like a decade ago on a weird whim. Don't like it but won't delete it. I had some idea of something more than just one chapter, but turns out I'm way more of an essay writer than fiction author.

** Through the Looking Glass is a decent read and updated relatively frequently. Sirius/Lily isn't the main focus, but it will probably be a semi-important plot point: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11072187/9/Through-The-Looking-Glass]]
