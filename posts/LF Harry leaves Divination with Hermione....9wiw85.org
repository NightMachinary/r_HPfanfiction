...and does not come back (don't know if you have to have two electives, but if you do: Then he probably signs up for something else which is rather easy this early in third year! Frankly being one or two lessons behind is not all that bad!)

​

Bonus points if it's not a canon-rehash (seriously, why is re-writing canon what so many writers do? I've read the books - except the last because I couldn't stomach how Rowling dismantles Harry (he becomes the idiot who's unable to plan, despite for the first time having had months to prepare for a situation, for the 'crux-hunt! Seriously, Hermione did plan but even she left out most of the things I'd have taken, like a bottomless bag with non-perishable shelf-stable food! This way Ron would not run away because he's hungry!)! I don't need a rehash!)

​

As always: No slash please - and only well written Harry/Ginny (have read a lot of that pairing and it really isn't my fave!)

​

So, thanks for your help, the stage is your's :)

​

ps: Wow! Down-Vote-Train on the move again! Seriously, maybe the downvote option should be removed? (It is after all not an "I disagree"-Button!) -.-

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  this early in third year

IIRC she leaves rather late in the year (Trelawney's prophecy was about some month the next spring).

I am writing a story which fits some of your criteria (no canon rehash, no idiotic Harry, he ditches Divination) but I am not so sure about some others. Ron is written out on neutral terms (no big fight or evil plotting, he does not believe Harry and that's it). Also, Ginny plays no role whatsoever (she will be mentioned exactly twice).

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

**** Keep in mind that it is rather "slice of life"-like. So if you are looking for action and explosions, this won't be the fic for you. And while Harry is a little disgruntled with Hermione at the beginning, they patch things up by the start of the fourth year.
