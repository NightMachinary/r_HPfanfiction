Harry is trained by an individual who, with the power of runes, is able to tap into others core/leylines as a source of power. Only Harry doesn't know this. Harry thinks that he is just very weak and strives to be better. A way to do this is that moody has these special rune stones that tap into a leyline or remus and Sirius cores and uses that extra power to continue to do the facade in training.

Anyway you take this idea, I'm up for it.

Thanks redditors.
