Looking for fics where Harry is the Wrong BWL because of a brother of his (twin or younger). Also, his family forgetting him, not outright abuse, just neglect.

He needs to be practical and think logically but doesn't need to be in Ravenclaw. Needs a romantic interest.

Also needs to be well written (obviously) and long (30-50K+ words with 10-15K+ chapters). Compacted stories with a lot of writing into fewer chapters basically.
