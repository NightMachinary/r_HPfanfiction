Looking for fics where harry has a oc guardian.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283][Dragonheart Caravan]] is a good example of this. LOTS of OCs throughout. Not sure I love the story. There's a lot lacking but the idea is cool: a travelling group of squibs who practice different magics & come from all over the world. They adopt Harry.

**** Yes. The author changed the name (understandably) when posting it later to AO3.

** Blood Crest was surprisingly very good, although it's definitely pretty dark in places (esp towards the start). Harry is sort of unintentionally kidnapped by a German dark wizard who doesn't realise he's the BWL when he's about 9. Things are pretty terrible for him from them on but the Harry it creates is very interesting. An enjoyable read, esp if you treat it as 5% crack.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

** No idea if this counts but I recently read a fic where James survives Voldemort and meets a woman who hits it off with Harry and becomes a close guardian figure (SPOILER: becomes stepmother). It is written incredibly well and is the first in a trilogy (last book is WIP).

It's published on WattPad by KMBell and is called "Nepenthe".

  Happily or unhappily, depending on who you asked, he fared no better than his lackey had. Chief Warlock or not, some pain pathways, generally taught as the first thing a girl should know about self-defense, are simply impossible to ignore. Furthermore, it is very hard to cast spells when a large marble rolling pin has just broken your wand arm, which was why Natasja had purchased it in addition to a plain wooden one, which she used for actual cooking.

The movements are to raise your wand and swat. The incantation is "Ahm'Gonna BraykUr'Ahm."
