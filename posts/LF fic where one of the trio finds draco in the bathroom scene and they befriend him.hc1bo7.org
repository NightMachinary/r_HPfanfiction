Oke, so I was wondering if anyone knows any good fic with this as the turning point. I don't care who is the main character.

I found a couple when I Googled but it always starts already with some kind of romantic things being pointed out for example if they pick him of the ground they look into his 'beautifull grey eyes' or they notice how warm his hands are... something like that. I would like it if there is no romance involved from the get go. Romance could become a thing later but not in that scene itself, and I would prefer it to not be the focus of the story. I would love some good redemption arc and friendship building :D

I would be ever so greatfull for some new reading material. If you do know some good stuff about befriending Draco which do not start with this specific scene I would still appreciate it :D
