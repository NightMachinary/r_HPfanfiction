Couple things I remember about this fic. One, Moody leaks Azkaban escape date to Bones and Sirius casts some Black family magic on Azkaban preventing prisoners from escaping. Another is that Harry is on the loose, free from Dumbledore and the ministry.


** I think I know which one you're talking about, though I can't think of the title yet and it's driving me mad. Can you remember if:

1) Harry grew apart from his friends (some bashing), and when he left the school he gave them each a sort of slap-in-the-face gift (like I think Neville got armor because the two were supposed to fight the war together, but Neville bailed because of a girl or something)

1. Harry, Sirius, and Moody, along with a fourth masked person who turned out to be Amelia Bones, fought together as vigilantes.

2. Moody dies in battle, Bones reveals herself as the fourth for some reason (and I think Susan Bones is a fairly important character)

*** Nah, none of that sounds familiar. You seem to be referencing JackPotr though. Check out his stuff.
