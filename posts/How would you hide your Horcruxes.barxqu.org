Here's my plan:

First, which item? It'd obviously be preferable to make it useful somehow, like the Diary or Nagini which could be weaponized, but in a way that doesn't endanger it.

So, here's my choice: A supercomputer. Magic only disturbs tech if there's way too much of it from hundreds of students and ancient enchantments, since people don't notice their phones failing when walking past the Leakey Cauldron a little bit should be fine.

I'll slightly modify the Horcrux ritual to keep a connection between the Horcrux and myself, like Nagini or Harry's scar, so that I can communicate with it. It's task will be to be my personal assistant, like Iron Man's JARVIS, just that I can access it with a though. If I need something, I just need to think the question and my Horcrux assistant will Google it for me.

Now, where will I put it? I obviously need to have a good internet connection, but I can do that using protean charms for untraceable wireless communication, and I can use more magic to provide power. My best choice for a location would probably be outer space, since wizards don't appear to have a space program even though magic makes it ridiculously easy. So, I'll put my Horcrux computer on a invisible magical satellite in orbit, and instruct it to change orbits randomly. The only way to find out where it is would be for me to politely ask it through my mental connection.

If I have a completely undetectable invisible satellite providing me with all the information I need, I might as well use its vast intelligence and multitasking capabilities. So, if wizards can animate statues, magical robots should be easy. I'll build an army of robots that my superintelligent AI Horcrux satellite can manage and control. No need for Death Eaters.

In case I die, I don't want to spend years in a forest, so I'll prepare everything for multiple resurrection rituals and have a robot ready to perform it, and locate both in the only perfectly safe location: The satellite itself. If it's invisible, might as well make it space station sized. The robot can then also perform maintenance on the Horcrux computer to ensure everything keeps running smoothly. I'll also put a fully automatic robot factory on the station to produce more robots so I never run out.


** I would hide mine in .... TOTAL NONEXISTENCE, MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!

Seriously, they were invented at /least/ back in Herpo the Foul's day (which is a long way back, he also invented the Basilisk, and Pliny the Elder included them in his /Natural History/ in the 1st Century) and in all the time from that day to this we haven't been completely subjugated by an immortal Dark Lord?

Clearly the wretched things don't work as advertised, and the modern-day exponent of the practise is no great advertisement for the side effects. The cognitive degradation /alone/ is a deal-breaker.

So it's not unreasonable to suppose that Voldemort's bad case of frothing lunacy had something to do with the horcruxes.

The other possibility, of course, is that half his family being multiple generations of brother-sister incest left him with an inherited mental health problem.

*** This.

Horcruxes are more trouble than they're worth, even without taking into account having to murder someone to make one (suppose you have an enemy you hate; as a wizard or witch the rules of society already have a shaky grip on you at best, unless you let them).

If I were a Rowling-style wizard, I'd study human transfiguration as my discipline of choice to try for prolonging my life. This (along with very effective magical medicine when things go wrong physically) is my head canon for why some of the characters who aren't deep into the Dark Arts and don't take the Flamels' +Elixir+ Spice of Life ^{Dune or not, the Spice must flow!}, such as the Dumbledore bros, are long-lived and a lot more vigorous in their golden years, than any human being has business being.

These is no reason to believe magic on the scale of preserving your soul wont interfere with electronics, especially as delicate as a supercomputer.

** Hm, depends I guess.

Either something innocuous that I could keep on my person that would never raise suspicion. Maybe a horcruxified hairtie? Or one of these contraception-chips that are implanted under the skin? A dental crown maybe?

Or something that can be used for self defense, a bit of hurcrux-induced selfawareness will probably enhance it's potency - Tommy had a nice idea with Nagini there. Maybe a selfaware bodyguard-drone once the technology has matured to a point where they are actually useful?

Sadly we don't know what exactly was required to restore Voldemort to a fully functional body (and what different ways there would have been), because you could double-porpuse one of these requirements and also use it as a horcux - less exposure to danger that way and it can be more efficiently guarded. Also, its a failsafe: If your way back to a body is destroyed anyway, an eternity as wraith seems like unneccessary torture. Personally I'd prefer death over that. That is why, while all those ideas about dumping a rock into the ocean etc. are certainly effective, they are no option for me. There are worse things than death after all, and if the hideout it too good for even me to retrieve the Horcrux, I might sentence myself to an eternity of suffering without a way out.

** It really depends on what's required for your horcrux to help bring you back and what are the requirements of a horcrux vessel. If it can be anything (or even just anything with sufficient volume/surface area) and merely needs to exist, then probably the best thing to do would be to enchant a random brick, throw a dart at a world map, go to where it lands and install/insert the brick into a building or something.

No connections to you at all. You might have to spend a little more effort in making it unfindable by magic, but there ya go, though the HP verse seems to be pretty sparse on 'find it' divination magics. Even the "point me" spell, cannonically, only points north and not to whatever you want.

******* I honnestly don't understand why Voldemort was so dismissive of Wormtail. I mean when you think about it, the guy is quite competent.

- He managed to be a spy for several month, and even gave Voldemort the location of the Potter, he can't be help responsible for the whole "Boy-Who-Lived" thing that followed.

- He tricked a powerful wizard into taking the blame for his crime, and even to make people think he is dead.- While living 12 years as a rat is definitively a fail, (why did he not just left to Australia or whatever and started a new life as Piere Pivert or whatever?), he still managed to hide in plain sight and probably managed to give Voldemort some interesting information when he came back.- He found Voldemort. The good guys seeked him and failed, the bad guys maybe tried and failed (not to sure about that), but he did it. And he even captured a Ministry worker on the way which led to GoF plan.- He resurected Voldemort, he did the ritual. Voldemort may has Harry's blood, but he is his flesh.

Having a follower like this is a win in my book (especially if he is only one in many).

So, why Pettigrew may not be as talented than a Bellatrix or a Snape, he still showed some true talent and cuning. And I don't understand why Voldemort relegated him to a post of servant for Snape (except if he is still crossed with the secret keeper things but other did as bad, like Lucius and it still took more faillure to really loose his place).
