With Draco Malfoy as Main Character?

Something like:

-He goes back in time to get revenge?

-He goes back in time and replaces Vold emort as main villian?

-He can have a Dragon or control Dragons?

-He becomes friends with Harry, Hermione and Ron and helps them. (While been in Slytherin)

Suggestions?


** Closest i can give is linkffn(i'm still here) but he is not main character sadly.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I've got a few.

linkffn(7819644)

linkffn(5134678)- Draco time travels to the Marauders era!

linkffn(2538955)- technically, Draco's not the main character, but he is a major character as the only other person who time travels.

linkao3(1030535)

linkffn(8601821)- This has sequels, but also has an odd OC in it. She doesn't figure much at first, more in the sequels, but... it's odd.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

  AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]
