** Yes, please, more positive Lavender Browns! My pet peeve lately is how in *EVERY FREAKING* fem!Harry (gender-bending) all other girls (except for Hermione) are complete bitches to her. I can understand Ginny (if she was hoping to date Harry, and suddenly she is out of luck), but why cannot at least once Lavender, Paravati & al. just welcome fem!Harry to the girls dorms with open arms. “Hello, welcome to the nice side!” (and Hermione or other muggleborn mutters in the background “... we have cookies!”).

It is slightly the best I can take from “Problem of Susan” by Neil Gaiman: why cannot fourteen-year-old girl be just that: chatting with her best friend about robes, boys, and gossip? What's wrong with that? Or why her ambition cannot be some lighter and fluffy: owning her own boutique (I like her portrait and Paravati in “[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]]”), being a journalist for Witch Weekly, etc.

****** All of their work is set in the same AU - I believe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6342013/1/Hunters-and-Prey][this]] is the first fic that introduces Lavender in a prominent way.

Northumbrian writes mainly post-canon fics that are fairly canon-compliant but were written pre-Cursed Child. The starting point is that Lavender survived the final Battle at Hogwarts but has a cursed scar that has left her chronically ill. And then the story of where her character goes goes from there. Northumbrian never loses sight of the fact that she was sorted into Gryffindor, but also that she *is* a girl who likes feminine things and there's nothing wrong with that. (Which is something that really appeals to me)

** Oooh! I've got a nice way to seque in this.

You know how every time Trelawney predicts Harry's death in the books?

IT'S NOT HER, IT'S LAVENDER, letting her own stuff slip while gossiping with her fav teacher.

and Trelawney being Trelawney the awkward, alcoholic hermit, has no idea how to change those prophecies without yelling them at Harry, who ignores it. Then seeing how Harry is stupid as hell, and had his ass stuffed full with his own head and teenage angst, decided she might as well deal with it herself.

And it turns out, she's real damn good at kicking supernatural ass trying to harm her student. Unfortunately, she spends the rest of her time being drunk off her ass, and so life goes on.

**** You can even add a few twists. The reason she's such a drunk, was because she used to be famous as an actual Prophetess as a little girl, her Inner Eye was not only real, she had given more than a 100 true Prophecies as a kid. Unfortunately, something happened, she grew up, she hated her parents who milked everything to the max, and eventually she lost her Inner Eye. Or rather, it seems to be kinda stunted due to her own stunted emotional/social growth, and now rather than see into the future, the best it can do, is see about 1 minute or so into the future, which is rather "useless" all things considered.

All it was really good for now was minor inconsequential things like always knowing where she can dump the next empty bottle of sherry, or how to dodge a dragon, how to kick a troll's ass or how to keep all the other beasties in the Lake too busy to bother Harry. Little things like that.

So she became a useless drunk living off past glories.

Until she heard Lavender spouting off gossip about some really odd stuff like flying horses and flaming pits of death and rescuing maidens from abyssal watery depths. To anyone else, it pretty much sounds like complete gibberish. To a legit former Prophetess who has done almost everything she could to get her Inner Eye back though, she knows what those words really mean.

And so she sets about trying to avert those words, by yelling the literal meaning into Poor Harry's point blank face, because she's just as socially crippled as him, just not as mopey or timid.

And did it work? Course not. Everyone just thinks she's crapping nonsense out again.

And then, seeing as he's still too busy moping and angsting to do anything about it, she sets out trying to fix things herself, whether its due to her own status as a former Seer, or because of how much research she has done on Prophecies, even if she wants to be known as a Seer again, there's no worth in that if it comes from letting her own student get skewered on his own idiocy.

** I remember this one fic where lavender got scratched by fenrir so she didn't turn into a werewolf, but she had a huge craving for raw meat and she was friends with bill weasley because he understood what she was going through. She was kind of a badass in that because she learned how to deal with her oddities and she helped other characters overcome their oddities. The only problem is I don't remember the fanfic.
