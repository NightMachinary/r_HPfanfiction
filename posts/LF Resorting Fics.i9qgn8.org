** This one is fantastic. I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.

This one wasn't for me, but what I read was very well written.

Excellent, but incomplete. The author says it's not abandoned though.

This isn't a resorting. Hogwarts does a house exchange program, and Harry visits every house.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

  Draco thinks it's rubbish that people suspect Harry is the Heir of Slytherin, but that doesn't mean he won't use that to his advantage. Harry? He's all alone now, unable to face his friends. Lucky for him, he's found a Diary that he can confide in.
