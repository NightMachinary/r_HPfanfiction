Floo powder-powder! Floo powder-powder! Floo powder-powder!

This almost requires one of the horcruxes to be a Zach Effron poster.

*** Just a preference. I don't find a lot of fem Harry stories around. Although, I think a male Harry would be more comical as well as ideal. Males in the musical theater industry, small businesses, local and nonprofessional, are very stereotyped. It would make Harry stand out even more at school and in the magical world, as there is very little reference to theater in the books besides the frog choir and references to magical bands and such. I can imagine that his interest would have a big impact on the magical world as well, considering that a celebrity is interested in such “muggle” things. This prompt was just an idea that's been floating around in my head for days.
