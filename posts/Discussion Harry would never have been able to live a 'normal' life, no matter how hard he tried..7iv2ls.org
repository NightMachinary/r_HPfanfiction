I don't like the epilogue. It feels so cliche - a tack-on to the events of Deathly Hallows, with no real changes and unrealistic outcomes.

I know what you're thinking? "Unrealistic"? HP is a series about magic! Yeah, it is about wonderful magic, but even then it still needs to make /sense/ and flow well with the rest of the series. I do want Harry to find happiness and love; he deserves it more than a lot of people do. But the events of the epilogue? All one big happy Weasley family - a normal, white-picket-fence life? I don't think Harry would have or want that life, especially with everything he has been through - including his childhood before Hogwarts.

Given the abuse he suffered from the Dursleys, Harry would have a VERY skewed perception of "normal" and most likely hate it. Even with exposure to other, actually normal people, it is still limited exposure. Then one day Harry discovers that he is a wizard... before the next seven years are filled with the best and worst moments of his life. Particularly, the events of Deathly Hallows, which put not only Harry but his friends through the ringer. Therefore, this is how I think should have happened in the epilogue:

At the end of the battle, Harry would try, and oh would he *try* to be "normal" and get back together with Ginny. After all, that is what normal people do, right? But the war changed them - it changed practically everyone. They both try to make it work, but in the end decide that being friends would be more suitable. Ron and Hermione may have a relationship, but it is filled with bumps and pitfalls, and it is NOT a smooth ride.

Back to Harry, the Boy-Who-Won still has nightmares, he still has duties to fulfil. So he does them... and it feels /right/. It isn't exactly peace, yet Harry feels at ease with what he does. Once every DE scum is rounded up, Harry hears about some missing people cases in France, followed by a string of kidnappings in Norway, to rumours about a rising dark lord as far away as mainland China. Gradually, Harry becomes more skilled and more powerful, as he travels the world and does good. In places where people can't stand for themselves, Harry comes raining down like hellfire on those who abuse the weak. Voldemort's defeat wasn't just down to dumb luck.

On one visit to another country, after saving the city from a legitimate dark lord, Harry finds an orphaned child who is barely a year old. With no living relatives or potential carers, Harry feels conflicted. After all, the child's life will be in danger if Harry adopts him/her. In the end, it is an easy decision - and the Potter family feels a little bit bigger. Speaking of family, Harry still keeps in contact with Ron, Hermione, and everyone else. Years later, his now pre-teen son/daughter, informs him of Ron and Hermione *finally* tying the knot - this is only moments after dealing with a particularly tricky creature incident. It may not be a "normal" life, but Harry wouldn't have settled for anything else.


** There's some interesting discussion going on in this thread about what Harry would or wouldn't want, but I think there's something else that needs to be mentioned:

The epilogue in no way points to Harry having a normal life.

If there's /one/ day of any year that everyone would put on a mask and pretend to be normal, it's the day that all of the children are sent off to school. For all the epilogue says, Ron and Hermione's marriage could be dissolving, Teddy could be a high-functioning alcoholic playboy, and Ginny could be a closet lesbian using Harry as a beard because of her somewhat old-fashioned parents and wizarding society. Precisely none of that would have shown while the kids are boarding the Hogwarts Express.

Not saying that any of the above is my personal headcanon, but it's impossible to judge entire lives on a really narrow sample of a day where all of the characters have strong reasons to wear masks.

*** This is exactly what I was thinking. We saw one moment 19 years later of them, and they were having a happy moment. They could have a happy family with still MANY issues underlying.

Whether or not you want to consider Cursed Child canon, considering JK said it's canon, and we see Harry's life is definitely NOT that great, it is very clear that the epilogue moment is probably not an entire telling of their future life.

*** True, but we can deduce from Rowling's comments since the series was finished, along with the line "all was well" that Harry ultimately was leading a happy, good life at least. I mean, technically, yes, it all could be for show at that moment, but do you really think Rowling intended us to interpret that scene in such a way?

At the end of the day, it is still fiction. While in reality Harry probably would have a hard time dealing with everything as he starts to come to terms with the trauma of his childhood and teenage years, I personally am happy with the belief that he made it through and is overall a well-adjusted, happy adult with the family he always wanted.

And even within the context of a more realistic view of things, I believe that the support structure that had built up around Harry would allow him to make it through those first few years when he theoretically would be at his worst. For example, one of the reasons Ginny works so well for Harry is her ability to comfort him and provide the exact thing he seems to need in the moment. She would be able to handle his mood swings and be there for him when the past sneaks up on him; in fact I think comforting Harry during this period allows Ginny to deal with her own issues.

I forgot what fic it was (think it was one of little0bird's post-war fics) but the author wrote about how Harry led a normal, happy life but every so often he'd have a bad few days that forced him to relive the war. I think my headcanon follows that, that Harry is able to have his happy life, but there are always moments where he gets really down and depressed about his past, but the support structure around him allows him to deal with it in a healthy way.

** There's a lot of conjecture here, and it all starts with how you consider Harry's upbringing. I'm firmly in the camp, that Harry suffered very little physical abuse-if any at all-and loads of isolation and bullying from his peers. The immediate effect? A desire for family and companionship, more than normality.

I also believe that Harry and Hermione joined the Ministry because they were intent on changing the world. A lot of the fandom's thoughts on Harry's post-ministry life was based on the idea that he's "tired" of saving the world. In canon, he's never /not/ wanted to fight Voldemort. For him, he has a personal stake in it, he wants to kill the man who murdered his parents.

I also think Harry's an auror because it's all he knows how to do, and enjoys it. He's spent his entire life "fighting" the Dark Arts. He doesn't know how to be an Arithmancer, or a regular ministry worker, or a professor. He knows how to fight, and so he keeps on doing that. By the epilogue, I see The Potter-Weasleys as the equivalent of the Clintons or the Bushes. They're effectively the family in charge of the ministry, and they push their ideology. I wouldn't be surprised if they did their level best to have their children replace them.

And after the Big Bad was down, there was still tons of cleaning up work to be done. It would be a terrible waste of opportunity to NOT follow up their decisive victory at Battle of Hogwarts. It would be a terrible disgrace to their fallen comrades if they didn't follow up with far reaching reforms. The mistakes after the First War SHALL NEVER BE REPEATED!

***** I don't remember Lucius being freed. Several issues here:

- The biggest difference from the first war is that the Malfoys learned their lesson. They fell out of favor with Lord Voldemort and learned the ugly man that lay behind the pleasant facade.
- Draco is a bit of a pariah. He married another pureblood that supposedly didn't want to raise their son how Draco had been raised. Rowling notes that he's independently wealthy, but not influential. I imagine he leads a quiet and solitary life.
- Narcissa saves Harry's life. If she doesn't lie, Harry dies there, and who knows what happens.

Forgiveness over punishment works properly if used properly. The reason the Malfoys needed punishment after the first war, is that they hadn't understood the wrong in what they had done. The second war, they understand the mistake they made, and they paid dearly. Lucius loses influence, Narcissa loses family. Draco becomes a relatively decent person.

It's not confirmed, but I believe that Lucius Malfoy received leniency for giving evidence for several Death Eaters, allowing them to truly punish rabid followers like Dolohov, McNair, etc.

The Malfoys walked free, but the inherent problem was on it's way to being solved. Voldemort wasn't the problem, but merely the catalyst. The idea that muggleborns are taking over wizarding culture had been around for several centuries, and tensions rose to the point that Voldemort set them off.

By the end of the second war, there's a considerable power vacuum, allowing Harry & co to take control, and do their best to erase that line of thinking. So, yes, they did succeed.

First, I detest the manipulative "evil" Dumbledore trope. Dumbledore made his share of mistakes, as any human being, including Harry, has done. But he is a good person, and did work for the betterment of the wizarding world.

I've explained multiple times on different comments on my thoughts on Harry's abuse at the Dursleys, and his character. My most recent is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7izrsn/best_truly_grey_harry_working_fully_for_himself/dr3zzau/][this]] The final conclusion is this: /Rowling didn't write Harry as an abuse character, and presents several facts of evidence contrary to that conclusion/ This is important to keep in mind when analyzing Harry's actions and motives.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Treason doesn't necessarily cause a death sentence. Bradley Manning wasn't sentenced to death. Capital punishment is a big deal. It's not handed down lightly. Again, the end of the 2nd war is radically different from the first. The first was closer to putting down a terrorist cell. The second was a civil war. The end created a power vacuum, allowing Harry and the Order to establish themselves as the leaders.

This is all conjecture. But, Harry /isn't/ a poster boy. He's not a kid anymore. He practically runs the ministry with Hermione and Kingsley. Twenty years later, Harry is the head of the DMLE (think Secretary of Defense/Homeland Security) and Hermione is the minister.

That' just canonically false. Lucius Malfoy isn't a part of the wizengamot. I assume that's from fanon. In OoTP, Malfoy is waiting outside the courtroom for the result of Harry's trial. Considering Harry's trial required the full Wizengamot, by basic deduction, we can conclude Lucius Malfoy /isn't/ in the Wizengamot

The Epilogue itself really didn't say much and only gave up a 'normal' feeling, but underlying things changed dramatically, if you take everything JKR later said in consideration.

We had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qxmgc/are_the_weasleypotters_the_new_super_wizarding/][a long discussion]] here about the future of Weasley-Potter after the war. Here is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qxmgc/are_the_weasleypotters_the_new_super_wizarding/dl0rnll/][my take]] on this subject.

Instead of going alone, Harry obviously chose the option of using Ministry's security forces as private army to protect his interests and push his agenda. The Ministry of 2017 would be populated by their allies, followers, and sycophants. The only thing better than a Dark Lord is a Dark Lord with a badge.

I'm gonna have to disagree with that. Ron and Hermione's problems always stemmed from outside forces, aside from Ron's insecurity, which was pretty much done away with by the end of the series. Fight third year was about their pets. Fourth year was about Krum. Sixth year was about Lavender. Deathly Hallows was the locket and Harry. They bicker all the time, but that's just their way, like an old married couple.

Out of all of the endgame pairings, I think Ron and Hermione would have been better off than anyone else.

*** Yeah right, Ron's the only one insecure...right! WRONG! Hermione is just as insecure! Her studying and being the best stems from that, in fact I believe Hermione's home life (which not abusive!) wasn't all that great, especially since she seems to emulate adults more than her fellow teenagers! Not to mention that Hermione doesn't know what fun is and how to relax, kick back and not study for a change!

Hermione also believes she has to be right all the time - and can't admit it when she isn't (Firebolt! Sure her heart was in the right place when she snitched about it, but she shouldn't have nonetheless! If she was so concerned then she should have taken her Gryffindor bravery and taken out the broom for a spin herself, just to check if it's cursed etc.! Then there's the Malfoy thing! She abandon's Harry to moon over Ron who finally moved on from carrying a torch for her (and she's unhappy about it, despite the fact that she treats him like shit!) and in the end the DEs invade the school because she didn't want to believe that Harry was right about Draco "I am a bully and a traitor who deserves to die, painfully!" Malfoy!

No, old married couples don't do that - that's such a stupid idea! People who argue all the time don't stay together, especially if it's fundamental stuff like society's problems (anti-muggleborn bias and slavery) or manners (Ron's manners don't change over the course of the series, he eats like a pig - Hermione is more refined than that!), don't stay together to even become "old married couples" (good natured ribbing ok, but not actual fighting which devolves into fucking shouting matches without a buffer - Harry!)

** I've stated on this subreddit many times I feel the epilogue is too clean. While I have no issue with Ginny it does come across as if the series is wrapped up with a happily ever after when book by book we see more and more failings of wizarding Britain. There are many takes on post-Hogwarts stories and I can buy the idea behind many of them partly because there is such potential.

Harry's life in the wizarding world was defined by Voldemort. His whole life prophecy had forced them against each other. Ideological differences and the whole killing parents things too, who is Harry Potter when Voldemort is no longer a factor. To the world he's a hero but for Harry who is he? His formative years have been spent focusing on surviving he never really stops to think about what comes next. He considers becoming an auror in the 5th book and we see progression towards that in the sixth and in JKR's post-series works (Which I tend to stick my fingers in my ears, shut my eyes and pretend never happened.) It would be understandable if Harry said, I'm done and took a long holiday. He's never had a holiday in his life, not one. If he went alone, say while Ron and Hermione went off to Australia and Harry just vanished for a while I suspect he'd come back a different person.

We know Harry feels guilty for those that died. He has a history of doing so. What effects would that have on him? Would he speak to a professional about it? Would he join the aurors or some other group looking to find redemption. To continue to help and to serve since its all he knows how to do? What does Harry Potter want now he's survived Voldemort? He says to be normal but surely at some point he accepts that he wouldn't know where to start with normal and even if he tries, nobody will accept him being normal.

It seems to me Cross-Overs in general pick up on these themes more so than regular HP fanfictions. Whether that is because they use it as a device to start the cross-over or it reflects their actual views I don't know. Perhaps it relates to them knowingly twisting canon in merely creating a cross-over that they feel no need to guide Harry to the future laid out in the epilogue.

#+end_quote

Even if Harry feels guilty for all those deaths, it would be an old, comfortable guilt. I believe in the years after the war his friends would convince him that the war was much bigger than just him. It would be the height of egomania for him to continue to believe that he was the only one responsible for a confict that raged for 20-30 years. I think Harry would intellectually accept that he was not responsible for the majority of shit that went wrong, even if he kept an emotional gut reaction of feeling guilty about everything.

Extremely doubtful. He would speak with his friends and maybe someone that could understand what he went through, like Andromeda. But not a stranger.

#+end_quote

Redemption for what?

#+begin_quote
  To continue to help and to serve since its all he knows how to do?
#+end_quote

To continue to help, sure. Serve, however? After the way the ministry fucked up everything, I think Harry chose to go that way in order to shape things the way he preferred and to keep an eye on things, much more than wishing to "serve". I don't think that Harry would ever willingly serve anyone. It makes sense that after defeating Voldemort the new ministry would give him a lot of informal power, if only to keep the public happy - out of the understanding that should Harry speak out against the government, it would basically crumble.

#+begin_quote
  What does Harry Potter want now he's survived Voldemort?
#+end_quote

I think his #1 goal is to keep his friends and family safe. Especially with Teddy, he would probably feel that for the first time, there's a person that is almost totally dependent on him. That is powerful motivation for wanting to fix the corrupt cesspit that is the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Where does it say that he wishes to be normal? I believe that he wants not to be stared at and gawked, rather than have a Dursley-ish version of normalcy.

Anyway I think that Harry would sooner realize and accept that he can never have anonymity and would have to settle into his fame with some amount of grace, even if it would have to be faked.

**** I'm not so certain Harry would come to terms with his guilt without speaking to a professional about it; guilt doesn't tend to be rational for your average person and Harry really seemed to struggle with it in canon. When he's actually the Chosen One who had to defeat Voldemort (and he knows that's the case), do you think it'd be that easy to shake off thoughts about whether he could have finished the Horcrux Hunt or finally defeated Voldemort just a little bit faster or better? And who might be alive if he did so?

I agree that rationally, he SHOULD realize that prophecy and Voldemort's obsession aside, lots of people were going to die in the 2nd Wizard War and there's not a lot he could have done about it, but he's in a uniquely bad position to think logically about it like that.

Exact retributions on Voldemort's remnants and make them PAY.

Destroy them economically, financially, politically, and if necessary, physically.

Reform/Revolutionize Magical Britain so people he cared about would NEVER have to go through that again.

This is a popular thing for fandom!Harry to want, but I don't think it particularly fits with his canon character. As you've mentioned in another comment, Harry is an extremely reactive person. He'll become an Auror because he doesn't know what else to do, but what he actually wants is to be left alone both by the general wizarding public and dark wizards in particular. He has his 'saving people thing', but that only pushes him to act when people have already been wronged. If that motivation kicks in enough for a fulfilling life, magical Britain is a pretty crappy place.

After what those people had gone through, it should be expected that most of them would undergo significant changes, for better or worse.

** Can't stand for themselves? In a society where everybody carries the equivalent of a tactical nuke in their pocket? Yes, tactical nuke! A wand can deal a lot of fucking damage, so comparing it to a gun or even a rocket-launcher doesn't do it justice (Fiend-Fire anybody?...Cast that a couple of times all over London and a lot of the city will be destroyed, especially if the wizard or witch doing it apparates around and lets the fire go out of control on purpose!)! So yes they could fight for themselves, they just don't - sure some have good reasons ("Can't endanger my family!" or "I am no good in a fight!"), but that still doesn't make it ok! You can hide your family (send them away or errect a fidelius!) and then you can fight!

I totally agree with you however that Harry wouldn't be able to live a normal life! The guy thinks he doesn't deserve that, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to sacrifice himself as he did (for a world that has hurt him a lot! From placing him with the Dursleys to forcing him into the TWT to smearing him in the media and locking him up with the Dursleys again and again!)!

Harry would need treatment for PTSD etc. and he would need people who, unlike most of the adults in HP, stand up for him and make him realized that he does deserve a certain respect (especially for sacrificing himself!) and that he deserves love (and that betrayal comes at a cost - Sorry Ron, but a mumbled appology doesn't cut it when you endanger somebody's life twice (during the TWT and when he leaves on the horcrux hunt!)) and Harry also needs somebody to help he re-take his OWLs (after making an effort in his subjects, which he didn't really...probably out of fear because he probably wasn't allowed to outperform Duddley in primary school and because he didn't want to fight with Hermione (look at how miffed she is about being outperformed in HBP, despite that fact that Harry kind of does have to shine in this book to get closer to Slughorn! Harry offered to share the Prince's book with her, too but no, she was a prissy little bitch about it!)) and to take his NEWTS!

Harry being an auror wouldn't help matters IMHO especially since it doesn't seem that justice was allowed to happen (all the Malfoys should have gone to prison for a long long time!) and that the pureblood elite (who control the ministry!) are still in power...Harry would hate to be their enforcer!

Hell, I don't think Harry would adopt as easily...then again I also don't think he'd marry straight out of Hogwarts (he was muggle raised and marrying at 18 or 20 isn't the norm anymore, hell it's highly abnormal!) and I don't know if he'd have kids!

I agree that Harry might take up traveling and dealing with Dark-Lord-Wanna-Bes and that life really isn't great for having kids (you can't protect them easily and raising a kid in a wizard's tent? I don't think so, especially since that kid would never have any friends because of all the moving around (Harry wouldn't subject a kid to that IMHO!)
