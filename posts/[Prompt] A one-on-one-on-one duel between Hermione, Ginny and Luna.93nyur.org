**Bonus**

- Muggle tactics are allowed
- Harry and/or Ron and/or Neville seeing the fight, and then running for the hills.


** An unusual scene unfolded in the courtyard below the clock tower of Hogwarts. A trio of witches faced off in a circle, two sporting Gryffindor colors, and the third forgoing the house tie altogether in favor of a lurid pink scarf. It wasn't the gathering itself that was unusual, but their rigid postures and the glares they were sending each other.

"It's obvious that I should be first," Hermione said, tapping her foot. "I've known him the longest."

"As a /friend/," Ginny said. "I was his first kiss!"

Hermione huffed. "Will you ever shut up about that?"

"Nope." Ginny stuck out her tongue.

Hermione rolled her eyes. "Very mature."

The two glared at each other, then turned towards their third companion.

Luna blinked owlishly. "Oh, I'm not going to justify myself. I just want his thick hard thing in my--"

"Luna!" cried Ginny, blushing to her ears.

Luna cocked her head. "Aren't we all after the same thing?"

Ginny averted her eyes and mumbled, "You didn't have to put it so... candidly."

There was a brief silence as three pairs of eyes exchanged fierce stares.

Hermione sighed. "We can be mature about this, can't we? If none of us will back down, let's have a contest--winner takes all." She tapped her lips. "What should it be? Tossing a coin seems rather inappropriate..."

"Exploding Snap," Ginny said, her eyes glinting.

"Competitive finger painting," said Luna.

Hermione planted her hands on her hips. "You're just picking something you're good at!" She gave Luna an unsure glance. "Aren't you?"

Luna smiled. "I've always wanted to try finger painting, and it's more fun to do with friends."

"It's supposed to be a competition," Hermione said, sighing. "Let's see--something that puts us on equal footing..."

Ginny worried her lip, her hand dipping into her pocket to caress her wand absently. The familiar warmth of its smooth surface made her perk up. "How about dueling?" The corners of her lips quirked. "We all take Defense."

Hermione opened her mouth as though to object, then nodded thoughtfully. She looked at Luna, who was humming as she gazed off into the distance. "Is that alright with you, Luna? You will back down if you lose?"

Luna twitched a little. "You finally decided?" she asked, yawning widely without covering her mouth. "Good, I was getting sleepy. I have no intention of losing, by the way."

"We'll see about--" Hermione clammed up and took a reflexive step back as Luna's pale thin wand appeared in her hand as though by magic. At her sudden motion, Ginny whipped out her own, and to her chagrin Hermione was the last on the draw.

A tense silence ruled for several seconds before the witches exploded into motion.

"Eat bogies!" Ginny cried, aiming at Hermione with a broad smile on her face.

Hermione waved her wand. "Protego!"

Ginny scowled as her signature hex was deflected. Recalling that there was another opponent to worry about, she turned sharply, and found Luna twirling her wand with a spaced-out expression on her face. She trained her wand on her and unleashed another Bat-Bogey Hex.

Luna stooped down, and the jet of light passed over her slender back. "What a pretty pebble," she murmured, picking a tiny blue stone off the pavement.

"Bloody hell!" cried a male voice in the direction the hex had hurtled off to, but none of the girls noticed.

"Stupefy," cried Hermione, "Locomotor Wibbly!"

Ginny leapt aside from the red jet of light, and said, "Protego!" catching the Jelly-Legs Jinx on her shield. The two witches glowered at each other, then began exchanging spells in earnest.

Luna hummed, the tip of her wand alternating between them. "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe... Subvelopubis."

A pink beam left her wand and struck Ginny in the ribs. Gasping, she patted herself down, soon finding nothing of the ordinary. Her brows furrowed.

"Expelliarmus! Ha!" Hermione laughed as Ginny's wand soared out from her grip.

Ginny rounded on her. "Not fair! I never heard of that spell, what if it was something dangerous?"

"Oh, please," Hermione crowed, holding a wand in each hand, "Luna would never--"

"Expelliarmus," Luna said, then casually snatched the two wands from the air.

Ginny and Hermione gaped at her before breaking into angry yells, but they were drowned out by a loud gong from the tower above. Luna tilted her head back.

"Oh good, they'll be serving pudding soon," she said when the bell went silent.

Ginny exchanged a glance with Hermione before pouncing at Luna and scrabbling for the wands in her hand. Hermione joined in, and the three collapsed to the pavement in a tangle of limbs.

"I won!"

"You cheated!"

"I'll be late for pudding!"

There was a sound of pounding footsteps and Ronald Weasley emerged from around the corner, dragging a shorter boy along. "They've gone all mad! Hurry up and stop them!"

The boy regarded the scene before him, then chuckled and strolled into the courtyard. At his approach, the catfight broke up and the girls hastened to put themselves in order, their cheeks flushed.

"Ladies, please," the boy said. "What are you fighting about? You know I'd hate to see any of you get hurt."

The witches exchanged furtive glances until by some tacit agreement Hermione stepped forward and inhaled deeply. "We were just arguing on which one of us, um..." She lowered her gaze. "Gets to be your f-first."

The boy laughed heartily. "What a silly reason! There's plently of me to go around. Besides..." He winked roguishly. "I know for a fact that the Room of Requirement can produce a bed large enough for all of us. Want to see for yourself?"

"I should've thought of that," Hermione murmured.

Ginny latched on to the boy's left arm and purred, "You're so smart."

Luna pirouetted over and hugged his right, which left Hermione groaning when she saw she was left out. Luna extended her right hand mutely, and after a moment's hesitation, Hermione sighed and took it. The foursome strolled off, whispering and laughing among themselves.

"A thanks would've been nice," Ron mumbled to Colin Creevey's retreating back.

** /Outside the Burrow, home of the Weasley family, stood three young witches. These three witches, Ginny Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Luna Lovegood. They were among the most gifted witches as ever there had been, the sharpest of minds and the keenest of duelists./

"What are you playing at with the narration?" Ginny raised an eyebrow at Neville.

"It seemed like a good idea at the time." Neville shrugged. "And since you three aren't actually trying to hurt each other, I thought it'd liven things up a bit."

"Neville," Hermione said shortly. "I believe your grandmother is calling you."

"Um...you know what, I think you're right." Neville looked from one witch to the next. "Um...bye now!"

Neville took off running as fast as he could, apparently forgetting that he could Apparate.

"Hermione, I never realized you had such fine hearing. Is that from a charm?" Luna smiled.

"No!"

"Pity," Luna frowned slightly. "I'd like to be able to hear voices from far away. I'd be able to keep in touch with you more easily."

Hermione's expression softened before she shook her head.

"Never mind Luna, the winner of this duel shall--"

"Oh we decided something? I thought this was because you were bored. Not that I'm complaining, this may be very entertaining."

Ginny whipped her wand towards Hermione and shot a Bat Bogey Hex at her. Hermione ran to the side, and the hex sailed harmlessly past her.

Hermione sent a jinx back at Ginny, but her aim was off. The spell bounced off one of the Burrow's windows, breaking the glass.

"Hermione did it! Hermione did it!" Ginny shouted.

"It was an accident!"

Ginny's eyes narrowed and a sly smirk crossed her face.

"Tarantallegra!"

The spell hit Hermione squarely in the chest and Hermione's legs began dancing an uncontrollable jig.

Hermione called Ginny a very rude name as she danced about the Burrow's yard. She couldn't let this happen. She was a stronger witch than Ginny was. And she certainly couldn't lose due to a dancing spell of all things!

"Hello, what's your name?" Luna was crouched down, facing one of the several dozen garden gnomes that lived throughout the garden of the Burrow.

"Gerroff!"

"How do you do, Mister Gerroff. My name is Luna. Want to be friends?"

"Gerroff!"

"Luna!" Hermione shouted. "You're not even trying!"

"Trying? Oh yes, of course!"

Luna brushed her hair back behind her ears and pointed her wand at Hermione.

"Wingardium leviosa!"

Hermione intercepted Luna's charm and muttered the countercurse on herself. She fell onto her hands and knees and looked around wildly.

Ginny had made a beeline for the broom shed where her Cleansweep was kept. Hermione felt her face grow redder--if Ginny got ahold of a broom, there'd be very little she could do to stop her.

"Stupefy!"

"Rictusempra!"

Ginny shrieked as Luna's Tickling Charm and Hermione's Stunnng Spell collided in midair, the jet of purple and the wave of scarlet shattered against each other, briefly glowing white.

"Oooh, what pretty colors!"

"Gah!"

Hermione dove for cover as Ginny sent another Bat Bogey Hex in their direction.

"Protego!"

The hex bounced off the Shield Charm but Ginny soared overhead, pointing her wand menacingly, which clashed furiously with the impish grin on Ginny's face.

"I'm not sure I can fit into your burrow, Mister Gerroff. But thank you, it's very kind of you to assist."

Ginny sent another hex down, and missed Luna by inches. Gerroff the Gnome wasn't so lucky, and tiny little bats began to swirl around him.

"We're doomed if we can't figure out a way to get up to her!"

"Ginny, come down please!"

"Not a chance! You'll have to come and get me!"

Luna aimed her wand and smiled. "Wel, okay, if that's what you want. /Accio Cleansweep!/"

Ginny screamed as the broom lurched and she felt herself being pulled back down to the ground.

"Not fair!"

Not my best work, I'm afraid. The idea seemed much funnier in my head.

** I mean, in-character it wouldn't be much of a duel. Hermione would overthink it and Luna would get distracted, while Ginny fills their noses with bats. GG No contest no re easy win for HP's best girl.

*** ...meh.

It had started with Lavender Brown, way back in third year. Then when her oppugno had splattered so disappointingly she'd begun refining it, but oh, in her heart-of-hearts Hermione had never thought she'd actually get to use any of her over-thought--and purely theoretical--revenge plots against her friends.

Now, however, with bats dribbling out of her nose, a furious Hermione apparates directly behind Ginny. With one thoroughly researched transfiguration she turns the other girl into a humdinger.

Luna looks away from where Hermione used to be standing and spots Ginny, "Oooh!" she exclaims, wand dipping.

"Incarcerous," Hermione replies and both bodies drop to the ground with a thump.

She turns to look at the terrified figures peeking out from behind a tree trunk, one black bearded sea captain and a precocious young reporter. It wasn't that she didn't like the idea of immersive fiction, but Ginny and Luna never should have messed with one of her childhood favourites.

"If you could just look at my wand tip for a moment, I'll be letting you get on with your regularly scheduled adventures," she says before casting obliviate and disappearing with her friends.

**** Yeah, no. Hermione was extremely smart, but in canon (aka not the films or cursed child) she never proved to be able to think properly during combat situations. That was part of her character. Even during the last book she couldn't summon a patronus outside of a controlled environment. Ginny owns easily and it's not a contest. Good try tho.

***** Wow, people /hate/ it. jerks.

I agree that she panics early in the series, but she gets better with practice. By the time she's apparating them out of the Lovegoods in DH, she's managed to stick Ron under the invisibility cloak and use Harry to protect Xeno and explode the horn and that looks like good on the spot tactical thinking to me!

****** Hermione doesn't have the nerves for combat. We see throughout Deathly Hallows that her quick thinking are all based around escape and evasion. It's Harry and Ron who work wonders in actual fighting. Which is why she does not become an Auror.

****** the fact that someone dislikes what you wrote doesn't make them jerks.

And that's one example of her thinking. There are also countless examples of her freezing. While Ginny and even Luna (fucking Luna Lovegood) have, in their reduced page time, proven to be way more efficient in combat situations. There's nothing wrong with liking Hermione over the other two, but pretending she was the better witch just furthers the "Hermione-Sue" image that some fans seem to want to cultivate.
