  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

I will love to see a fic where they try and start their 'our son... Why Snape...' whine and Snape tells them where they can shove their son.

He loved Lily, her son isn't part of deal.

**** Which he didn't! We don't know how he treated his students, since this fic is third person limited PoV from perspective of an 11 year old abused, isolated and damaged kid with lack of any normalcy in life.

Snape was always there when Harry needed him.

Let's analyze their first interaction from Snape's PoV.

New class, first with Harry!

Before this class he had heard few things about Harry which must include his tardiness.

Moving on:

First class, class starts, Snape starts lecture and he sees Harry wiring something on his scroll (paper).

So the almighty famous boy doesn't even listen to teachers? His father was a bully who broke rules and probably never listened to teachers. Is it particle Harry is same?

He asks questions, Harry knows answer of none. Hermoine (and others) know answers. Great. A famous kid who not only doesn't listen to teachers but doesn't read his books.

And then there is comment about 'why don't you try Hermoine.' at which whole class snickered.

A cheeky, arrogant boy who doesn't even read his books.

Look at every incident from Snape's eyes and then tell me what you would have done different.

The only time Snape ever mentioned his father was when Harry didn't even show a tiny progress is occlusion of mind.

Where is this things about him not being a good teacher coming from. Canon never said he was bad teacher.

Kids have different fears, of whatever kind. Neville was 12 year old when it happened. Neville was clumsy, stupid and a coward for most of the series.

Ron's boggart was Spider. It doesn't imply that Spiders terrorized him, it implies that he was afraid of spiders.

He was such an idiot that he managed to do 'disarming spell' in his fifth year. Even kids at DA club did it before him.

Let me remind again: This series is a 3rd person limited PoV from perspective of a psycholigically damaged kid, who was left in an abusive environment. Who (in book 1) admitted of a game "Harry hunting", felt proud (in book 1) of his ability to stay out of his uncel's arm length and avoiding a frying pan that his aunt swung at him, and a Harry who thought it was 'normal' for his uncle to shovew in in cupboard after he had vanished glass and let a snake escape (book 1). He even was okay that he wouldn't get food in cupboard.

Do you know what's the first interaction between Snape and Neville?

#+begin_quote
  Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

  "Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"

  Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. "Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus.
#+end_quote

Neville was incompetent, and foolish boy with clumsy hands. He couldn't even follow simple instructions written on board. All the other scenes of Neville prove that he was a coward boy with no talent.

********* And Snape was supposed to be a /teacher/. Granted the wizarding world probably has a different type of sense of danger level, but I am a teacher. We are trained to think through and anticipate what is going to happen. We can't prevent all accidents by any means, but there should have been protocols for spills etcetera. And containment/ emergency first aid is what a teacher should have done. Harry's POV would have noted that.

But the wizarding world is different. Granted, we don't know enough about other dangerous situations really to compare. All we have is Hooch escorting Neville to the Hospital wing with a break which is a different type of emergency than a chemical spill.

Realistically, Rowling may just not have thought about it. But, I think the way she had Snape act tells us that he had a certain view about his students and that they should be responsible for much of their own safety. Which fits with what we know of his own upbringing where he had to take care of himself, but is at odds with what would be acceptable in many people's minds.

I'm not saying that excuses it though. Just because Neville is "incompetent" does not mean that he should be subject to painful boils. He is 11. But we also know his relatives dangled him out of windows and almost drowned him to get him to show magic so I am not surprised more characters weren't outraged by Snape's teaching methods.

********** What I'm trying to say is that we don't even know enough about his teaching method. Even narrator (An immature 11 year old boy) didn't mention anything wrong about his method. It's hard to avoid all accidents. Immature kids are hardly the sort of people you would expect to pay complete attention to their stuff.

It's possible that some teacher might decide that fear is easy, tried and tested, method of controlling kids in class. Detentions are common method of enforcing 'reward-punishment' sort of system in classes. Nobody in magical Britain ever complained about his teaching methods, canon is silent on that.

All the important interactions between Harry and Snape happened outside classes, usually at places where Harry shouldn't have gone, doing things Harry shouldn't have been doing.

Being a Teacher of Harry doesn't mean he has to serve Harry. He did more than anybody to keep his promise (and vow?) to Dumbledore about helping Harry survive and have the vengeance on Tom.

I'm sick of all the fanon Snape-bashing tropes taken as canon. Snape had his issues. Not kissing the ground Harry walked on wasn't one of those.

Lily and James don't get to complain about how he treated his students, or how he played his role in war.

He didn't. Canon has no concrete proof that Snape bullied children.

#+begin_quote
  He purposefully ignored sabotage in his class.
#+end_quote

He didn't. Canon never mentioned Snape removing him from class, giving him wrong information or signaling him out.There was only one incident, in book 1, and even then it was Harry whoo wasn't paying attention to what Sape was saying. From other people's perspective Harry was writing something in his notebook. Snape singled him out and asked him questions from syllabus, which he didn't have answers to.

All the rest of their 'confrontations' were outside class, where HP didn't have a reason to be. There was no reason for HP to be on 3rd floor. Harry shouldn't have missed his train, and then come to school in a flying car. Harry shouldn't have been the only one near every frozen up kid in second year. Harry shouldn't have been the one with Lupin/Black in 4rd year.

See? Every interaction with Snape was at place where Harry shouldn't be. Their class interactions were never about Snape neglectivg his duties as teacher. This is a badly written Fanon trope.

#+begin_quote

Snape was broken, yes. He was socially stunted? He managed to convince two sides in the longest war that he is on their side. He was a darling of everybody who mattered in social circles. Nobody ever called him out on his teaching abilities.

Did I mention HP is written in 3rd person limited from perspective of an 11 year old abused, psychologically damaged kid who had no sense of normalcy? The very same kid who happily jumped on a troll in a fit of 'heroic' rush of adrenaline. I don't think this kid 's view about a person who played his role as spies for the most powerful people in magical Britain holds any truth.

******* There are many things you are wrong about regarding Snape. While we only get the perspective of Harry during the books, we do see his actions and can infer things from those actions.

When Harry is in the potions class with Snape, he sneers and calls Harry, "our newest celebrity". He then quickly fires off questions specifically towards Harry, not bothering to ask anyone else. Hermione is the only one who raises her hand and shows that she seems to be the only one who knew the answer to the question. We do not know whether or not the answers were in the books at all. Snape does however, ask Harry about the Draught of Living Death, a potion that was brewed by the Sixth years during Slughorn's class.

Regarding Snape being a bad teacher, there are multiple pieces of evidence that proves this. Snape berates Neville after he causes an accident, calling him an "idiot boy" and also takes multiple points from Harry and co. for provoking and getting into fights with Malfoy even if Malfoy starts it first. At one point he takes points away from Harry for standing in a corridor. Something else to note, no other teacher has ever insulted a student as Snape did except for Umbridge.

For Snape's bias against Harry, Pottermore and J.K. Rowling have said that Snape held a grudge against Harry because of James Potter's pranking/bullying and for saving his life when he went to the Whomping Willow after Sirius got him to do so. When Snape talks to Dumbledore in his office, he is humiliated to be helping James Potter's son and asks Dumbledore to not tell anyone. When Snape begs Dumbledore to help protect Lily, he does not mention James Potter or their son at all. He only wanted to keep his childhood crush safe not her family and Dumbledore is disgusted with Snape as a result.

Snape was socially stunted, as a matter of fact, only the Death Eaters trusted him because he brought Voldemort the prophecy and for perhaps other unknown reasons. Dumbledore trusts Snape because he would never betray Lily purposely and would protect her son for her sake. No one really knew that Snape was a Death Eater and I doubt that Snape would be trusted if it was public knowledge.

Harry Potter is written in the perspective of Harry, who shows no signs of being mentally stunted or psychologically damaged at all. Harry did not "jump " on a troll and went there to save Hermione and not fight the troll. The reason he did is because he felt that it was Ron and his fault for making her cry in the bathroom as Ron had made several derogatory remarks towards her during charms and in the corridors. Because it was written in Harry's perspective his view does matter. Even though Harry's narration isn't always reliable, Rowling still made clear that Snape was petty and spiteful.

Even if you aren't a Snape Apologist or simply confused with fanon, denying Snape his complex character and contradictory views only lessens Snape's contributions and his interesting character.

There aren't! The very few scenes in canon from classroom are first class with him. Another one where they were talking about who they take as dates for Yule. In first Harry wasn't listening to Snape and Snape asked him questions from syllabus, which he failed to answer. That's how normal teachers deal with students who aren't paying attention in class. Later Neville was a fool. He asked a classmate to take Neville to their healer after calling him an 'idiot' for failing to follow simple instructions on board.

Umbridge never insulted a student. She was there on a mission. Her goal was to discredit a school boy who was claiming that he saw resurrection of the then dead Darkest Lord of their time. Harry didn't put his case clearly, and Dumbledore abandoned him that year.

#+begin_quote

According to movies Harry was writing on parchment at this point. And according to books he 'shared a look' with Ron and saw toward Hermione. In both cases it is evident that Snape saw him not paying attention to lessons. Teacher sometimes ask such students questions to surprise such students. Harry had no answers. Hermione knew answers, whi9ch is enough proof that they were from course.

Because that's how people operate. People only care about people they love. He hated James, and had no ove lsot for Harry. Lily was his friend, and her asked Dumledore to protect her. Do you know what Dumbledore did? He (ab)used Snape, made him vow and asked something in return.

Regarding the Dursleys, Harry was in fact scared at first. Harry did not care much about the Dursleys because of their mistreatment of him and Dudley's "Harry Hunting".

Auror Harry Potter names one of his sons after Snape AFTER Snape's contributions to the war effort and bravery. The books and Rowling make it clear that it was despite his faults, Snape was still honored as what he did allowed Harry to defeat Voldemort. Pottermore is still canon, it is optional canon but you still have to weigh in about what she says after the books.

You still ignore my point. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE QUESTIONS WERE ON THE SYLLABUS!!! Harry was listening to Snape, he was writing down what he was saying in fact. I don't know what school you went to but one of my teachers got fired for calling a student an idiot and shouting at them in their ear. How is calling Neville an idiot helpful to him? I understand that you think Neville was an idiot squib in the first several canon books but even then, name-calling is detrimental to a student and doesn't help anyone. Just because you think he is a fool, doesn't mean that you should call someone that.

I realize that yes, Umbridge didn't insult Harry but she sure as hell implied it. That is on me.

First, Dumbledore asked Snape would he would do in return for Lily's protection. Snape said he would do everything. They were no longer friends, Snape called her a mudblood and also Snape was infatuated with the idea of Lily, he wasn't her friend.

******* "A bad idea l, Professor Lockhart," said Snape, gliding over like a large malevelont bat. "Longbottom, causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox." Neville's round pink face went pinker.

Snape said, "Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this." He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, "Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you to not entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear." Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.

"Orange, Longbottom," Snape said, ladling some up and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see. "Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one cat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?" Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he were on the verge of tears. "Please sir," said Hermione, "please, I could help Neville put it right-" "I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," said Snape coldly, and Hermione went pink as Neville. "Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly." [...] "Everyone gather 'round," said Snape, his black eyes glittering, "and watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned."

“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf ---”

“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”

********* I'm sorry, are you really excusing Snape' s comments and passing it up as good instruction? Do you have any idea how education is done? Do you understand what's needed for students to thrive? Or would you have us all be taught by teachers like Snape where no extra attention or instruction is given? What a lovely idea, to think children don't need any nurturing or care when teaching. To think, that negative comments purposefully made to be embarrassing and derogatory can be classified as good instruction.

*********** The point is Snape is responsible for the education of children. Strict is significantly different from bullying. Verbal abuse has no need in a classroom no matter what. It's getting personal because you are excusing verbal abuse in a classroom. I have lots of personal opinions with people that have such a limited view of education. Can you think of no way to be safe in a classroom without verbal abuse?

************ He is responsible education that he gave them. Nobody ever complained about that. He was a successful potion master who remained at post and only had to move when Hirace had to be bought back at Dumbledore's need.

Even then it was only due to Dumbledore's injury.

As an educator Snape taught his class enough to pass all the necessary exams and be able to enter their desired fields of choices.

Calling out a student in class is a common practise. Every incompetent who get caked out thinks teacher is unfair with him.

Remember Minerva verbal lashing Ron and Harry when they came late to their first class.

************* Oh that one that was only in the movie and not in the books? So that non-existent comment in canon compares to calling children "dunderheads, idiots, and a insufferable know-it-all"? Snape also had the pleasure of insulting Hermione's teeth. Nothing Snape did was normal. It is not normal for educators to mock students' appearances, threaten their pets if they don't carry out assignments properly, or give them poor grades to retaliate against their parents. Snape vanished Harry's vial of potion to be petty and vengeful. An educater is more than just knowledge of a subject. It also requires pedagogical skill.

************** And the board of governors, principal and vice principal didn't find his conduct questionable. Those people didn't think his method of teaching was bad.

According to our standards Dumbledore should be in jail for kidnapping a kid. But that world doesn't think like that. May be it was okay in that world.

Similarly, we don't know what was allowed. But since Snape continued to teach, it seems gods conduct was within acceptable range.

Moody (fake) turned a student info a ferret, students laughed at it as if it was funny. Minerva just commented that we don't turn our children to animals.

Albus allowed a teacher to demonstrate 3 unforgivables in class and test imperius curse on students.

P.S: Movies are canon since JKR verified and certified material showed in them. Your personal preference doesn't mean JKR's stamp of approval doesn't hold.

*************** This is vastly different from the rest of your comments. No one is saying the wizarding world has acceptable standards for education. We are all getting frustrated because you seem to think Snape is an acceptable educater.

Edit: where does my personal opinion on canon come into play? I was unaware movies are considered the same canon as books. Forgive me if I thought the books (which had established canon before movies) had a different or overriding significance to canon. Since it seems that's the part that offends you.

********* First, I would like to mention that Snape publicly shames Neville multiple times without remorse. Several of those comments could be made in a private setting (the one to Lupin) or not made at all. Snape deducted points for being "an insufferable know-it-all" not for talking out of turn. Just proof of his bias. He hates Hermione for associating with Harry.

******** Really, unless you find it entertaining, I wouldn't bother. Snape is my favorite character, and I've written thousands of words about him, and [[/u/Sulmil003][u/Sulmil003]] is simply wrong. They're ignoring the text, the /obvious/ authorial intent, the boarding school trope of the cruel teacher, and everything JKR has ever said about Snape.

Harry isn't always a reliable narrator, and JKR plays with the "ooooh, Snape is evil"/"whoops, no, he was on our side" flummery for several books as a way of reversing expectations. But the narrative endorses Harry's opinion of Snape's pettiness and spite every step of the way. Snape's choices are interesting /because/ he's a bitter, grudge-holding arsehole, not because he's a secret woobie.

********* my issue with Sulmil003's case is that he's attempting to justify Snape as a tragic hero where each and every action he takes is justified. Snape is incredibly tragic, but he isn't a tragic hero the way he's written in the series. JK did give him the potential to be the most interesting character by far in the fanfiction "extended universe", which I'm sure includes your depictions of Snape as a much more fleshed out character. But canon-Snape picked on kids and especially Harry, if based on nothing except objective dialogue.

I'm not out here trying to call Snape a bad character, he's actually probably the most three-dimensional character in the series. but in the books, according to the only perspective we have, Snape is a kid who got in with a bad crowd, called his best friend and only good influence the wizard equivalent of the n-word ending all contact between the two forever, became a criminal of which the conviction would be life in Azkaban, accidentally got his former best friend and her husband murdered, and then bullied her orphan despite being as peripherally aware of his home life and background as anyone else in the wizarding world prior to his entrance to that world.

********** Oh, absolutely. I agree with what you're saying here for the most part, although I think the narrative conventions JKR used, especially the redemption-by-death arc, allows for a genuine version of tragic /anti/-hero. Snape was never going to be a hero in the accepted sense. I also suspect JKR's initial ideas were much more cartoonish/exaggerated in a Roald Dahl-esque sense, in line with a lot of kid lit, and that it now makes some of her "bad" characters' behavior come across much worse, especially if taken literally in real-world terms. (I personally don't think she quite pulled off the blend of kids' book sensibility and serious tragedy because she hadn't actually thought the implications through when she started. For example, I doubt she intended Snape to end up being the most three-dimensional character in the series.)

Sulmil003 is projecting, not to mention re-defining Harry's character to lay blame on him instead of on Snape. It's been a while since I've seen such an extreme case of special pleading for Snape, and IMO it strips him of everything that makes him a character worth exploring.

********* I agree with you. As long as we aren't pointing toward authorial narrative, and just focusing canon, Harry is not a reliable narrator. As in always, not sometimes.

We are talking about an 11 year old kid who thought it was funny when a giant man broke the door, entered his home, threatened his care givers, turned his cousin into a pig.

This 11 year old kid is not a reliable narrator. It isn't supposed to be. And unintentionally, in her attempt to make Snape a complex character, JKR made him more immature.

There aren't enough things from Canon to point out that he did anything purely our of spite for his father.

We as readers can see how Snape behaves, and it supports Harry's experience: Snape is a vindictive teacher, particularly toward Harry, his friends, and Neville Longbottom, unfairly favors his own house, and behaves in ways that would get him sacked in most real schools.

And is given biased information by many people including but not limited to a biased boy he met on train from a family mothered by a suffocating helicopter mom, two bullies who 'prank' everyone with borderline torturous spells and items and a 'model' perfect from same family.

It's the same Harry that laughed when a stranger stormed his house, threatened his family and turned his cousin into a pig.

And it's the same Harry who when matured named his son after the very same professor. Harry's experience convinced him that Snape wasn't worth all the hate that his immature mind mustered for Snape.
