Hi! Anyone have any suggestions for this?

I have read/am reading Harry Black by AuthorK on ffn.

I've also read the Return of the Marauders by the Last Zion.

Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Thanks ðŸ˜Š


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]: Harry is blind, and Dursleys are good. But he can't go to Hogwarts, and grows up to become a mad scientist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. They then burnt down their own house, faked their deaths, and fled for continental Europe. This Harry was raised by his loving parents and never went to Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean he's a nice guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]]: Raised by Sirius, this Harry never went to Hogwarts, and hires Ginny to accompany him on some postwar adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: Lucius Malfoy seized power through a daring maneuver after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore and his followers had to flee for France. Harry was raised there by Sirius and went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. But they would have their revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]]: This Gryffindor Tom Riddle is a lot scarier and more successful than canon Voldemort. Harry Potter still exists as the child of James and Lily, but is raised by Snape and goes to Durmstrang under an alias. The story however, is currently focusing on Hermione.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
