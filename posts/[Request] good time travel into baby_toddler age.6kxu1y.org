So... I'm curious, other than the story where hermione defeats the dark lord in 12 hours, is there a good time travel story where they are baby/toddler age at first?

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

*** Haa... Thanks for the recommendation.

The author was not consistent in HP lore though. No wand allegiance change when disarmed, no lost magic because she did not respect and follow the Black tradition despite swearing unbreakable vow about it. Too many plot hole to me...

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.
