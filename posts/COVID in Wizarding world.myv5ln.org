I literally just woke up from a dream where COVID affected Wizarding Britian. My biggest impression is Lucius Malfoy with a bubblehead charm... what would this look like?


** There's a fanfic about that exact subject. Harry is killed by thief stealing toilet paper due to the pandemic. He's given a second chance and hoards toilet paper as a result

  He didn't know what was worse. That he'd been shot and was bleeding out or that he had been shot and was bleeding out as a result of a toilet paper raid. Shot for a roll of single-ply bog roll.

** Aside from the 'do mundane diseases affect magicals' question, outside of Ministry employees and platform 9 3/4 I just don't see magicals mixing enough to allow for fast transmission. Before they move into Grimmauld place for security reasons, do any of the Weasleys ever leave the house other than for short shipping trips? I can still imagine it being used as an excuse to ban muggleborns from things though.

*** I don't remember all the details but I think in one of her Pottermore writings JK said wizards were affected by the black death just like Muggles (which might have been one of the Malfoys' curse that got out of control while trying to chase some Muggles off of his property or something). However she also said wizards are usually not affected by mundane disease. However even if that were not the case, wizards interact enough with people to bring the disease into their world (particularly Arthur who works with Muggles). All it takes is an obliviator who has to wipe the memory of a sick person. Soon the entire ministry is sick and considering how many people work for or interact with the ministry, you soon have the entire world infected.

**** You also have to consider 'how effective is magical healing?' All we see of it in canon is for magical accidents and physical injuries, not illnesses. There could be a potion that clears it up trivially, or at least the symptoms. If there isn't however, then potentially 'muggle' medicine with oxygen supplies and cocktails of anti-inflammatories and now vaccines don't necessarily have an equivalent in the magical world, so it could be far worse.

***** The wizards definitely have the common cold but they also have a cure for it. However according to JK's writings again... Linfred of Stitchcomb developed an early version of the Pepperup Potion with the final version being developed some time in the early 18th or 19th century. So it's quite likely that until the 13th century people could die of it just like regular Muggles and even in later years still suffer from the inconveniences of it until the final version of the Pepperup Potion was invented.

** I laughed out loud at the image of a Lucius Malfoy with a bubblehead charm, wearing a disgusted expression as he makes his way through the crowd.

Overall though, I doubt that Covid would affect witches and wizards.

*** I woke up laughing too because that's the exact image that was in my head... I doubt it would too, but the fun of having it written even for a one shot specifically from Lucius Malfoy's perspective would be hilarious. I can hear Molly Weasley's voice rising over the den of Diagon Alley... "Ronald Weasley! Put that bubblehead charm on right now!"

**** Yeah definetly, though I find myself even more amused if it was some minor sickness or so and people would deal differently with it, a bubble head charm being the most over the top solution to the problem

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] looks at a lot of this. Bubblehead charms, affected wizards turning into squibs because the virus kills their magic which acts as their immune system...
