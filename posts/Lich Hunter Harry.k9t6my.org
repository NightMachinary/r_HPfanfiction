Imagine after the death of Voldemort Harry gets some kind of divine sense and travels the world killing liches and undead creatures.

One interaction I'd love is some preacher calls him satanic but Harry pulls out a phone and calls the freaking pope and the leaders of the Jewish and Islamic faiths along with the satanic church leader.

"Sup dipshits. We got another phylactery to destroy." Harry says to the complete shock of the preacher. The 4 great him like an old friend and a ritual is preformed to destroy whatever unholy thing Harry called them to and they leave.

"Yeah the 4 heads of those religions are actually clerics." Harry says before patting the preacher on the back and leaving.


** "Can you call us something else, other than dipshit?"

*** He says it like he's spent time with these people for years. He's literally spent 50+ years hanging around these people.

**** Honestly, shit like this would ruin the prompt. Stories like this need a specific tone, and some kind of weird anime-goth hybrid protagonist that calls people he considers allies "dipshit" would completely break that tone.

A story like this would function well with a competent, but slightly dismissive Harry, one who's essentially seen it all and is relatively less fazed by horrible stuff than those around him. Not completely unfazed, that makes the story unreadable, but in a situation where others may become nauseous and horrified, he just feels a bit of existential dread.

Alternatively, it would work very well with an intense Harry, sort of like the Doctor from Doctor Who. One who is much, much more knowledgeable about such matters, and generally wants to shield the innocence of other people by handling the problem in their stead. To this end, he'd have an intense charisma that brokers no disagreement - if he tells you to get the hell out and don't look back, you don't ask "why", you /do/ it.

In another vein, he could also be broody and unapproachable, grim in his demeanor and given task. He does these things because someone must, and he's the best person for the job. He doesn't like it when people interfere - whether that is because they make his work more difficult or because they could be harmed, nobody really knows.

And as a totally different option, he could be a veritable paladin, holding a level of zealotry in the destruction of evil that's almost manic at times. He does these things because they are righteous, not for any kind of material reward.

No offense to your prompt, of course, but weird anime-goth hybrids that are completely and utterly unlikeable don't make for good protagonists.
