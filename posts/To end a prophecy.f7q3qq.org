When Harry is found alive in his crib with a heavily bleeding scar James and Dumbledore decide that the best thing to do is allow the prophecy to end and hope another champion can rise and defeat Voldemort. With the intention of letting him bleed to death Lily takes her son and runs away to France. She finds herself at the safe house Sirius told her of and is found by the man himself there. Together Lily and Sirius raise Harry with the help of good neighbors the Delacours.

You could have Lily and Sirius marry each other or other people if you like, Harry can go to Beauxbatons or Hogwarts


** ...how does Voldemort die if Lily is still alive? why would James let Harry die?

*** Presumably the prophesy would have been interpreted as /only/ harry can kill Voldemort and only Voldemort can kill harry while the prophesy is active. Therefore render the prophesy inactive via fulfilment and suddenly mad-eye, Dumbledore, random muggleborn victim #7, ect can potentially kill voldemort.
