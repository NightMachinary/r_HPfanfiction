What, in your opinion of course, is the best Ritual you've seen in a fanfiction? Me personally, I really enjoyed the Blood Magic Tattoo rituals in the fic With Strength of Steel Wings linkffn:(9036071)

What ones do you guys enjoy? Both for the way it's written, and the effects of it.


** The resurrection of Lily Potter in linkffn(An Old and New World)

That version I linked is a reupload/re-edit that hasn't quite gotten up to the ritual yet, but it's great, it actually /feels/ like it's a really difficult piece of magic, rather than just a matter of course as so many fanon rituals are.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

*** It's from the first Potions class in VP:

#+begin_quote
  “We return to the question,” Snape continued. “I doubt many of you even grasp that potions are magic, so accustomed are you to the foolish waving of wands. But make no mistake... whether holding a wand or ingredients, the magic does not come from the instruments you hold. Always, the magic comes from the wizard. If it were otherwise, there would be no Muggles.”

  He paused to look around the class, his lip curling at what he saw. “Of course, most students never properly perceive the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron, nor the power of its products. It takes a certain subtlety of mind to truly understand Potions, a subtlety which some---” he turned to look at Victoria “---lack.”

  She frowned. Had she done something to offend him?

  “Potter!” Snape said, making her jump, “tell us, if you can... why is it that potions ingredients must be prepared with great care?”

  For a moment her mind went blank, so terrified was she of being the focus of Snape's attention, but a moment later the answer came: “Because a potion isn't just what's inside the cauldron, sir. What you're doing matters too.”

  For a moment he stared at her, his dark eyes boring into her own. “A basic answer, but essentially correct... five points to Slytherin.” He turned to face the blackboard, chalk floating up to write under his direction, though he had not removed his wand.

  /A POTION IS A RITUAL/

  “Perhaps Miss Potter can give an example to the class.”

  It didn't seem very fair to ask her two questions in a row. “Um, the Draught of Clear Sight?”

  Snape turned back around---there was that piercing look again, like she was the only person in the class. “Elaborate.”

  Victoria ran a hand through her hair, glancing at Daphne next to her, who sent her an encouraging smile. “The, er, key ingredient is a blindfold that you have to wear for ages.”

  A small, nasty smile crossed Snape's face. “Congratulations, Potter, you just blinded yourself.” Victoria felt heat in her face, suddenly finding the table as fascinating as did the Gryffindors.

  Fortunately, Snape turned his attention back to the class. “Take note! Precision is vital when it comes to potion-making. Descriptions such as /‘ages'/ are not good enough. For your information, Potter, the potioneer must walk blindfolded for a year and a day. Even a small variation will cause the magic to fail, with devastating effect.”

**** I don't know if it's intentional, but I like the idea that in order to gain proper sight you must put your faith in someone ie. rely/trust/be lead by those /with/ proper sight or wisdom, with the blindfold signifying your own lack.

Of course concepts like that are all well and good, but where I fail is to further those thoughts into /magical/ concepts/theory, even if just a veneer.

(Also I suppose some sort of magical alarm could be set, house-elves or personal determination could see a person through they year and a day, but all the same.)

***** I'm okay with it, albeit with some caveats:

1. LASIK isn't really a "cure" for bad vision in the sense of reversing the root cause; rather it is a "work around", a treatment of the symptoms which can be temporary in result.

2. On the other hand, the Draught of Clear Sight as imagined is a genuine, permanent cure for poor sight. So despite the lack of convenience, in many ways the magical treatment is still more "powerful".

3. The Draught of Clear sight is intended to be able to cure all problems with sight, including complete blindness, which LASIK cannot do.

4. If so inclined, a Healer could probably copy the effect of LASIK with magic.

  Mary Potter background canon. Early June 1979. Just another evening at Order of the Phoenix Safehouse 4. Lily saves Frank's life using hella dark ritual magic. She only gets possessed by the Dark Powers a *little*. Will probably be a two-shot.

** /Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black./

/Buried beneath the flow of time.../

/From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the emptiness,/

/Unknown to death, nor known to life./

/You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and guardian of the gate:/

/I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before me!/

HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!

(It's not a real ritual, of course. But combined with some appropriate window dressing, it does succeed in scaring the living daylights out of forty-four bullies /and/ their intended victims.)
