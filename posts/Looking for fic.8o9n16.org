many years ago, I read a Harry/Susan B. marriage contract fic. The plot was that Dumbledore discovered that harry was the subject of a marriage contract but did not know who the other party was, so he asked his students and Susan said it was her. I do not remember if the fic was any good, but I kind of want to read it again. Does anyone remember this one?
