Some of my favorites are probably either DnD or Buffy-Verse crossovers mostly because i love how their magic interacts with each other. Also buffy verse is around the same time frame as hp.


** Stargate. Because aliens and magic and science and origins. üòÅ It's so fascinating to see how they can fit. If there were more of Star trek I'd watch that too!

  Voldemort didn't know the powers he was messing with the night he attacked the Potters. Lily Potter was much more than she seemed. Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.

** Oooh I really love HP and LOTR crossovers. I read one where Harry Potter was ‚Äúcursed‚Äù to always live his life over and over as the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù in different stories. The fanfic was about his time as Frodo and he was basically in a constant state of annoyance like ‚Äú...why me?‚Äù

** There aren't any particular fandoms I seek out for crossovers, but I find a lot of Avengers ones do pretty well. My top 3 individual stories are

- "When Harry Met Seeley" by razztaztic; Bones crossover. linkffn(7343771)

- "Steve and the Barkeep" by Runaway Deviant; Avengers crossover. linkffn(8410168)

- "The Sea King" by Doghead Thirteen; of all things, a Deadliest Catch crossover. linkffn(7502511)

And as a runner-up, since it's not finished (and it's been a little while): "Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage" by Clell65619; Marvel Comics. linkffn(3933832)

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** For some odd reason, Creepypasta! I've read quite a few good ones, and they're just... Interesting. It's fun to see him interact with the other creeps, and I admit to liking the kill scenes. One of my favorites is linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01), in which an 8yo Harry gets found and adopted by none other than Ticci Toby.

There's also one for Hellraiser(I think) that was quite gory, yet still one of my favorites. Sadly can't remember the name.

  After traveling to the UK for a hunt in Surrey for a change; Ticci Toby discovers a small child living under the stairs of Number 4 Privet Drive but there is more to this child than meets the eye. A CreepyPasta and Harry Potter crossover. Check EXTRAS for more work with this story idea.
