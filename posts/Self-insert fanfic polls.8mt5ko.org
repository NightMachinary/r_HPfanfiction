Okay, I caved and I'm writing my wish fullfillment HP fic. I'm talking time travel, books are real, save HP, have a romance with a character I like wish fullfillment. Full out.

So, because I have imagined various ways this can happen, I would like your input on elements of the story. So here's are some polls:

Who should be romanced: A) Severus Snape B) Remus Lupin C) Narcissa Malfoy D) Nymphadora Tonks E) Other: _______ please indicate who

How old should Harry be: A) Younger than 5 B) Older than 5 but pre-Hogwarts

Who should my character be: A) Unrelated adult B) Related adult

Please let me know of anything you think might be interesting to add. Thank you for indulging me.

Edit: for clarification, the romance options are for my self-insert who is bi. Unrelated/related is pertaining to whether or not the self-insert character is related to any HP canon characters or unrelated to any HP canon character (for example, distant Black relative or random muggleborn).


** Who should be romanced by /who/? Your self-insert, or older Harry down the line? If it's you, gotta know your romantic preferences to make an informed choice. Not much sense suggesting Lupin if you're a homosexual woman, etc.

I would say a pre-Hogwarts but older than 5 Harry. Writing toddlers as anything more than gimmicks tend to end up with the character being obnoxious and one-note rather than a person who's memorable in their own right. Not that it can't be done, but you need to be /very confident/.

When you say "unrelated" and "related", do you mean related to the Potter family?

*** I should clarify, I'll add an edit to the post after this.

Romanced by my self-insert. And by related/unrelated I mean self-insert related to any canon HP characters versus unrelated to any canon HP characters.

Slightly older Harry is a good pick, I do have a soft spot for toddlers though, so cute.

**** So is this a true Self-Insert, then, or are we assuming a counterpart to you who was always from the /Harry Potter/ universe and has no metatextual knowledge? That's tricky.

***** A counterpart to me but whose soul is sent back in time to inhabit a dead body (come back to life) with the knowledge of the books and movies. She now realizes they were based on truth. But of course with any book or movie, which part is exaggerated, which part is true? She doesn't know but will find out.

So basically me but with changes for privacy reasons.

** Why would you want a Lupin ship? He'd just run away once your OC is pregnant.

*** That has been taken into consideration. And in fact I have a plotline developed for this happenstance.

My story is wish fullfillment but I try to make it interesting by still having horrible things happen.

Also I adore Remus.

That doesn't make your story interesting, that makes your main character seem like fate's punching bad and is horrible to read. Good conflict comes from strong antagonists, not having your MC get fucked up their arse 24/7 by everyone and their mother. ^{Well, unless you are writing some very odd smut}

Edit: Also, what exactly is there to like about Lupin? He ran from his pregnant wife, never gave a fuck about Harry, tried to shame him with his parents' memory and nearly infected 3 children because he couldn't even take his fucking meds, literally the only condition there was to him being a teacher.

***** I think you overestimate the amount of horribleness I intend to put in this story. I only meant it's not all sunshine and roses. There will be plenty of happiness and things that go her way as well as times where it doesn't.

** Snape, but like canon Snape. Full on "I see no difference", sneaking up behind Ron and Harry in the beginning of CoS, complete childhating asshole but also kinda funny Snape. If you want misunderstood, just pick Lupin.
