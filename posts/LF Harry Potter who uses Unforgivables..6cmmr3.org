The reason for that is, that there is so many Dark!Harry, Evil!Harry fics, but in very few does he ever use Unforgivables.

Crossovers are Optional, but highly encouraged.

** I think a large part of the reason so few Dark Harry fics have the unforgivables is because they are boring. The killing curse kills and can't be blocked, pain is something other curses can cause and the imperius is probably the strongest of them all. What is darker, killing someone in one spell or melting their organs and blowing off limbs? One is graphic the other simple. Its easy to describe violent curses and very hard for amateur writers to carry a story with such 'clean' violence.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** With the implication that he doesn't find the Imperius Curse too terribly objectionable, when used against enemies, and that if he gets worked up into a rage he may forget himself and drop a Cruciatus on someone.

But we never see him even tempted to use the killing curse.

** linkffn(HP and the Summer of Change by lorddwar) - older fic with Harry being recruited after Sirius' death at the Ministry as a member of the Dept of Mysteries, field ops division. They teach him the Unforgiveables as essential combat spells along with other tactics.

Yes, it's trope-heavy with things that nowadays are considered laughably bad, but that's because this is where some of those great ideas came from, and were then pounded into mush by dozens of cheap knock-offs.

** On the Way to Greatnes linkffn(4745329)

On the off-chance that you haven't read it yet: It's an AU where Harry was sorted into Slytherin. It begins in 1st year, so it takes quite a few chapters until you get to the part about Harry casting Unforgiveables. The first three years can be a bit tedious to read, but then it really develops into a great fanfic.
