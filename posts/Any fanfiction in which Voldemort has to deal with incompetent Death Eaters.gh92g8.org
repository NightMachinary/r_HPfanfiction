I'm in the mood for smth light hearted and the authority figure having to deal with the incompetence of those in their care is never not funny to me


** The story Champion's Champion by Driftwood1965 has Voldemort complaining about his incompetent followers.

He's not Dead Yet by Redbayly also has Voldemort considering the incompetence of his Deatheaters.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.
