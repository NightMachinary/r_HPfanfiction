Hi,

I'm currently brainstorming a Ginny Weaselly story. The story is about Tom and Ginny working together to kill the other Horcruxs who have come to life and taken over the bodies of people. Please avoid death Eaters if at all possible and tell how the person would come into contact.

Thanks

- Ginny has the Diary
- The ring can be anyone
- The locket is taken by Mundungus
- The cup is up for anyone.
- The Diadem might be for someone who attended hogwarts in 1956
- Nagini is just a snake.
- Harry is just Harry.


** I would put the cup in Borgin and Burkes, or maybe just Hepzibah smith's house. Probably taken by a Dark family, perhaps Tonks' mom if you want her to have the cup.

The ring might have taken over the Riddle caretaker(or another muggle from the hometown), might be interesting to see what a horcrux can do with a muggle. Or worst case scenario it ensnares Dumbledore.

** For the cup, Hokey the House Elf has it. A Butterbeer-fueled fever dream allows her to break Tom Riddle's memory charm and she seeks it out as revenge for what he did to her former mistress, Hepzibah Smith. An angry House Elf is ill equipped to fight off a Horcrux.

The diadem was discovered by a certain Dolores Umbridge, an underachieving sixth year Slytherin, who wandered across the Room of Requirement quite by accident. Though her OWLs were thoroughly unimpressive, her NEWTs set the high water mark, achieving what none since Tom Riddle had done. Her family connections would land her a place at the Ministry, from where she would begin a torrid political ascent to the office of the Minister itself.
