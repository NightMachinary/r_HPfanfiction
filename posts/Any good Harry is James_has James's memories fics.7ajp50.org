I've been reading [[http://fanfiction.net/s/3384712/]] and like the idea but the execution is a bit flawed.


** This is one of the better fics of the fandom, I strongly doubt you'll find a better fic with a similar premise

***** Gotcha. I'm on mobile so I don't know how any of this works tbh ha. And yeah, that's pretty much the epitome of Harry has James' memories.

*** Huh. It's good but there's a few minor details I don't really like that are a bit jarring.

**** Yeah, it's not really a good story. It's good at distracting the reader into thinking it's a good story, but once you actually stop to think about it for a moment and ignore the sorting hat, it's pretty terrible.

***** It does do one thing right, in my opinion: It doesn't make Lily into this perfect saint we see far, far too often in fics that show James' flaws/bad sides.
