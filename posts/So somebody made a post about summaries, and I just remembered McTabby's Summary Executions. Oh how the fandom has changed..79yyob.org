  We pushed the swords into each other. Our bodies closer than comfortable. He leaned over and kissed me. I let him for a second, letting the buzz in mine mind make me warm all over. I pulled away and kneed him in the balls

I too would totally kick someone in the nuts and give a passionate tongue game if I got myself gutted with a goddamn sword.

  Severus Snape Out Of Character Female

So not Snape then...

#+begin_quote
  This fic is all about high-paced, trashy good fun. It introduces situations that stray slightly from the HP series' "good-old boy" style. It's set from the fiesty, strong-minded Naomi's POV, she has no mystical power, no super-human strength and no sense of political Manoeuvring. It's very centered on our favourite bad guy Draco Malfoy. The two teens are very much equals in personality, our heroine is gun happy and the main man reaches for his wand a bit too quickly. So can they survive the obsticles they're facing like master vampires and the o-so-scary Voldemort while riping at each others throats? Dumbledore eventually takes pity on them and offers sanctuary at his school, but even their dream aren't safe from unwanted advances, eventually they are forced together physically by circumstance. Who will brake first? Dancing with Death can be hazardous to your health. /^/ I have this thing, it's a personality trait really, I say what I mean and mean what I say "Draco I'm going to kill you,"- Naomi /^/ /^/"You infuriate me! Everything you do! Every little movement you make, makes me want to hurl things at you!" He ran his hands through his hair letting a long breath out of his nose fighting to stay calm and not hurl things at me.- Draco and Naomi /^/ /^/ I began to wonder how long we'd be stuck here with Reuben and would it be possible that I'd have to sleep with him in dream world. Would that even count as sex or just a really realistic wet dream? Further more did girls even have wet dreams? And would Draco feel everything I felt, would he see it? Would I be playing Mrs Erotica to his dreams/nightmares? Gross.- Naomi /^/

I hope it's trashy neon Voldemort lightning up like a child's eyes at christmas. Digging it.

** That first one, the one about Princess Anastasia seems like it could be an interesting premise if written better. We really ought to have more Rasputin in this fandom.
