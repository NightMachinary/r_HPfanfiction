Are there any fics where Harry gets a cool ability that is used throughout the book, but it doesn't make him OP? I prefer not to read Harry "I obliterate dumbledore with a flick of my wrist" Potter.

Over 70k+ words please!


** linkffn(Harry potter and the emerald trance) i think this covers it. It allows harry to duel on par with adult wizards over power spells and in general be powerful. But its hard to control, finicky, and exhausting.

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)

*** I just started Emerald Trance.... and I am disappointed. A lot of similar things happening I can understand, but the whole Umbridge situation is annoying. Harry who has learned to watch his mouth for several years is still getting in trouble for snapping. It kind of ruins the premise a bit for me.

Edit) I redact my comment.

*** I just finished this fanfiction, and I have to say.... it is very well written, but absolutely a nightmare in execution. The Emerald Trance is a perfect power, that Harry easily controls, never gets tired when using, and is consistent. Except for one portion of the story it is a mary sue power.

I had some serious issues with how close the author follows cannon as well, I get that the general layout is the same, but in the end I feel like he just rewrote the entire story with a less enjoyable Harry Potter.

***** No no, it was a good rec, the series as a whole is fun, if not a little too stringently connected to the main series. The highlight though is that it reads as if it was professionally written.

** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) might fit this. Harry spontaneously develops an Animagus form but doesn't 'level up' in other magics.

** In linkao3(4924519) the Unforgivable Series Harry is able to bend reality and control 'life threads' in another dimension. It sounds cringey but the author did a good job with it. There was great character development and suspense.
