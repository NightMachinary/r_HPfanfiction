Hello everyone!

The Tales of Everest Scamander has just been updated!

Chapter Fourteen: The Second Year.

Chapter Fifteen: The Ten.

Chapter Sixteen: The Gala.

In these chapters Everest starts her second year at Ilvermorny and joins an elite group of students who are under the supervision of Professor Steward. She also meets a very important guest at a very fancy dance.

For those who haven't read my story yet, here's a brief description.

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.

Future pairings are DracoxOC and FredxOC

** And from a somewhat interesting story it deviated into same old same old nothing new here territory.

Lost any interest in it when the summary says she goes back to Hogwarts. Even the weird name was not such a turn off as that.

*** If it isn't your cup of tea that's fine. I think you might be surprised though. If you don't like fics about Hogwarts, you might actually really enjoy this story. You don't have to give it a try, but I highly recommended the first couple chapters at least.

What I can tell you about this story is it is an entirely new plot with a whole new set of characters.
