I hope this is an okay post, but I'm looking for a full (I believe it was 4 or 5 chapters at the time I last read it) either cached file or a link to the full story. The story is either deleted from ff.net or it just doesn't want to show up for me, and the only copy I found (scribd or something) is only 2 chapters.

I know the story was never finished - or was relatively stagnated the last I read it - but it was one that got me thinking and inspired some ideas.

Any general recommendations for stories with more detailed necromancy/dark magic and rituals are also welcome.


** Why not just message her and ask for the story if she still has it?
