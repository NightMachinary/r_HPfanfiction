** Oh god, Bleach. That series taught me the meaning of blue balls. (In Kubo's defense, he's been sick for ages, but ssshhh)

If Harry was a Quincy he'd be a lot faster and a lot more likely to call down rains of arrows on his enemies. He might in a fit of stupidity drink the blood of the being whose soul fragment lives in him (hmmm, familiar) leading to him getting a shiny new power, like the ability to turn people into his personal zombies or destroy anything in a straight line.

*** Bount Arc is filler, yes and the main characters as less upgrades and powers than Goku. XD

** Cornelius Fudge could be the spirit king he's just as useless, and Gildroy Lockhart could be Don Kanonji.

** Harry could turn his Quincy Cross into a Focus with Little Gems made of his blood (done up like the one from The Da Vinci Code with 13 Jewels) so he can shoot Spells like Arrows, Harry raining Stunners on DE'S or sniping them with Exploding Spells from hundreds of yards away.
