2 years ago I met my girlfriend with whom I apparently share a taste in Fanfiction. Before I met her, my interaction with other HP fanfiction fans was solely through this subreddit. She introduced me to another (all-women) FF reading club. One thing that I noticed was that my girlfriend and her friends are so much more focused on "One True Ships" or shipping in general. Whenever someone recommended a Fic, the first question inevitably boiled down to: Ship?

Whereas I (a guy) dont really pay attention to ships. Sure, I often stumble upon ships and even get a kick out of certain scenes but mostly I disregard them. (There was this amazing "Harry was raised in the forest" fic that somehow ended up with him in love with Draco. While it was a nice addition, it neither added nor took away from the fic for me.)

Is this a male / female thing? How important are the ships in the fics you read to you? And do you identify as male or female?


** As long as it's not the main focus of the fic, I don't care about the ship. And I'm female, so I guess I don't fit into your data set. Might be more of a community thing?

******* Adding my 2C to this: In my experience women tend to flesh out their bios a lot more than guys, they have lists of favourite characters, ships, tropes e.t.c. While guys tend to keep it minimal with just basic info and updates on their schedules.

Again, there are of course exceptions, but in /general/ that's what I find.

I don't care much about the ship, unless its slash or H/Hr or H/G, which I hate. I only care if there is romance and if its well written. My fav fic all time is Grow Young with me, which is an OC.

** I don't think it really matters that much to women in general. (Or I'm so self-centred that I take my own experience and that of my friends' for the Gospel, I'm never sure eh).

Usually, there is mostly two type of stories. The ones where all that matters is the plot. The stories where there is a mystery/adventure/things happen/lot of research etc. And for these fics, I and all of my girl friends usually filter by ships in so much as « ships that I absolutely can't stand ».

And then, there is the fluff fic (or angst, tbf). Where it's mostly cantered around a ship/love stories/emotional stories etc. And there, indeed, it's all about OTP.

But overall, I really don't think that girls are all that much more interested in OTPs. Maybe we're more open about enjoying fluff fics, though (it feels a bit like « romcom are for women/only liked by women », even if it's just something we'll consume from time to time etc).

(And I have no idea if what I wrote makes any sense at all, sorry !)

*** as a dude, romcoms are okay if they're not cringeworthy or sexist. as it turns out, a lot of the so-called romcoms i've read have ended up being incredibly sexist towards both men AND women (see "all women are prudes", "all men are perverts", "men act, women are", "double standard abuse: female on male", "men are generic, women are special", and "the unfair sex" TVtropes pages for more details on the most common pitfalls).

that said, most romcoms are pretty obviously aimed at women in the first place, because guys "aren't allowed" to be into that kind of thing without getting slammed down by the awful sorts in our society ("wow, you like people talking about their feelings? what a [slur]"). but since women "are allowed" to like male-targeted works, obviously works targeted toward women aren't going to be as popular as works targeted toward men, so they shouldn't bother wasting funding on them (or so say the publishers and tv network executives). this leads to the "girl show ghetto" where media aimed at girls is just lower-quality all around. fanfiction gets around this part by dint of not being funded like that, but the stigma persists.

fluff can be pretty good, but there are a few common pitfalls that it tends to land in. One is "love solves all their problems", which no it fucking doesn't. Another is "he's a bad boy but he's absolutely perfect to me", which is incredibly unrealistic and probably leads to a lot of abuse when people try it IRL. Another is "not even gonna try to explain how these characters got here", and another is "here let me cram these characters into these little molds made out of my own ideas about what a perfect relationship is, no matter how much i have to bend their characters with no explanation or development".

also, anything tagged "lewff" or "fluff and smut" is generally actual garbage.

  not really. you're constantly tested on your knowledge if you're a woman into tech or cars, &c. ''oh but are you really into tech? do you know about a c b x y z.'' as a woman you can't be casually interested in male-coded things, you have to know everything about it, too, otherwise you're just basic or trying to signal something or w/e.

#+end_quote

i find that most of it is poorly-written, tends to fail the "show, don't tell" rule, and authors almost universally slip their own personal kinks into it. (it's also depressing to me but that's purely for personal reasons)

#+begin_quote
  idk this feels v. male centric. romcoms are more misogynistic than the reverse imo. when women talk to other women in them it's almost always only about men, women are still commodified the same way they are in normal patriarchial culture, etc. the exact same systems are reproduced.
#+end_quote

the "almost always only talking about men" thing is something that i don't actually quite know what to call? like, is there a trope name for that? I don't remember one offhand. you are correct that it is a problem. on some level i have to wonder if it's partially a self-sustaining cycle; hollywood depicts certain categories of people a certain way, people from that category act that way to emulate their idols/role models, hollywood uses that as justification to depict people from that category in that way.

I think there's probably more than one subcategory of romcoms, though, and we may have seen different instances. I can definitely believe that there's a lot of them that are primarily misogynistic, particularly when they're aimed at more than exclusively female demographics. if the stuff aimed just at you is ALSO misogynistic, then... i don't even know how the hell they're profitable.

i guess some of the tropes i mentioned are more prevalent in "Lifetime Movie of the Week" (again, see TVtropes) than in romcoms, but the "Men are generic, women are special" is a really nasty one seen all over that's sexist towards everyone involved.

side note: where i'm at, most of the people who complain about "the patriarchy" are misandrist lunatics with massively overinflated egoes and a sense of entitlement miles long, who think the world owes them literally everything and will play oppression olympics at every available opportunity. it took me a moment to realize you weren't just talking out your ass here. could you elaborate on what you mean by "commodified"?

**** I like to avoid Rom-coms if I can. I mean I'll read one if it is highly recommended, I'll favorite anything if it has a unique, interesting element of the story, but I'll avoid them. They're usually freaking teenagers.

Those tropes you listed above tend to ruin a story for me. I will always favorite a story where female against male violence is subverted with punishment (I usually don't like reading the inverse, because male against female violence is almost always a bad plot device). I always thought a realistic story would have a Harry who a dates a few people a bit throughout his later years in Hogwarts and settles down in his 20s. Would widen the cast a bit, and I think most of them would remain friends with Harry.

** Male here

Generally I don't care about ships, my interest in fanfiction is in AUs and canon divergences, focusing on the question of "what if things went differently from canon?" In those kinds of fics, ships and romance tend to take a backseat, if it's present at all. So I don't have a preference for what ships come up in those stories, it could have fem!Voldemort/Harry and I would not mind as long as the entire story was interesting.

The exception to this is Harmony (Harry/Hermione). It's pretty much been ruined for me after years of fanfics. I don't particularly dislike the ship, I think both the Ronmione and Harmony ships have valid points, but in my experience, 9 times out of 10, Harmony goes hand in hand with Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. And not in a good way either, it's the same old Weasley love potion and Dumbledore manipulation plot that's been done so often the proverbial horse has been resurrected and beaten to death several times over. So I steer clear of those simply because there's nothing unique about it and I have no desire to read the same story remixed over and over again.

tl;dr- am dude, ships are secondary to plot

** Ships are pretty important to me in a story. Even if they're not the man focus, generally speaking I don't read stories with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Harry and I never read stories with Harry getting involved with Death Eaters (sans Draco) unless there's a dang good explanation.

Mostly, I read Harry/Ginny or Harry/Multi stories where Ginny is either with Harry or, at the very least, isn't bashed (it's a huge turnoff for me). Pretty much every other ship is allowed, as long as it's good enough.

When it comes to slash, though, I am particularly picky, with most of the slash stories I like being Seamus/Harry. Anything with Deamus in it is also an instant turnoff for me, unless it's a really background detail in the story. I'm also picky about fem!Harry stories, but I usually like fem!Harry with Fred and/or George, Draco, or Theodore Nott (who I also ship with plain old Harry).

Oh, and I identify as female by the way.

Hope this all helps with your survey!

** I don't really care about the ship unless it's completely unrealistic. I care more about plot, worldbuilding and action.

I prefer fics like linkffn(Divided and Entwined) where there are more scenes of Hermione blasting Death Eaters to pieces than scenes of Hermione dating Ron and Harry.

I'm also totally alright with fics that don't have any ships at all. Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them) had great plot and worldbuilding without any romance and it's one of my favorites.

I also especially enjoy fics where pre-Hogwarts Harry discovers magic on his own. Those tend to not have much romance in them due to young age.

Dramione fic where 90% is descriptions of Draco and Hermione kissing? Nah. Dramione fic where both are double agents, have to deceive Voldemort at the Christmas dinner in Malfoy Manor and Dumbledore while in Hogwarts, learn difficult Dark magic and assassinate their enemies? Fuck yeah!

** I'm a girl, and ships have a lot of importance in what I read, but it's not because I specifically like romance fics more than others.

For me, when I'm reading a fic, I primarily just want the characters to be as as happy as possible. If I know a fic has a sad ending I'll refuse to read it. And my ships are usually just people I think would be happiest with each other, have good chemistry/compatible personalities, or would make for an interesting story if done well. I also never have ships where one character is oc or near oc (Daphne, Susan, etc).

So with Harry for instance, I only really ship him with Ginny Luna or Draco. (And even then I really mostly prefer Ginny, to the point that if I do read a Luna or Draco fic, there's a high chance it's a poly fic with Ginny still part of it.) And so I don't gain any enjoyment reading Harry/narcissa or what have you, because the whole time I'm reading the fic, in my head I would just be thinking "but his best possible match is right there, so why is he wasting time with Narcissa?"

So when I'm looking for fics to read, I rarely have any specific requirements in terms of plot or genre. It could be pretty much any plot or setting you could think of, but as long as it's got a happy ending and a focus on one of my ships, I'll give it a try. Sometimes even if everything about it is shit I'll read it solely bc my ship is in it.

To compare to, it could have the most interesting plot ever, but if it doesn't have a happy ending or any of my ships, I'll most likely never pick the fic up.

So many people treats shipping as this very superficial unimportant thing for ~silly teenage girls ~, but in the real world romance and pair bonding is more or less* a vitally important part of life as humans. We are naturally social creatures, we go to so many lengths to find the one we want to spend our life with, is it really so unusual for people to value that in the media we engage in as much as in our own lives?

***** There's more than one thing I could make this post about, gonna try to summarize all of them. I may be atypical, between Aspergers' syndrome and trust issues.

The premise of the fic is important, I tend to skip over anything with a premise that doesn't really interest me. In particular, if a fic's entire premise is "it's all about this ship", or if the tagline implies that it's all about this ship, those tend to exclude almost everything that isn't directly related to the ship, which leaves a lot of plot holes and unexplained background.

Alternatively, if the entire premise is built on relationship drama I will not read it. For example (and I literally pulled this tagline from "newly posted stories" on FFN) "Christina Miller is a mortal on Percy's Olympic Swim Team. Percy invites his team to a pool party at his house, so Christina who has had a Crush on Percy for a long while goes over, what will happen when she meets Annabeth?"

See, that implies that /literally the entire premise of the fic/ is built on relationship/crush drama. (Also note that they should have put parenthesis around "who has had a Crush on Percy for a long while" and also not capitalized Crush). Me? I hate how complicated people make things like romance. Who has to do what and when and where and why and how.

A lot of it is believability and mood/tone. If the characters are acting out-of-character, there'd better be a good reason for it. (Longer works have a lot more time to build up character development on that front). Worldbuilding is good, and I really appreciate fics that get the character's "voices" right (stuff like word choice is critical to that, speech patterns really help a character feel more like themself.)

Combat and action scenes... ehhh. Combat works a lot better in more dynamic mediums, particularly video. Written words just don't really do a very good job of capturing the chaos that is actual combat in almost all cases. Occasional action sequences are fine, but don't make the whole thing an action sequence because it WILL fall flat (and at some point I'll go "holy shit what are your enemies Imperial Stormtroopers? How are you not dead yet?")

I absolutely refuse to read kill-em-all fics, and bash-fics are quite annoying to read because of the exaggerations made to the characters to support the author's personal beliefs about the characters being bashed. "Look at how awful and evil I made this character act! Isn't he/she so awful and evil all the time?" Total bullshit circular logic. Likewise, I don't want to read the Draco In Leather Pants fics that glorify the "bad boy/girl" because honestly people who think it works that way are going to set themselves up for abuse IRL. Bad boys/girls DO NOT make the best marriage partners! God damn idiots.

I don't like grimdark - if the setting is grimdark, someone had better be doing something about it and not failing horribly at every turn. I hate reading "being ___ is suffering". "___ the Master of Escalation" stuff has to be really well-written to not be awful (and if it's "___ the Master of Escalation who Despite Going Full God-Tier Cannot Get A Happy Anything Ever" then I'm noping right out).

One of the things I do is I tend to look for long fics. Thanks to my trust issues, I like to have a lot of time to get to know someone. I like lots of detail, I like a world that explains things in the background and works on a consistent internal logic (even if it's incomprehensible to the characters). Short stories aren't really my thing, because there isn't enough time and material for me and my trust issues to warm up to the characters and get emotionally invested in them.

I've learned the following from experience browsing AO3 and FFN: Any fic with a wordcount-per-chapter of less than 1,000 is almost guaranteed to be too sparse (no detail AT ALL, probably just a summary pretending to be a story), disjointed (jumping from scene to scene and snippet to snippet haphazardly and rapidly and leaving no time to explore anything major), or low-quality (seriously [author name redacted] are you even TRYING?) to bother with. Anything with a wordcount-per-chapter over 5k is usually at least okay. Anything with a total wordcount of over a million is either absolutely fantastic (written by an extremely dedicated author who is utterly driven to write the best possible story and puts in their whole 110% to make it as good as they can) or absolute crap (written by an idiot who can't even spellcheck and thinks all criticism is "flaming" and is too socially oblivious to know when to stop), because nothing that's "so boring it's average" can keep the author's interest long enough to get that long. Stuff between 100k and 500k tends to be the very high end of where "so boring it's average" stuff lands, in my experience. Anything with a wordcount of less than ten thousand is too short for me and my trust issues to get involved in.

Edit to add: As for "fun", I do like a good "shenanigans" fic if it can be pulled off believably, but most of that ends up veering straight into Crackfic territory. Adventures are good, overarching plots are good, exploring implications is good, examining how things work is good.

*** Male fanfiction reader and sort-of writer here, if you have any questions I have nothing better to do today (except keep writing and i'm not in the right headspace to write anyone trying to interact meaningfully with Moaning Myrtle right now, especially when they kinda fail).

Shipping-wise, I made a more complete post in another reply in this thread discussing what makes so many romance stories fall flat. Quick summary is twofold:

1. lots of them are sexist to everyone (see "all women are prudes", "all men are perverts", "men act, women are", "double standard abuse: female on male", "men are generic, women are special", and "the unfair sex" TVtropes pages, also "damsel in distress").

2. others hit "love solves all their problems", which no it fucking doesn't; "he's a bad boy but he's absolutely perfect to me", which is beyond stupid; "not even gonna try to explain how these characters got here" and "here let me cram these characters into these little molds made out of my own ideas about what a perfect relationship is, no matter how much i have to bend their characters with no explanation or development".

also every now and then you see a romance-ish fanfic where the author very obviously has a certain kink and it's visible in the story because they couldn't fucking keep it out.

** This is just my POV, I could be wrong. The shipping issue (for both genders) is possibly a fan fiction only thing - there's a huge element of wish fulfillment in fan fiction. People in the LGBT community want better representation in the stories they read, people don't find the canon ships believable even though they are only 5% of the plot (HarryxGinny vs Harryxanyone else), or people want the character they find most attractive/worthy to end up with the MC. This then forces fan fiction readers to pay attention to ships only so that they avoid the bad/forced ships (everyone's opinion is different on what those are - I hate HarryxBellatrix, others are really into it).

Personally, sometimes I'm in a mood for ships and sometimes I'm not.

** i like plot heavy with a really great ship. ships r really important to me i read pretty strictly only pairings i like. but it can't just be a ship bc i like novel length fics 100k+ and i need more than a ship to carry that. (i'm female). i agree that my first question after being told a fic is good is “ship?”

** I'm fairly ship-focused in HP, but from the perspective of One True Character rather than One True Pairing. I multi-ship, and in fanfic I'm more interested in character studies than plot - not that I avoid plot, but it's not a requirement, and if the characterization or writing style bother me, no amount of plot will keep me from bailing.

I can enjoy romantic fics if they're beautifully written and bittersweet, but I gravitate more toward angst, odd pairings, age gaps, enemy ships, unhealthy passions, intensity, and strange bedfellows. I like UST and smut, but not if it's one-size-fits-all Ikea sex; it has to serve a purpose and fit the characters.

Wit, style, complex characterization, veins of poetry and pain, magical inventiveness, clever dialogue, eroticism, and moral ambiguity are all more important to me than pure plot or worldbuilding. Ships tend to be the vehicle for that.

Possibly relevant: my fannish preferences don't reflect my non-fannish tastes in fiction at all.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I am a woman and I go through different phases while reading.

If I'm simply reading to pass the time, I go for gen fics which are Harry centric - kid!Harry, canon divergences, or post-war Harry being a Professor, Healer or simply a father to Teddy, and so on. I still filter out ships I don't like - I cannot stomach Snape being romantic with anyone.

If I'm feeling sad, I go for a fluff marathon. This is usually pairing specific, even if the characters aren't exactly canon compliant. I tend to read more slash than het in the HP fandom... but that is because I don't like the lead female characters in HP other than Luna.

On other days, I worsen my bad mood by reading angst fics. Pairings don't matter much because the ones I choose would be about character deaths.

** As a male, my first question about a fic usually boils down to ship. But this is mostly so I can avoid fics with ships that I prefer to avoid. Otherwise I care little for what, if any, ships a fic has. The only exception is less, which I may read due to the ship alone, at least until I exhausted the list of popular FFN/Ao3 fics with this ship.
