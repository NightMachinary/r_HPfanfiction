** Basically whatever [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] wrote about them, except Susan Bones who should follow more closely her auntie and be a lawyer (there is no better portrait of her than linkao3(2467277)). And yes, Justin should be something more towards politics (perhaps, even the Muggle one), diplomatic service, or army (perhaps something in the style of linkffn(4798208)).

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.

** I have following assumptions for the postwar Magical Britain:

1) The role of Ministry of Magic immediately following the Battle of Hogwarts.

The British Ministry of Magic resembled more of a failed state. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the 'great' Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's forces. Then, large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and deterrence after the war. I expect it to be thoroughly purged by the winners of the war and rebuilt from the ground up.

--------------

2) The roles of our heroes (The Trio, Ginny, Neville, Luna mainly)

I know many people like the angst/comfort/hurt genre. But I don't think our main characters going broke immediately following the Battle would be canon compliant. They didn't just lead happy lives 20 years later, but ruled magical Britain, and that could not have been achieved if they had drown themselves in PTSD misery for years!

They were after all mentally extremely strong people. They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on power immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best. They knew they couldn't afford to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

Their decision to send Harry and Ron into Auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional needs. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls recruiting more followers at Hogwarts.

We know Ron and Neville spent only a few years as Aurors, which meant that Death Eater threats were mostly gone by that point. Harry needed only 8-9 years to make it to the youngest Head Auror ever, which implied that he was very successful at this job. He spent a further decade as Head Auror before becoming the director of DMLE. Another implication of those canon facts was that Harry had the loyalty of Magical Britain's security forces.

Also, you can no longer assume our main characters to remain innocent children or naive teenagers anymore. To get where they are at in the Epilogue, they will have to become hardened warriors and cunning politicians.

--------------

3) Magical Britain will have to experience radical changes. I have written an one shot for the occasion of BoH's 20th anniversary. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview with Harry]], linkffn(12925628), and I have him saying "they had been very thorough with Voldemort sympathizers".

I don't expect them to carry out mass executions, but they would push through following measures such as:

- Establish their own political and paramilitary organization/network based on the DA. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna were working hard in their last year at Hogwarts to recruit followers for their cause. It started out as a self help group for students to overcome the trauma of the previous year, and Luna came up with the proposal to formalize it and expand it to the general populace after their graduation.
- Seize control of Magical Britain's security forces with DA veterans and Order members.
- Rile up and organize the general public to purge and reform Ministry/Wizengamot. The mass torture of Hogwarts students under the Carrows should serve as a primary rallying cause.
- Grant significant emergency and surveillance powers to Aurors. Auror office eventually became the equivalent of combined MI5 and MI6.
- Hold public trials and fully expose atrocities committed by Death Eaters, Snatchers, and Voldemort sympathizers.
- Reject “I'm just taking my orders” as a form of legal defense.
- Reveal the damages caused to Magical Britain by Blood Purity ideology, using examples of Bulstrodes, Carrows, Crabbes, Goyles, Lestranges, and most importantly, Voldemort himself.
- Make public support of Blood Purity high treason.
- Taboo the word “mudblood”. But instead of going after each trigger, Aurors would record the frequency and location of their occurrences, and send humans to conduct in-depth investigations.
- Vetting of all public positions (Ministry employees, Hogwarts staff) for extreme ideologies.
- Confiscate assets of Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to compensate their victims.

4) Regarding the roles of individual D.A. members other than the Ministry Six, here are my head canons:

SUSAN BONES: Bones family seems to have a tradition of being in Magical Law Enforcement, such as Amelia and Edgar. Susan, being a core member of the DA, has every motivation and skills to continue this tradition. She is my preferred deputy for Harry and will become the Head Auror after Harry's promotion to the director of DMLE.

HANNAH ABBOTT: Not a head canon actually, JKR said that she married Neville, ran Leaky Cauldron for some time, before replacing Madame Pomfrey at Hogwarts.

DEAN THOMAS and SEAMUS FINNEGAN: all veteran Aurors. Dean had a multi year romantic relationship with Luna after their time in the Shell Cottage, but broke up amicably because of differences in their professional interests. Seamus and Ginny lead the hardliner faction of the DA, whose members take a zero tolerance attitude towards Death Eaters and Blood Purists.

PARVATI PATIL: Her talent in divination makes her an idea candidate as a seer in the DoM (Department of Mysteries). Her sister PADMA also joined her as an Unspeakable, along with ANTHONY GOLDSTEIN.

LAVENDER BROWN: I assume she survived, although with some long lasting physical changes and a major change in personality. She's no longer a girlish gossip, and is a rather serious no nonsense Auror. She works well with the also serious Susan Bones.

TERRY BOOT: He is the chief liaison between Aurors and DoM, as Anthony Goldstein is his best friend at Hogwarts.

HERMIONE: Lots of her postwar career has already been said by JKR, but I still see some room for head canons. For example, she too had a stint in the DoM for several years, and continues to work closely with Unspeakables. She was the one who came up with the idea of implementing a new Taboo that eventually caught Rudolphus Lestrange in 2000 and nailed the gang behind “Skeeter's Conspiracy” in 2014.

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY: He runs the important Department of Muggle Affairs. One of his key tasks is to manage Muggles who are let in on magic and help maintaining the SoS. Another one is to improve Muggleborn's integration with the magical world.

LEE JORDAN: He stayed at Witch Weekly until Barnabus Cuffe, the chief editor of Daily Prophet, was arrested as a ringleader of the “Skeeter Conspiracy” and executed when his crimes in the Muggle world were uncovered.

LUNA: As indicated above, she and Dean had a relationship for several years before she moved on with Rolf Scamander. They have two children together and successfully found the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Speaking of Rolf's grandfather Newt, he and his wife Porpentina managed to keep their communities safe until Voldemort's takeover in 1997. They had to flee the country for the being, and Tina had tried to enlist foreign support against Voldemort in America. However, Voldemort's speedy fall took them by surprise. Nevertheless, Tina and several volunteers from America offered to help out the new Kingsley Ministry and train DA members to become Aurors. She retired after the Last Death Eater, Rudolphus Lestrange, was killed in 2000.

***** They work well enough. Concerning Padma's children, though --- twins don't run in families the way you seem to think they do. A family with /identical/ twins has a higher chance of having another pair of identical twins down the line, but is not significantly more likely to have heterozygote twins.
