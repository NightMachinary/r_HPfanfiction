** This could be written as a really dark and interesting fic.

Fate would ignore Harry's please and send him back to his 11 year old self no matter what arguments he makes, plunging Harry into a powerful mix of panic and depression. He quickly decides to actually do everything exactly the same way so that he eventually lives his way back to where it was, but fails almost immediately. No matter how much he tries, even if he says the exact same things verbatim, he can't emulate the exact same context and emotions as originally, and the butterfly effect escalates rapidly. He realizes his original family and interactions will never return, plunging him deeper into desperation.

It could also explore the mental effects of having an old and jaded adult in a child's body. Even if he did want this, I still imagine being extremely frustrating, doubly so for someone like Harry that would turn everything in a moral dilemma. If the journey was forced on him, this whole thing must be downright horrible.

*** Harry died from old age in his original timeline, so he won't fall to panic and depression so quickly. But otherwise, it would be rather dark.

Due to having a lifetime's worth of experience and foreknowledge concerning Ron and Hermione, Harry's manner of speaking to them has subtly changed. Whatever Harry says Ron and Hermione follow without question.

While Harry really wants his family back, the mental agegap with Ginny is ridiculous. He feels like a pedo.

And worst of all, Fate considers his marriage with Ginny one of the mistakes She sent him back to fix...

Trouble is the moment they meet and interact he feels disgusted with himself about trying to manipulate her into loving him, and again, he can't emulate the original actions and emotions no matter how identical he tries to behave.

Then all of a sudden, he realizes Professor Sinistra, a woman 30 years older than his current body, is a genuienly amazing person, and in his current state, it would be ridiculous to make any sort of move on her, adding to his sense of isolation and increasing depression.

However, all of the POVs (Dumbledore, Percy Weasley, Sally-Anne Perks would have been the main three with some others) would be from the non-time travelers who are getting consistently wigged out by these creepy children who try and fail to act like children.

One of the things I thought about was that none of the returnees would feel comfortable dating 11 year old children but some of them returnees were married/dating and continue to be so...but outsiders like Percy Weasley feel insanely creeped out that his younger brother and a muggleborn witch are dating already.

But yeah, I always feel weird about people in time traveling bodies dating kids. It's icky.

******* Alternatively, the shit Harry got into gave him a very screwed up perception of what constitutes as ‘dangerous' and an intrinsic disregard for what the ministry says helped by the fact that /he/ is one of those responsible for setting up and execute it's politics and thus knows exactly just how much is swept under the hug or just outright disregarded. All the while Ginny (who became more cautiously after the diary in her first year -hence the distrust towards the potion book in HBP- and then became one of the responsible for ensuring the safety of the younger students in Hogwarts during the war) took up this side of parenting since she is far more overprotective, but also being unable to filter all of Harry's ‘brilliant' ideas since she is busy most of the type with her career.

The end result is situations like her coming back home to find out that Harry stole a dragon's egg to let their children see it's birth and potentially even raise it while it's mother is drugged to the grills and back in their backyard ‘cause little Al (not even Hogwarts age!) saw a wizard flying dragons in a cartoon and thought it looked cool. She naturally starts screaming and tearing her hairs out while a serene Harry is looking slightly confused while trying to understand what is wrong with the new family's pet, Ginny surely wouldn't be so insensitive as to suggest an owl after what happened with poor Hedwig.

I imagine that this Harry going back in time would probably result in Norbert growing up in Hogwarts raised in secret with the help of the students, Acromantulas becoming normal pets (to Ron's horror), advanced and dangerous magic being taught to anyone who asks and the chamber of secrets becoming a club house /with the basilisk still inside/.

*** It could also alternatively have a result similar to the way Tom choose to take power in linkffn([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16329614]]) -I highly recommend it, it was absolutely brilliant and hilarious- meaning that, while Harry wouldn't do something so OOC as siding with Voldemort or anything of the like, he would do his damm best to make sure to get the exact opposite results as the list given to him.

The reaper wants him to get together with Hermione? Well it is not like he /wants/ to jump on the bones of an 11 YO child when he died of old-age, so no biggie sidestepping /that/; the reaper wants him to disregard his old friends in exchange for ones who would /'help'/ him on his assigned goals? Than he makes sure to never let anyone he befriends help with the things the reaper asked (can't see him trying to befriend someone based on anything other than the person's own personality even if it is out of spite); the reaper wants him to oppose Dumbledore? His old headmaster is the most knowledgeable wizard he knows, is old without ambitions to immortality and has a lot more of resources and skills at his disposal than Harry could reasonably attain, going to him with the information earlier so they can try to figure out ways of dealing with the “Voldemort issue” without him dying (putting Quirrelmort in a permanent coma?) is really a no brainer; the reaper wants the unifying of the magical/non-magical world or whatever political goals are generally found in this types of stories but that Harry never gave a hint of caring about in cannon? Then doing the complete opposite in separating even more the worlds should be relatively easy and leave him with enough time for something he actually enjoys.

And last but not least, he has to get his own philosopher's stone or some other path to immortality to make sure there is no going back again and ‘fixing-it' after his death.

   :END:
Harry reflected, and decided he had not lived his best life, but he had lived a /good/ life, if one could call it that. He was certainly far more privileged than many, and if he could go back and change things, well, they'd be mostly the little errors that ate away at him; relationships he had failed to keep up with, words said in anger, those sorts of things. There were certainly things he /wished/ had been different, but he had no idea how he could have fixed those things.

Sometimes, broken things can't be fixed. Sometimes, when you're destined to kill Dark Lords of magic, accomplishing anything else is a bonus.

--------------

He was most proud of James, Al, and Lils, as they managed to become somewhat extra-ordinary sorcerers given the circumstances of their upbringing. Dad being famous was often the subject of wonder, outrage, frustration, fear, remorse, and bullying at different stages of their lives: both for the children and parents.

Harry was proud of Teddy Lupin, too, who grew up in as difficult a situation as any of his kids and still managed to do the right thing.

Harry and Ginny's nightmares never really went away, and their method of coping with the emotional scars of war involved a dangerous combination of doubling down on their respective careers (Harry as an Auror, Ginevra as a Seeker for the Harpies), self-medicated alcohol and potion abuse, uproarious, passionate arguments, and uproarious, passionate make-up sessions (of which both Albus and Lilly were the result). Harry and Ginny's marriage became further strained as both their jobs sent them home injured more often than either would like, and the subject always came down to what was best for the kids.

In the end, Harry caved first.

--------------

The Auror life was not the life for Harry. Post-war Britain was a mess of sorting out skirmishing former Death Eaters, the Death Eater aligned and sympathetic, those claiming to be under the Imperius (and of course, many of them /had/ been under the influence of the Unforgivable), copy-cats, and the general mayhem of reconstructing a collapsed government.

Harry slowly grew to resent bureaucracy in all its forms. Hundreds-year old laws prevented him from doing his job, or let known, dangerous criminals walk free; or else let him and his "colleagues" do unspeakable things in the line of duty. Harry never wanted an innocent man like his godfather (well, /mostly/ innocent) to be punished for a crime he didn't commit, but there had to be a happy middle-ground between the chaos of a government with no teeth implementing Rule of Law, and the authoritarian grip of Law and Order, yet, it seemed like the new Ministry -- mostly Moderates, as the influential extremes on both sides of the political spectrum were either dead, in prison, or under investigation -- oscillated between the two extremes. It was unbelievably frustrating, and Harry had a bad habit of either bottling all this up, or else taking his work home with him.

The fact that the Ministry /still/ used Dementors upset Harry to no end.

Ron confided that he and Hermione had similar issues, what with Ron riding Harry's coattails in the Auror department (but still far more competent than the vast majority of the staff; it was just that Ron and Harry worked best together) and Hermione quickly rising in the administration on her own, of course, but Ron and Hermione weren't nearly as combustible as Harry and Ginny.

They'd both been personally possessed by Voldemort, in one way or another, after all.

The arguments always started and ended differently, but Voldemort needled his way in each and every one, like an annoying tune stuck in your head.

"Did you go to St. Mungo's?" She'd ask.

"I'm fine," he'd reply.

And then it would start.

"You're a reckless mess, Harry Potter. What would we do if something happened? Do you even think of what might happen to your children?"

"They're yours, too, or did you forget that /I also played Quidditch/ and know what a broken collarbone looks like."

"It's entirely different, and you know that!"

"I'm not risking my life for /sport/, I gave that up!"

"Just like you gave up so many other things, so you could chase evil and be a hero?!"

"YES! But I never asked for it."

"You aren't always the victim, Harry, even when you think you're being a hero!"

"I've been the bloody victim since before I was two years old!"

There was only so much the /Muffliato/ spell could conceal, and inevitably one of the kids would start crying, and either Harry, or Ginny, or both, would go to the Firewhiskey while the other, or both, tried to put the kids to bed and make up.

It was a disastrous time.

"I'm done," Harry said, one day. He was only thirty and retiring from the Aurors.

"With what?" Ginny asked, shakily.

"The Aurors. The Ministry. I'm not involved any more. I put in my notice. It all just... conjures up too much."

Ginny knew how much Harry couldn't help "helping," so she was sympathetic.

Teddy was starting Hogwarts soon, and James a year after. Life at home wasn't good, so Harry had to fix that. It's what Harry did. Fix things. Bugger the rest of the Wizarding World, Harry would focus on his own.

Life was good for a while, but the nightmares persisted.

Harry was in his mid-thirties, supposedly the prime of his life, as a wizard, but he felt much older. The stress of a rebuilding magical Britain, raising a family, and hunting Dark wizards, after fighting a war as a teenager just took its toll. All of his kids, and his godson, were in Hogwarts, and while they required intermittent catastrophe-level parenting intervention, they were physically away for so much of the year that Harry grew practically bored most of the time.

He helped Ginny with her flying and acted as an unaccredited consultant for the Harpies, did various social works, traveled, and mostly acted as a stay-at-home-dad and part-time-former-hero.

Then the Goblins rebelled.

The post-war economy was in shambles, due in tiny part to a trio robbing a Gringotts vault and escaping on a dragon just before the war's end. The Goblins took that as an act of aggression, and it took a lot of capital to appease them, which Harry had, in part, personally donated on the condition they were subject to the Creature Cruelty laws that the rest of Britain had to follow.

It seemed almost whimsical in remembrance, until you were much older and facing down a horde of armed goblins and their king deep underground.

Harry had went back to the Aurors as a third-party consultant. Ron hadn't necessarily suffered in Harry's absence, he was still a bloody good cop, but he didn't get the recognition he deserved and should have been at least two ranks above his current. Harry's assessment of the department, recruits, and senior staff was wanting as he was brought on for emergency purposes.

Too much politics and not enough getting the bloody job done.

The Goblins held a lot of Wizarding debt. Turns out that wars and deaths cost a lot of money, especially when pureblood families get involved. The escape from the vault over a decade prior caused a cascading effect where the Goblins couldn't secure funds as effectively on the international market, or match the Galleon to the Geobukseon to the Vasa and whatnot (why the Wizarding world traded in /ships/ always confounded Harry until he learned of a convention in the early 12th century that standardized such things) while the muggle market skyrocketed in value, just tipped things over the edge. Suddenly, muggles and muggle-borns were financially empowered outside the Wizarding World, and even some old families were trying to secure financial assistance in the muggle world.

In the end, the wizards were weak because they were struggling to rebuild, and they were using borrowed money to do so, and pretend Dark Lords and Dark Ladies were running amok around Europe as the Great and Powerful Harry Potter seemed to be no longer persecuting them.

It was a total system collapse of Goblins seizing vaults in order to secure gold for loans the Ministry was making in their reconstruction efforts and reparation and a host of other social experiments designed to prevent another Voldemort from happening, but when people couldn't withdraw gold, the economy ground to a halt, wizards rioted, and people died.

Harry was to meet the goblins alone, it was the only way they would negotiate. Harry agreed, and Ginny was pissed.

Harry received a litany of texts, notes, and suggestions from Hermione on how to deal with the situation. He met with Ragnok the Greedy (Thirtieth of His Name) in the chambers deep below the bedrock.

--------------

"We ask for an arbiter and they send a thief," spat the king in Gobbledegook.

"You think so lowly of wizard-kind that they wouldn't think their arbiter knows the language?"

"Do my insults cut, oh /mighty/ Harry Potter?"

"Your actions do."

The king and Harry insulted each other with an audience of goblins before finally getting to the crux of the negotiates.

"Wands and liberties as citizens Britain."

"Out of the question. Our proposal is sensible: you will be solvent again within 20 years and making far better interest than now if the post-war reconstruction goes as planned. You'd have stakes in nearly every venture."

"You mean if there isn't another Dark Lord to trash the place," the king retorted. "You speak in terms of generations. Do the wizards not bother to know the lifespan of a goblin?"

Harry thought about it, and realized he didn't know. A shorter lifespan might explain why they rebelled every few centuries as the younger generations forgot the lessons learned by the older. Harry shrugged.

"If we are at in impasse, then I'm afraid there is no choice. You can not win a war."

"But we can bloody your noses, starting with Harry Potter."

The Elder Wand was a terrifying thing in battle. Spells flew at mere thought, sometimes, and almost everything combat related was easier. It was the perfect duelist's wand.

It was also perfect for slaughter.

Ragnok died with a sputter and the goblins came down on Harry, and he repelled them with wave after wave of surging elemental spellcraft. Some of them might have died, but Harry wasn't really trying to kill them, just send them off until they got tired.

There were just so many.

Eventually, Harry decided the goblins had had enough and apparated back to the surface, where a standoff between wizards and goblins broke into all-out battle. Harry diffused the situation by rounding up the goblins and levitating them back inside the bank. Harry breached the walls of Gringotts, dozens of alarms and traps screaming and blazing uselessly at him. He tore through the stone and granite and bedrock and sent any goblin he encountered down into the deep chasm.

With a /Sonorous/ and the potion that let Harry speak Gobbledegook, he sent the goblins a bellious, echoing warning: "To your next leader! You CAN NOT fight us. You can not even defeat ME! So give up! Take the deal! We'll both be rich in the end. Or Die. The choice is yours."

"Mate," Ron looked shaken when Harry returned to the group of wizards on the surface. Harry was still bristling with energy, and everyone kept their distance from him. "That was bloody terrifying. We've been partners since we were kids, I've never seen you do anything like that."

"Yeah, I guess I got a little carried away." Harry glanced at the wand in his hand.

Hermione was disturbed but grateful the situation was diffused without any more unnecessary bloodshed.

Ginny and Harry argued again.

Or maybe they'd been having the same argument since they were 17.

--------------

It wasn't long after the goblin incident that the ICW started calling Harry again, about this or that Dark Sorcerer, or some potential breach of the Statute, or some brewing rebellion, but Harry refused the calls as politely as possible. Harry was pushing 40, now, and felt it.

Teddy Lupin graduated Hogwarts, and the Tonks' hosted a big party.

Teddy was going into the Auror corps, taking after his godfather, which left Harry feeling pride and indignation.

"Maybe you should reconsider teaching, Harry." Hermione was always offering /good/ advice, it just wasn't always the advice Harry wanted to hear. Hermione was /finally/ making her play for Minister of Magic, and hopefully some good changes would come of it in the Wizengamot. Harry's seat had been acquiesced to Andromeda Tonks for twenty years, and Harry had no plans of taking up his spot, butting heads against bureaucracy.

The 'Golden Trio' might have been more effective at changing the Wizarding World if they were working together, but Harry's heart and soul were not in it.

He sipped his drink in contemplation as the kids played games outside. The Weasley clan had ballooned even more as Bill and Fleur, George and Katie added their own red-heads to the mix. Charlie Weasley seemed content as a bachelor and expert animal handler. Ron and Hermione had Rose after some time, and she was a turbulent ball of curly-red hair and curiosity at the party.

Maybe he should go back to Hogwarts? His own kids would be graduating soon, so there wouldn't be that awkward situation of your dad also being your professor, but Harry didn't know.

"Every time I go back there, it's like I'm seventeen again. I'm pulled back. I see their faces, Hermione. All the dead. Not even in my nightmares."

"Harry James Potter, you would happily face a demon if it threatened your family or friends, but when are you going to face the demons that threaten /you/?"

"There's something missing in me, 'Mione. A part of me died that day, a part of my soul is missing and I can't piece it back together. I just go in circles in my own head. A lot of the time I just don't really care about anything. Sometimes I think I'm better off dead, that I should have just taken that train and everything would have worked out for the better."

"Harry, you have Ginny and the kids. They exist because of you. We /all/ exist because of you. You made the choice to save us, and it was the right one."

"Right," Harry said. "But I can't save myself, Hermione."

Fireworks started as Teddy zipped through the air on his Nimbus, laughing. Harry met his eyes and couldn't help but be reminded of the dead Remus Lupin.

   :CUSTOM_ID: part-3
   :END:
Harry did go back to Hogwarts. He taught DADA, of course, and took up filling the role Hooch left behind when she retired.

"Can't rightfully keep the rascals in line at my age, not with this damnable curse, anyway. You'll do great, Potter."

Hooch had a permanent limp and was missing an eye as a result of the Battle of Hogwarts. The scars of the war were visible everywhere, even if Harry's no longer was.

Lilly was seventeen and very mature for having her dad in her NEWT defense course, and Harry was a fair teacher. He thought he wore both hats well, and tried to give her as much freedom as possible (there were SO many boys to keep up with, it was exhausting).

Things got easier from there, as the children took up jobs in their various fields. James worked at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes for a while after graduating, Albus was a potions genius and earned himself an apprenticeship, and Lilly was fast becoming an expert curse-breaker under the tutelage of Bill and a woman named Rakepick.

Life became an easy routine for a few years, but the notes Harry received from various ICW agents were getting more and more dire. The Statute was practically falling apart as muggle technology advanced faster than the wizards could keep up with ways to confound it, and Dark Lords were popping up everywhere as a result of the "muggle question." Muggles were also apparently destroying the planet by polluting it and wizards wanted to stop them. It was a mess.

They practically begged Harry to come back and fulfill Albus Dumbledore's role as Supreme Mugwump.

Harry wanted to ignore it all and live his life in peace, watching his children grow old and maybe have children of their own.

Then Ginny got injured.

--------------

When Harry got the call from St. Mungo's and rushed to find Ginny paralyzed from a training incident, the arguments and drinking and terrible nightmares started again.

Ginny was a witch, so a broken spine wouldn't keep her from walking again, but it did bring an end to her quidditch career. Harry felt valid in his accusations bordering on "I told you so!" and "What were you thinking, testing an experimental broom!"

"The kids are grown up now, Harry!"

"They still bloody well need their mum!"

It all came to a head when Harry mentioned something about Ginny's parents, and Ginny made a comment about Harry's parents. Everything came crashing down.

Harry grabbed the Firewhiskey and apparated outside of Hogwarts. He trounced around the forest for awhile, wondering what he was doing there, then saw the Headmaster's grave by the lake, and felt the weight in his pocket.

The Elder Wand refused to be bound in a sling, yet jumped into Harry's hand as fast as any quick-draw sling whenever he mentally called for it. He rarely used it these days, and he hadn't noticed it in his heavy coat pocket until sighting Dumbledore's grave. Like the Hallow had called /him/. He drew the wand and cast a quick spell, turning his meandering to purpose.

The Stone was vaguely where he'd left it all those years ago. Forgotten for so long, buried by dirt and dust and time, waiting for someone to pick it up and accept their own death.

Harry reached for it and felt the connection again.

"Potter," said the ghost in a high pitch, cool and controlled. It was Tom Riddle, and it was an ugly baby-thing, and it was Voldemort.

"Just checking," Harry mused. The ghost of Voldemort shifted between its various forms, seemingly between various times in its life. Harry wondered if it was because of the Horcruxes.

Ogden's Finest burned as Harry took a sip, but he was a long way from being drunk enough to deal with this.

"Yes, Potter, I am truly dead. Do you have any other obvious observations you wish to expound upon, or is your curiosity as dull as your wit?"

"What is it like?" Harry found himself blurting out without thinking.

"Death? What a stupid question. It is nothing and everything. It is being everywhere and nowhere. It is seeing everything whilst blind. Death is the opposite of Life. Satisfied?"

"Are you proud of what you did? Satisfied that you brought so much pain and misery that it will take generations to undo it?" The bottle was getting lighter in Harry's hand, and his head was getting heavier.

"Proud? Come now, Harry, surely you've had enough of me in you that you can ask a question like a proper Slytherin rather than the dull dolt of a Gryffindor." Harry didn't know how to respond to that, as Voldemort shifted between Tom Riddle and his elder, snake-like self, but Voldemort continued: "Ask like a Lion and I shall answer as one. I had my reasons. You see them even now, don't you? The world is a broken mess. The Ministry is next to useless. The muggles take over the planet like a plague in a Petri dish. Power is the only thing people respect, and progress requires strength and decisions only few are capable of making. I was capable and tried my best."

Harry thought about that for a long moment. The ghost of Voldemort seemed content to just hover and observe as Harry grew more inebriated. Maybe he should summon another bottle? Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts.

"You failed miserably, though. If anything, things are worse."

The ghost shrugged: "I was distracted. Splitting one's soul can do that. I also never really got the chance."

"What?"

"Don't be an idiot, Potter. You're powerful and can change the world, even now. Our origins are not so different, are they? Neither of us were ever really given a choice."

"You had plenty of opportunities to change! You didn't have to open the Chamber, you didn't have to make your first Horcrux, you didn't have to start a war! You didn't have to kill my parents and make me your /SEVENTH/ Horcrux! I was just a baby when Fate fell on me!"

Voldemort shifted to Tom. "I was dutifully invested in magical learning, Harry Potter. I was an academic prodigy as much as you were a quidditch one. I didn't shy away from the so called Dark Magic, as ridiculous as that moniker is, because I was invested in learning all of it. I discovered the Chamber over the summer after my first year at Hogwarts. It provided me a place to hide instead of returning to the orphanage, or something worse. The basilisk was one of my few friends. Myrtle was not supposed to die, and I had already completed the ritual for the Horcrux beforehand, so I might as well use it. As much as we think we are in control of everything, Fate has a cruel way of reminding us that our destiny is not entirely within our own control."

"But you said it yourself, you were a prodigy! You could have gone to the ministry and made the changes, even while being an evil git. You didn't have to start a war!"

"Tell me, Harry, how much success has Granger had?"

"She's busy cleaning up your mess."

"And I would have been busy battling the idealistic Dumbledores of the world in the wake of Grindelwald's war. Besides," The ghost shifted again, "I never had the opportunity. Slughorn, ironically, made it impossible."

"Slughorn? You were his favorite student!"

"Were," Voldemort practically growled. "You saw the memories. Ask yourself, O Brave Lion, why would Slughorn give up everything to go into hiding after my fall? Hmm?"

Harry thought about it. It was perplexing, he had to admit. Then the answer hit him like the Knight Bus.

"He blocked you?" The ghost nodded.

"He pulled out every stop, every favor, every connection. I couldn't get a job as a rat catcher for the Ministry if I wanted to."

"You know," Harry said after a long moment, "Dumbledore was right about one thing. You /were/ defeated by the Power of Love, as ridiculous as that sounds."

"Prey tell, Harry Potter."

"Maybe your Fate would have been different if you had just recognized that people mattered a little bit more. Maybe you could have actually accomplished something other than the scars and curses and broken relationships you left in your wake."

"Are we quite done with your little therapy session, Potter? It is getting cold, after all."

"I'm not cold."

"That would be the whiskey."

It was cold, Harry realized, and Voldemort faded away. "Until next time, Potter..." said the wind.

Harry basked in the cold for a while, in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, emptying the bottle down his throat. He needed to decide something. He felt it, the crossroads of decisions. He thought about his children, Ginny, and Teddy. His friends and family. The reports about muggles and climate change and dark forces brewing.

Voldemort didn't regret his path, even if it ended in disaster. Harry knew he wouldn't, either, but clung to hope that the same Fate wouldn't befall him.

"Our origins are not so different..."

Harry shook off the voice of the ghost and returned to the castle to sleep off the whiskey. He'd made his decision.

***** ** Part 4:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-4
   :END:
The following years went by quickly. Harry returned to work with the International Confederation of Wizards, and was quickly elected Supreme Mugwump. Rumors and whispers were calling Harry the next Dumbledore.

Dumbledore was not so cruel or effective during his tenure, but Harry really did try to keep himself in check.

Firstly, there was the Statute question. Harry shifted the ICW from outright blocking muggles' knowledge of magic to introducing tiny slices of the truth into specific places. Governments, intelligence agencies, et cetera. He enlisted teams, muggle-borns, to infiltrate internet spaces and sew a bit of chaos with conspiracy theories. A dab of truth mixed with flamboyant lies were enough to buy time, at least, and muggles seemed to eat it up.

Lockhart's lessons weren't entirely useless, afterall.

Harry directed his agents to drip-feed a bit of truth about the magical world to various muggle governments. Threats and misdirection, as well as subtle guidance in the form of what technologies those governments should be prioritizing in order to save the future of the planet were /primo directiva/ of Harry's administrative role in the Confederation.

Harry's personal role was to seek out and quell Dark Sorcerers and rebellions.

It was easy work, with the Elder Wand at Harry's beck and call, but there were some close calls.

Ginny was furious, as expected. Harry was a hypocrite, and Harry didn't argue the point.

What was the point, after all?

Harry's children grew distant over the years, and understood what he was doing, but didn't outright say they disproved. Harry could read between the lines of frequent Owls, and they all told each other how much they were loved.

It was good to be reminded of love, Harry thought. It kept him grounded.

Teddy was absolutely infatuated with Harry, though. He wanted to know about every mission, every defeated wannabe Dark Lord, every spell and confluence that Harry conjured to combat the mild terror that had taken over the magical world.

Harry acquiesced, but only some. The details were gruesome much of the time, and Harry tried to use the opportunity as a learning tool (being a Hogwarts professor doesn't really escape your psyche, especially when it comes to people you care about).

Hermione's letters were dripping with personal concern and well wishes and hope. Harry had grown to be a master of interpreting the brilliant witch's not-so-subtle diatribes, and it became clear, now, the choices the Sorting Hat had given Hermione all those years ago. She was not subtle or ambitious for he own sake, but she did have trouble making friends, and was obviously studious to a fault, but what she desired most, deep down, was the bravery to do the right thing.

That was what Harry was trying to do. The right thing. And keep himself from becoming another Voldemort, but it was hard to cling onto love when you had so much power.

Ron's correspondence was brief and to the point, as always, but Harry appreciated it nonetheless. Harry asked about quidditch results between news of various missions Harry conducted.

"Wish I were there, with you," Ron wrote.

"Shine on, Ronald," Harry replied, not knowing if the wizard would pick up on the Pink Floyd reference.

Ginny argued, and Harry didn't care. "I know," was his answer most of the time. Ginny would run out of steam, and Harry would suggest something to do with her time, now that she couldn't fly professionally.

"I've been talking to Teddy and Ronald, and I think about the Auror corps a lot," was her response.

"Oh," was all Harry could conjure. There were so many opinions and thoughts and emotions roiling around in his head at the idea of Ginny working for the Aurors. "Not in the field, I hope?"

"Research, mostly." Ginny's response was a small epithet to her conscience. Harry could read minds without really trying, these days.

"That might be for the best."

"You look younger. You always keep looking younger," Ginny left the question out of the statement, but Harry knew.

"Probably the Hallows." Harry knew the answer but didn't want to start another argument, so he played at Ginny's role and gave her something without losing out on his own secrets. He was good at that, now.

"I'm scared, Harry."

"I know."

"Mum says it feels like another war is coming. I feel it, too."

"I'll be there. I'll always be there, Ginny."

"I know, and I'm scared."

"I just..." Harry felt something, and he didn't know what to say, how to form it into words. How do you explain Destiny and Fate and fixing The Broken Things to turn the world into something it needed to be, but didn't necessarily deserve? "I love you, Ginevra Weasley Potter. I always will."

"I love you too, Harry."

She was crying, and Harry couldn't feel anything.

   :CUSTOM_ID: part-5
   :END:
Harry got used to being... whatever it was he was being.

Lord of Light, some had called him. Everyone knew him as Dumbledore's successor. Many called him another Dark Lord.

Idiots.

Harry went from place to place, putting down Werewolf Kings, Goblin Rebellions, Eldritch Intrusions, Fey Inquisitions, and the like. It was as exhausting as it was exhilarating.

The other shoe dropped when Harry's enemies attacked his family.

--------------

Harry appeared in an explosion of green flame in the middle of St. Mungo's admittance auditorium. People cried and yelped and pulled out wands.

Harry ignored them.

"Lilly Luna Potter. Where is she?" Harry asked the frightened receptionist.

"Err--"

"No matter." Harry erupted in another explosion of green flame, leaving the waiting patients coughing in his wake.

Lilly was in stable condition. The best curse-breakers were working on her. Someone at work had slipped her a "clue" about their shared project and upon reading it, Lilly had succumb to a blood curse.

Harry was furious.

It took days, but Harry found an approximation of the curse in an esoteric journal, tracked down the "colleague" who had cursed Lilly, and confronted him.

"Macnair."

"Potter."

There was a twinge of fear in the Man's voice, but he had avoided the post-war cleanup for a long, long time.

"You know why I am here."

"I know you are Harry Potter, Paragon of the Light."

"Don't try to appeal to my better nature, Macnair. I'm not your Lord Voldemort. I don't care about my own ego."

"What of your reputation?"

"Did you do it?"

"Does it matter? We are legion, Potter. We saw this coming as soon as the Dark Lord fell. If I die, another will--"

"/Avada Kedavra/," Harry intoned. The bolt was not the quick, lightning-arcing thing that always found its target despite its defenses. It was a lazy, haphazard thing.

Bright green brought an end to Macnair. Harry pilfered the residence, disabling wards as he went. The lone house elf stood wide-eyed at the Great and Wonderful Harry Potter Sir.

"Tell his friends to leave me alone, or else the same will happen to them." The house elf nodded and POPPED out of existence.

Harry had work to do.

--------------

Hermione Granger Weasley took her seat as the 42nd Minister for Magic with great effect, but not as the sweeping reformer she had hoped to be, years ago.

Time in the Ministry dulled her idealism toward practicality, and though she resented it, she knew it was for the best.

Change couldn't come all at once, she knew, and societies weren't conjured out of thin air. Things took time, and though she was studious, there was just SO MUCH to the Wizarding World that Hermione had to catch up on over the years to effect any sort of change.

She had a fairly firm grasp of it all, now, and had been making progress, but then Harry Potter happened, and Harry Potter isn't something you can ignore.

He stood in her office, staring out the window to the lower levels of the Ministry, seemingly contemplating what all the workers were busying up to.

"Harry," Hermione almost gasped as a way of greeting.

"Hermione," Harry said without taking his eyes off his vantage.

"When did you get here? No one told me--"

"Just now," Harry said, cutting her off. "I thought to chat with you privately." Harry waved his wand, /that wand/, and Hermione felt the privacy spells erect around them, though the movement was too quick and subtle for such a dramatic list of spells.

Hermione deposited her files and briefings onto her desk and regarded Harry with her full attention. She kept her wand hidden in a holster, covered by the elegant arm of her business-like blouse, but she quickly dismissed the thought of using her wand. Harry was orders of magnitude beyond her in combat magic by this point.

"So what did you want to talk about?"

"Azkaban," Harry said, turning to her. He was as disheveled as ever, but it was in a chaotically handsome sort of way. His black hair went in all directions, and his beard turned to youthful stubble. Harry looked young. Younger than she remembered him at thirty.

It was the eyes that concerned her most. They almost glowed; green, impossibly green, like a picture of a rain forest at maximum saturation.

"Azkaban?"

"You've been trying to close it for years. Decades. I'm done waiting, Hermione. I'm tearing it down."

"Harry--"

"You can't stop me."

"Then why are you here? Harry! Wait!" Harry twitched in movement, and Hermione knew that Harry could apparate out of the Ministry at the speed of thought, if he wanted to, wards be damned. He hesitated and turned to her.

"You need to hear reason, Harry. That's why you're here. Do you want permission? Lawful guidance? What is it you need?" The Boy Who Lived, the Savior, the Next Dumbledore regarded her, with impossibly green eyes. And he shrugged, like he was fourteen and considering her advice for a date to the Yule Bawl.

"I love you, Hermione," Harry said matter-of-factly. "I value your opinion. I'm going to destroy Azkaban and kill the Dementors. I just thought I should let you know."

"Harry. Wait. Think about this."

"What is there to think about?!" Harry burst in a sudden rage. Hermione could feel the magic bristling against her skin in an instant. "You've tried! You did your best! The arseholes just keep blocking you, the system doesn't change, the evil persists! I'm done with it, Minister! Use me. I'll be your tool. Tell the Wizengamot that unless they abolish the petty /bullshit/ they keep holding on to, all the racist shit that persists, I'll come knocking, and I'll knock it all down. Let me be your Big Bad Wolf, Hermione, and I swear -- I SWEAR I'll fill the role!"

Harry's torrent came in quick with sweeping gestures. Hermione wasn't quite sure how to handle it immediately, but a thought and memory transposed upon her. She tried to calm down, as Harry Potter was a great force unleashed, and she really did consider his argument, though perhaps faster than Harry intended her to.

"Harry, do you remember fourth year?"

"The Tournament, the Goblet? Yeah, I remember."

"Do you remember my campaign for the house elves?"

Harry laughed. It was a rich, deep, genuine thing. "Sorry--" Harry apologized between coughing, "--I, yeah, sorry."

"What do you think would have happened if I was successful? Like, if I had actually freed the elves?"

"Disastrous."

"Exactly! I was so concerned with what was right, I had no plan for what was wrong."

"Bloody Gryffindors," Harry responded.

"Do you see the parallels? Harry? If you tear down Azkaban, who is left to pick up the pieces? We need a transition, Harry. You can't just decide that Might Makes Right, society doesn't work like that."

"Sorry, Hermione, but you're wrong." Harry stood up to his full height, now. His habit of slouching never fully escaped him, even in adulthood, but the man standing before her now looked almost entirely not like Harry and like the pure embodiment of him at the same time. It was perplexing.

"Explain," she demanded tapping her foot.

"I wish I could, but I've noticed over time how people just rely on us."

"What?"

"You know it. Don't pretend you don't get the letters, too. You can do things, so they expect you to fix everything."

Hermione knew exactly what he was talking about, and she felt a disgusting pit in her stomach, knowing what Harry was going to do next.

"They need us, Hermione. We didn't choose to be different, but they think we are their saviors, their gods of old. I'm just tired. Tired of waiting for something to change. Please, just let me be your instrument. Let me do this, for all of us, for Dumbledore's stupid 'greater good', so we can get past all this mess and let the world move on."

"Harry." Hermione was crying, now. The tears welled up and she couldn't stand to see her best friend follow this path. It was too much.

Hermione had always felt closer to Harry than Ron while at Hogwarts. They were both effectively Muggle-Born, after all. Harry's home life hadn't been immediately apparent to Hermione, and if she had known earlier, things might have turned out differently. But, she reasoned, Harry had sort of sealed it in their sixth year: Harry was the chosen one. He didn't /need/ her, not in that way, and he'd always find a romantic landing pad, so to speak, if he needed one. Harry was empathetic beyond reason, she knew, and Ron was a goofy, handsome, dolt most of the time, but Hermione felt the need to educate Ronald more than she felt the need to comfort Harry.

And that was her role, she knew, at some point as a child. Comfort Harry and educate Ron.

She threw herself at Harry, tears streaming, embracing him.

"Harry," she repeated, "please. I'm asking you, as your friend. As someone who loves you. Please, just let me try to work this out."

"I--" Harry caught himself, embracing his friend again after so long. "I need this, Hermione. This is my path. I never really had a choice, in the end. I can't let them grow up in a world doomed to die because we ignored the muggle world for so long. I can't let our own hypocrisy scream at them while they benefit from it. It all has to end. The time is nigh."

Hermione gulped and released her embrace.

"I'll have a lot of work, cleaning up your mess, Harry Potter."

Harry laughed. It was a genuine, throaty thing. It sounded like music to Hermione.

"It's a brutal cycle, I know, but something has to change. You can spin it, right?"

"I can try." Hermione felt weak. Defenseless. Harry patted her back, and a thought formed, and as he was letting go, she said: "What will the kids think?"

"Whatever they want," was Harry's cold response. They gauged each other, for a moment. Harry shook his head.

"I wouldn't have been good for you," Harry said.

"Probably. We might never know," was Hermione's response.

Harry's magical privacy charms broke the instant he disappeared, and a litany of flying papers streamed into Hermione's office.

"Good bye, Harry Potter. I wish I could know you better."

Harry killed the Dementors as promised. It was cathartic, in a way.

The island was still bleak and sad and housed criminals awaiting the expiration of their sentences; Harry wasn't going to completely upend the situation, he just hated the Dementors.

The blinding light of Harry's Patronus weaved patterns beside the nothern Aurora in a spectacle of dance and death and not-death.

The fact that many of the life-sentenced residents also died in the attack went underpinned in the reports.

--------------

Great and terrible things followed in the 'destruction' of Azkaban. The world feared Harry Potter, and felt in awe of Harry Potter, and no one quite understood Harry Potter, even his family or closest friends.

"I Pray for the child," whispered Molly Weasley. Of course, Harry was just a child in her mind.

"Harry's Wrackspurts have come up with some very troubling solutions," Luna minded.

The papers all speculated on Harry's next move, after every public move. Harry confided with Ron and Hermione and Luna and Neville whenever he felt it necessary, but he continued his campaign privately, until now.

Harry cleaned up Knocturn Alley; it turned out that the place was both the source of the Snatchers (low level gangs aligning with the big boss), and rife with discontent and power-struggles now that Voldemort was not around to give some semblance of order to the dusty rot of a neighborhood. Harry outright killed direct dissidents and plied the residents for information at every turn.

The Ministry was turning out laws like they were going out of style, and most of them Harry approved of, but there were many reservations. A lot of them seemed directly aimed at Harry in particular; emergency measures, Hit-Wizard recruitment, Obliviators. For every step forward Harry garnered as 'The Enemy', the Ministry took equal steps backward.

It was infuriating.

Harry planned to take direct control, and told his friends as everyone gathered in a rented room above the Leaky Cauldron, a loose barrier between the magical and non-magical worlds.

"You, what? Mate--"

"Ron, please. I've breached the Ministry dozens of times without anyone noticing. This is just a statement."

"You want to pronounce your plan to the world, Harry," Hermione stood in stark defiance in contrast with most of the old gang; Luna and Neville were there. "However," Hermione continued, "I don't think it wise. The Wizarding World just doesn't quite yet understand the concepts you're trying to instill. Climate change sounds like a muggle problem, and the technology thing just engenders them to more anti-muggle prejudice...."

Hermione was right, Harry knew.

"You're right. Which is why I'm taking control. Hermione, you can either acquiesce power, or I can take it. Which do you think will have a better result?"

Harry was talking about overthrowing the government as casually as casting a levitation charm. Harry was not demanding power, he was asking what the best result would be.

The others didn't understand.

"Let me explain," Harry started. "Since rejoining the ICW and eliminating threats to both the Statute and Wizarding-Kind, more and more people simply give up responsibility to me with the misguided notion that I'm the one to fix everything. I haven't a clue how to fix everything, so, I need your help.

"I can take over as an authoritarian figure," Harry continued, "as it is easy for me to do and easy for the press and population to digest. What we need to do is engender the muggles into complying with rapid technological change in order to prevent them from destroying the planet whilst convincing the magical world that taking over the muggle governments is not a good idea. Any thoughts?"

"Errr."

"I don't care if I'm painted as the bad guy," Harry reminded them.

So they formed a plan.

Harry did many great and terrible things leading up to his assault on the Ministry.

He took over without casting a single curse. Aurors and Old Family members alike stood aside as he took the office of Minister of Magic.

Harry held the titles of Supreme Mugwump, Minister of Magic, and to his friends, Master of Death, all while being the source of public legendary admiration simultaneously.

Years past like flies.

Society changed just as swiftly.

--------------

It was, perhaps, ironic that Harry suddenly knew that the swift changes he'd enacted as Minister and de-facto King of the Wizards could be undone the moment he relinquished power, though he persisted anyway.

If anything, he wanted the world to know he'd tried.

Harry's ascension to power surprisingly bloody-less. He commanded the Wizarding world with the authority and conviction only the Master of the Hallows could lend, but Harry was annoyed at how much people /relied/ on his decision making. He just wanted people to figure it out for themselves. He was the director, not the actor and engineer and lighting technician and script supervisor....

Harry was starting to see his life as a movie, which was troubling.

Harry spent most of the time in the Minister's office, overlooking the Ministry and its capacities. There was a benefit to inept bureaucracy, Harry finally admitted, as it allowed those who were not-quite good at their jobs an easy escape from punishment and terrifying remorse.

Bureaucracy was good for morale, as dumb as that sounded.

Harry's reign was not quite 'dark' as most might describe it. There was a lot of work to be done, for sure, and inept peoples were dismissed to find their own way in the world. It was a bleak time but not a bloody time. For that, Harry was grateful.

Everyone wondered why Harry seemed to grow /more/ youthful with time passing, as if he aged backward. Harry knew the answer and couldn't explain it.

Harry was almost proud when his friends and family gathered in late July to lure Harry to his death. It was almost cute.

"Was this what you feared?" Harry asked the ghostly visage from atop his 'throne' above the Wizengamot.

"Perhaps," said Albus' ghost, "if you mean what I might become if I accepted the power bestowed upon me. If you were referring to something else, though, I have no reason to fear anything, as I am a ghost."

"Very prudent, Headmaster.”

"It is good to see you, Harry. Even in these circumstances."

Harry turned to the ghost. "Is it? I'm a monster. Swallowed by the Hallows and the war and trying to fix a future that I can not predict. I'm just frustrated. And too full of power to be happy with anything less than the dramatic."

"I do mean it. I am proud of you, Harry James Potter. You are not quite as fallen as you might believe, and you are alive despite all your attempts. I am very proud to see you living despite my own influence, in fact."

"I wished to die, you know." Harry was angry and tired and frustrated and annoyed. The Headmaster had left so many things unanswered, and despite all attempts to talk to his portrait and ghost, he never really revealed his true intentions. “You were never honest with me.”

“I always told the truth, Harry. Trust me, I wished I could tell the whole truth the whole time, but there were too many moving parts, the stakes too high to give you the keys you sought. They were always within reach of Voldemort, and he was /your/ Dark Lord to defeat, not mine. I am sorry you wanted to die.”

Harry wondered what the hell that meant, but continued.

“You could have prevented all of this, you know. You had the Elder Wand. You could have taken control of the Ministry, like this, and put an end to the pureblood nonsense. The muggle-hating. I could have lived a normal life, and I wouldn't have to become a monster to get what I want.”

“Is that what you are, Harry?” The old visage asked. “Monsters do not often contemplate the ramifications of their actions on their wary children, or opine upon the opinions of their friends. It is not like you to wish for me to have taken your burden for you, after all.”

The old man knew misdirection, even from the grave. Harry knew in that moment what houses the Hat offered Dumbeldore.

“I never wanted you to suffer,” Harry started. “You took the burden upon yourself. I was just curious, wondering, why you stopped halfway, why you went to such extremes in some circumstance to protect and direct me, whilst in others you misguided me, like a lost puppy, or as Snape said, a ‘lamb for slaughter.'”

“That---” Dumbledore looked genuinely offended--- “Is a misunderstanding of my character. Harry,” the old ghost sighed, as if his old age affected him now, even in death. “There were no possibilities of you living a normal life. I did the arithmancy and divination. The Fidelius collapsed, the Potters were dead, the Longbottoms were our only hope, and Hagrid found you, with a scar, and got drunk and proclaimed you the Boy Who Lived. I had no time. Nothing to engineer. The world knew you were destined for greatness, as did I when I first saw you, but really. Harry---”

“What about putting me with my aunt and uncle?”

“What would you propose?”

“Andromeda Tonks, for starters.”

“And they'd be inundated with a litany of fan mail and cursed letters, both equally as dangerous.” Harry had to admit, he /had/ had to deal with a lot of cursed mail over the past few decades. It was easy, after taking up the Hallows, but it left his family vulnerable. Was Dumbledore's protection so complete?

“Harry, my boy. I am not a master of charms, but with the Wand and my knowledge of the effects of Dragon's Blood in conjunction with alchemy, I found a way to move your mother's ritual sacrificial connection to a place. It only worked if they were your blood relatives.”

Harry almost started again, but bit his tongue.

“I am sorry, Harry.” The ghost looked truly sorry.

“I had to keep things from you, Harry,” Dumbledore spoke on. “Once I knew of the Horcrux, and your connection to Voldemort, I couldn't doubt that anything you knew /he/ also knew. You were our greatest hope and liability, at the same time.” Dumbledore looked down, apologetic.

“And preventing this?” Harry gestured wide in the office above the Wizengamot, as if to encompass the whole of the world.

“I do not think you have fallen, my dear Harry, but I did not have the Hallows complete to protect me as you do now. The Wand is a wondrous thing, but do you fear mortal Death with all complete at your command?”

Harry did not fear Death. It was an almost laughable situation.

“Your ascension to Master and Governor is most curious. You may think me invincible from your understanding of magic in your youth, but do you see that now, knowing what you know?”

Harry wasn't sure. He could picture Dumbledore holding four jobs and taking power and commanding the peons to his progressive bidding, but it was only an image you could conjure if you ignored Dumbledore's Achilles heel, so to speak.

“What of Ariana? Your family?”

Dumbledore looked up, startled. Achilles Heel indeed.

“I suppose---” The great Grand Sorcerer and Supreme Mugwump and Headmaster looked started and ashamed.

“I left them behind to achieve the Greater Good. It was always for you, in the end, Harry.”

Harry nodded.

Love. The Power He Knew Not.

That was Harry's problem. He loved too much. He wanted so much, because he loved his friends and family and wanted everything for them. Not for himself, but for them.

Harry felt nothing for himself.

   :CUSTOM_ID: part-8
   :END:
Harry walked into the trap willingly. He wasn't afraid to die; if the time was right. It was always the right time, he just worried about his friends and family, and what people would think.

Maybe he should have written some of this down? Protect his legacy? Whatever. No matter. Things were in motion and Harry preferred motion to a tormid let-down. He played his part, conjuring a terrifying circle of whirling energy around him with the simple flick of his wand.

"What have you done?” He demanded. Harry's voice was cool and calm, but the atrium was crowded around him, far away, in the upper levels, with dozens of wands pointed in his direction.

“You've been voted out.” Hermione was very matter-of-fact. She wasn't a good actor, Harry knew, but most didn't know that her disapproval counted as bravery.

Harry looked around. He flourished the Elder Wand for dramatic effect.

“It's treason, then!” Harry loved his internet memes of late.

And then the battle started.

Harry defended himself lackadaisical. The aurors in the room couldn't hit him with a spell nine times out of ten if they'd tried. Half the commotion was just for effect. Harry briefly considered conjuring extra would-be Red Coats to attack him as mirages, but then Ron entered the atrium.

Ron and Harry had been best mates. They both loved quidditch and food. There was little to misunderstand about their relationship. Harry loved Ron.

So it was very difficult to think about killing him.

Ron and Harry dueled while the other aurors tried to stop Harry. It was futile. Harry loved Ron too much to put him down, but loved the game and distraction too much to stop it any other way.

The atrium exploded in all directions from spellfire; granite morphed into living lava that attacked Harry, and Harry was having fun with it. Shrapnel that would harm Harry swirled around him like a shield. Conjured and Transfigured creatures became his puppets, directed back at their creators. It was pure, unrivaled, chaos, and Harry loved it.

More and more poured into the atrium to attack Harry. Wow. He was so loved. The attention of half of wizarding Britain was upon him, casting spells and melting pillars as Harry deflected spells and countered jinxes and returned curses.

“You know---” Harry said during the onslaught, “It might be better if you executed some sort of plan, or else I might get bored and start killing people.”

There was a demonstrable pause in the spellcasting at that.

Hermione appeared again, and challenged Harry. “If this is part of the script, then sure. I accept.”

They dueled. Hermione was like an ant before an elephant. Inconsequential.

She summoned, conjured, transfigured, froze, exploded, needled, and cursed her way at Harry's protections. She even tried some psychology.

“Harry Potter! You really want to go down as a Dark Lord? What of your children?”

Harry laughed.

“My kids are adults, Minister. They can think for themselves.”

Harry spun the Wand in a looping motion and suddenly disarmed dozens of wands to him. There was a moment of pause and confusion as everyone took this in, then another round of aurors faced Harry.

Harry paused, seeing Teddy's face. It was Professor Lupin's face, dead and still and his fault. Something caught Harry.

“/Expelliarmus!/”

Teddy was flanked by Ron, and Harry really didn't want to kill them. Even without the Elder Wand, Harry could summon or transfigure death in an instance.

Runes alighted all around him.

This was the trap. Finally!

“Now!” Teddy screamed, and Hermione said some words in Greek that Harry didn't quite catch, and the world was on fire.

Harry bristled. Fire was painful, but not the worst way to die.

Harry's arms and legs caught, paralyed, and the fire abated. Runes lit the atrium amidst the terrible damage. Harry commended himself for not killing anyone directly, but noticed a few dozen unconscious bodies lying about the corners of the battle. Someone said some words, and the ring on Harry's finger shot off, taking part of his finger with it.

“Ow! That was rude!”

“Harry. James. Potter.” Hermione descended upon him, flanked by Ron and Andromeda Tonks. Teddy was just off to the side, looking bewildered at Harry and the dual wands in his hands.

“You are accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?”

“Erm. What?”

Hermione sighed. She made an elaborate, not so subtle gesture that this was an act.

“Oh.” Harry knew the gambit, but he loved a good story all the same.

“I am guilty of many things, Minister, but crimes against humanity? I only hoped to help humanity. If death is what the world wishes of me---” Harry spun in his bonds and they wriggled away from him, as if disgusted to touch his flesh, or even be near it.

Everyone gasped.

“Do it now!” Teddy yelled.

The trap alighted, a ritual circle cleverly hidden beneath the stone plinths of the Minstry's atrium, and Harry gasped.

The Elder Wand ignited the circle.

Harry wasn't afraid to die. He'd been called the ‘Next Dumbledore' for years.

Harry was mostly disappointed. He didn't see the fruition of his plans. He didn't see if the efforts to influence muggles had saved the planet. He didn't see his children grow up to have kids. He didn't see if the Ministry could effectively change, if his ruse had any impact at all.

It was fine, as Harry observed the ritual runes affecting him, and then a desk appeared, and exploded, and appeared again, and exploded, and --- Harry had seen this before.

“Harry Potter! You are Banished!”

The desk exploded. And then it was whole. And then it exploded.

Harry was aging, now. Rapidly. He aged up back to his thirties and forties, growing a beard. His hairline receded thereafter, but his beard grew, and his face tightened, and his hair grew white, and his voice stuttered.

Teddy looked at Harry.

“He--- Harry!”

“It's okay, kid.” Harry's voice transcended from old to Grandpa in a second. “Take care of that for me? Love ya---”

Teddy spun the Elder Wand at the infinitely self-destructing Time Turners, but it was too late.

Harry was crippled and decaying a moment later in front of the... well, the whole wizarding world, as much as it mattered.

Harry Potter was a pile of ash on the floor of the atrium to the Ministry of Magic.

********** ** Part 9:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-9
   :END:
Harry Potter was not a pile of ash on the floor of the atrium to the Ministry of Magic.

Harry Potter was thoroughly confused about his surroundings.

Harry Potter saw rows and rows of bookshelves presented before him, but they were as if made of strings, and instead of bindings and titles, they showed little pictures, like a muggle movie.

Harry Potter couldn't even find normality in death!

Harry did not stand, but knew intrinsically his footing. He sort of floated along where he meant to float. He looked down the rows of bookshelves parallel to him, saw an arrangement of moving pictures before him, and knew that they were infinite.

Harry was in an infinite space surrounded by repeating images in a floating, sort of magical box of impossibility.

Whoa.

“Hello?!” Harry spoke, not quite sure what was happening or where he was. The other time he'd died, he ended up at King's Cross, afterall. This was different.

“Ah,” a voice spoke out from everywhere at once. “I was wondering when I'd finally meet the great Harry Potter.”

A form appeared in front of Harry, in front of the infinite stacks, and quickly coalesced into the shape of an old man. He looked like the Flamels but eerily older, more translucent and with longer hair. Everything about him spoke: OLD!

“OLD!” Harry said it accidentally. He really didn't mean to. The last few hours of spellwrought and deception still had his psyche burned out, but that was his excuse.

The old... thing... laughed. It sounded genuine, but foreign.

“I am Time Eternal.” It sounded like the thing was speaking from everywhere at once, but very quietly. Like an old man with a microphone triggered to speakers about the room. Harry needed to learn that trick.

“Greetings, Time Eternal. I am Harry Potter, cursed to ever-living self deprecation. Coincidentally, I'm the luckiest idiot alive. And not alive. Pleasure to meet you.” Harry bowed.

Time smiled. “You are quite a conundrum, Harry. Do you know why you are here?” The old man gestured to the infinite stacks of bookshelves that played infinite scenes of things on repeat. Harry hadn't the slightest clue why he was here.

“Of course. I was invited to the inter-dimensional time and space emporium exposition, but I'm afraid I forgot my wand. Forgive me, mister Time, for I must depart.”

Time laughed again, but the world whirled around Harry as he did.

“Maybe I should make things a bit easier for you to... digest.” The whirling continued, until the infinite stacks of infinite books of infinite images coalesced into a sort of library with a single infinite stack of infinite images, but there was a floor and a rug on the floor and chairs on the floor and a glorious three-dimensional floor!

Harry planted himself firmly on the floor. The old, battered, nearly translucent being that called itself Time did the same. There were even leather chairs! How cute.

Harry plopped himself in a leather recliner and looked out at the vistage. Ahh. Infinity. It really put you in your place.

“Harry,” said Time, appearing in the chair opposite. “You've lived an exceedingly consequential life. It's rare that I have visitors of the mortal coil.”

“Really?” Harry looked at Time again. His image faded and flickered a bit depending on how Harry thought he should look, but it felt inappropriate to /try/ to make him look a certain way.

“Oh, yes. That spell your friends concocted. I don't think they rightly knew where or when it led. I am, however, delighted to find some mortal company after a while.”

Harry was confused and... more confused. He should be dead, right? He touched his face. It was his face, at about fifty something or so years old. His beard wasn't quite full, but it nestled against his lips and nose all the same. His hair hung black and wild. His robes were the ones he was wearing when he stepped into the Ministry that morning, the all black and stylish flagrant obstruction of fashion.

He had been very careful to look at least fashionable in death.

Except, he wasn't dead.

“Right,” said Time. “You aren't dead. You are in what one might call a tesseract. That spell to reverse your inverted aging, to force you to die of old age, well, sent you here.”

Harry took it all in. The tesseract was beautiful and terrifying. Harry was still confused.

*********** ** Part 10:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-10
   :END:
“Erm. Sorry, but I felt myself aging past this point. I was dying. Except I ended up here.”

“You are not on Death's list, Harry Potter.” Time spun his hand and the wall of infinite books of strings of images shifted to reveal something Harry had much trouble seeing.

“Harry Potter was crossed off when he made his first decision.” Voldemort entered the three-story house in Godric's Hollow. There was a duel.

Harry was proud of how formidable his father fought the Dark Lord. James Potter yelled for Lilly to run and take Harry. James Potter never intended to win against the Dark Lord, but he put up a good fight. Harry, after extended use of the Elder Wand and his own forays into defeating Dark Lords, knew the bloke was done from the offset. He planted his feet wrong, his wand movements were too slow, he announced his intentions without needing to, and he was every bit the duelist's dream opponent, if you were a master duelist.

Voldemort was a master duelist. He used legilimency to anticipate his opponent's attacks, he erected multiple levels of shields, and he countered the opponent's spells in their most direct opposition. That is to say, he flung the jinxes back at Harry's father, not wasting to block them.

On paper, or even as a non-partial observer, it would appear that James was being intentionally obtuse and Voldemort intentionally careful about the whole duel. Harry knew that his father was being an idiot to buy time. Transfiguration in duels were very clever distractions, but rarely won them, and that was James' go-to.

“I've seen enough,” Harry waved his hand haphazardly. The image fast-forwarded.

“This!” announced Time, “is the moment of your decision.”

“I really don't want to see it again---” Harry saw the book-string-image shift to Voldemort stalking up the stairs into the bedroom. Harry saw himself as a baby, crying at the noise, trying to escape his crib. His mother was there, kissing him, assuring him, saying everything would be okay, that she had a plan, that Harry needed to be strong and grow up big and tall and oh god----

“Stop!”

Harry was crying. He couldn't help it. The sight of his mom dotting over a baby... him, moments before she sacrificed herself. Harry dreamed it for years. It was a nightmare that played on repeat on his subconscious. Mind Healers couldn't alleviate it, because he didn't want it gone. It was the only way he could remember her, and it wasn't even really a memory.

This, though, was the real deal. Harry knew it was as real as the infinite stacks of infinite images, as real as Neville cutting the snake's head off, as real as Harry waking up.

“Please. I don't need to see her die again.”

“So be it. However, you do need to see /you/ die.”

The image fast-forwarded in a flurry of bright green explosion and then stopped, freeze-framed on Voldemort holding his wand, pointed at baby Harry's head. Baby Harry was looking past it. Current Harry knew why.

/“Avada Kedavra!”/ and stupid Snake-Face blew himself up with the spell, and baby Harry collapsed in a cute little heap. Current Harry wanted to get up and pick the boy up, but Time held him still.

“This was your first choice. You were anchored to the mortal world, but dead.” Harry looked back at the image, and yup. Baby Harry was definitely dead. His forehead was a smoking ruin, and he was as still as a plank of wood.

“I don't remember making a choice.”

“Of course not. Also, mortal children are extremely attached to living. For obvious reasons.”

Baby Harry opened its eyes and started wailing.

A rat entered the scene, stealing wands, and escaped before the flames claimed him.

Hagrid battled the house itself, as it was collapsing on top of him and on fire, and tucked baby Harry under his hunched form, along with whatever pictures and toys and dottles Hagrid had deemed important, rummaging through the place.

“Okay,” Harry said. “My origin story. So what?”

“So, you are not on Ms. Death's list. It was rather appropriate that you became the owner of her mortal artifacts, perhaps some note of Fate's guidance in there. Really, bravo, Harry.”

“What?!”

“I'm sorry, what was confusing about that?”

“Fate and Death and... and you're TIME and...”

“Harry, surely you've read about the Greater Powers.”

Harry had read about the Greater Powers. Harry had immediately dismissed them as lark, except for allowing a small hole in the logic for Death, or ‘Te Most Dethly Pow'r' as the old scripts told it.

“You really are Time Eternal?”

“Why would I lie?” The grandfatherly, not quite Dumbledore, not quite Flamel, gestured to the bookshelf of infinite images again.

“You are here in a tesseract, my boy, and I am Time Eternal, here to guide you.”

“So wait,” Harry was confused. “You said Death crossed me off her list?”

“That's right. You aren't an option. Normally, you'd be mortal. Normally, I can't show these things to mortals. You, Harry Potter, are not mortal. Death does not desire you.”

“The Hallows...”

“A lark, as you might say. Though they are Her engineering, they were designed to bring mortals /to/ Her, not give them immortality. They were engineered by very clever ancestors of yours and Death sort of snuck in and added Her own little tricks. Can't let mere mortals get the best of a Power now can we?”

This was a bit much and Harry slumped in his armchair. Time was already sifting through the images to find the appropriate past to show Harry.

“No, no, I don't need to see how my great ancestors tried to cheat death and got screwed themselves.”

“Ahh. It's a good story, though terribly dull in parts. Suit yourself.”

“What about the Veil? What happens if I throw myself into it?”

“‘The Veil,' as you call it, is merely a portal to the Lands Beyond. No one comes back, because they usually die. I would say it is a good way to treat with Death if you wish to, though.”

“What other Powers are there?”

“Oh, a few, I suppose. Time and Death aren't everything, afterall. There's Chaos and Order, ever dueling, that's how you have magic, by the way, and my partner Space, and Fate, and...”

“And?!” Harry demanded. He needed to know!

“You might not be mortal but you are a mortal being. It's improper to try to explain things that are over your head.”

Harry huffed. “Try me.”

“You really wish to know how Time functions? In relation to Space, in relation to third, fourth, and fifth dimensional arrays simultaneously?” Harry was blasted with thought. It was like being attacked by the Elder Wand directly, a mind intrusion that showed him galaxies expanding and contracting in impossible directions, the birth and death of universes, the images of his mother---

“OKAY!”

“Do you get it?”

“NO!”

“Good.”

Harry shook off the feeling of being... compelled. It was so unfamiliar given his last few decades of power. The Powers were real. They could do whatever they wanted.

And Time Eternal was sitting in a comfy recliner, regarding Harry, in the middle of some sort of interdimensional time obstruction.

Harry wished for a normal life. A thought struck him.

“What about the future?” Harry wondered. “Can you show me that?”

“You can show yourself, if you'd like, but you should be careful with the future.”

“Why is that?”

“Once you see it, you can't change it.”

“That's silly. It's the future, isn't it? Why can't I change it?”

“Because then it has become the past.”

“The future... becomes the past?”

“Only when observed. Time is very particular, Harry, and you can't change the past.”

“WHY AM I HERE!”

“Oh, Harry. Please. If I may. You are here because your friends inadvertently created a tesseract that trapped you in time. Because you are favored or disfavored by several Powers, I was curious about your presence. Forgive me if I've been a poor host.”

“No, Time, I'm sorry for the outburst. I'm just a bit overwhelmed. You've been a great host.”

“Thank you, Harry. I don't get many visitors who wish to stop and chat, most just jump through.”

“Wait----” did Harry really want to know?

“Yes, Harry, and so are you. Here.” Time filtered the bookcase of strings of images of time and stopped once again on Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow. “You could go here, if you wished. Stop Voldemort. Save your parents. Save yourself.”

But... “But I would erase the future, wouldn't I?”

“To them?” Time gestured to the still image of Voldemort stalking up the lane. The target, a three-story house on the cul-de-sac with dominating gardens and wide fields behind it. “To them, you'd drop in as if out of thin air. Their world would be forever changed. To you? You would remember your world, your time, but it wouldn't exist for them.”

Harry thought he understood. You can't change the past.

“And I could never go back, could I?”

“Maybe you should study that ritual your friends concocted a bit more before deciding.”

Harry did. He sped up the image and slowed it down. Over and over, until he thought he got most of it. If he jumped into a timeline, he was reasonably sure he could find a way back out.

Or he'd throw himself into the Veil of Death and ask Her just what the hell she was on about.

“What about Teddy and James and Al and Lilly? Can I see them?” Harry asked after some time. It was hard to tell just how much transpired between events, in this place. Harry suspected time didn't really go anywhere, here.

“Of course. Remember what I said about the future?”

“Yeah, I remember.”

“Then take all the time you need.”

The pacing was sort of meant to speed up and show more scenes as things went on, kind of like how we reflect on memories.

Harry can't die, but he thinks its because of the Hallows, so his friends and family set up this elaborate "show" to convince the wizarding world that Harry is dead, so he can step down from being the world's savior.

Excellent story and the passing was great (also thanks for clarifying about Hermione&Teddy, I had wondered, also just to be sure, did they plan for the trap to kill Harry or only to make it seem like he died?). You've got real talent there if this is a result of a single sitting, really, an excellent read.

** I read something like that. Harry dies without any big regrets at the ripe age of 90 and wakes up as 11. He is not sure if it's just an imagination of his dying brain or some fate thing and rather angry about it. All the children are younger than his great grandchildren and he does not befriend them. There is a more interesting fight with Quirrell. I have forgotten the name of the fic but I believe it was abandoned

*** The problem is that Teddy gets written off as well if Harry is sent back before his birth.

Remus and Tonks met in the Order of the Phoenix so to not butterfly their meeting away, Harry can't preemptively destroy Voldemort and his Horcruxes (if Voldemort doesn't return, the Order of the Phoenix will not reconvene).

Also, it is likely that Tonks and Remus' whirlwind marriage happened due to the threat of the upcoming war against Voldemort. If there is no upcoming war, Teddy's birth might get butterflied away...

******** Very true, but if I were writing a 'lifetime groundhog day' (ie. Meet and chat with Fate, then go back and wake-up in the past on 'day one', live 'til you die, then get to see Fate and then wake up on 'day one' again), I'd probably write more snippets or highlights of the lives rather than a full day-by-day. Plus, time-skips. Have a new run begin with something like "He'd tried this. Again and again and /again/."

Plenty of options. :)

Give in to the inevitable. He's going up against 'Fate', a literal God-like being. No matter what he chooses to do, if he doesn't do what it wants, it'll just reset him again. He basically can't win. Whether it takes ten resets or a million, eventually he'll get bored and be disinterested in the endless repetition, then he'll stop believing he can do anything and will just give up and do what it wants. It's just Human nature and the nature of causality. If you're starting with the same 'prologue' and the same 'finale', then eventually you'll get bored of repetition and you'll start to wonder 'what if I did it different'?

********* Yeah.

Harry more or less manages to repeat everything with some deaths changed due to the chaos of war (Fred doesn't die, but McGonagall does, for eg.). He even repeats the conception days of his children.

Still, his children are a bit different.

James is not a prankster but looks up to Percy. Albus isn't gay. Lily is somehow a squib.

He still loves them because they are his children, after all.

And then he dies and meets Fate once more.

** Ugh, the whole 'I must avoid changing the future!' trope is one of my biggest pet peeves. It always leads to a boring story following the stations of canon just with more narrator angst hamfisted in. Shoveling some self-righteous Harry-knows-best into the mix doesn't make it sound any more appealing.

*** I think it could be a really good story if the "I must avoid changing the future!" trope goes wrong. Like - let's do it realistic: How many details do you remember from the school year when you were elven? I don't remember much, too be honest. Sure, I know who my friends were and I cleary remember the basic things I learned... but details? Not a chance in hell. I am not even sure if I could still name all my classmates (though the school system in my country is different, I only attended classes with them 4 years from 10-14) And I am not even thirty - Harry died of old age, so he was probably over 100 years.So Harry tries to do the same things but doesn't remember the details. So it's not the big things he fucks up: he still remembers how he got into the quidditch team or how they saved Hermione from the troll (even better if he only remembers the details after Malfoy steals the rememberball and Quirrell runs into the great hall). The devil is in the detail - for example: Harry, Ron and Hermione don't offend Myrtle at the Death Day Party. She doesn't fly back to her toilet and floods it - so there is no water - Mrs. Norris is dead not petrified and all this little changes lead to bigger and bigger changes. With such details the story could really become interessting.

At the time of his death in Deathly Hollows he begs for some more time so that he can fix his mistakes. He gets send back in time to the beginning of PoA. Now he needs to avoid the desaster in the Shrieking Shack, get Sirius freed, prevent Harry from getting kidnapped during the Triwizard Championship and get Tonks to fall in love with him so that he can get Teddy back.

** My main gripe with time travel fics is the lack of consequences, stakes, and the existential anguishes that the mere concept implies. Really think about what it would be like to be an adult stuck as a child. It would be fucking weird, hellish, boring, awkward. Social interaction would be practically impossible. And yet very little of the fics are about time travel and the experience of such. it's all a rushed over reason for the author to dismantle every bit of plot or conflict in the canon to write self indulgent boring changes. I like your prompt because it has an actual reason for existing. Most time travel fics cannot justify their premise, and would probably be more readable as normal AU's.

Time travel is a moral, philisophical, existential, scientific paradox and question. It should not be used as a throw away plot device. (I actually like it in POA, even if it seems out of place in the series as a whole, because it works well as a powerful metaphor that is thematic to the core of the book when Harry saves himself from the dementors.I cry everytime I read that part._)

  really doesn't want the existence of his children to be written off as a price for his 'second chance'.
#+end_quote

"doesn't want" is a hell of an understatement. If that was you, you'd develop a permanent seething hatred against the "powers that be".

I would like this time-traveller Harry develop contempt for the world he's thrown back into. Maybe just be inconsolable and kill himself on Day One, and either fate will throw him back to his timeline to die /properly/, or he'll just die hoping that this was all a cruel joke and his family still exist /somewhere/.

Imagine the case where Harry has died dozens of times. Is reborn dozens of times. Has no control over his destiny and no control over his rebirthing powers. Just stuck in an endless Groundhog Day/Groundhog Life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is a decent story that explores this concept. A bit cracky, and if I remember correctly it's a slash male/male romance.

Funny thing: there's a cool incremental game called [[https://mogron.itch.io/groundhog-life][Groundhog Life]] that I've played before. Pretty cool.
