** This trilogy is the most believable mentor!Snape in the fandom, and even then, it's barely tolerable. So, I cannot recommend any stories based on that metric (though I do like the story quite a lot).

There's not that many good auror!Harry stories either, but there are a few, though I don't think any really follow him going through training like the R trilogy does.

For example, there is linkffn(8262940) - Unatoned, which has auror!Harry and is an excellent story. There's also linkffn(7733333) which is also auror!Harry, but unfinished and not as good.

If you've seen those, then I suggest looking at older Harry/Ginny stories. Many post-hogwarts stories written between 2007-2009 (or even earlier), feature Harry either becoming an Auror, or playing quidditch. I can't recommend any specifics, because at this point in time, they all sort of blended together in my mind.

If you're willing to broaden your horizons even more, there is a trilogy on hpff that focuses on the auror training itself, though it's from an OC's pov. It's been like 8 years since I read it, so I won't make any claims to it's quality - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=80823]]

*** Just a warning if you run headfirst into harry/ginny postwar fics: much of the plot is angst/lack of communication as harry and ginny struggle to find time together while still dating/engaged.

Some common cliches:

1) oh no! Ginnys doing 7th year and I can only see her on hogsmead weekends and quidditch games! Theres only 2 hogsmead weekends per term! My auror training schedule made me miss one and now ginny wont return my letters because she thinks im cheating on her!

2) auror training and harpies training leave no time for each other! Dont you love me more than your sport/job?

3) i cant be married and play on the harpies harry. Will you really deny me my dream job?

** I don't remember the name and it's completely AU and it follows Hermione as the main chara but there was this one where Hermione is about to begin auror training after going to beauxbatons I think and she meets Harry in a pub, they shag, only for both to realize Harry is her new instructor. Other students from Hogwarts were also studying.

If someone else knows, you might enjoy it

*** I don't wish to be unkind, but Debs isn't a very good writer, certainly compared to greengecko. She has something like 10 WiPs going at the same time, which suggests to me that she writes too fast and with very little regard for characterization. I'd hesitate to rec her to anyone who uses Resonance as an example, although the OP may have a higher tolerance than I do.

**** I enjoy both, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Also, I read too many fics tbh, and generally favor in-progress fics, so it's a bit harder for me to pick up on small inconsistencies between chapters. It's gotta be pretty big for me to notice.

***** Fair enough. Prose style and characterization are two of the things that give me the most pleasure in reading fic - well, in reading, period - so typos and clumsy sentence structure and OOCness really ruin the mood for me.

Plus I've been a beta reader for so long that I have a hard time turning off my inner critic. Too many spelling and grammar errors, and I start itching to break out the red font.

** Have you tried [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]]? It's an archive dedicated to Harry and Snape in a non-romantic context.

I've never found a truly in character Snape in these types of fics, but there are nonffensive characterization, maybe this linkffn(8646550) would be up your alley. It's decent enough.
