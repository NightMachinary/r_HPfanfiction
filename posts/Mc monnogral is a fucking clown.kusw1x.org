This is the scene at the start btw when mc monnagral is a cat standing at the dursley

"Fancy seeing you here,Professor McGonagall."

She then replies with

"How did you know it was me?"

The cat animagues the witch and the brain cells of this bitch its not like you have been deadass turning into a cat at the first class for the new first years and working for him for over 10 years it's not like your a registered animagus stalking the exact spot you knew he would be it's not like as dumbledore says shortly after your posting unnaturally on the wise words of my role model Jamal BITCHES BE BONKERS shit makes me as mad as any chocolate that's not Hershey's or minecraft fanfiction books but that's a whole another can of worms


** First-book syndrome. It's like wondering why Dumbledore flew all the way from Hogwarts (Scottish Highlands) to the Ministry (in London) when there were other options available, such as Apparition or Floo Powder.

It's like wondering how in the world Hagrid flew to the shack on the rocks (probably Fawkes, in hindsight).

It's like wondering why Snape was hobbling around and got his bleeding leg patched up the Muggle way with Filch when Madam Pomfrey could've fixed him up quickly. Hell, Snape himself was shown to be capable of healing, in book six.

** Isn't her animagus form a pretty generic-looking cat? I couldn't identify a specific tabby cat out of a lineup.
