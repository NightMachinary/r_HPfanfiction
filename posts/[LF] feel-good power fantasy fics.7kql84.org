looking for that feel-good bullshit power fantasy fics such as /I'm Still Here/ or /The Merging/ (which is actually well written). In the style of horrible harem anime, most of the characters often initially underestimate Harry's power (or any other main character's), and are later surprised by a show of strength. Often includes angst and a romance subplot

Other notable examples include:

- /0800-Rent-A-Hero/
- /Whiskey Time Travel/
- /Deprived/
- and to a lesser extent, /Wind Shear/ and
- /A Cadmean Victory/

just to make it clear, harem or any sort of romance at all is entirely unnecessary

** Your definition of "feel-good" and mine are very different. I don't like any angst in my feel-good stories.

You have listed quite a few good stories.

** How.

The Hell.

Can /0800-Rent-A-Hero/, the fic where literally everything that goes right for Harry is actually going wrong, a feel-good bullshit power fantasy fic?

*** well, as I remember it (i'll readily admit I haven't looked at the fic since it last updated)....

a tragic backstory is established (harry is plucked from his world and then disfigured)

and then everyone feels bad for him, he shames the weasley's for being the cause for his disfigurement, he is randomly the only person that is able to teach divination despite being thrust into the job on a whim, the femHarry counterpart has some sort of mild romantic interest in him, he takes down voldemort in his free time, somehow subvert's Tonks' loyalty, etc

as I see it, the basis of this subgenre is a main character that comes off as an underdog, but is actually able to overcome any obstacles with relative ease... while this would ordinarily be boring, the underdog aspect creates a false sense of challenge and establishes a sense of justice, which can create a fic that is entertaining but pretty worthless otherwise. seems to be the case here to me, but feel free to disagree
