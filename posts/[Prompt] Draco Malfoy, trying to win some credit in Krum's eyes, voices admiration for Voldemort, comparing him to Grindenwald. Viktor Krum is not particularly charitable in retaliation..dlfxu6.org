I acknowledge that it should be "Grindelwald," but my fingers slipped and I can't edit the title.

Oops.


** Viktor sat at the Slytherin table, because that's where the Headmaster Karkaroff ordered the Durmstrang delegation to take their seats.

How he hated that decision at this moment. He should have said something to his fellow classmates to go to some other table. Perhaps the one with the black and yellow? They seemed friendly enough. The blue and bronze was taken by the Beauxbatons students, which was a shame. There were some very pretty girls there. Sigh.

The gold and red was another option. It wasn't that bad and the girls there were equally as pretty. Especially that one with bushy hair... Hmmm...

But no. They had to sit with the morons in silver and green. Especially the one. Blonde hair, slicked back with an insane amount of hair gel, it's like the boy didn't even care about his image. But then, with his delicate cheekbones... Viktor shuddered at the thought that the inane prattle the little irritant constantly spewed was due to any romantic feelings. That wouldn't end well for anyone involved. The body would have to be hidden well after all.

"... and after all" the blonde irritant continued speaking "the Dark Lord was only continuing the work of great Lord Grindelwald! It was from that foundation that he built his idea of opposing the muggle scum!"

Viktor stilled. He noticed that all his classmates did as well, watching him warily and quite fearfully.

"It's only natural, after all. I mean, wizards need to fight for their own, we can't let the mudbloods pollute our society any further and the less said about the rest of the muggle filth the bettttt......"

The blonde's airways found itself suddenly clogged due to Viktor's silent curse.

"Really?" Viktor said while casting several concealment charms to hide what was happening from the teachers.

"I hav one ving to say to you." he looked at the boy whose small frame was completely dwarfed as Viktor loomed over him "You vill not speak to me again. You vill not look at me at all. You vill not even fink of me, ever. If you do" here he lowered his head to the ear of the boy, who was rapidly turning blue and whispered "I vill make your life a living hell."

With that he let go of the curse and countered the charms. All his classmates just nodded and went back to their meals. The students in green around him looked apprehensive.

The blond menace just soiled his pants.

** Viktor casts a spell his older brother invented on Draco

Whenever Draco says "Mudblood" he is magically stripped down to his underwear . This lasts throughout his remaining four years of schooling and makes him a laughing stock

Viktor teaches this spell to Harry and Goyle,Crabbe,Zabini,McLaggen etc. are also afflicted after Harry teaches it to the DA using Zacharias as a test dummy in order to avoid embrassing anyone he actually likes

**** It's likely a nod to the /Half-Blood Prince./ Harry uses several jinxes from the Prince's book, including a jinx that rapidly and uncontrollably increases toenail length.

Harry uses it on Crabbe, and later on, Ron recommends it as punishment for McLaggen's dismal performance in Quidditch.

Harry, for his part, was considering /Sectumsempra,/ before he knew what it did.

***** Yeah, but my point is that I strongly doubt McLaggen would even use the word Mudblood, so using the spell on him doesn't really make much sense.

****** Fair point, though if Zacharias is the test dummy, it's likely the curse could be modified for a variety of trigger words.

Replace "mudblood" with "my father will here about this" for Malfoy and "Quidditch" for McLaggen and it still fits.

****** Ron saved five goals, and he saved his goals fairly.

Assuming McLaggen, had he not been jinxed, would have also saved five, they likely would have continued until one of them missed outright.

Alternatively, Harry may have asked the rest of his team who they felt would be a better match for the team as a whole.

Keep in mind, McLaggen's attitude is absolutely dismal--he's arrogant, bossy and in love with himself. Considering several of Harry's team already knew McLaggen--he was in Katie's year and Ginny would have met him through Slughorn, I don't think McLaggen would have been on the team for very long.
