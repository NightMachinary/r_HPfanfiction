So yeah. Any fics (crack/humor only, no smut that tries to take itself seriously) that do this sort of thing? Make all kinds of willy wand jokes?

  "So... Susan Bones?" his penis greeted suavely.

  Susan was clearly embarrassed as she nodded and replied, "Yep."

  "Now is that your name," the penis clarified. "Or the plan for tonight?"

This...is actually a pretty good pun. Who else has used it?

  COMPLETE. OneShot. Either Fred and George played a prank on Harry, Harry played a prank on Fred and George, or they're all playing pranks on everybody. Although to be honest, it really doesn't matter how it happened. WARNING: crude, immature, ADULT humor.

** Now, now, there's no need to be so restrictive in your thinking. After all, wands aren't the only phallic objects in the wizarding world you can make jokes about:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion)

Harry lets Ron compete on his behalf in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Ron keeps asking the other Champions if they'd like to polish their wands together.

Its all about bashing Ron, which some people don't like. I think the fic is in my top 5 crack.

Edit: I forgot the first chapter is rather bad, but if you can get past that, its very funny.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
