I'm looking for fics focusing on Draco. He time travels into the past.

Probably befriends, Harry. Makes him join Slytherin. Or Uses the future knowledge to save his family.

*** Can I please trouble you for a general review of the story's quality? Especially how Ron fits into this story. The summary is quite unhelpful.

**** Basically, Draco goes back to just before his first year, he and Harry become friendly with each other when they meet in Madam Malkin's and the Hogwarts Express. While Ron's there in the compartment, there's not *too* much hostility between them. Harry and Draco get sorted into Gryffindor and become best friends after that. Ron and Hermione are friendly with the two of them, or at least friendly rivals. It becomes a Golden Quartet as opposed to canon's Golden Trio. Also so far, the story is implying Drarry, but since they're kids (Draco regains a bunch of childish qualities, don't feed him sugar,) it's not gone anywhere yet.

As to the quality, well, I think it's really good. Draco's relatively limited knowledge of canon allows for some interesting moments of tension and avoids being a Mary-Sue fix-it fic. There's no weird tropes or unnecessary bashing.

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!
