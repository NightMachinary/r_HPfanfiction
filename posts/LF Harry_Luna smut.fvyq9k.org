Just what the title says, I'd prefer no harems but I have no problem with them, I've read the Nargles in the air all recs are appreciated, thanks!


** Noodlehammer does some great stories with smut weaved in. Not a Luna focus but she's written really well in them.

** I know you said you prefer no harems, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]] I had to put down because of the smut. It starts off just suggestive, but got uncomfortable fast.

*** You know that isn't a harem really, I think a harem is more than three people in a relationship

It's Harry/Hermione/Luna, which they're comfortable with
