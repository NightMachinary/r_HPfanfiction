Title says most

Pairing Haphne or Harmony

No slash with MC

That's just my opinion soo don't get offended because I don't like slash

I'm looking for a fic like this because most fics with animagus forms don't have Harry using it/ them

** Vox Corporis is a lot of Harmony shippers favorite fic. It's got plenty of animagus action for you but it is HEAVILY a romance. It's been taken down but there are some archives of it floating around. [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZ74bV_yYE2kWMa4s-gMYt8n92v0WsFq/view][Here's one]], download for easy reading. It was written before HBP came out so bear that in mind.

** I think he's saying a fic where Harry uses his Animagus form a lot?

In linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) Hermione uses her animagus form to great effect. Harmony.

In linkao3(The Accidental Animagus) Harry uses his form a lot. The pairing is Harry/Luna but Hermione is effectively Harry's sister, who he's very close with, so she's a main character. The romance is pretty unimportant.

Both of these are cat animagi.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
