:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a FemHarry fic where she, Hermione, Blaise and Draco were aspects of the Four Horsemen? Harry was definitely Conquest and I'm pretty sure Hermione was War. I think it may also have been a Tomarry fic and possibly Harry was raised by Sirius. It was on [[https://Fanfic.Net][Fanfic.Net]] a while ago but I can't find it.

This is actually killing me and if someone could point me in the right direction that would be amazing!!!

EDIT: The fic was called Inside My Mind on ffn
