Harry Potter did his best to remain out of sight while the Dursleys were finishing their dinner. He quietly went over his studies as his relatives continued to feast and drink. While there was great animosity between them and Harry, the truth was they were afraid of him and his new abilities.

"Usually it's just a fry-up for me what with twelve dogs to look after," Aunt Marge continued, pouring herself another brandy. "Speaking of dogs, where did you send the boy?"

"St Brutus's. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases," replied Vernon.

"Excellent. I won't have any of this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it," Aunt Marge announced after wiping her mustache. "Harry Potter's father was a drunk and unemployed wastrel, and his mother was a bitch."

Harry Potter, having overheard the conversation, became enraged. He burst into the dining room with his wand, pointing it at Aunt Marge. "/No one/ talks about my parents that way". Aunt Marge's glass shattered in her hand to reveal the end of her finger having swollen to the size of salami. "My father was not a drunk and unemployed wastrel. In fact, he was a great and powerful wizard named 'James Potter'. My mother, Lily Evans, was also a powerful witch. I take great pride in my parents and am disheartened to hear you disrespect them as such. So, as punishment: you shall be blow."

Aunt Marge started blowing as the rest of her fingers swelled up. Dudley, who had earlier sneaked off to the living room to watch TV, was eating chips on the couch oblivious to all this. One of Aunt Marge's buttons popped off her tweed jacket, flew into the next room and hit Dudley right in the head, causing him to fall off the couch. Both Vernon and Petunia were paralysed with surprise at what was happening to Aunt Marge, and Harry Potter just continued to look on with anger. Aunt Marge was now completely blow and had lifted up from the table.

/BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH!

Aunt Marge was bouncing on the ceiling, slowly making her way to the door. "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!" She flew outside. Vernon ran after her and grabbed her foot, but he was lifted off the ground as well. "Don't you dare let go!!!!!" Yelled Aunt Marge, but Vernon had already dropped to the ground. "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"

Harry Potter calmly packed his suitcase and left the house with Vernon still crying and Petunia still waving to Aunt Marge in the backyard. As Harry Potter walked along Privet Drive, a little black dot could be seen floating around in the sky...

/Later on, Harry Potter meets up with Ron and Hermione to discuss magic/

"And then I blew her fat with a spell," said Harry.

"Wow, that's really cool!" Laughed Ron. "What happened next?"

"She flew away."

"Serves her right. I hope she died," grumbled Hermione as she took a sip of her goblin coffee. Something caught the corner of her eye as she peered over to a table at the other side of the room. "Is that Dudley?"

"Yes it is," said Harry. "Let's go be mean to him." Ron and Hermione grinned in unison. "Yeah!"

The trio got up, walked across the room and sat on either side of Dudley. "Hi dudders," mocked Harry. "How's your head?"

"Still bruised a bit," replied Dudley.

"We saw your grandma pop," announced Ron.

Dudley looked up. "Oh, ok."

** That is a repost because this "fic" had already been posted here at least once.

Edit: Apparently a repost by the same author who already posted this a couple times.

*** The poster has multiple accounts constantly making this same dull joke across multiple subreddits. Last time I called him out he tried to send me a pm but I ignored it.

Hopefully he will go outside and make some friends soon.

*** I changed /dudders/ to dudders, so it's not the same.

Also, are you going to review it or not?
