Im looking for some good fanfics or reimaginings of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, that center primarily around Albus and his difficult relationship with his father, Harry. In my opinion, with all of Cursed Child's issues, I found reading about Harry and Albus's strained father/son relationship to be fascinating. I've even had this cool idea for a fanfic floating around in my head that involves Albus kind of become like a gray Jedi of the wizarding world. Like a wizard vigilante who believes in good and helping others but is willing to take the less popular path. :33 If anyone knows of anything like this that would be awesome! I feel like every time I look up fanfiction for Harry Potter i end up getting a lot of romances (which is totally cool but not what I'm looking for right now! ;33)

*** Well to start, I appreciate your opinion, even though it has nothing to do with what I requested. The strained relationship between Albus and Harry is not due to Harry NOT loving his children. Its because they are both so similar in personality that they struggle to communicate with one another. Harry is the savior to the wizarding world but he is also just a man too. I think it's very realistic that he could face hardships with some of his children. The world isn't a la la land where everything is perfect and the good guys always do everything right. I totally agree though that Cursed Child was bad though! The story was so poor and such a waste, but the Way Albus is portrayed did interest me. I also liked Scorpius too.

**** Harry says that he wishes Albus was not his son. That completely fits what I said.

***** Right, and that's a bad part from Cursed Child. But the strained relationship, everything else, is believable imo.

******* I meant the “everything else believable” statement in regards to Harry and Albus's difficult relationship. You're really digging for an argument here. I've already said that I agree that Cursed Child wasn't good. Time travel stories are never good! Now take a deep breath and move on with your life.

**** I agree, get rid of the ridiculous time turner storyline, and the even more ridiculous character of Delphi and lets focus on the Potter family.

** Thank you! I personally thought that the Harry/Albus relationship was the best part in Cursed Child. Unfortunately, the only Cursed Child fanfiction that I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12121323/1/Put-Your-Curse-in-Reverse][Put Your Curse in Reverse]]. Both of those are more feel-good stories that fix Harry and Albus's relationship...as well as develop a romance between Albus and Scorpius. Entertaining, but not what you are looking for. I'd also be interested to see if there are any other recommendations.
