Well... I'm looking for some kind of mind meld, where neither could hide their thought to other. Well, either because both of them are soul bonded, or because they are both legilimens and have nothing to hide from each other or any other premise like this. If possible I want a fic where they have little to no ego as Harry or hermione, and more as gestalt entity (almost like one mind in two body).


** "Error of Soul" is sadly uncompleted, but might fit

I also remember reading a one shot where Harry and Hermione created a soul bond that went horribly wrong, but can't remember the title.

  'Aaron,' she thought glumly. Idly, she wondered if she would ever have someone to kiss her like that again...

Oh GOD no. Why did Umbridge have to fantasize about someone with my name? What have I done to deserve this?

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.
