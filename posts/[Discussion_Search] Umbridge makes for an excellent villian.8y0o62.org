If and/or maybe flesched out. Any fic's where she is? Is she a good villian? In my pov yes, if a tad bit annoying in a childish way, hence the youtube link to a perfect video for this argument below. Basicly a typical disney villian. Of course most fics are too mature for that type of antigonist(huh).

** Canon Umbridge makes for a good villain, but she's still somewhat too superficial IMO as she drops her grandmotherly facade too quickly. [[/u/dsarma]] has however worked out a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6rjzod/reasonably_clever_umbridge/dl5pdxo/][truly frightening and effective Umbridge]]:

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge doesn't make that cringey speech in the beginning. She just goes about looking prim and proper, and a little feather-headed, right? First day of class, she announces that there will be no essays, no homework over weekends, and absolutely no interruptions to Quidditch matches.

  She says that she's spoken to the other teachers, and gotten a copy of the Quidditch schedule for the year, and has scheduled exams to be at least 2 weeks BEFORE Quidditch, so that even if you're on the team, you have time to enjoy the game without the spectre of an exam looming over you.

  All of a sudden, the entire class is freaking THRILLED. Harry talks out of turn, and says, "But we need PRACTICAL demonstrations of defence against the dark arts!" Umbridge says something along the lines of, "Your education in DADA has been spotty at best. I cannot risk accidents in my classroom. I need you all to start from the beginning, and we'll have to move at a slower pace, so that everyone has a chance to catch up. Unless you all WANT more homework, more exams, and more essays?"

  It all sounds perfectly reasonable, right? Harry is about to protest, but is shouted down by literally the whole rest of the class. Something along the lines of, "HARRY DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ME."

  And then, Umbridge, being magnanimous, says something along the lines of, "Now class. We mustn't be angry at a young man who yearns to stretch beyond the boundaries of his class. I agree, Harry. You will have 12 inches on the use of the protego charm on my desk first thing tomorrow morning. I'll make sure to assign you special assignments through the semester, so that you can get your wish. Now. Anyone else want my special tutoring?"

  At that point, Harry can't really argue one way or the other. Umbridge has shut his ass down, and quick. The rest of the year, the other students turn on him and Hermione. Not even Ron will talk to them. "They're both BARMY. Trying to get us extra homework? What is WRONG with them."

  From that point onwards, it will become very easy to get the rest of the school thinking that Harry is merely trying to be disruptive. She never outright takes him in to detention, or overtly threatens him, but she does remind him that his spot on the Quidditch team is only as good as his grades are kept up. Continually antagonising teachers is a poor way to ensure a passing grade.

  That'll get even his own team mates on her side.

  Basically, the rest of the books would take a really dark turn. Umbridge wouldn't be doing big, shouty, angry things against Harry. She'd be doing quiet, needling, persistent chipping away at Harry's character, and casting doubts about his ability to think rationally. She wouldn't have to overreach her authority. She could still get the go-ahead from the Minister to see to it that classes are adequate to the Ministry's standards. She makes it clear that she plans to root out any teacher who is overly harsh on their students, because, "A learning environment led by fear causes children to be unable to pass their exams. And really, isn't that the point of school?" She broadly implies that she'll curtail Snape's ability to intimidate his students, and assign detentions/take away points willy nilly. She takes one look at Trelawney and has her fired by Dumbledore, because the woman is "clearly not competent to teach the materials on the divination final exam." She has Hagrid removed from the school, because any teacher who hasn't passed the OWLs himself is clearly not suited to teach students.

  But she doesn't do it all at once. She starts with the least popular (Snape, Trelawney), and works her way through the rest of the staff. She spaces it out over the course of a few months.

  Again, the students are freaking HERE for it, because they no longer have to put up with reams of homework. As long as they can regurgitate what's on the textbook, they're considered passing. You get the students writing glowing letters home about Umbridge, and what a caring, dedicated educator she is.

  That's the thing. To let evil win, you don't have to go down the route of big grand gestures. Encourage mediocrity. Encourage stupidity. Laziness. Lack of accountability. Encourage that petty, small-minded, short-sighted thinking, and you've got a populace that doesn't need to be conquered. It's already conquered itself.

*** Wow. That's certainly something I'd be interested in reading. Specifically the last paragraph is really telling and I think spot on. Create a culture where it is encouraged and all too easy to become just another sheep in the herd.

**** I can't claim 100% credit. There's a series by Mercedes Lackey called the Mage Storm trilogy, where the worst evil guy isn't the ruthless emperor who's ruling like a despot; it's a petty paper pusher. He quietly goes in, and finds ALL military accounts that are in arrears, and leaks it to the press. And when his own accountants come in and audit the books, he acts HORRIFIED. All of a sudden, he's got the merchants on his side. He rounds up all the criminals, and puts them to work in forced labour houses. The poor are happy, because he's “tough on crime”, and their roads are clean and the cities are working again. The military is in his pocket, because he managed to get them all paid and up to date. He assigns rationing chits to everyone. Now the entire populace is on his side, because they can get (meagre) food. Employment hits pretty much 100%. Beggars are rounded up and sent to work in feeding the furnaces of the factories. Now the merchant class loves him, because their supply chains are running, and their labour force is in place.

Meanwhile, he assigns spies to keep an eye on dissent. He drops little gems of gossip so that the petty nobles all are fighting each other, and think he's on their side. It's a terrifying look at how easily everyone slips right into mediocrity, and I can totally see it playing out in any truly conniving villain.

***** I love Mercedes Lackey! I just finished her latest one--The Hills Have Spies. She's pretty much my fantasy comfort food.

And I totally agree about villains. The worst are often the ones that make us think they're on our side while systematically dismantling everything we hold dear and then making us think it was our idea. Kind of like a certain president. Then the true horror is when you realize what's been done to you right under your nose.

I always believed that Hagrid quietly passed his OWLs and NEWTs over the summer between Second- and Third-Year.

***** Well, it seems clear enough that Dumbledore home-schooled him to an extent, once he'd unsnapped his wand and hidden it in the umbrella. So I imagine that as /soon/ as he was pardoned, he did a few weeks of revising and then sat his OWLs in a special session Dumbledore got him. I don't imagine he passed them with flying colors, of course, but he probably got As wherever it mattered, an E or two, and naturally an O in Care of Magical Creatures.
