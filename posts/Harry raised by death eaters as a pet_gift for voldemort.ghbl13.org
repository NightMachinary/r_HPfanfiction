:END:
Remember reading this fic where Harry was kidnapped after defeating voldemort and raised, I think by Lucius, to be a gift for voldemort when he returns. I remember a scene where they meet with the order to try and negotiate or something and they recognise Harry and try to get him to return, but he doesn't care and just demands Tom gets him food?

Please help, I've tried trawling through my saved fics but I can't seem to find it :(


** I've read that one! I will have to look for it, I think it might have been on adult-hpfanfiction.

*** I found it! After spending about 3 hours slowly sorting my downloaded fanfiction, I found it! It's called dark gifts and it looks like it's been deleted from AO3 for some reason but I've still got the epub :)
