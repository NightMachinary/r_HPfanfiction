#+begin_quote
  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!" has an accidental Dark Lord Ron who gets a harem without trying. It has absurd amounts of Snape bashing but still makes the entire thing funny and not cringe-worthy. The fic is the definition of crack that still makes you laugh despite being totally unbelievable.
