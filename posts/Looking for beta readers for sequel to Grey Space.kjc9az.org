I'm getting close to the end of the first draft of Glasslight, the sequel to a story I finished posting a few years ago called Grey Space. Having worked on it since then, I'm really invested in making sure the quality of the writing is the best I can make it before I post. So I'm looking for a few beta readers to take on the first draft of the first section (of seven), for now, preferably someone who previously read Grey Space. Seeing as I occasionally see spikes of new readers after it gets linked here, I'm hoping a few of you lovely souls might be interested! If you are not, thanks for your patience as I clog up this sub a bit.

Glasslight is split into seven sections, each following a different character. The first section follows Hermione. It begins right around where Grey Space ends, after Hermione receives her Hogwarts letter. In certain sections more than others it does deal with some heavy topics of neglect, abuse, and grief though I don't think there will need to be any content warnings in the first section. As opposed to Grey Space, there is a bit of romance, though it is not in the first section. I'll include a bit of the very beginning down below, if you're wondering what sort of style we're looking at (initially), though I will say I've re-written the opening quite a bit more than the rest, and also that it's subject to being completely rewritten if it needs it.

What you'd be signing up for:

- Reading the first section of the story, which is just under 36k. (Of course, if you end up hating it and can't read past the first part of this first section, I won't hold it against you, and would love to know why.)
- Answering a number of questions regarding the writing, with a special focus on character, story flow, and consistency/readability of each voice. There are definitely some rough areas that need more help than others.
- Keeping a special eye out for repetition or other areas that can be trimmed.
- (Bonus for Britpicking!)
- If you're up for it later on, potentially re-reading a future draft before posting.

If this seems up your alley to help out with, please let me know! I know it's the end of the year and people can be quite busy, but I'm looking mainly for people who'd be able to read by mid-January. Thanks in advance and Happy Holidays!

/Dear Ms Granger,/

/We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry./

/This may come as something of a shock.../

1. ​

Objectively speaking, it could be worse.

Really, her parents are taking this all very well. Most people, being of sound mind and common sense, on receiving a letter purporting not only the existence of magic, not only that some people can control said magic, not only that it is something entirely unattainable by them while at the very fingertips of their teen-aged daughter, and that their daughter is not only magical but a full-blown witch with enough potential to be educated at the premier institution in the United Kingdom (if not the world) in an undisclosed location with no phone or electronic communication and post only to be carried by bird and full boarding services nine months out of the year (with the option for students to remain on the school grounds for the Winter and Spring holidays at the students' discretion)---

Most people would scoff, at the least, and toss the letter in the bin, and perhaps tell their friends about it over a few pints down at the pub later on, a strange anecdote that everyone would soon forget about as they go on with their ordinary, practical lives.

Most people, on hearing their daughter (their intelligent, practical daughter) say, “I think it's real. Can't I go?” would wonder if they ought to acquaint their daughter with some sort of therapist or medical professional, especially when that daughter is fourteen and really too old for such flights of fancy, let alone for believing in honest intentions behind something so suspect.

/(Unfortunately, you will not be able to tour the castle; there are protections in place to keep muggles, which is to say, non-magical peoples, far from the grounds. But you can be assured your child will be kept safe and comfortable in the care of seasoned educating professionals, and soon will find her second home and place in magical society from within Hogwarts' walls.)/

So in truth, yes. Her parents have done quite well, taking this all in stride. Hermione supposed the whole ‘witch' thing was a similar experience for them as it was for her: like finally learning the name of the old man who has lived around the corner from you for years, who you see while out on walks and always pause to wave to when he's sitting on the porch in the evening. A name doesn't really change anything on its own, but it's the key to a door that's been locked for years. Locked, but there; accepted, but not acknowledged.

Despite that:

They don't want her to go. Not because of the magic thing, but because of, well, everything else thus far in Hermione's life that hasn't quite gone to plan. Because she's not the student teachers expect her to be, not the polite, obedient child, not the one who follows the rules or even plays the same games---

And maybe the reason she's felt the shame about that more keenly over the three days that have passed since they received the letter is that now she also has to bear the consequences. That thought only magnifies the guilt. She had always aspired to be a good person, and the idea that her wrongdoings are only wrong to her when /she/ is the one who suffers is, frankly, disheartening. Incidentally, that would mean admitting that her supposed wrongdoings are in fact wrong, which is something she is still always prepared to debate with anyone, even her parents. If they prevail, she can accept that. But their immediate /no/'s---her mother's the moment she read the letter, her father's when Hermione asked, a few minutes later---

They hurt. The way it hurt when her dog, Cocoa, a chocolate labrador with cataracts and a wagging tail who played fetch with the vigor of a puppy into her teenage years, had finally let go of what had seemed like an unbreakable grip on life, when Hermione was just five years old and unwilling to comprehend the notion of death, and her parents had told her Cocoa wasn't coming back and she was happier where she was now, and Hermione hadn't understood the sentiment. The way it hurts when Hermione is browsing through the history section at the library when she should be in class and unknowingly ventures into a passage about some new subject she hadn't known of before, and through several hours and several books discovers she had been ignorant of yet another major atrocity---another, another; when will people stop /hurting each other---/ And it hurts like the first day of school always hurts, because she doesn't /belong/ and she knows it, and every one of her classmates know it---and her parents know it---

And still they've said no. And for all it hurts, she knows, logically, it is because they care. Because they are family, and they love her. And for their love, it hurts all the more.


** I am ecstatic that you are writing a sequel! Grey Space is one of my favorites I read this year

#+begin_quote
  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
