It's been ages it feels like since I stumbled upon the story but Harry somehow becomes god like he makes the earth and the people and walks among them occasionally and builds the world it's a strange story I feel like the writing was sub par anyone know what the hell I'm talking about?


** Sounds like the ending to the third part of the Hero Trilogy.
