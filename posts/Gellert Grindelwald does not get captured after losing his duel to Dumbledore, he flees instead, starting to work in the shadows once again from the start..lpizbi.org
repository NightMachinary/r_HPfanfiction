  In 1945 Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald have their famous duel to end the war. but what if Gellert got away? what if after suffering defeat he went into hiding? what would change when Voldemort rises to power and makes an enemy of the previous Dark Lord? How would a child of destiny's life be changed? rewritten history, Grey!Harry eventually Powerful!Harry rated for safety

** Try these:

(1) Reformed, Returned and Really Trying - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/]]

AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

â€‹

(2) Phoenix Insurgent - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/]]

Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.
