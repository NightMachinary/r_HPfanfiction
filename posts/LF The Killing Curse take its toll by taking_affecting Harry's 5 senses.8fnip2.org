Harry choose to return to the Living, but he tributes this by losing one of his senses in regular (or unregular) periods. So, he is blind for a certain time, then Deaf for a certain time and so on. The order of this tributes isnt necessary strict, so as he loses his eyesight and then his sense of touch, he might lose again the eyesight.

I used "affecting", but i dont want it to be like, Harrys Eyesight is getting worse or he hears like through wadding, he completely lose the Sense, but he gets it back and loses an other Sense.


** 1. This is certainly a unique request (as far as I can recall), so kudos on that.

2. Is this a fic you've read before, or are you looking for one like it? I can't help either way, but it would be good to know.

*** 1. Thanks for that, although a Unique Request doesnt guarantee a Hit.
2. I want to know, if such a Fic exist.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** not quite, what i was looking. The killing Course about Voldemorts and Harrys last encounter would be the trigger and it would be more than blindness
