Personally I've been pretty psyched for linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic by Sophprosyne).


** Although [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), is getting better recently, I hope White Squirrel can wrap it up soon and move on to her more interesting premises, such as [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12435331/1/I-Aim-to-Misbehave][I Aim to Misbehave]], or [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11189707/1/The-Philosopher-s-Red-Herring][The Philosopher's Red Herring]], linkffn(12088294;12435331;11189707).

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

**** Im not sure if you've heard of it but the concept (infact the exact phrase, 'literal five headed dragon') is taken from the podcast 'Welcome To Nightvale', check that out you might like it. The personalities of the heads, as well as being referred to by their colour is also taken from WTNV. Not having a go at the author but as they neglect to mention that anywhere in the story I thought I would point it out.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** I'm psyched about Half Blood Romantic and also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief). It's AU and the premise is interesting, but it still has a canon feel. Romance in this fic is very realistic.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

I enjoyed both linkffn(12640734; 12640717). A recently written oneshot and completed WiP. Boogum is one of those authors whose witty and emotional dialogue both 'land' for me in a way they rarely do, and can make any conversation work.
