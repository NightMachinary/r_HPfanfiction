I'm sorry this is just a personal rant. Whichever way, I look at it, Harry is too well-adjusted in books for someone who went through Dursleys' Abuse/neglect (Should I call it neglect or abuse ,or is it one and the same?)

I commented on a post other day trying to explain how book1 being a children's book has very Cinderellasque elements.. but now that I think about it, I regret answering this way. Harry's treatment is just too unfair! Who treats a Child like that? The only other character whose character portrayal is even more wretched, is Sirius Black.

I find fanfics where Harry is rescued, bitter-sweet especially since no one took him away in Canon.


** But Harry /does/ have issues from how the Dursleys treated him. Harry, from an early age, has a somewhat depressed value of his own life, and even veers into suicide ideation at a few points (bold emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, *it's only dying a bit later than I would have*, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! (PS, Chapter 16)

  /Let the pain stop,/ thought Harry. */Let him kill us/*/. . . . End it, Dumbledore. . . ./ */Death is nothing compared to this/*/./ . . . /And I'll see Sirius again./ . . . (OotP, Chapter 36)

  He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and *close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them*. (DH, Chapter 16)

  He saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade; and his own wand trembled in his hand, and *he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling*. . . . (DH, Chapter 32)
#+end_quote

He also has a reduced sense of self-worth, often not realizing that other people may like or respect him:

#+begin_quote
  What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. (CoS, Chapter 4)

  “Listen, you're not going to have any trouble. You're a champion. You've just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they'll be queuing up to go with you.”

  In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, *to Harry's amazement*, he turned out to be quite right. (GoF, Chapter 22)

  Harry considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I'm a nutter, remember?” (OotP, Chapter 16)

  He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. “I dunno why the team's this popular all of a sudden.”

  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not /Quidditch/ that's popular, it's you! (HBP, Chapter 11)
#+end_quote

He feels he has to be very self-sufficient, because he doesn't trust the adults around him to be both competent and acting in his best interest. That's why he felt he had to save the Philosopher's Stone and Ginny on his own (or only with the help of Ron and Hermione), and why he felt the need to "rescue" Gabrielle during the second task. And I think this line in particular is telling:

#+begin_quote
  What he really wanted (*and it felt almost shameful to admit it* to himself) was someone like --- someone like a /parent/: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . . (GoF, Chapter 2)
#+end_quote

He's so used to only having himself to rely on that wanting even just advice feels like a weakness.

So sure, Harry doesn't show any of the dramatic, stereotypical signs many people expect from abuse victims. But the fingerprints of that abuse are all over his characterization, if you look.

**** If it was just about wanting the pain to stop, then I'd agree. But the addition of "And I'll see Sirius again" makes it sound more like suicide ideation, especially when you also consider the next chapter (bolding mine, again):

#+begin_quote
  “Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human ---”

  “*THEN --- I --- DON'T --- WANT --- TO --- BE --- HUMAN*!” Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, “/Really/!”

  “I DON'T CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. “I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, *I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END*, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE ---” (OotP, Chapter 37)
#+end_quote

Yes, he's in acute grief and probably shock (even though he's not being tortured anymore), but that's kind of my point. It's not so much that he actually wants to die, but more that, in moments of danger and/or high stress, he considers his death to be an acceptable outcome.

It's incredibly heartbreaking to think about the complete lack of love Harry received from the time he was 1.5 to adulthood. It really shows Harry's strength of character that the abuse didn't completely destroy him.

She was trying to write about a kid who had a shitty life who suddenly finds out he's a celebrity in a fantastical hidden world. The Dursleys serve to make his life shitty, and their abuse is just an extension of that.

*** I have a feeling that when Rowling wrote the Dursleys she didn't quite realize what that kind of treatment does to a child.

Especially when Harry turns out relatively healthy despite the neglect making me think that she just sorta threw in the Dursleys and how they treat him in order to encourage him to like Hogwarts more.

I never understood why the Dursleys acted the way they did since they have no influence in how Harry acts throughout the books. You could have just replaced them with foster parents that don't abuse him or treat him like a burden and would probably still end up with the same character.

**** Well you also have to consider that it was intended as a kids book or at least especially the first few books. So I think the treatment is partly just to like show kids that the dursleys were like mean and bad and also should show you that the the muggle world isn't Harry's real world, that he's only really accepted in the magical world. I think she just went to the extreme to really get her point across. But yeah it does feel that even in later books the abuse is kinda just ignored.. and not just Harry's I mean we know that Sirius and Shape didn't have a great upbringing either. Also what also struck me as abuse but never got really labelled as such was Neville and his great uncle ?? Like that guy was literally putting Neville in danger of dying to have him show some accidental magic... I mean I'd consider that abuse

***** That they are kids books is all the more reason not to show abuse without consequences. If Harry made it through fine victims that have problems are just weak/attention seekers, as [[/u/tediuminahamsterball][u/tediuminahamsterball]] says above kids don't empathize with Harry's situation. They might be more inclined to if it actually had some effect on him.

If JKR wanted to show that the muggle world wasn't Harry's 'real world' then she would have been better off giving him a normal family that he still didn't fit in with.

In her defense, though, she wrote the books in the 90s and there wasn't a lot of social awareness at the time. A few hot button issues would get attention, but generally, people still thought abuse had to ongoing, sever, physical abuse to be a problem.

***** I think she unintentionally implied that wizard logic and morals are vastly effected by the fact that they have magic and most of these things can be reversable.

For example:

Bludgers that can knock a wizard off a broom hundreds of feet in the air? We have charms that can catch them and keep them serious injury or can heal said injuries with potions.

Dementors guarding a school? Ministry controls them, they would never attack school children /sarcasm. Plus we have the patronus charm to control these things.

Stealing from Dragons as a 17 year old only trained by in what amounts to general education standards? Its fine, we have dragon handlers and can heal any injuries short of being eaten with potions.

Love potions? Its fine because there is antidote for it and doesn't create real love.

Child not showing signs of magic? Threaten to throw them out a window and see if accidental magic will save him by making him "Bounce". It'll be fine. We have skelegrow.

I think anything that can be reversed seems to be forgivable. I think that's why the unforgivables are... well unforgivable.

Killing curse can't be reversed short of a Deus Ex Machina. *Cough* Harry *Cough*

As far as i know, the Cruciatus can't be cured. Only time can let you recover from it.

And I think the Imperious can't really be reversed, only stopped.

**** While I don't completely disagree with you, close control of children who aren't treated well is a relatively recent development. At the time of Rowling own youth, corporal punishment was still widely used in Scottish or English schools in lesser or greater degree. Homelives weren't really checked up as much. I don't think she saw it as that abnormal to write, though exaggerated.

The dursleys abuse is also a lot more gruesome in most ff than in the books, which is mainly neglect and verbal abuse, more so from petunia than Vernon.

That Harry shows less effects than such a situation realistically would call for is because they Are children's books, and it's not an easy topic to write about. We're it written today, the situation would have been a lot different, I'd wager.

It wasn't the dark ages. The emotional neglect, fine, yes, those /were/ less enlightened times, but it was flat out illegal to keep him in a cupboard, and it would have been illegal to keep him in a downstairs bedroom at all. Bedrooms had to have ventilation and windows and, in a multi-storey dwelling, had to be upstairs.

Then, too, there was a duty to clothe the child in fitting, weather-appropriate clothing, which the school should have picked up on. Harry's ill-fitting hand-me-downs were an enormous red flag that should have caused social services to start looking into things.

Then he was often sporting bruises, and yes, teachers checked, or were supposed to, and to report to social services.

Then his broken glasses, if that was a normal thing, are another red flag for a neglected child in the 1980s.

On top of that, /Dudley/ should have received attention from social services too, for his rampant bullying and violence.

Vernon was clearly paying off /someone/.

Is this an American thing? Seems definitely false from a UK perspective - having grown up in the 90s myself, on several occasions I had a downstairs bedroom, as did a number of my friends. Hell, one of my friends at primary school even lived in the cupboard under the stairs - a nicely converted one, and roomier than Harry's is described, but nonetheless a cupboard. We all thought it was terribly exciting, like a secret den. Looking back, probably his parents just couldn't afford to move into a bigger house.

The real abuse isn't so much that Harry has a small, poorly ventilated living space with no natural light - lots of poor kids have to put up with that. The abuse is in the fact that there's a free bedroom upstairs.

They do. Vernon Dursley is racist and bigoted, he and Dudley are the Muggle version of Lucius and Draco.

Harry does not like the Dursleys, so unlike Dudley he is unlikely to agree with Vernon's views that come straight out the Daily Mail and Sun. Plus Dudley is a spoiled prat (thanks to his parents), so when he encounters Draco first in the shop and then again on the train, he is sceptical and does not exactly jump at the chance to be friends with Draco. He has heard all about "the right sort of people" from Vernon before.

If the Dursleys were a loving and doting influence on Harry that would completely change. He would be far more likely to dump Ron for Draco on the train and end up in Slytherin.

** Just because cruel (step)parents is a trope of the genre doesn't mean it doesn't happen all the time in real life. After all, it became a trope for a reason. There's nothing unrealistic in child abuse, unfortunately, even if the abusers are middle-class and obsessed with being "normal". As I said in a similar thread once, disbelieving that someone like the Dursleys can exist is just proving the Dursleys' point.

And children react to abuse and neglect in a very different way. Even in the books, we have plenty of kids from abusive background, and their reactions are very different. While Harry learned to be self-reliant, doesn't trust adults and has no self worth, Neville is timid, browbeaten by his grandmother and has no confidence whatsoever. Snape was an angry teenager with no social skills who fell with a bad crowd easily, and Sirius's response to his home situation is overconfidence, lager-than-life personality and rebellion against everything his family stand for. And we all know what lack of love and affection and Daddy issues did to Tom Riddle.

** I think the Dursleys's were definitely meant to be a comedic element. They're supposed to parody middle-class "Proper" stuck-up English culture, and they're obviously such a stark contrast to the wackiness that is so present in the wizarding world.

And of course Harry perseveres through their shitty treatment because while they are mean to be antagonistic towards him, I don't believe JKR was setting out to write any sort of definitive work about child abuse. Even the frying pan moment is--in my opinion--meant to be taken for laughs. You can look at it and say "what the hell, that's not funny." In real life, it's not. In the context of the story, I think it is just a moment that shows antagonism between Harry and his family. Harry being so blase about it is part of the joke.

The Dursleys's abuse level is something that can really put me off a fanfiction if it's done poorly. In this instance, I much prefer if authors try to emulate the spirit of what JKR was trying to do with the Dursleys rather than try and ground their abuse in reality, or worse, heighten their abuse. Things like raping Harry, or breaking Harry's bones, or dashing Harry's kittens against the concrete are just too far for me and way too edge-lord. It feels exploitative rather than sympathetic.

It's also true that if the Dursleys did what they did to a child who wasn't the Hero of a fantasy series, then it would really mess up that kid psychologically. But I like not having Harry damaged by the fallout, because his recovery from that is really something that could fill a whole novel by itself.

In the narrative Harry comes away unscathed. Is that because he's super resilient? Maybe. It's also just because JKR wasn't interested in writing a story about surviving and moving past abuse. She was writing a story where a kid with a shitty life gets to discover this awesome new world. I think focusing on the abuse wouldn't have improved Canon, because that's not what canon set out to do.

I'm sure there are fanfics that deal with Harry's abuse an its fallout expertly and with grace, but that sort of story wouldn't really be something I'd want to read tbh.

I agree. I think as a reader who reads original HP books umpteen number of times, things like Dursleys treatment , other things big and small, are just something you pick up, during the repeat reads.

** I had a conversation with an actual child psychologist on the Harry And Ginny Discord, asking if Harry is actually too well-adjusted and she said that kids are more resilient than you think. She said she's seen some kids go through some pretty awful things and a lot of them come out more okay than you'd think they would. But of course, Harry is a fictional person who bends to the whims of the writer.

** I can accept and move past /most/ of the Dursley's treatment. Making him do extra chores, giving him hand me downs etc. It's not nice or good, but nor is it pure evil and guaranteed to screw Harry up.

But having TWO spare bedrooms and putting him in a cupboard under the stairs, with a lock on the outside? That goes beyond treating him as an unwanted burden and begrudgingly giving him the bare necessities. That's pointless active abuse for its own sake. Similarly, Ms Figg has a line where she says (paraphrased) "sorry you didn't enjoy coming to mine, the Dursleys would never have let you come if you had". That indicates that the Dursleys didn't leave Harry with Ms Figg while they had nice days out just because they didn't want to be around him/spend extra money on him, but out of a specific and deliberate wish to cause him to suffer, even in a situation where it would cost them nothing for him to have a nice time.

It's the difference between not buying your kid a toy, and waiting till your kid finds a toy that was left behind at the park, and burning it in front of them.

** A sort of rationalization I like to make is that Lily's protection extended to more than just burning Voldemort, but it also sustained him during his time at the Dursley's, leading to him growing up to be a well-adjusted adult despite his mistreatment.

**** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). It's good, but very long! The start of the story is that Sirius broke out early, more or less by accident, and so instead of chasing after Peter, he came to check on Harry. And the Dursleys were more than happy to hand Harry over.

***** I'll give that a try. Interesting tidbit: I got into Fanfiction world because I was looking for different write-up than Canon, where Sirius survives beyond OOTP. Also looked for fan writing on how Harry would have grown up if Sirius had never been to Prison. Like I said in the original post, it's Sirius Character Portrayal that's sadder than Harry Potter.

***** Oh. So I meant "who treats a child.." as in I assumed that as a relative or a family , they would treat a Child at least, as a Human Being. Adoptions or fostering is done mostly by a Family member, as they don't prefer sending the Child to the orphanage, which is the only alternative. Hence my question about Foster care as I haven't included it in the equation.

** Not gonna lie, that is also part of the reason why i cannot like Dumbledore. He knew; at the very latest when Harry arrived at Hogwarts, probably earlier because he had spies around Harry his entire life. Still, he did not take Harry away from the Dursleys.

I simply cannot believe that the most powerful wizard in the world could not have found a different way to protect Harry, cancelling out Lily's Love Magic.

Harry should have never had to go back to the Dursleys after first year. That is honestly, unconcsciounable.
