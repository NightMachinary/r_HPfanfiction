Yes, I know; powerful magical battles aren't the main point of the HP series. Maybe I'm just tired of seeing the Potterverse seem so... weak, in comparison to other universes, when I know it has the potential to be greater (and not just in the power sense). Even so, I am disappointed by the lack of... creativity(?) by most wizarding folk in the Potterverse, besides Dumbledore and Voldemort.

After rewatching Infinity War and later seeing Avengers: Endgame, MCU magic is just so much more colourful and fantastical -- and GRANDER in scale. Potterverse magicals have the potential to be pretty powerful, but they are hindered by human-level durability and magical idiocy.

In the Potterverse, reasonably fit teenagers can dodge AK with relative ease -- someone with super reflexes will face no problem. Furthermore, most duels simply become lights shooting back-and-forth. The best fanfic contain epic duels between magicals, e.g. rapid-fire transfiguration on a large-scale; city-buster level destruction etc.

Sure, Harry and co. won't be THAT gifted with magic, but what about those that should? e.g. The professors. What do you think?


** I think that Magic is already powerfull enough. I mean, Fiendfyre can burn cities if uncontrolled, and considering Crabbe did it at 18, any semi serious Dark Wizard should be able to do it.

At the same time, I remember a fic pointing how "dangerous" magic could be, and that after 3rd year, any student inventive enough could easily cause mass destruction in the muggle world (like, transfigure a bearing wall into wood, and watch the building collapse).

Wizards in Harry Potter (at least powerfull ones) could already kill millions if they wanted to. But I believe that a important aspect of Harry Potter Magic is the control of it. For example (even if it's only in movies), you have an idiot like Crabbe completely destroy a magic room with a dark spell, killing himself in the process, while Voldemort uses the same but control it so it only attack his target with minimal collateral damages.

​

PS: And I don't think any reasonably fit teenager can dodge an AK easily. I really want to compare spells to gun for how fast they move. Most wizards seem to use spell (useless against his one), but I don't think you can dodge a spell "after" he is sent. Jump out of the way while the opponent cast it maybe (Avadra Kedavra is a pretty long incantation after all) but that's like you can "potentially" dodge bullet by watching the canon. And it's not like wizards are really fit (with the exception of the 4 Quidditchs team, so 28 students, maybe 35-40 with the replacements, what physical activities do student do?)

*** You know, that is a good point on dodging a spell. I never considered it before, but if we assume that spells move at the speed of light, it's even faster than bullets. I checked a few duel in the books and most spell description only shows as 'a jet of light'.

  [...] Snape cried: /‘Expelliarmus!'/ There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet [...]

  A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach [...]

  A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids [...]

  A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand [...]

  A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand [...]

  Jets of light flew from both wands [...]

**** If it were traveling at the speed of light, it wouldn't look like " a jet of silver light". The photons on the jet of silver light are moving at the speed of light and the viewer just sees it. It would seem more like things just happening as the words are said. Like maybe in the Snape example, if the red flash and Lockhart starting moving are simultaneous. Wizards might have different spell speeds and Snape's expelliarmus is something like light speed?

** Magic in the Harry Potter universe is exactly as strong as you want it to be. Magic itself was not really expanded on enough in the books, much of what it does is debatable and how it can be stopped is also debatable. Is there a reason that Dumbledore couldn't just point his wand at Voldemort and turn him into a duck? Barty Crouch Jr did not have a problem turning Draco into a ferret. You can assume there is some kind of defense, but what kind and why didn't Draco have it? This is how it goes with a lot of magic in the Potterverse. This is actually what makes it one of my favorite universes for crossovers, as the magic can be scaled to be useful and dangerous but not overpowered in practically any setting by just changing how you view it. If Harry showed up in the Marvel setting and got in a fight, is there something that would stop him from turning Iron Man's suit into dirt? Turning Thanos into a duck? Would a killing curse one shot Thanos? Would the people in this universe have any defense against an Imperious? While there are a lot of point and shoot spells that look easy to dodge in the movies, there are spells in the Potterverse that seem to be impossible to dodge, can you dodge an Imperious, transfiguration, summoning charm or legilimens? If you teleported directly next to someone and point blank Avada Kedavra'd them, would there be any possible response? Are Harry Potter wizards actually always squishy? It seems as there are potions and enchanted armor and such that might be able to fix that, but in fights where a Killing Curse can go straight through any defense and kill you in one shot what would be the point of super strength or skin that could tank bullets? There are charms that make things indestructible, but aren't really useful when the Killing Curse will ignore that spell as well. Would an indestructible shield block anything from the Marvel Universe? If you down Liquid Luck where does that luck really end? If you drank Liquid Luck and got into a fight would it make you able to hit fast targets with your Killing Curse due to luck? Would it make you able to Dodge people like the Hulk or Captain America through sheer luck? If you Polyjuice as a Super Human like Captain America, would you have his physical abilities? Would a basilisk one shot anyone in the setting on eye contact? If your in a universe without a phoenix is basilisk venom 100% fatal all the time?

I always explained much of the odd spell choices and moves in fights in the Harry Potter series as the result of both sides being technically just trained civilians with a few police officers that are out of their depth and the fact that their is no magical soldier equivalent, so no one really had the best idea of what they were doing. It was really a talented Professor with some armed students and civilians vs a talented serial killer with some home made terrorists rather than any real trained combatants.

** Just because we only see Dumbledore and Voldemort using 'powerful' magic in Potterverse doesn't mean that they are the only one that could do it. Remember that McGonagall also transfigure desks and statues to attack DE in the final battle.

Even without all the flashy magic involved, the most powerful magic in Potterverse is the mind control. Imperius curse is total mind control without any visible effect; it's really powerful if used correctly. A wizard could've imperio-ed a few important people and they can literally rule the world. Sure, you could argue that imperius curse wouldn't work on alien/orcs/demigods/etc on other fandom but since there's no proof and since that goblins are also vulnerable to the imperius curse we can assume that the curse works on all beings.

Honestly, I'm not surprised if Nicholas Flamel already control the Potterverse, at least the muggle world.

I'm always annoyed when a crossover or a mugglewank shows how 'weak' Potterverse magic and conveniently forget about the Imperius Curse.

*** I also have big problems with Mugglewank, especially the one saying Muggle would win in a war because, seriously :

No Muggle equipment can stop magic, so yeah soldier can be turned into animal, tanks become wood, hell even stupefix would knock soldier down, not mentionning Dark Art. Avada Kedavra kill, et if the wizard is lazy, fiendfyre the whole battlefield. (Also, it's discutable but in DH we see that Protego can block physical objects as bodies, and I see nothing in canon even hinting it can't black bullet.\\
Wizards also have Invisibility Cloack and silencing spells (even Muffiato would suffise to pass behind enemy lines). And wizards can teleport, So any adult wizards can beat even the deadliest muggle commandos with one item et 3 spells usually learnt during school year.

And all of this is in the case there is even a war because wizard can hide easily. Muggles pass in front of their settlement everyday without knowing, and they can litterally bend space with one wallet able to turn into a full base easily. I remember some people (mugglewanker) saying Muggles only had to bomb every "blank" zone on the map but :

1: We don't even know if there is any blank zone of the map. Muggles probably just can't see the zone and ignore it without realizing. And hidden islands like Azkaban would still be hidden.\\
2: Even if there was "blank zone", what will they do bomb everywhere? Blank zone can exist for several reasons and it would be fun for them to bomb absolutely everywhere just in case. Hell if I was a wizard I would just put some enchantments (wards in fanon) over some zone just to seem they destroy their own country over time. (And again, wizard can teleport so not really usefull).

So yeah I don't understand why people could even think Muggle had a chance against motivated wizards.

​

On another points (still in muggle wank), I hate it when people ask to "reform Hogwarts" because it's not safe or their curriculum is lacking or other things like that because :

- They are wizards. They don't know about Muggle science, they don't care about muggle science, they don't even need to care about muggle sciences. They don't use Victorian era stuff because they are retarded, they use it because thanks to magic Victorian Era stuff still works perfectly well efficiently enough for them. Also magic is about visualisation, they have no use about the table of elements because either it's something they can touch (like iron) et they can transfigure it (except gold), or it's some of the news elements we can barely synthetize and they can't so don't care.
- Hogwarts is not understaffed. Books made absolutely no mention of teacher having no time to deal with students, depending of size of Hogwarts it may seem strange but Magic. McGonagall did not ignore the Trio is PS because she was too busy, she ignored them because when 3 11years old kids come to you and say "We know the super secret item is a Philosopher stone, it's hidden in the forbidden corridor behind the cerberus and we think a teacher wants to steal it", you don't just obey to them (especially because I remind people, THEY WERE WRONG and snape was innocent). Also because in children book adult must be useless for children to save the day.
- It is a MAGICAL School. It may not be safe but we can't judge them with the standards of muggles. Considering that Harry losing all the bones in his arm only waranted one night in the infirmary, I guess they don't really care about physical injuries since they can't heal them so easily. In fact, I am convinced that student messing with magic and failling (like Hermione with the cat polynectar, or some gilr (Eloise Midgens?) trying to char her acne away, need more attention that Harry usual broken bones.

​

So yeah in conclusion, in Harry Potter universe, wizard are just superior to Muggles.

** No, definitely no. Wizards in HP are insanely powerful to the point that most crossovers have to give them massive nerfs to be in any way compelling. MCU is definitely among them. Harry, who is a talented wizard but not near the level of Dumledore/Voldemort, would be able to wipe the floor with nearly any threat.

The whole bit about dodging beams of light is mostly cinematic in nature, and mostly isn't true to canon. Much of the magic cast in the books doesn't have a visual effect, nor do we have any reason to think they have travel times.

Wizards in HP have local omnipotence varying by their talent. Even at Harry's level he'd likely face no threat from any non magical source. Magic in HP is genuine magic, not unexplained physics etc, but genuine supernatural phenomena that trumps the natural. A bullet, a fist, a bomb, none of these things can touch magic.

This is all before even considering instant transportation and mind magic, which only further broaden the power gap.

In MCU? Doubtful in a straight up fight. I just don't see how he wipes the floor in any fight against any Avengers or their villains bar a few. He definitely has the power, and he might win, but it won't be a clean sweep against any of them.

***** Having not seen Endgame yet, so no spoilers.

Ironman beats Harry handily. Like not even close. He has the power to take out Harry no sweat. And his speed makes Harry completely useless. Ironman is moving at and combating at supersonic speeds if not faster depending on the armor he is using. Harry is not hitting that. Harry would have to rely on AOE spells and there is no destructive AOE spell that isn't avoidable by Ironman in the suit.

Hulk, again moving at supersonic speeds and is ridiculously powerful. His durability is absolutely insane, at least Mountain class. I have not seen anything in HP that is Mountain class destruction in one hit. If we are talking about Harry deciding to straight AK Hulk, Harry would definitely need to get that first hit in otherwise he will be wrecked in seconds. Second, we don't even know if it would work because it's not like much is known about AKs and how it works against that level of power.

Harry would get like 1 spell off before Hulk closes the distance and gets smashed. Same with Ironman, Harry gets one shot against these guys before he will be absolutely destroyed. Ironman can even destroy Harry from a distance and is Harry skilled enough to stop Ironman's ranged attacks, doubtful.

Everything I said dealt with speed and the fact is HP universe is too slow to hit a majority of the people in MCU. None of that is magic vs. nonmagic, it's just straight combat ability which this entire post is about. If HP verse gets a speed boost than yea its easy, HP wipes the floor with MCU, but without that speed boost, it isn't going to happen.

I absolutely love the HP verse, but the fact is, without a speed boost, HP verse fails against a majority of the other verses. It isn't lacking in power, just speed.

Honestly I'm curious how you think Harry would "wipe the floor" with Ironman or Hulk when the speed differential is so great.

******** 'Protego', then nothing they do matters. You say I provide no basis for that, but my basis is canon. I can't speak to Thor or any of the others in Avengers, I don't like superhero movies/comics for basically the reason we're touching on here. The intersection of fantasy and sci-fi is messy and never makes sense. Which causes me to have problems suspending disbelief.

Harry Potter is a wizard when he flies he isn't reversing gravity, or ignoring it, or anything else. He's simply operating outside the realm of physics and natural law. Anything that operates within those bounds, for instance anything made by Ironman, doesn't pose a threat. You bring up the topic of speed or ambush, which is just a pitfall of who would win discussions that doesn't nothing except avoid the point. Harry Potter > Anything non magical.

Yet you had no problem blatantly saying Harry would "wipe the floor" with any Avengers. Choose another fantasy and it's really the same arguments. If you can't hit it, you aren't winning a fight.

Welp. If that is your stance, there's no arguing with you because you have blinders on. Nothing, absolutely nothing points to the contrary in canon. Are you seriously saying if Harry gets hit by a car, because it's made by man it doesn't pose a threat? That's insane and I cannot argue against that because you that's just choosing to have your blinders on for HP verse > all.

Look I'm pretty sure we agree HP verse is a very powerful verse, but again, if you cannot hit something, you aren't winning a fight. That's the main argument that you seem to be avoiding. It doesn't avoid the point you're trying to make at all, that HP verse is powerful, and it is absolutely not a pitfall of "who would win." IF you decide to nullify speed and make that a condition on "who would win" I would agree, but that is different than a "full powered up, who would win" which is the apparent premises for this post.

I never brought up ambush. In an ambush fight, Harry would win, magic is too versatile for the most part. Only a handful would probably be able to get out of the ambush.

** Wizards are much more durable than typical humans. For instance, a wizard getting hit by a cannonball (i.e. a bludger) will end up with a bruise, concussion, or maybe a broken limb. A muggle who is hit by a cannonball would be lucky if they lose an arm, but would probably die.

Assuming it's a straight fight, the power is definitely there, being able to hit your target though is going to be a problem.

In a non-straight fight, it probably doesn't matter because of how versatile magic is which makes fighting from the shadows much easier.

Yes . . . how is that even a question. Do you not expect people in other verses to dodge fire or water?? HP-verse is one of the slower fantasy verses and appears to be limited to real life reaction time if slightly above. Nothing shows that they are going superhuman reaction time.

There are clearly limitations otherwise people would be ridiculously easy to kill. e.g. Turn the air Voldemort is breathing into toxic gas, yet doesn't happen.

Again, other verses have beyond super human reaction time. They can deal, especially because it wouldn't be anything different than fighting multiple opponents, which isn't a huge thing to do in a variety of other verses.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There is definitely a limitation to that otherwise you would have seen much more of it in canon.

#+begin_quote
  There are a ton of ways to deal with people trying to dodge.

Sure, but it requires reacting to them to counter. There is no way to stop all methods of dodging, you just have to be able to react in a straight fight. If you can even see someone move/dodge, how do you beat that if they definitely have the power to put you down.

It's not about power in a HP-verse vs. any other universe. HP has power in spades, and to spare. It's all about speed and HP-verse is sorely lacking.

** No, the fights and action arent weak because of the source material. HP Magic is actually one of the most OP, visually appealing, and unbalanced magical systems in all of fiction. The action is dull because the writers of both the movies and the books dont know how to properly use their own sources. Fanfiction, regardless of the level of quality, is most often above the source material in terms of how it portrays combat.

If anything, canon magic should be increasingly debuffed to a more manageable level.

** There are a lot of arguments in here regarding the power level of wizards and witches, all of them pointing out how high it is. And i agree, using the little we know about the limitations of HP magic, wizards can have a major impact in everything.

​

The problem, however, is that they don't. If a teenager, in his last school years, can command enough power to cause destruction then why is it that we don't see that kind of effect? Take the death eaters for example; if someone like Crabbe can learn Fiendfyre then why is it that death eaters aren't using it? They proclaim themselves muggle haters and blindly attack London ( *Millennium Bridge* ) and show willingness to kill wizards and witches (blood traitors) then why don't they just unleash Fiendfyre upon a village.

​

It would surely spread chaos and kill thousands of muggles.

​

If the Hogwarts bunch was able to defend it self during the battle for hogwarts then why is it that a whole nation cannot organise itself against a single foe?

​

It would only take one respected veteran from the Grindelwald era (that's willing to fight no matter what the cost) to organise everything, why isn't that a thing?

​

TL;DR : If wizards and witches have the great potential that cannon gives them then why do we not see it (in cannon)?
