Every once in a while I am free. Unchained. Free to spend my hours as I wish. Want to go play a game with my mates? Go for it. Be productive around the house? Uhhh that's a maybe. I spend weeks like this.

Then I see a post from this subreddit on my Home feed, and i'm dragged back into reading fan fiction. I am now unavailable for pretty much anything but basic human functions for the next 48h as I binge what looks like a really good fic.


** I read fanfiction two ways: when I'm supposed to be sleeping, or I use fanficfare to make big anthologies of longfics and listen to them while running/doing dishes/driving etc with Google play books.

**** Yup

[[https://ibb.co/DMbh4p8]]

I highly recommend ~tripling the speed of the voice for this.

There are a few downsides; the voice is optimized for Google maps so "Dr. Granger" is always pronounced "Drive Granger", for instance, and if authors do <><><><><><> to separate sections it reads out "less than greater than" over and over which is obnoxious but overall I quite like it. I actually used it for my last reread of the series proper even though I own the audiobooks because it's nice to be able to pause and copy out quotes.

*** I download mine into Calibre with Fanficfare, you can make custom categories and tags there. Bonus is that I can then read on my ereader instead of a normal screen (and realize just how much time I'm about to 'waste' when it tells me a fic has like 1500 pages). And you have a backup if the original is deleted or ffn is down.
