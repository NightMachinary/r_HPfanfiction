Core threads is in my opinion an ok fic

But the weird ass humor somehow managed to make me laugh for 15 minutes each time i saw it

One scene they were asking Dumbledore questions and this is how it basically went

Mcgonagall: please Albus you need to tell us something

Dumbledore smiled and gave her another orange

That is only one example of how weird the humor is Harry's mind has ninja vampire duck soldiers in it

It can only really be explained if you actually read some chapters where Harry has made it into Hogwarts already so like until chapter 15

So similar humor as in linkffn(core threads)
