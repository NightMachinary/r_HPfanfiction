** Is your request inspired by a very potter sequel? If not, than I highly recommend it.

**** It's a fan made musical made by StarKid that starts with "a very potter musical" and has 2 more parts, the one I mentioned being the 2nd one.

It is hilarious, entertaining, at times sad. The first part maybe a bit hard to watch(low quality video, simple decorations etc), but it's still a very well done play.

You can watch all of it(and other StarKid productions) for free on YouTube.
