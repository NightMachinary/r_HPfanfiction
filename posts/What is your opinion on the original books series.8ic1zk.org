** Let me just state the obvious for you with apologies for being curt... if we didn't like it, we wouldn't be here.

She could've handled the kids differently. She could've made the adults in their lives more competent, she could've fleshed out a few characters... but she did a good job for the most part.

** I'm sure there are plenty of things about the books people wish were done differently, and that opinion varies from person to person. I think all of us on this subreddit can definitely say, however, that we fell in love with the world JK Rowling built and the magic she created. Fanfiction, especially the most popular fanfiction on [[https://FFN.net][FFN.net]], likes to point all the perceived holes in Rowling's story and exacerbate them. I still enjoy the world Rowling gave us, but I can see more of the loopholes the Harry Potter series had. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the any book series will have loopholes in it and flaws that can be exploited and magnified. In fact, the flaws of the Harry Potter books likely work in its favour--so many fanfic authors love to write those Fix-It fics and/or manipulative Dumbledore fics. If HP went down perfectly and without any loopholes, we'd be sorely deprived of half the HP fanfic out there.

Basically, I'm of the opinion that in the end, canon is canon. I respect how JK Rowling wrote canon, and I won't debate on the 'best and worst things' about it because it's Rowling's story. She wrote it how she wanted it. Fanfic can twist what she wrote and flip events around to their whims, but canon, for all the good and the bad, is the world Rowling gave us. If it was written differently, we might not have such a dynamic fandom.

** JKR's writing and creativity are superb, but her world building is severely lacking, and plot of the last two Books is awful.

HP basically ended up as a war story, but she obviously had no idea how wars should be fought, so we got a horrible amount of Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, the usual lucky hero trope, and villains suddenly becoming stupid in the last book.

** I like the books immensely. I grew up with Harry. I reread them yearly. Umbridge still manages to make my skin crawl every time.

** There are some faults with the books, including several big ones, but it doesn't really matter. They're always going to have a place in my heart.

I still remember getting the first four. I'd been out drinking in central London on a Friday night with a couple of friends and got back to find an Amazon delivery containing the first four books. I decided to read the first couple of chapters before bed... and ended up reading all four, twice, back to back over the course of the next couple of days. I simply passed out on the bed when I was too tired to read more, ordered takeaways or made toast when I needed food and forewent personal hygiene because I was absolutely hooked.

After that, I devoured each of the next three books as soon as they came out, and discussed them furiously with my friends and colleagues. To the extent that I arranged with a colleague that she'd call me at 7am on the morning after the last book came out so we could discuss it (we both bought it at midnight).

And then I discovered fanfiction. It was ff that made me realise the original books weren't perfect but that doesn't matter. They inspired me, they inspired tens of thousands of others, and what more could any author want from their books?

** I like them as childrens books. I read them to my nephews and nieces and little cousins. I take them more seriously then they deserved to be and debate every word with said little ones.

However, they are childrens books. Well written ones but they are what they are. Thus they are what you make of them and so when I make them bad they are and when I make them good they are but they, to me, never become more than they are made to me. It is for this reason that I so enjoy the surrounding community and fandom as every person has their own version of the story.

** I love the books and there is very little I would change, probably reflected by the fact that I write canon compliant stories. But I would think even people that write very AU fics would would love the books, or they would be reading and writing something else??

** I liked the series, but the sheer variety on fanfiction made me dislike canon. The number of really well characterised Harrys in fanfiction is really cool.

I loved canon until 6th book. The plot was just so weak at that point i never got past it.

** I love them. Sure there are aspects that aren't my favourite now but I'll never forget the experience of waiting for every book to release and not letting it go until I was done.

Changing things is what fanfiction is for, but if I had to scrap something it would probably be the epilogue.

** books 1 and 2 are fundamentally different from books 3 to 7; In the first two books the heroes comprehensively and unequivocally win at the end. In the later books the heroes generally lose or at best score a pyrrhic victory. I like the first 2 books and don't much care for the last 5. Kinda why I'm here, searching for an alternative.

*** I think that after the second books Harry should have changed. The whole experience with Tom, near death and the school ridicule should mature him (if the Dursleys aren't enough) After that he should have been lees Gryffinsorish in my opinion. That why I would never change the first 2 books.

** The originals are incredible. I wouldn't have her change a thing.

That said, what I really love are fics that take different directions. I love seeing how writers interpret things differently, I love AUs with weird premises, exploring impossibilities or alternate personalities or how-it-might-have-beens.

(I probably love the originals now /more/ because of how much fandom they've created; before I found fanfictions, HP was just one good series among many. Now it's one of my primary fandoms, because of the beautiful, creative community that has sprung up around it.)

EDIT: Aaaaand, I'm off on a tangent. To answer the actual question. . .

Best things about the originals: The sheer creativity and beauty of the story's world, characters, etc. The chapter 'The Prince's Tale'.

Worst thing about the originals: Harry's prejudiced view meant Slytherin had a very poor showing. And I never really liked the way Quirrell's possession worked in Book 1, it was weird and kinda inconsistent with most magic.

But, that's what fanfiction is for. To explore alternate perspectives, alternate possibilities. I love it.

** Loved the first three, thought they were really good children's books.

Didn't love book 4. There were just too many things that dragged me out of the story. But all in all I enjoyed the story, just not the writing. It's the book that I think the 'writing a world known series' got to Rowlings head and she bit over more than she could chew. She went from an efficient and clear language into something else. It's also where the wizarding world grew too big for her, the world building is lacking and there's a lot of (horrifying) implications from little things she wrote that I don't think she completely grasped. It got worse in book 5 where I also got sick and tired of snogging.

Book 5 I didn't even finish. Skipped a good 50 pages and then read almost to the end, but DNFed at the last chapter.

Have read parts of book 7, just enough to know I didn't like it. Did not read the rest of the series.

But between book 4 and 5 I discovered fanfiction. And the great authors here have kept my interest in the Potterverse alive.

** She made a very fun setting and fun characters, but many smaller decisions are criminally stupid.

She also doesn't treat the characters as actual people with goals and ideas, she just Deus Ex Machinas her way through the story.
