So, I admit I'm looking for some worldbuilding inspiration here - though I'm also just looking for things to start googling in order to find new non-fiction textbooks to read (so any recommendations you have would be much appreciated too!).

Mainly though, I'm hoping that people might share some myths, legends, or other folklore they know about that they might want to see in a fic or just know about and want to share. Anything at all, modern, recent, classical, ancient, big, small, gods, beasts, creatures, men, other races, magic, curses - whatever you've got, I would very much like to hear about it.

eg. Mike the Headless Chicken, Persephone and the Pomegranates (weirdest band name ever, btw), that time Thor and Loki tried to cross a river made of a giant's menstrual blood, the trickster tales of Wakjakaga, the battle of Moytura, the Cleverman and the Dreamtime, vanishing hitchhikers, and that time a Navajo kid got told off for masturbating by an Owl and started the whole 'lust for sex' thing in society.

When I say anything, I mean anything. :D


** Ok, so in the US we have the lost colony of Roanoke.

I would love to see that, but a wizarding settlement in the UK is abandoned with no explanation. Maybe its only noticed because the floo connection doesn't work and the owls are unable to deliver letters. Someone apparates out to visit their relative and finds the whole town empty with no clues. A post war auror fic would be fun.

*** Ah, Roanoke. Virginia Dare was born there - first English kid born in the English colonies out there.

Have you see a movie called The Vanishing on Seventh Street? It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was fun enough in places and it did look at the whole Croatoan thing.

But that could definitely be fun, yeah. I like the idea of that sort of investigation.

** I've read one story in which Harry runs across the Jersey Devil, but I haven't seen any that involve the Wendigo.

There's another native American legend that involves the council of animals deciding to get rid of mankind because men are so rapacious. The dog defends man, but is told that by himself, he's not enough to save mankind. The only other animal that votes with the dog is the mosquito. It might be interesting to have some of Luna's beasts involved in something similar.

Poor Narfi no one remember loki's kid with sigyn) I'm talking about Baldr and Frigga's protection spell and similarities to Harry and lily.

But yeah.... How about the sun goddess Amaterasu was lured out with naked dancing. A strip tease from goddess of wine. Where Susanoo ended up roaming earth until she forgives him.

Or Sun Wukong being generally a hyper murder monkey or journey of the West.

A white snake when killed and eaten gave knowledge of all languages (even animals). Or the white snake that married some guy then proceeded to try and find cure for his illness(death)

That a rabbit makes pills of immortality

The dragon king ( nehza ends up accidentally destroying his palace) goes to report to the jade emperor his palace was destroyed and his son was murdered by a kid but then gets beaten up made to promise not to report. Then a monkey ends up stealing a pillar plug causing typhoon storm and flood all over the world. (poor western sea dragon king )

*** Amen. Though that's more my distaste for Marvel-type Superheroes and Plotlines than anything to do with those sorts of fics. If you're going to take a modern media adaptation of Norse Mythologies, I'd like to see a Hellblade or God of War-type view. Have you played/seen God of War (I don't want to spoiler you if you haven't)?

Heh. Harry gets adopted by the Monkey King and they have modernised Monkey-King-esque Adventures? That's a fic I'd read the heck out of. I still remember the first time I saw that in Secondary School.

Heh. I'd like to see some Jianshi, yeah. That could be so fun, a Vampire fic that avoids the Dracula-clone tendencies. On the subject of Japanese spirits-inhabiting-things-that-hop, how about the Kasa-obake?

Kasa-obake (Japanese: 傘おばけ) are a mythical ghost or yōkai in Japanese folklore. They are sometimes, but not always, considered a tsukumogami that old umbrellas turn into. They are also called "karakasa-obake" (から傘おばけ), "kasa-bake" (傘化け), and "karakasa kozō" (唐傘小僧).

**** I've seen God of War (youtube playthrough) and kind of wished a more mystical Norse fic and less superheroes-esque fics. Not to bash superhero plotting, but I'd prefer stories like that one HP dead fic where Harry met Ódinn and made a deal with him which ended with Harry digging out his eyes and drop it in mimir's well to drink knowledge.

I kinda thought it will be incredibly out of place a Jianshi or Asian myth based creatures but a part of me want to see how difference in attitude with magic it will bring. Not only is it a different system of magic but it brings everyone out of their depths.

As for Monkey king, well... I can just imagine Harry either being like Xuanzang or ended up being like Sun Wukong and embrace his chaotic side if he was raised by Wukong. I can just imagine Harry giving the ministry or deatheaters the same degree of headache Wukong gave the jade emperor.

***** Ah, okay. Cool. Well, I was going to say that it'd be interesting if Harry turned out like Baldur with his "I feel nothing!" angst..

If you haven't read Druid of Holly and Yew, you'd maybe enjoy it. It's got a similar... bloody approach to the classics, though it's more Celtic Druidism than Nordic. Do you have the link to that dead fic?

Eh. Public transport is a thing. Harry could go to Asia for something, or one of them could come to England. It'd be possible to make plausible. And definitely a different system. Integrating multiple types of magic does seem to be difficult in many fics, but if it's done right the 'fish out of water' conflict can be quite fun. A Spirited-Away-esque fic would be interesting, especially if it took a Little Nightmares kind of tone to it.

Would you prefer a modernised version of the original Monkey King stories, or have Harry and he meet after the stories conclude and then move into the Harry Potter plotline?

****** I do like the I can't feel anything Baldur angst that Harry can end up with. I just referenced the brutal fic since it's the only one I could think of that isn't Marvel inspired Norse. I checked the dead fic but it seemed to be taken down already. I'll be checking the celtic inspired fic, I just tend to think celtic is just about the fae or Tuatha Dé Danann but apparently I was mistaken.

A modernized version of Monkey king may be interesting but that's just me wanting to read about monkey king wrecking havoc in modern times. But a part of me wants to see what if Harry is a reincarnation of Xuanzang or monkey king and had to deal with something else on top of the Voldemort issue or even Just monkey king hanging around Harry for whatever reaaon. Either way, I'd read a fic with the money king in it.

******* Fair. Maybe the Wayback Machine has it.

Heh. No, no. Celtic is an umbrella term, really. Can refer to a lot of old tribes of western Europe (eg. the Gauls of Asterix and Obelix fame), the Gaelic nations (Ireland, Scotland, etc), or a whole bunch more depending on which view you take of it. That fic is particularly more British Celtic.

Oh, I meant the stories directly modernised. Like that Romeo and Juliet movie with Leo DiCaprio which had the Capulets and Montagues as gangs in the modern world. So, maybe the Modern Monkey King is disenfranchised and ends up working as a Bodyguard/Bouncer for someone, or he breaks into a modernised 'Kingdom of Heaven' (with filing cabinets and business suits) to find the Reptilia Don't Fear The Reaper Challenge Harry getting ready to be sent back and volunteers to go with him in trade for something. That kind of thing.
