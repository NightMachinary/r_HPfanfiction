Anyone who has author alerts for The Divine Comedian already knows this, of course, but I finally got around to reading it 10 days after it was posted. It's a 12,000-word one-shot that is just as good as the five-out-of-five-stars "Blackpool," and I wanted to recommend it.

  Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.
