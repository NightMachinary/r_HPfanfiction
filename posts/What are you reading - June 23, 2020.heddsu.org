** Just stumbled on the most interesting fic I have read in a while. I like time travel, but I am so sick of Harry or Hermione going back in time. This time Voldemort gets his shot and decides to raise himself. The best thing about it is that Voldemort and Tom Riddle are very much in character as they navigate complicated/tense interactions. It's a very solid read and the author is actively engaging in the comment section, which is always something I like. I'm not sure how to post a link here, but I'll do my best.

** I've been slogging my way through A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool because it keeps coming up and I wanted to see what the fuss is about. linkffn(8045114)

I have no idea what the fuss is about. There's a tiny amount of story in there but it's buried under mounds and mounds of dialogue. It's chapter 7 before Harry even makes an appearance and now I'm on something like chapter 30 and he still hasn't gone back to school. Slow-burn is one thing but this is ridiculous.

There doesn't appear to be any meaningful conflict. There's been a bit of bashing here and there but beyond that Harry is allied with about half the wizards in Britain and has most of the rest neutered. It looks like another 50+ chapters of slogging through dialogue before his eventual unavoidable win.

Can anybody tell me why this story is regarded so highly?

*** I haven't read much of it. For Sirius raising Harry, my go-to story is Innocent, by Marauderlover7. No character bashing, no secret Black family magic, just a powerful narrative of Sirius doing his flawed but sincere best to look after his best friend's son (from age eight), and Harry getting an actual childhood.

There's also The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox. The first book is an excellent Sirius-raising-Harry, then the second is pretty standard Harry-at-Hogwarts and finally the third is a pretty standard Harry-at-war, with an ending I particularly dislike. But the first is worth it alone.

****** YMMV but I thought it threw away a lot of the character development that had occurred over the course of the three books. Now I get that Harry has changed because of the war but he seems to have forgotten almost everything that made him who he was, and I don't much like what we end up with.

I know not every story ends with "And they all lived happily ever after", and nor would I want them to, but the ending to the third books seems to be nasty for the sake of it.

But as I say, others will probably disagree.

** linkffn(13041698) What's Her Name In Hufflepuff. My new favorite SI fic. It avoids falling into the trap many SI/time travel fics have, where they use future knowledge to go through the stations of canon more quickly (and in an easier and more boring way)--it's more of a fluff/slice of life fic.

** I just discovered the best fic I've ever read. In the last four hours I haven't put down The Secret Language Of Plants by Endrina, a three part series.

I'm not usually a fan of AU, but the writing is amazing. Humor, tragedy, insight, a few tasteful sex scenes. Amazing plot and memorable characters. Can't recommend this enough.

Even though it's set in an AU, I love all the subtle nods to the books. Like the twins' shop also sells magically protective gear after Voldemort returns, and while testing some new hats, almost cut George's ear off.

** Just finished linkffn(Certain Dark Things by eirajenson) and I have got to say I was impressed. It's a femharry story which I seldom read but I decided to give it a go and I generally like where the story is gong. It is a Slytherin Harriet story though she still is a Gryffindor at heart. Plus love the authors OC, daughter of Sirius black completing a new trio consisting of Hermione Harriet and the OC Elara Black all in Slytherin. It's very original in the way it deals with the “death” of Voldemort and post-war Britain. Definitely worth the read.

** I just finished linkffn(13365454) casting shadows by wakefan. One of the best if not THE best world buildings in a fic I have ever seen. It is centered on post hogwarts harry (best written powerhouse MC I have read in a long time), and I really don't want to spoil anymore.

It came as a total surprise, and it has become a permanent part on my top10 fics.

The author is currently writing a prequel (really needed, cause this fic has a "really expanded magic system"), and updating frequently.

After finishing the prequel (I would say it is around 70% completed), he/she said it will immediately start posting the sequel to casting shadows Really. 160k+ words and it seems to be just the start (read the fic to know more). Haven't been this hyped for an author in a LONG time.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** Linkffn(Crawlersout)

Loving the worldbuilding of MACUSA (although it's not referenced as such) and the Wolcroft Magic school that Tom attends. Interesting electives and the student body is very diversified between pure blood dynasties such as Washy, the great-something son of GW himself, and Margaret, a No-Maj born whose father is president of General Motors and mother is a “moving picture star”. Grindelwald is also intensely interesting here and I can't wait for more updates, while it's been a bit since it has been updated, there is no indication that the fic is abandoned or on hiatus. The fic also has generated fanfics of its own, and those are also delightful to read. There is a definite humor to a lot of the interactions and in general it's a very heartwarming fic for those interested in brightening up their day.

** I've been loving *Full Circle* by *tetsurashian.* It's brilliantly funny. I never thought I would enjoy a Harry/Tom Riddle fic, because I thought Voldemort is far too evil to be redeemed, even by such a loving soul as Harry. This fic changed my mind. Harry and Tom are soul bound to be reincarnated together over and over (like over 100 times). Quite often they live as muggles. This fic includes plenty of flashbacks to their previous lives but mainly focuses on when Harry and Tom back in the GoF timeline. If you want someting warm, very romantic and very absurd I earnestly recommend it. There is also a very naturally unravelling drama, making it less crackficy.

** I'm reading linkffn(Faery Heroes) (M rated). Post-war time travel back to GoF from an alternate timeline where Voldemort had an extra Horcrux and returned for a third war which he won. I'm enjoying it more than most of the other Peggy Sue fics I've read. The author definitely gets Luna, which is really rare and very fun to read. It's also a multi relationship that doesn't rely on "you're Lord Harry Potter/Black and have to marry 2 women" which is refreshing.

** Just tried out linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) since I've seen it recommended a bunch of times. The start of it is fairly straightforward - Harriet Potter (going by Rigel Black) being sorted into Slytherin and befriending Draco and Pansy - though decently executed. It gets really interesting, though, towards the end of the year, with what felt like a (large) twist on the Basilisk attacks. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.

Edit: I'm partway through book 4 now, and I must say I'm dreading catching up with the author; it looks like chapters are only released infrequently (not surprising when they're all HUGE), although one came out this month, so it's clearly still active.

** Right now I'm rereading The Life and Times by Jewel5. linkffn(5200789). I'd caught up to all my in-progress fics and so I tend to wait a week or so to let several fics update and go back and read something else.

The Life and Times is good. I like most of the characterizations, especially with Lily's roommates. I really don't like Carlotta Meloni, however. She's a terrible person. The whole episode at the Ministry towards the end of the fic isn't as good as the rest of it in my opinion, but I still enjoy the story.

Been looking for more quality HP fics featuring trans characters (that don't involve Severus Snape romantic pairings).

*** Chiming in to say: linkffn(13001792) All According to Plan is the first in the series.

I'm also in the midst of enjoying its frequent updates. The writing style rambles and occasionally dips into paragraphs of world-building minutia and unnecessary internal monologue. It made it a little difficult to binge, but as a serial it's easy to digest, and it shows how much thought has gone into the world and characters.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

******* I read that recently, and the prose quality is excellent. The writer clearly knows how to craft words. I personally wasn't a fan of the amount of coarse language; YMMV. And I really liked how it handled the consequences of the Shrieking Shack incident.

On the whole, though, I liked The Peace Not Promised better. It puts a bit less emphasis on Severus' misanthropy (though it's still very much in effect) and a bit more on his devotion to Lily, especially since he didn't just mysteriously land in the past; he was offered the chance, and took it in hopes of saving her. So although he's hyper-aware of his faults, he doesn't push her away and keep her at arm's length. Watching their relationship grow and his heart slowly open is a big part of the story and sweet to see.

Also, he collaborates with Dumbledore from the start, which is quite an interesting subplot. They know about Horcruxes and so they have the chance to end the war a generation earlier, but Severus never knew where they all were, and some of them aren't yet in their canon positions. Still, the knowledge Severus brings regarding the events of the war is a powerful tool in the hands of someone like Dumbledore.

(The Peace Not Promised is also more than three times the length, so it has more time to explore things and develop their relationship slowly, although it might be a bit /too/ long for some. And it's not complete, but it's actively updating and probably fairly close to the end.)

** Been reading crossover fics mainly so, but I'll give a list

Title: Evil Be Thou My Good Rating: I have no idea, I don't really pay attention to these things, but I'd guess M? It's pretty dark and has some explicit gore scenes Link: Linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) The whole thing is amazing. I started out with anticipation, progressed to curiosity, then to horror, the confusion, to anticipation, to horror again, and when the end came I both wanted to never think of it again and beg for more

Title: Five Nights with Harry Rating: again, no idea. Link: linkffn(Five Nights with Harry) Sadly, the thing seems to be abandoned. But it has suspense, romantic subplots, fluff, and so much more. It's well written, but the author seems to have simply disappeared for now.

Title: Creepy Potter Rating: you know the drill. This one doesn't have much gore but it's got murderous Harry so. Also gay Link: linkao3(Creepy Potter by Piff) This fic is amazing. It's currently left off right after third year but the last chapter was posted recently so I expect more soon. It's got minor smut hints but not to much explicit stuff, mostly discussions. It's got brotherly bonds and Hufflepuff Harry, but Harry's also a murderous psychopath so,

I'll put more later.

** On a slexenskee kick it seems, because after crawlersout i picked up the writer's other Fem!Harry/Tom Riddle fic

Linkao3(Grandloves by Slexenskee)

Really a dark romance that has some elements and tropes that can come off cliched at times but the writing is fabulous, it reads like water from a faucet gushes. Not as creative Crawlersout but more poetic and explorative of a romantic relationship and its consequences. The fic was just updated 5 years after its last update during April which makes me excited and hopeful for more content from this great author with my favorite pairing.
