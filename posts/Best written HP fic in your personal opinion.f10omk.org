** Harry Potter and the Prince of SLytherin

linkffn(11191235)

The author is a monster at foreshadowing. Some plot twists had my mouth hanging open after I'd connected the dots and realised it had been hinted for like the last twenty/thirty chapters and I was too stupid to see it or didn't have all the clues. The kind of things that make you go "The fuck? That doesn't make any sense" and then you're like "Oh. OOOOOH. OOOOOOOOH. He's a fucking genius."

And then there's the excellent worldbuilding which gets rid of most of the canon story's plot holes or the character growth where you really see them change. Ron, Jim, The Twins, Hermione, Ginny, Harry, etc... from their first appearance are completely different from the ones now.

You just HAVE to read it. You can't miss on the Prince of Slytherin experience.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Either way, her writing style is the most professional feeling to me - she writes a lot more patiently after the first few chapters of The Changeling and actually lets characters develop.

** By far [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]] (no idea how to link properly).

Most fanfics are easy to read, fun while they last but easily forgotten and dont have any lasting impact. They are like the popcorn of literature.

This one was actually thrilling and exciting to read. It felt like a proper novel. The writing was great, there was a thought out plot (although its confusing at the start) and there was actually a proper ending.

So because of that i would say that in my opinion Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time is probably the best fanfic.

Second place is probably Prince of Slytherin, but because the start and the first 12 chapters or so are simply terrible it doesnt measure up (it gets properly good from the second year onwards thougj).

** [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. No matter what you think of the story, the characters, or the main idea, you have to admit that it's superbly written and planned.

One of my favourites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/][Birds of a Feather]] by babylonsheep. The author has clearly put much effort to creating the right tone and atmosphere of the 1930s and 40s.

**** HPMOR, superbly written and planned? You've got to be kidding. The characters are either super-intelligent clones or unimportant. The story deviates very early from its stated goal (brining "rationality" to Harry Potter). It goes on for ages with no structure.

No, it's not superbly written, or even well written. The fact that you feel it necessary to say "no matter what you think of the characters" is proof enough - you can't have a well written story with poorly written characters.

***** The OP made it clear that this isn't about whether you enjoyed it. You can feel free to dislike HJPEV; that's very understandable. It's still a long, complex story full of foreshadowing, shout-outs to other media, humor, thought-provoking discussions/arguments, and clever exploitation of rules. It has very few typographical errors, and no coarse language above PG level.

All of the above puts the writing quality well above the average on fanfiction.net, even if you detest the story. Just the fact that it's over 600k words and complete puts it above average. (And people are allowed to like different things.)

The structure is "this is the events of Harry's school year." Granted that they don't all have equal relevance to the final climax, but not all stories have to be tightly focused like that. Some of the great classics take time to meander (and let's not forget Harry Potter and the Deathly Boring Camping Trip). It's also worth remembering that it was originally published serially, so it's normal for it to have relatively self-contained and independent sub-plots.

"I hate this character" is a very different thing from "This character is poorly written." Practically everyone hates Dolores Umbridge, yes? But she wasn't a failure on JKR's part; she achieved exactly what she was meant to. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is meant to be a clever but self-righteous, abrasive, and annoying little flawed prodigy who is so bent on saving the world that he's in grave danger of burning it down. If you hate him, then hate him; that doesn't mean he was written badly.
