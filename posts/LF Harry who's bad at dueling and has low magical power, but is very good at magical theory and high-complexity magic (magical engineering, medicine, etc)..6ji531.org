See title. Basically I'm hoping for a Harry whose 'power he knows not' is being inexplicably adept at dispelling unbreakable curses, curing the incurable, reverse-engineering every spell he sees, et-cetera.

Specifically, I'm looking for a Harry who's NOT good at dueling Voldemort head-on and instead uses his talents to make it possible for everyone else to fight Voldemort.


** linkffn(Almost a Squib) has a Harry that's, well, almost a squib. He has very little magical power, but still fights Voldemort using his ingenuity.

That said, it's a bit of a humor-fic too (it's written by the writer of Harry the Hufflepuff), but it's a nice quick read.

Depends on the work. Some (I can't think of any fanfics off the top of my head except maybe Prince of Slytherin) do restrict Magic and give it explicit rules.

[[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's Laws of Magic]] talks about this a bit, where some works have magic with few rules used to create a sense of wonder (like the Lord of the Rings or Magical Realism), and others have magic super well defined (like Mistborn or Fullmetal Alchemist).

True, POS did do this, but not well, and not in a way that made Magic feel magical. I remember distinctly feeling annoyed when he went through Harry using a summoning charm through an extremely precise series of movements.

Giving Magic some kind of groundwork isn't a bad thing. But when you hit JK Rowling's limitations, Magic just doesn't follow its own rules, which is the worst thing you can do once you've created rules. For example, Rowling says that Magic has power over the mundane, but not the Magical, yet we see characters manipulating spells all of the time, we see works of Magic directly destroy others, etc... Heck, if what she said was true, Curse-Breakers wouldn't have a job, as any enchantments placed on an object couldn't be taken off.

Though, this doesn't mean that Magic should go willy nilly and nobody has to speak incantation/do somatic movements. But that should be just about the only rule, applying 'muggle' rationalism to Magic is just about the worst thing most authors do.

***** I torally agree on JK breaking her own rules.

One of my least favorite part of Rowling's universe is how vague/undefined magic is. It felt like, the amount that characters relied on magic, it should've been much better explained.

A good example imo is Harry surviving when he was 1 year old. It was such a huge part of the plot that wasn't really explained. I would've liked if there was some specific list of rules that triggered to protect Harry, and that these rules had a consistent effect that could be used in other situations in the future.

Because once u have this u ccan have characters begin to incorporate this in their plans and strategies.

A lot of the reason why I dislike the series post-GoF stems from this.
