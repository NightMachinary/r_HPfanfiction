Check it out if you can. Originally titled Fantastic Breasts and Where To Find Them, but the title was already used by a slam poem, so I present: Newt Scamander and the Bronxvitch School of Witchcraft. R Rated. x, Sandy [[http://www.wattpad.com/story/35469073-newt-scamander-and-the-bronxvitch-school-of]]

UPDATE: I've started putting it on FFnet too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11143366/1/Fantastic-Breasts-Where-To-Find-Them]]


** Wattpad is a bigger turn off than UmbridgexSnape.

**** ffnet , Adult-fanfiction, HPFanfiction, Fiction Alley, Ficwad, AO3, tumblr... I mean, there is a list over in the side bar, and Wattpad is not one of them.

****** ffnet for exposure, AO3 or adult-fanfiction for smut, though TheQuidditchPitch is also decent, if dusty and slightly abandoned. Ad yes, you can post it to any and all sites if you want to, it is your story after all.

******* Many thanks. I'll probably finish it on Wattpad, since it started there, and then spread it around like Manticore dung. It is quite smutty.

******** That sort of reasoning is illogical. You should just put it on AO3.
