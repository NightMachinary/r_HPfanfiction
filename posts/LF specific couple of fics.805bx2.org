I lost the file where I kept track of these things, and now can't put a name to a few of them. Anyway, these two I read around early 2015, I believe.

First was a nextgen fic. James came to visit uncle Dudley with his father. There was a werewolf attack nearby. James saved a muggle kid's life, but was late to prevent him from being turned into a werewolf. The kid's family had to be told about magic. Main character was the kid's elder sister, who became a friend of James, and then through him the entire Weasley clan. Story was mainly about her balancing both worlds. At some point she worked in a store in Diagon Alley iirc. It was most probably completed.

Second was kind of a generic unfinished romance fic. A pureblood OC (or it could actually have been Daphne) fled from home after her father decided to marry her off (to Lucius Malfoy (?!) who wanted a virgin for some ritual, of course this now sounds ridiculous so I maybe mixing it up with something else). Anyway, while alone in the streets, she was attacked, and then was rescued by Harry and Sirius who were prowling the streets in their animagus form. They took her to their home (post-war, Remus is alive too). Rest was drab romance and I can't remember anything else about it, but it wasn't bad.
