Hey, all. I managed to save most of "Post Mortem: Dawn of Day." I clearly remember there being 12 chapters (I don't know if there had been more), but I only have the first 9 saved.

If anyone has them, I'd really appreciate it if you could send them my way?

I'm also looking for all other fics by that author that aren't currently on AO3. I have "Yours, In Murder" [HP/TR] and "Bride by Choice (Not!)" [HP/BZ] but that's it. Non-HP fics would be great as well (specifically her Naruto and KHR fics).

Thanks in advance!
