It makes no sense that Merlin is a Hogwarts graduate. Hogwarts was founded in AD 990, and yes, HP!Merlin lived in the time following this, and yes, one can argue that the Arthurian canon is only established in the 1100s and later, but Geoffrey of Monmouth didn't invent Arthur, he only codified a preexisting tradition that was at least a couple centuries older than Hogwarts.

We could resolve this with a "Two Merlins" theory, and postulate that the deeds of one were confused with the other over the generations, and teasing out the actual deeds of each Merlin could be fun in some ways, but it would also be a little confusing for the reader. Since I've already gone and replaced Rowling's Wizarding North America with my own version, I might as well just say "Merlin predates Hogwarts" and go from there.

But once I made that decision, I was curious to see what the world of King Arthur looked like, so I spent a few hours double-checking HP and Arthurian lore and referencing old maps, and I came up with this.

Map [[https://i.imgur.com/88Rk1d7.png][here]].

First of all, I need to point out that there are going to be some problems with this map. If you know your 6th century Western Europe, then this is probably going to look a little off, just because I didn't want to spend an extra three hours getting everything placed just right. And yes, this ignores the actual polities which existed in these places at this time, but I haven't figured out a good way to reconcile that (there are ways to make a /little/ better, but at the end of the day King Arthur never existed and there's no way to make him exist without displacing /somebody/).

Anyway, this should still correspond /roughly/ to the mid to late 500s, with a certain margin of error.

HP lore isn't clear whether King Arthur was a muggle or a wizard. I've decided that he was a muggle, and his sister, Morgana, was a muggle-born. She may be the reason that Arthur and Merlin became acquainted with each other, but the Statute of Secrecy didn't exist back then and there are plenty of other ways that a muggle and a wizard might have met, especially when the muggle is royalty.

What we do know, however, is that Arthur spoke the Brythonic language (I say /the/ Brythonic language because it seems that Welsh, Cornish, et al were not distinct from each other until after this period), which is the first reason that the realm of Camelot extends where it does. During this time period, there were migrations from Wales and the South West Peninsula to the Continent, more or less where you see bits of Camelot. Arthur is often said to have invaded Gaul/France, so I decided that these Brythonic enclaves were, at least in part, the product of Arthur's invasions.

According to her chocolate frog card, Morgana was the ruler of Avalon, and Avalon is traditionally associated with Glastonbury Tor, which used to be an island and is located in the South West Peninsula. Like Camelot, I tried to restrict Avalon to where the Brythonic language was spoken.

Camelot should arguably extend a little into the South West Peninsula, but there are other sites in modern-day Wales and Cumbria which have been associated with Camelot, so I'm just going to say that Camelot was one of those castles/cities and not one of the other candidates.

Because of his role in Arthur's invasions, Merlin has a less than stellar reputation in France and the Iberian Peninsula. Morgana, on the other hand, has received no end of praise. According to the British, she simply had it out for Arthur, but where Arthur is remembered as an invader, she is considered a faithful friend and a just ruler who fought, not to usurp a throne that was not hers, but to protect the people from Arthur's tyranny.


** The actual answer to Merlin being in Slytherin is, of course, that JKR is terrible at maths, dates and history, and always has been. But the *fun* answer, and something you're missing?

Multiple takes on Arthurian legend have versions of Merlin who lived backwards in time. Not just Benjamin Button style - he's able to predict Arthur will be a great king etc because he has already lived through it.

I therefore posit that Merlin was born in the tenth or eleventh century, went to Hogwarts, and invented the time turner (this is probably against pottermore canon, but whatever). In a bad accident with an early prototype, he threw himself back to the sixth century and, in living through the time of King Arthur, realised it didn't really match up with the version he knew from the chronicles and gave it a nudge in the right direction.

*** "This is why you should never snort time turner dust while pregnant."

Living backwards through time honestly wouldn't be out of flavor for a time turner accident to do something like that, and it /would/ make Merlin a canonical Slytherin without getting rid of any of this other stuff.

(Yes, yes, this means we have to wonder why Merlin didn't super-munchkin his future vision to the triple-max, but it was probably a super confusing experience which he never totally got a handle on, and sometimes it took everything he had to just get through the day).

** Correct me if I'm wrong but only Merlin is canon in HP. So you could just say that everything that doesn't fit history and/or your story is muggle fiction.

*** Arthur and Morgana are semi-canonical (mentioned in the video games and on Pottermore), but in the end, I'm willing to discard even book canon if it just doesn't make sense. >:P

it's not a vital part of the story in the books so this is probably okay. "it's fanfiction" and all that...

That was my point. I don't feel a special obligation to stick to Pottermore canon because I don't even feel a very strong obligation to stick to /book/ canon. I think we're in agreement.

** Personally I just put the Founding as happening during the conquest of Briton by the Roman's. Makes sense with Slytherin's anti muggle sentiment actually being an anti Roman sentimen that got misinterpreted over time. Muggles would have been lauding witches and wizards as demigods any time before christianity took over, not trying to execute them.
