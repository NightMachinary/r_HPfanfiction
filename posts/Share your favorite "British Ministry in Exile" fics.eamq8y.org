Inspiration: This happens in the latest chapter of Animagus at War.

Basically fics where the ministry/hogwarts ends up evacuating Britain and setting up a ministry in exile. Probably with some resistance fighting etc.

*** When I finished today's chapter of AiW I thought that it is completely original, apparently nothing is original in the HP fanfic world.

**** That's not restricted to the HP fanfic world, not at all. There's not really anything original anywhere at this point in time - that whole 'there's only eleven (I think?) actual stories in existence, the rest is just details' thing is thought to be legitimate by actually qualified people for a reason, after all.

I do like what Dan Brown said in his masterclass, though. You don't need original whats, just original hows (I paraphrased). Basically, feel free to have a trope filled monstrosity of a Lord Potter-ad-nauseam fic, just put a new spin on it. :)

** Not the ministry since it got taken over, but Dumbledore's Order evacuates and spends 20 years in exile after the Death Eaters just continued the war despite Voldemort's defeat in '81.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][*/The Dark Lord Never Died/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][/Starfox5/]]

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** linkffn(4356667) has this, sort of. Not the Ministry itself but the 'light' side. It is also a kind of brilliant fic.
