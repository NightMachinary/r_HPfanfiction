Dear HP fanfiction writers (I write too, I just don't have this problem), please, please, please, start making your story authentically British.

You don't have to use British spellings like I do all the time, but you do have to use common British phrases and insults, as well as---I can't stop saying this---use "mum" instead of "mom".

British people (at least in the books), do not call their mother "mom". So, please, just use "mum" and use British insults and phrases. I'm pretty sure you already know what they are---you read the books, after all---and if you don't, search some up. It will only take a minute.

I promise you that many of your readers will be peeved by all the American phrases when the damn story isn't set in America.

Sorry for the rant, but it's a pet peeve of mine.


** While overt Americanisms break your suspension of disbelief, I would hesitate to say that American writers should go out of their way to "Britishise" their fics. The problem with this is that more often than not, the attempt backfires and you end up with (for example) characters who speak in nothing but a string of cliched British idioms rather than having their own voice.

So many fics where authors look up a load of British slang and have Harry going around speaking like a chav.

** I don't know British English well enough to do it reliably. I sometimes remember things and correct them when I find them, but...

Well, consider the Naruto fandom (which I used to write fics for). I am monolingual. I /cannot/ speak Japanese. But when writing a fic set in a Japanese setting with its own terminology, how do I deal with that? And honorifics, that's a system entirely alien to me. So do I purely go the American route, do I try to shoehorn in as much Japanese as I can based on what I've picked up through cultural osmosis, or do I go for some mix?

Obviously, there's only one right answer: whatever helps me write the best story. So if I say color when I should have said colour, or jerk when I should have said prat, then whoopsie-fucking-daisy. It's fanfiction, I'm an American, and if I need to, I'll dump British words like my ancestors dumped British tea. In the end, it's just a story.

**** Surely you're used to reading American work by now? It's not something that I imagine US writers consider while writing. They're going against at least a decade of being immersed in mom, color, -ize, etc. And as a British-speaker myself, I see enough of it that it's not really disrupting when I read US spelling.

It makes me happy when I see characters written as British ones, but I'm not too fussed about it either way. Seems like something to put a Beta on (if you have one), and if not, not really worth dealing with.

** I wonder if I'm not so bugged by the difference because I'm from a country where English is one of our official languages and we use predominantly British but very occasionally North American spellings. Maybe I'm more flexible because of that, but I understand the original text is heavily committed to British English.

Fan fiction is made by people for free, with a huge donation of hundred of hours sometimes invested in their works. I take my time to let people know when there are differences if they invite feedback - for example I recently explained how a British GP practice works - but I'd say it never peeves or upsets me. I've always been interested to understand why the spelling in particular gets under people's skin. We have heavy deviations from canon in many other ways, in characterisations, in universe differences, sometimes physical traits etc, but the firm preference for British English is fascinating.

*** I don't care about the spellings of the words the characters use, but I do care about the phrases. If they use too many American phrases without using anything British, I will be seriously doubting their Britishness. But, for Salazar's sake, British people use "mum"!

** The two that always really jump out at me are these.

Cream in tea. Please, please, don't. We take tea with milk, or if it's a lighter tea such as Earl Grey, lemon. I think the confusion on that has come from people hearing about a cream tea, which is a light meal - you get a pot of tea and a tray of cakes, small sandwiches and scones. The scones are served with cream and jam, which is where the term comes from.

Pancakes and waffles for breakfast. This always seems to crop up in fics where Sirius gets Harry early on and wants to spoil him. In the UK in the 80s, we would not have had pancakes for breakfast. They're a very American thing that haven't really taken off over here and definitely hadn't at that point. A "treat breakfast" in the UK is much more likely to be a Full English.

*** One other thing that I want to add.

In the US, gun ownership is common. In the UK, it's very much /not/ - Vernon is an exception.\\
It's downright jarring to have guns discussed as if they were common threats, and especially for gun-safety to be common knowledge among Muggleborn kids (looking at you, Accidental Animagus).

**** In fairness, handguns were only banned in the UK in 1996/97 and there was a huge amnesty for people to hand them in. Vernon having a gun in 1991 is less weird than a character who is a business executive rather than a criminal or a farmer having a gun in 2020 would be.

But yeah, even before the handgun ban the culture around guns in the UK is totally different to the US. Here, you know gun safety if you grew up on a farm or you went to Army Cadets. It's definitely not something that people were taught as a general thing, because even when we had laxer gun laws people didn't just go around carrying them for no bloody reason. Most kids in the UK know nothing about gun safety and the first thing they would do upon getting a gun /is/ point it at someone because they're only used to handling toy guns and water pistols.

** I don't tend to notice these, probably because I'm from Australia and already exist with a weird mix of British/American cultural influences.

That said, some stories are obviously well researched in various areas, so I don't really see why looking up aspects of British culture and language is any different? But I also don't have the skill or patience to write, so no judgement lol.

** I agree that can be quite annoying. I personally get quite irritated when Harry Potter characters start fixing their tea with "cream and sugar*" like it's coffee - but I acknowledge that's kind of a cultural thing that you either know or you don't. Tbh, Sherlock fics are far worse for clumsy Britishisms and random Americanisms.

If anyone has any Britpick questions when they are fic-writing, feel free to DM. I don't have time to commit to full-on Britpicking, but I'm always open to answering questions when I'm not at work.

*Tea preparation is a highly controversial and contested topic in the UK alone (nevermind anywhere else), but it is usually milk and not cream that is added. Some nutter probably does, but it is not usually the done thing. The "cream" in cream tea refers to a practice of eating a light meal comprising of bread/scones with jam and clotted cream which can be dated back to the 11th Century. (Obviously there were no scones in the 11th Century). And North American style coffee creamer/half and half is not very common or widely-used in the UK, especially with tea.
