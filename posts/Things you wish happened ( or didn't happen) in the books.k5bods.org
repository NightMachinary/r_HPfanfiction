Just what it sounds like things that didn't happen in the books that you wish did

For me

Regulus Black lived I honestly think he would have been really interesting a character and his redemption arc would have been great to see. He had alot of potential.

Exploring issues with magical creature bias? We get it a bit with Hagrid and Lupin and Umbridge's bigotry in general. But I hoped we'd see that more we Harry's generation and I think it might get more focus if you had someone in Harry's gen who got turned or something.

If Harry's schoolmates were more a part of the plot. Like it wasn't just him Ron and Hermione involved in his adventures and you got more of a opportunity to see them grow and develop more. Especially those from different houses that gave us a chance to compare and contrast different house cultures more

Remus/Tonks never got together/died This is more a personal thing. Because of the huge mood and personality shift for Tonks , combined with the fact Rowling put no effort into establishing scenes with Remus and her in book 5, makes me think she last minute decided to hook them up so the story could have a orphan baby. Maybe I'm totally wrong but thats the impression if gives to me which really sours me on the relationship. It feels like such a waste they don't even get to have a good fight scene together.

I think it would be meaningful to see Harry adopt a kid maybe a kid whose alot like him. But considering this war was pretty short making another baby orphan during this war that Harry is personally very close to and thats the one he would adopt seems a bit contrived.

Sirius lives ( i just miss him ok?)

what about you guys?


** I don't know if you've read Order of the Phoenix recently, but Tonks is in almost every scene that Remus is in. Just because Harry isn't seeing their friendship, doesn't mean it's not there.

Anyway, I think it would have been better if Molly had stayed with Teddy and Andromeda had been the one to kill Bellatrix. I really didn't need a scene showing us how badass Molly is, because I was perfectly alright with her being a caring mother and friend to everyone she meets.

I also think Deathly Hallows would have been the perfect book to spread across other characters. We get one chapter in GoF, two in HBP, and one in DH that aren't from Harry's perspective, but I would have liked more in DH

*** Andromeda killing Bellatrix would have been far more appropriate. Though I think they should have given her a few more scenes before that point if she was.

And I agree I think it would have been nice if they had more chapters overall not from Harry's perspective. I actually remember really like those chapters in particular too.

But I will still maintain that Tonks and Lupin becoming a couple was so they could create an orphan. It really feels that way to me at least. And really anyone dying and making a orphan so Harry can adopt said orphan seems contrived to me when the war is so short.

***** i'd have liked it if at some point during her duel with Hermione Luna and Ginny if Bellatrix saw Andromeda and Narcissa nearby with their wands clearly able to help her but they don't and in a moment of clarity, Bellatrix realises she has pushed away the only thing that matters, her sisters and she lowers her guard briefly and Luna Ginny and Hermione take her down...don't kill her but cleanly best her and take her wand. Maybe Andromeda has a chance to kill her then but maybe Cissy just can't let her do it throws herself in front of her older sister and escapes with her....when Voldemort dies it would have also been cool if some kind of control he had over Bellatrix became diminished and her mind is no longer held together and now she is mostly a mess bed bound like Neville's parents unsure where she is or who she is with Narcissa taking care of her? kind of a twisted fate and better than she mostly deserves still but I just really like the idea of her escaping with the potential to be the new main villain in future stories if she somehow regains her mind.

** I wish there'd been more world-changing/activism in general.

Hermione's house elf crusade is mocked as a joke when it could've been an opportunity to worldbuild (ex. house elves are made stronger by bonding with a wizard, they're happy and Hermione's condescending and treating them like children by thinking she knows best, literally anything other than what actually happened).

JKR goes to extreme lengths to show exactly how corrupt the Ministry is (Fudge, Lucius Malfoy, etc) but none of the characters ever do anything about it. When Scrimgeour tries to make Harry the Ministry's poster boy, Harry could've easily negotiated and asked for things like training up the Aurors, putting more effort into public awareness, stuff like that. Harry's Slytherin traits are hinted at so many times throughout the series and yet nothing actually comes out of it.

Speaking of Slytherins - it would've been nice if Harry becomes aware of his own anti-Slytherin bias. It's absurd that the characters demonize a quarter of the school based on a decision a hat made when they were eleven. I hated how ambition and cunning was equated with "evil," like it's not ambitious to want to change the wizarding world (Hermione), not cunning to blackmail (Hermione again), like everyone doesn't naturally become more cunning and "Slytherin" as they get older.

There's a lack of inter-house friendship in general. Even in the DA, people like Susan Bones and Ernie Macmillan were basically props used to reinforce the idea of "Slytherin bad, Gryffindor great, everyone else meh."

I also wish the actual magic had taken more of a center role. We only ever see a couple spells and never get into how differently wizards live because of it. For example, why do they wear robes with hanging sleeves when they're a fire hazard? Are they fireproofed? If so, how long do the spells last? Are longer-lasting enchantments more difficult and thus more expensive? It would've been so easy to add a throwaway line here and there so the wizarding world isn't just "Muggle but things fly sometimes."

Oof, sorry for the essay. If you hadn't noticed, I feel quite strongly about all the missed opportunities

That would make for an interesting story. But that kind of cunning wouldn't be very 'gryffindor' of him.

On a similar note to yours, I wish there had been more exploration of the different houses, the founders, and Hogwarts in general. I wish the Ravenclaw house ghosts hadn't been crammed into the last portion of the last book.

Harry doesn't have an anti-Slytherin bias. He has a very accurate view of how far Slytherins can be trusted. What else would you expect from a subculture that venerates cunning (i.e., deceitfulness), Slytherin-style ambition [1] (i.e., self-aggrandisement at others' expense), and a founder who was considered xenophobic even in his time?

And, while children sorted there when they are 11, they are sorted there because they regard deceitfulness and selfishness as at least OK, and are then subjected to a culture that reinforces those things, which makes them even worse people. It's tragic, but for Harry's predicaments, where trusting the wrong person is literally a matter of life and death, it's fair.

Of the "good" Slytherins we see, Slughorn is a corrupt wheeler-and-dealer; Regulus was perfectly OK with all the murdering and the torturing up until Voldemort hurt his favourite house-elf and performed magic too Dark even for him; and Andromeda was probably the only one who fully outgrew her house---and was barely a character, with no real plot impact.

--------------

[1] Ambition to change the world for the sake of the greater good (however defined) is a Gryffindor-style ambition, possessed by Dumbledore and Hermione, for example. It can lead to dark places, but it's not Slytherin.

**** Ambition is very literally a Slytherin trait and not a Griffindor one. Ambition doesn't become not Slytherin and more Griffindor like when its a ambition you approve of. Not that Griffindors can't be ambitious. Its not like the traits were only unique to members of one house. Plenty of Griffindors are loyal and hardworking but are still Griffindor and not Hufflepuff.

Harry Hermione and Ron all display ambition cunning and resourcefulness but they aren't in Slytherin. And those qualities aren't treated as bad.

am·bi·tion

/amˈbiSH(ə)n/

noun

a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work.

Ambition has nothing inherently to do with the greater good. Doing things for the greater good is not a Griffindor trait.

Harry gets to know very few Slytherins over the course of the story. The ones he meets happen to be bad doesn't translate to all Slytherins are bad.

Slytherin qualities aren't inherently bad. In fact they are incredibly useful often the kind of thing you want to sell yourself as job interviews. The kind of culture that emerges from valuing those qualities is I imagine to be similar to college prep schools. Which has its positive and negatives but I wouldn't call the negatives indicative of highly evil individuals. More likely indicative of highly stressed out individuals because its likely to get that way when you have high ambitions. You might put more pressure on yourself.

***** If we're going to have duelling dictionary definitions, an ambitious /person/ (e.g., politician) is typically one who seeks accolades, power, wealth, and status; whereas an ambitious /plan/ is one that seeks to accomplish a lot. Slytherin ambition refers to people, and it therefore is of the first kind.

We can see the different kinds of ambition by who goes into which House: the ultimate Slytherin, Riddle, was obsessed with prolonging his own life at all costs to others; the ultimate Gryffindor, Dumbledore, wanted to overthrow the world for the greater good. Both had ambitions, but fundamentally different ones. For that matter, Gryffindor-ambition isn't necessarily good. Religious fanatics who want to impose their beliefs on everyone no matter the cost to themselves are very Gryffindor-ambitious, for example.

Cunning is a tool that can be used for good and for evil. When you embrace it as a virtue, however, that's just going to make you an untrustworthy person.

This isn't even an individual matter. People are shaped by their environment. If you take a bunch of kids who are already a bit more deceitful, manipulative, greedy, and/or racist than average at 11, have them stew in a dormitory with others with these traits for 7 years, constantly telling them that these traits are virtues, and constantly making them compete against each other and against other houses with opposing virtues, what do you expect?

Your college prep school students example is telling. Students there don't usually study what they study because they are interested in the material, nor because they expect to use it in real life, nor because they want to be better people. They study it because they seek to improve their score on a critical exam, which will help them get into a more prestigious college. The moment the exam is over, all that knowledge is gleefully forgotten. The whole exercise is ultimately pointless and even destructive, created because the powers that be haven't come up with a better way to do college admissions.

Nor is it a particularly healthy culture, and it most certainly doesn't bring out the best in people. I've heard some interesting first-hand stories about elite (for the country they were in) law school students and the amount of hoarding of resources and sabotage that goes on among them.

Worse yet, Hogwarts isn't just a school: it surrounds you 24/7 for 10 months out of the year for 7 years. Again, what would you expect?

Cunning as a virtue and being valued is basically highlighting managing perception having people skills and some amount of intelligence. Valuing the skill (which I assume Slytherins would as its supposed to be a major thing for them) doesn't inherently make more or less trustworthy than anyone else. Using it for what you believe to be good also doesn't make you more or less trustworthy than anyone else.

The knowledge may or may not be. But the actions required to gather knowledge apply them and succeed in a endeavor are not. While you can argue that schooling should be promoting love of learning the actions required to gather knowledge apply them and succeed in a endeavor are still incredibly useful and in school and after you graduate and get a job.

As for what the culture is you have no idea. You don't get to see what the house is like. You know some are bigots but have no idea if this is the majority or minority. All you know about them as a house really is they like the rest of the school avoided Harry after he was a passeltongue and they like the rest of the school preferred Cedric to Harry.

And the competition and desire to succeed and out compete others and pander to authority is not a Slytherin thing its a Hogwarts thing. That's what the point system does.

Thats not good thing you could say it's toxic if you like. But its not a slytherin exclusive thing. It promotes the heavy competition and unlike the culture of Slytherin house which is unknown you see the competition isn't exclusive to one house.

Purebloods aren't exclusively Slytherin. The supremacists aren't exclusively Slytherin. Voldemort was awful but he didn't pop out of a vacuum. He was just a very militant form of the biases people have of muggleborns and other minorities such as werewolves and half giants. Even those on the "good guy" side aren't free of the biases. Molly is concerned with her husband being around a werewolf. Ron is antsy about half giants till Harry tells him off because Hagrid is their friend. But they still all band together to fight Voldemort because he's too extremist.

The ideology of the Death Eaters did not rise on Slytherin alone. That would be like saying only the rich law school from Britain are the problem students are the problem. Only they hoard and sabotage. Rich students of different disciplines or different countries don't. No of course not they were just the only pointed out. The one focused on in this story.

TLDR the problems with bigots in Harry Potter was always a problem with Hogwarts as a whole and the Wizarding world as a whole. The problems with Hogwarts and the HP world was never Slytherin exclusive.

No, they really aren't.

So your defence of Slytherin is "Other Houses do it too?" Degree matters, and a handful of non-Slytherin pureblood supremacists and some anti-creature bias doesn't excuse the open and unchallenged pureblood supremacism in Slytherin.

Actually, I am willing to set Voldemort's political agenda and the Death Eaters aside, because even without the fantasy racism, the Slytherin culture is toxic and will bring out the worst in people, which was my original point for why Harry was justified in not going out of his way to engage with or trust Slytherins.

You mostly see the bigots be bigoted and don't usually have the rest of their house around to react or something else interrupts or caused chaos around them.

A good start would be abolishing the house system both houses and the point system. The houses fuel hostility the point system have no real point beyond pandering to teachers and loose meaning when houses dissappear. There should probably be more clubs for kids to explore interests instead. Also teachers like Snape shouldn't be allowed to exist. Hogwarts in general is just an awful school once you begin thinking about it for too long.

But this was created to be a interesting dramatic fantasy school for kids not a realistic school that could exist in this world imo. And thats true for alot of this world once the story got aged up a bit and required you take the world more seriously.

Slytherin house in general though it seems Rowling didn't want to give the impression all Slytherins were all bad. But you had only ever met a handful and they were bad. But those impressions lasted a while by the time more positive Slytherin examples were introduced more than half the series was over so Slytherin as a house left a bad impression. That doesn't mean they are all bad or even mostly bad. Again we don't know. But they just a poor job of showing the house as nuanced in the books.

Just for the record, I've stated before that I am happy to put the bigotry issue aside and discuss other problems with Slytherin culture. I try not to bring it up unless you do it first. Outside of bigotry, we see what a friendly Slytherin---Slughorn---looks like, and he is a teacher who exploits his position for personal favours and comfort and who concealed critical information about Voldemort and his plans for immortality for decades, even after Voldemort started a brutal civil war.

We actually get a pretty decent idea of the different Houses' virtues and flaws, both from the Hat's songs and from Harry's interactions in DA. We know Ravenclaw runs the gamut from paper-pushers-in-training like Marietta to dreamers like Luna. We know Gryffindor runs the gamut from visionaries and revolutionaries like Dumbledore and Hermione to heroes like Harry to brutes like Cormack. Hufflepuff takes all the rest, of course, and there we see a pretty big range of characters and virtues, including characters overly proud of their ancestry. (There are characters like Percy, who are in a House for family reasons, but they are exceptions, as far as I can tell.)

Those decent Slytherins we supposedly don't see? Based on the fact that we don't see them, their dominant Slytherin virtue is self-preservation at all costs, expressed by keeping their head down and allowing evil to be done in their name.

  For example you can be racist and have racist beliefs but say lynching is going too far. That doesn't make you not a racist. It doesn't mean your views don't cause problems against the same groups that get lynched. It doesn't mean that beliefs like yours aren't the gateway to the lynching. It just means you think that is going top far.

I am not sure we disagree here. The character that exemplifies this attitude the most is Slughorn.

#+begin_quote
  Ya but that means absolutely nothing if a President graduated from your college and happened to be a champion of say environmental issues does that mean the whole college is? Or even the majority of the college even has his /her beliefs?
#+end_quote

If said President also selected that college for its environmental science program, then yes, of course we can. I mean, IRL, if fundamentalist Christian parents send their children to Liberty University, and the politicians who come out of it tend to practice fundamentalist Christian politics almost without exception, that does say something about Liberty University.

  No one said any houses didn't value honesty.
#+end_quote

That's right. They value those things over honesty. But only Slytherins explicitly value the opposite of honesty over honesty. Degree matters.

#+begin_quote
  That depends entirely on the institution and the teachers. One of the most useful skills I learnt was analyzing research papers for bias. We did it in highschool and its helped me both in other classes and out of school. Because it was alot of analysis and critical thinking.
#+end_quote

OK, I think we're talking about different institutions after all. When I read "College Prep School", I think cram schools, SAT prep courses, and similar. If you are talking about Magnet Schools (US), Selective Schools (Australia), Public Schools (UK), or elite private schools in general, that's a different animal. They can develop a cutthroat culture as well, but not inherently so.

#+begin_quote
  Those aren't the virtues they are descriptions people give to those qualities when they don't value them or look down on them. It doesn't mean those qualities are without value.
#+end_quote

Yes, that's what "restatements... with negative valence" means. And I wouldn't say they are without value to some extent. Like you write, image management is important even for honest people, and absence of personal ambition can translate to inadequate self-care. But if you build a society around Slytherin "virtues", you get something quite Hobbesian, which is my point.

#+begin_quote
  You don't know is my point you have no idea who is and isn't a bigot. You don't know how common these beliefs are beyond the characters listed. Everything beyond it is speculation.
#+end_quote

We see that outside of Slytherin, pureblood supremacism is a fringe belief at best. Even people who harbour such prejudices don't express them openly, and are ashamed when they let their own prejudices slip (e.g., Slughorn again). Even those who fight for them (e.g., Umbridge) are very euphemistic about them in public. Death Eaters as a movement were only viable because they had a once-a-century uberwizard on their side, and even then, rather than try to win over hearts and minds, they had to resort to a guerilla campaign.

To postulate that actually, other Houses are full of bigots but that we just don't see them---that's some QAnon-grade conspiracism.

#+begin_quote
  You mostly see the bigots be bigoted and don't usually have the rest of their house around to react or something else interrupts or caused chaos around them. Like for example when Draco says he hopes Granger dies no one is around beyond him and his 2 bigot friends. That's the context under which Harry normally meets the bigots.
#+end_quote

Well, maybe the non-bigots ought to have been a tad more vocal. As it is, we do have some other examples. Off the top of my head, there is Blaze Zabini in Potions in HBP.

#+begin_quote
  You have a interpretation and thats fine but the source material is vague enough that there can be multiple interpretations that contradict yours and be equally valid. Yours is not the only one consistent with canon.

My interpretation is a synthesis of totality of evidence and what I know about human societies and how people behave when placed in various environments.

#+begin_quote
  Cedric was returning a favor
#+end_quote

That was one practical transaction, and Cedric was friendly in other contexts as well. For that matter, offering to claim the Cup together at the end was very much a Hufflepuff virtue in action.

#+begin_quote
  And Harry returns a favor when Draco doesn't out him to Bellatrix despite the risk. Thats probably the most fleshed out interhouse communication you get for this series. You get very little if any insight.
#+end_quote

There was no communication there. Draco acted is not out of the goodness of his heart but out of the weakness of his stomach: once he learned what it really was like to serve the Dark Lord, he wanted out more than anything else. I think it's a pretty consistent theme for his character.

#+begin_quote
  A good start would be abolishing the house system both houses and the point system. The houses fuel hostility the point system have no real point beyond pandering to teachers and loose meaning when houses dissappear. There should probably be more clubs for kids to explore interests instead. Also teachers like Snape shouldn't be allowed to exist. Hogwarts in general is just an awful school once you begin thinking about it for too long.
#+end_quote

Houses are a thing in many boarding schools, and they have their benefits and their costs. But the Slytherin social environment in particular seems to be designed to bring out the worst in people.

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin house in general though it seems Rowling didn't want to give the impression all Slytherins were all bad. But you had only ever met a handful and they were bad. But those impressions lasted a while by the time more positive Slytherin examples were introduced more than half the series was over so Slytherin as a house left a bad impression. That doesn't mean they are all bad or even mostly bad. Again we don't know. But they just a poor job of showing the house as nuanced in the books.
#+end_quote

Rowling built a world in order to tell a story, and Houses were a means to an end---I think in this we agree. I also don't think that she would say that all Slytherins are bad. Neither do I. My point is invariably about how /their social environment/ makes it extra hard to become helpful, just, trustworthy people. But, as I described upthread a number of times, even these positive Slytherin examples aren't very positive at all. What nuance there is, it has to be manufactured by the reader, but #NotAllSlytherins is not a very good defence.

Coming back to my original point, Harry was completely justified in not engaging with Slytherins.

*** I totally agree

I think the happy end but still work to be done suits the story more.

If there has to be a epilogue I would have been happier seeing what careers they went into.

Like Ron and Harry being Aurors would be cool. Or like Hermione being a lawyer and a magical creatures activist. Ginny being a pro quidditch player. Neville being the Herbology teacher. Just seeing them follow through on the things you know they wanted and were passionate about because it was explored on books.

Especially if you are getting snippets of everything.

Like imagine the first scene is you see a little kid at a orphanage. He is scrawny and his clothes are too big. He walks in to the room to see Harry. And gets really happy. They start talking about random things school hobbies. And he mentions something about weird experiences. Harry is curious the kid elaborates and you realize its because the kid is a wizard. Harry assures the kid then shows him a bit of magic to show that they are similar. The kid is ecstatic. Harry asks him if he is alright with moving in if he liked the house the last time he visited. The kid says yes. Harry says he will be back again next week to pick him up. He goes and signs some more adoption papers then heads out .

He goes home and is greeted by Winky and Kreacher who are both wearing tea cozy's like Dobby used to. Harry asks them if they've seen a box and they hand it to him. He also tells them to set up a room for the kid whose going to be moving in a week later. They both seem happy about that. Harry takes the box and apparates. He's outside if a wonky shaped building he heads in and hesitates trying to find room on the table for the box. Hermione says don't bother put the box on the ground. He asks her if she's ready to go she says she just finished. They finally managed to put through the werewolf protection act. The last stretch was rough and but they got money from some unexpected sources like Draco Malfoy.

Before Harry can read too into that Hermione insists they should get going. They apparate again its in front of a crowded stadium. Ron waves them over he's sitting with the rest if the Weaselys Neville and Luna. He jokes that Harry got to go home early from the Auror office and he still somehow managed to be late. But then the game start the team's assemble you see Ginny come out and it starts. Ginny's team wins.

That night its a huge party. The next morning Harry wakes up to sound of clatter. Neville woke up late after staying there for the night. Its his first day of work he was supposed to take a portkey but he missed it. Harry assures him there is still time and Neville shouldn't apparate when he's so nervous. So Harry will apparate him. And he does to King's Cross.

Harry tells him to write and not forget about the Christmas party. Neville assures him he won't and heads off he plops into a empty compartment. All his luggage is overhead. He fishes out a letter from his pocket as the train starts and opens it. Its a letter from Hogwarts congratulating him on his recent hire as the new Professor of Herbology signed Headmistress Minerva Mcgonnigal.

Romance and having kids was never a huge part of the books so confirming couples and their kids being the main thing seems a bit odd in the epilogue.

*** It's a stretch in terms of displayed skills, but I'd give Bellatrix to Hermione. It would provide symmetry and closure for the Malfoy manor.

I'd even incorporate some wandlore, in that Bellatrix's wand in Hermione's hand would be reluctant to attack its master, so Hermione would end up winning with some indirect attack, such as using Transfiguration. Then, the moment Bellatrix dies, the wand just comes alive in Hermione's hand, suddenly eager to destroy on behalf of its new master.

As it is, wandlore only really shows up between Harry and Voldemort and their wands, which makes it feel contrived.

*** Very honestly I think romance was pushed in this book when it didn't gave to be. Ron and Hermione are the only exception it seems more tied to their feelings for each other earlier and more a part of their explored relationship. And as 2 out of the major characters in this story its a very important one.

But all others? There's no real reason Harry develops feelings for Ginny 6th year beyond the book series is coming to the end and there is a temptation to pair people off. It's not like they are depicted as particularly close. I'd argue Harry was closer to Fred and George than Ginny pre book 6. Never is very attracted to her or close friends with her and then suddenly he's all over her. Why bother putting in a romance with the main character who you won't explore?

Bill and Fleur hooking up makes sense as a sign of things happening around Harry's life without his observation or involvement with them. But I mean not every single person is pairred of and married with kids by the time they hit their 30s. And they are often quite fine with that. It would make sense that someone whose story didn't have a big romantic subplot may not be paired off by the end.

And I agree killing off one of the Weasely parents would probably hurt the most if you want to hit the audience in the feels. If you want it to be one of the kids, I mean I think giving Percy more of an arc then killing him would hurt alot. Or Ginny because she is the youngest would also hurt alot. ( But i also really like the twins so I'm biased)

As for gay and trans characters I agree but I think for them to exist at all I think there needed to be more effort in fleshing out and doing things with the other classmates. Make them more involved in the plot not make it always just Harry Ron and Hermione. Imagine if Hermione had been paralyzed earlier in book 2 and Harry and Ron needed to get the help of someone else in their year who was really good at potions to finish the polyjuice potion maybe like someone from a different house like Anthony Goldstein. And you get closer to others in Ravenclaw see a different house. And someone else really into magical creatures figured out the basalisk. Maybe Parvati loves Magical Creatures a huge nerd about it.

Imagine in book 3 instead of finding out from spying in Hogsmeade Harry befriends Dean who happens to be really into history and annoyed Bins doesn't teach more modern stuff. He also didnt have a permission to hogsmeade so Harry bonds and finds the new history fascinating. He not only finds out about more details about Sirius there but also about the lack of a trial and Barty Crouch and his son. Maybe even the Longbottoms.

When Ron has a fight in book 4 Dean has his back.

Maybe a few others go horcrux hunting with them but then get split up because of the snatchers and relieving to see them again.

Etc.

That way when people avoid Harry in book 5 or die in 7 it has more importance. You have a larger relevant cast that can leave a impact on a audience and more people the Audience really cares about. So that way it matters more if say Dean is Gay down the line. He's not just a side character. You had all this development with him.

To that end, Harry's brief attraction to Cho Chang feels pointless in the grand scheme of things. He just falls in love with her after they both experience trauma later from Cedric's death, and he just stops later in the same book and she is barely mentioned again. Instead of Harry being attracted to Cho, Rowling should have used /Prisoner of Azkaban/ to start planting seeds for Harry's relationship with Ginny, and had them grow closer together over books 4, 5 and 6, through things like Ginny providing support for Harry during the Triwizard Tournament, etc.

And book 6 in general wasn't great at balancing out hormonal high school drama with the background of a war story. Maybe it's just because Rowling's not good at writing romance.

They don't have to speculate about if he's lying, they can goddamn motherfucking know. It would take like ten minutes to stick Harry's memory in a Pensieve.

The distrust of Harry's warnings made more sense when all he had to go on was Quirrell's sinister tumor and an evil book wraith. After he's faced off against the Dark Lord in person and been saved by weirdass magic rules he didn't fully understand, it's a bit late for Fudge and the Ministry to start going, "Nah, I think he's making it up."

Thus, the reader can really get a feel of every character in different types of settings and scenarios. For example, I think it would've been interesting to read Ron's perspective in when he caught by Snatchers (and his subsequent escape). Also, I think it would've been equally interesting to read Hermione's thoughts when she was being tortured by Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor.

** I haven't read the books in years but what I found odd was:

1. Pureblood bigotry seems to be older than Voldemort, it's not something he came up with just something he capitalized on for his own benefit. But so where does it come from? Like typically bigotry is associated with using a minority as a scapegoat for societal problems, or demonizing a group of people for colonial/imperial purposes, or the group was subjugated for economic reasons and now ppl still view them as less than, etc. typically in these situations the majority of society is not on the side of the marginalized group, they are either actively bigoted or at best indifferent/unintentionally prejudiced. We don't know why muggleborns are disliked by death eaters and their sympathizers and I don't recall it being clear that muggleborns are systematically disadvantaged. Like werewolves are seen as violent and dangerous and we see clearly that they are systematically disadvantaged and ostracized. Then for the bigoted ppl to seemingly all be concentrated in this minority group (Slytherins vs everyone else) it seems to imply that just getting rid of this one evil man Voldemort solves bigotry...in the real world that's not how it works steps have to be taken by society as a whole. So if bigotry is bad because it's unfair and leads to horrors of war is her message this feels muddled. Like...after Voldemort is defeated the epilogue makes it seem like everything fine and wraps up in a neat little bow. But like there were just 2 wars fought for the exact same reasons so what steps did their govt/society do to eradicate this and prevent it from happening again? What did the pure bloods even stand to gain from all this?

2. I don't like the Slytherin bad Gryffindor good thing. Again if we are talking about a society with bigotry and oppression then it is much more likely that death eaters and their sympathizers would come from all houses. If Andromeda can be who she is and a Slytherin and Peter be a Gryffindor...then there could have been some more variety. Hagrid said the first war was so dark and scary because people didn't know who to trust but apparently you could just ask people their houses and know from that. I think having variety would have added more to the hysteria feeling that can happen in war? Also these traits associated with houses are fine but like anyone can be bigoted and that's important to remember, not just Slytherin personality types.

3. There's like no justice for other groups like werewolves, squibs, house elves, other creatures. Like Lupin was a prime example of the horrors but I wish he had lived just in general but also if like Bill took on more werewolf traits and maybe Lavender lived and got some traits then you could show the society taking steps to keep them integrated in society rather than ostracized and offering help to their conditions. I wish we saw more werewolves than just Lupin and Greyback.

4. I've read fics that explore this but all the kids involved in the war are kids and arguably some were groomed and/or child soldiers in a sense. And I feel all the Slytherins were demonized. Like we see Voldemort being generally cruel to his followers and Voldemort using Draco to punish Lucius but wouldn't this be the case for other kids? I'm sure some were happy to join with no regrets, but likely others felt trapped on the sidelines, or weren't involved at all. Like we have no evidence that the Zabinis were death eaters at all. So I wish there was more nuance there and exploration of what was going on with death eater adjacent ppl/kids.

5. Severus sucks. His redemption arc was nonsense and Harry should not have named his kid Albus Severus.

6. Sirius didn't need to die so soon. Like the way he couldn't be exonerated after his escape, had to be kept locked up, isn't offered much support at all from anyone really...then just dies.

7. I hate how no one knows what Regulus did.

8. I'm endlessly interested in the Black family (Narcissa, Andromeda, Bellatrix, Regulus, Sirius). I wish we had more from them and the Marauders.

** This is a mixture of something I wish happened AND didn't happen: Anything happening that would validate the protection at the Dursleys. All we get told is "it protected him". From what? Nothing happened, and a fat load of good it would have done too. At the start of book1, it showcases a ton of "weird" people greeting him, hugging him, shaking his hand, and disappearing. How hard would it be for a Death Eater to get him? Harry put up with them for over ten years with nothing to show for it except some words saying that that was what happened.

For all we know, the protection needed none of that, and Dumbledore in his arrogance assumed something and stretched it out over the Dursleys house. I'm not saying that's what happened, but Dumbledore himself said he didn't know what happened, yet he's the supreme expert on the matter and did all that stuff with it?

the whole schtick is really flimsy. Using a mystery as both a mcguffin AND a major reason the main character has to do something? If it's such a mystery, it shouldn't have all of these clearly defined rules.

Another thing I didn't want in the series: Snape's whole attitude as a teacher. It just cheapens Hogwarts as an institution and makes the rest of the staff AND Dumbledore look bad. There are tons of kids from fairly well to-do pureblood families he is terrorizing. There's not enough pull in the world for Dumbledore AND Malfoy to rescue Snape from that.

** Inb4 the people whining about pairings

I always thought it would be poignant if Narcissa and Androema died too. The Ancient and Noble House of Black reduced to nothing

Also Colin/Luna should have happened

*** Ohh interesting though since Harry inherited from Sirius and Draco is Narcissa's kid it does still live on.

Colin and Luna is interesting and now that I think about it makes sense I never really considered it before 🤔

The Ancient and Noble House of Black full of bad people except for 3 with 2 who hated these bad people.

The Blacks are dead at the end of the series....

** Drop the epilogue.

I wish Tonks had been given a chance to show off as a badass. Literally a shape shifting special forces witch and doesn't do much.

As far as Sirius getting killed off I wish it had served as more of an impetus for Harry to kick off his training.

And, as mentioned, I wish other characters were fleshed out a bit throughout all the books. So that they can be called upon later and it would mean more if someone that was antagonistic in book 1 became an ally by book 5/6
