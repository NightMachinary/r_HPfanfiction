So, I've been searching for a fic titled "Forgetting This" by HappySmiler. The crossover's main pairing is Hermione/Legolas. It was through the Wayback Machine that I was able to find some chapters, but not the full completed story. Does anyone have this story saved somewhere? I've tried searching for this fic a couple of years ago, but haven't had any luck yet.

** Not for nothing, but was it ever, in fact, completed? I found nothing to indicate it was updated after the wayback post, other than someone else looking for it back in 2012.

*** Sorry, I should have been more specific. I meant that I wish I could recover all of the completed chapters that were posted instead of just a handful of them (only 9 out of 17 of the chapter links work when I try and click on them through Wayback).

**** Huh. I'm a bit surprised no one has it saved and uploaded that I've been able to find, considering it was popular enough to have several YouTube videos dedicated to it..
