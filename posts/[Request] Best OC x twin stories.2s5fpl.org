** Try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304027][So Listen...]] by one of my favorite authors! :) She's the same author who wrote "Run" which gets rec'd here a lot. I don't read Weasley twin stories, but I do know other romance stories with OCs, if you have other preferences (genre, era, characters, or otherwise).

** I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4998084/1/George-Annie-an-Unofficial-Biography][George and Annie: An Unofficial Biography]]. It's well written, with good plot and a relatively original premise. Watch out, it's a bit of a doorstopper at 368,834 words but try not to let that put you off, as it's a good read.
