I've just read You Can't Make Me by DinkyBaby ( httpss://archiveofourown.org/works/29561088 ) and completely recommend it! It isn't finished yet but is being updated regularly.\\
Jist of it is OC from our world is placed in the body of Sirius Black's 5yr old son and ends up trying to change the story. It's actually fairly realistic (within reason guys haha) of how you'd feel suddenly in a new world and 5 years old.\\
So I just wanted to share my find with more people and also ask if anyone knows any similar fics? I find the idea of an OC/insert in a child's body really interesting. So long as it's well written I don't mind about characters/xover/different fandoms. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç
