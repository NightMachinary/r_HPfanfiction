#+TITLE: Looking for an older fic I recall reading almost ten years ago. I know this is a reach but I recall it being sort of a community favorite at the time. It was a Marauder fic with a female original protagonist. it might’ve been called “Fated” but I’m not sure.

** Do you remember any specific scenes or anything? There are a lot of insert fics set in the Marauder era

** Not much to go on, but could it be "Bound" by Mutt N. Feathers. I remember reading it about ten years ago. The protagonist name was Anwen.
