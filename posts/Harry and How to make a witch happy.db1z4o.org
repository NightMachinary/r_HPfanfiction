:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to find this one fic where I think Harry was raised by Sirius. With Sirius' track record of being a ladies man in Hogwarts, he of course trained Harry on how to do so as well. Harry was given a set number of things (like 12 or something?) to do to make a witch happy and that if you couldn't do it, you're not a real man or something. I can't remember if it's a harem fic or not, but I know he has a few different partners.

There's also a couple scenes where he's with women that aren't used to receiving pleasure so they finish before he gets past step three or something. It makes him quite frustrated. I think one time was Fleur and another was Mrs. Malfoy. They were both trying to seduce him and ended up being seduced instead.

Sorry for all the "or something"s. It's real fuzzy. I just remember this little bit and how funny it was to read.


** I think this is the fic you're looking for, Harry isn't raised by Sirius though, so maybe it's just very similar to the one you're thinking of /shrugs/ linkffn(4532363)
