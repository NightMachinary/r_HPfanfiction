Am currently reading "Seasons of change" and am finding it good and belivable so far. Is there any other good fem!Harry stories that you can recommend? Love femslash so I don't mind if there is that in it. It just have to make me believe that it's possible for Harry to turn female.

Thank you!


** This is a Harry that isn't transgender. She's really awesome though. It's inspired by the Alanna the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce.

The first in the series isThe Pureblood Pretence. The second is The Serpentine Subterfuge. The third (a WIP) is The Ambiguous Artifice.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

** What do you consider "good"?

I'll list my own, even though some have said it's poor form to link to your own stuff, but then I'll link to others.

The first three are part of a series. The first two are complete; the third has only just started, with the second chapter going up Saturday morning.

linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by philosophize) linkffn(The Power of Love by philosophize) linkffn(Heart and Soul by philosophize)

The next two are part of a series of HP/Avengers crossovers. I'll start publishing the third in an month or so. A rough draft is already written and just needs to be fine-tuned.

linkffn(The Death of Natasha Romanoff by philosophize) linkffn(Iris Potter Agent of Shield by philosophize)

These two by wordhammer are good, but they do have darker elements.

linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path by wordhammer) linkffn(Holly Polter by wordhammer)

Nemesis13 has written a bunch of femslash stories involving a female Harry, combining darker elements with... I guess it's whimsy.

Rakeesh has written a great story with A Long Journey Home:

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

If you don't read anything else, chapter 8 is hilarious (though you may have to read the first two just for context).

Heroes Never Die has both a femHarry and a regular Harry. It's a HP/Stargate crosssover that's a long way from being finished and isn't updated too often:

*** I'm echoing the recommendation for A Long Journey Home. Not only is it the best fem Harry story I've read, it's among the two or three best fan fiction stories of any genre I've read. The story is unfinished, but what's written so far is just simply beautiful.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
