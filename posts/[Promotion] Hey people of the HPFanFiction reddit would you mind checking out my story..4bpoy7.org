This is my first story I have published online. Would love some feedback on it. Also looking for a beta reader. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857299/1/]]

** Thanks everyone for the comments. I'm going to rewrite the first chapter. I will make it longer , and I will change it that Harry lives with them ,fix errors, etc. I will change the link once the updated version is on FFN.

** Try to mix simple sentences with compound sentences. Both your summary and your first paragraph use only simple sentences which makes it appear that it's intended for very young audiences.

Let your dialogue expand into multiple paragraphs, usually a paragraph break after each speaker. That last paragraph is packed too tightly.

364 words is a single page in a book, generally not a full chapter. This first chapter is an opportunity to introduce your characters. What do the characters look like, what does their place look like, etc.

** And you better have a tremendous reason to have harry raised by the dursleys because the blood protection won't fly since she and harry have the same blood/blood protection potential.

** So, first things first. This is super short, I'm not sure why your looking for someone to critique less than 500 words. That being said, I only found one error (and this is more of a preference thing). At the end, when you have the back and forth dialogue between Sirius and Emily theres no separation, its just a blocky paragraph. I would recommend doing it like this. It just makes it look much more normal. "Blah blah" said Sirius "Blaaaah" said Emily "Blaah blah blaaaaaaah" said Sirius Etc etc

Edit:New criticism time!

First of all, Snape has to say "dunderheaded" not "thickheaded" /s

On to the serious stuff. Its worth noting that all my criticism has to do with the Snape scene. The twins seem unreasonably scared of him. He doesn't say anything offensive and certainly nothing intimidating (11 years old or not) so it seems like their fear is totally unexplained.

Secondly, while we know Sirius hates Snape and he just insulted James, there doesn't seem to be a need to draw a wand or issue threats, it (again) seems very strange and unexplained. While I can definitely imagine Sirius calling him Snivellus and other such things, I don't think he would resort to violence /that/ fast.

** My suggestion is that after you write a chapter, /re-write/ it. Get a real book with lots of dialogue and try to make yours format the same way. Beta readers are great, but you shouldn't expect them to do everything or work from your very first rough draft.

** Second to last paragraph: "Uncle Sirius pulls out his wand and points it at ." I think you mean "Uncle Sirius pulls out his wand and points it at Snape."
