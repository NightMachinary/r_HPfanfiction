** Ooooh, I love this series! The author has another long HP series, but you've probably already seen it. The only recommendation I could make is the incomplete/abandoned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141722][Safeguard]] - it's headed towards HarryxJarvis, but doesn't get that far, only 42k words.
