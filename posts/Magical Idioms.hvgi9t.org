Sometimes I'm writing a fic, and I use a figure of speech, and then facepalm at just how /muggle/ it is.

Just the other day I wrote a scene where a pureblood witch described a nasty rumor as "so much worse with the long game of telephone before it gets back to me" -- whoops!

Today I was thinking instead of "they really threw him under the bus" maybe I should try something more like "they really threw him off the flying carpet" -- see what I mean? But this feels super weak.

I'm not looking to steal anyone's ideas, but I am curious what others have done about this problem.

So, kindly HMU with your best magical idioms. Please :)


** Maybe you could replace "/game of telephone/" with something among the lines of "/a round of floo whisper/" since it's problably the closest magical thing to telephone in canon.

As for "/throwing him under the bus/", maybe "/they really threw him in front of the dragon/"?

** I had a dad call his reckless son “that little daredragon” since in my wizarding world, they don't follow a religion that believes in devils. And someone went to his office to do some parchmentwork, since they don't seem to use paper.

Also, “The quill is mightier than the wand.”

** Oh! I think this is the most fun! I love making up wixen idioms.

"Ron! Stay still! You're like an erumpent let loose in an apothecary!"

"They were on me like a horde of cornish pixies!"

** So, whenever I'm writing, I think of all the Muggle expressions I know, and then figure out whether this could possibly apply to wizards. If it doesn't, instead of trying to replace certain words in the phrase with the magical equivelant, I reconfigure the idiom do that it sends the same message, but doesn't sound like they stole muggle sayings. If you want to be super true to canon, there's a list: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizarding_idioms]] , but beside the Merlin stuff, I don't use it all that often. Good luck!

** "It's not over 'til the fat lady sings" would probably be consistent, at least with the Gryffindors. She won't let them in the Tower until they listen to her song, so the day isn't over 'til she sings because she won't let you go to bed until then. :D
