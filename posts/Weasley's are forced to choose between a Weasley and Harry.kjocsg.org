Maybe Death Eaters enter the home, or a hostage situation happens, etc.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Not looking for pairings but if there is am fine with het/slash/femslash/threeomes, etc

If they choose Harry, I want Harry to be racked with survivor's guilt, trying to overcome it, etc.


** Well in canon, they had to choose between Harry and Percy in Year 5. The outcome was never in doubt.

So if we go by canon Weasleys, they will sacrifice family members for their belief and principle.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]], Harry's time travel also changes things, and the elder Weasleys don't trust Harry at all. Percy, interestingly, stands by Harry all the way against his family.
