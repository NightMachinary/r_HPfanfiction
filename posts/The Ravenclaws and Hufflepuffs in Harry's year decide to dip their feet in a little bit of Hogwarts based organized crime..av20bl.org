** Stuart, ever the curious Hufflepuff, asked his friend for clarification. "How are we getting away with this? Isn't it super illegal?"

Joshua, his Ravenclaw partner in crime and supplier of illicit goods, tried to dumb it down more since Stuart did not seem to understand his previous explanation. "We're getting away with it because we're discrete and we're supplying something that every girl wants."

Josh and Stuart arrived at the hogwarts lake shore just a little after 2:00am. Giving one more suspicious look about, Joshua stepped up to a rock but did not approach it any further.

"This is the important part. We're right at the edge of the wards and the rock is on the other side. Never ever step over it. Use a stick like this." Joshua explained as he picked up a nearby stick to dig at the sand near the rock. The end of the stick hooked on a string attached to a leather pouch.

Pulling the pouch across the ward line he picked it up. "Look here, see? Muggle fingernail polish. Sells like you wouldn't believe, and purebloods pay an unbelievable amount for it. You've got to re-brand it first so we need to get these back and move the stuff to new containers."

"You'll have to remember all this. There's nobody in my own house I trust enough to let in on. When I graduate you're going to inherit the business. Ill teach you how to get suppliers on the muggle side later."

** If Fred and George don't somehow find a way to weasel their way into the illicit goods trade I'll be very disappointed. After all, surely the amount of potion ingredients (for experimentation) and joke products they go through would raise some eyebrows otherwise.

** Might do the school some good if Draco Malfoy was told weed is a magical strength enhancer. Him and Ron will bond over food and there will be peace.
