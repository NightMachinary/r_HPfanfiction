I'm starting to think it was a weird fevered dream, if anyone can help me I will love you forever!

I don't know if it's one story, or two different stories that I ended up mixing up; if they are no longer around, maybe the author deleted them? Maybe it was deleted because it was too dark or graphic, I haven't the faintest ideas.

It was a super long time ago when I read it; like five or so years ago kind of long time ago.

Harry was cursed after the battle with Voldemort, either by Voldemort right before he died or by someone else.

His personality changes making him turn dark, or not as good as before.

He goes to the Malfoy manor and forces Draco Malfoy to become his slave. He places Draco at Grimmauld Place I believe, Hermione ends up breaking the curse that was placed on Harry (I believe it was Hermione).

Harry comes back as his old self, he ends up back to Grimmauld Place and ends up finding Draco in a room by himself I believed tied off/chained or something. Draco calls him Master and Harry frees him, and brings him downstairs to find something to eat.

Once Draco comes to his old self (or as old back to his his self as he could be) he ends up leaving and staying at Severus Snape's place. (At this point I might be confusing this story with something else, but I think it's the same story).

I can't remember much else about this story. I know that it was a multi-chapter story, it was a Ron/Hermione story. Lucius, Narcissa and Severus were in the story. And of course Harry and Draco. I believe that I found the story on fanfiction.net, but now I'm not 100% sure.

(Something else that I for some reason have remembered) Harry wants to do something nice or something to Draco, I believe that it was before Draco got his memory back or something. Harry asked Narcissa what Draco liked to do and I think that she said something about opera. (I don't know why, but I remember that, don't know if it was in this story or another story. I think it was this story).

Please help me out here, I don't know if the story is complete, what the title or the name of the Author is. It was several years ago or so when I read this story, I think that I was fairly new to the site so I didn't think to favorite the story or anything. (And now I'm kicking myself).

I didn't read it all and I would love to go back to reading it. I can't get the story out of my mind. (Funny how I can't get it out of my mind but I can't remember the title or the Author). Heck I can't even think of the summary of it or anything. It is seriously bugging the heck out of me. Please tell me if you can remember it! Even if it isn't exactly it, just please!
