So, I want to write a fic where McGonagall finds Harry at 221B Baker Street. Will I need to mark it as a crossover since I've seen other stories similar to it not marked as one.


** I don't think you /have/ to mark it as a crossover, but you probably should. Or at least make what you're doing explicit in the summary, especially if Holmes is a major character and/or Harry is participating in his investigations.

*** Oh, because Holmes is just Harry's guardian but I won't be going into the Sherlock side of the story so basically it'll be after Sherlock's investigations are done. Holmes won't be a major character, kinda like Remus in the original- Harry's guardian and he'll get some screen time but not as much as say, Harry's classmates.

** It largely depends on who you want your readers to be
