Hi! I read this fanfic a long time ago. I think it is a short story about a girl who lived in Hogwarts but was unknown to anyone but dumbledore. Sirius found out about her during one of his detentions and became friends with her and visited her every night. She had a condition and was dying. She dies at the end of the story. I really want to re-read it. I think it was called Broken wings but i can't find it on the hpff website. Has anyone heard of it?


** Are you sure about what site it was on? Do you remember what any of the tags are/were? Also was it an OC or an established character (like Marlene McKinnon, Ariana Dumbledore, etc)?

**** You don't by chance remember the character's name? or what point of view it was (first, third)?

edit: To be honest, I don't think I've read a single story on HPFF and certainly nothing even remotely like what you're looking for, I just thought I'd take a few minutes to help you look, and it's not going anywhere at all =/\\
Maybe try asking their [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/forums/][forum]]?

** There's [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=271862][this one]]. If that's not it, HPFF does have the function to search by Sirius/OC (assuming the story was a pairing...).
