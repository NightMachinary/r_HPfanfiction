:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been searching for this all day yesterday and it's driving me crazy. I'm pretty sure it was on Fanfiction.net.

The story goes as follows: Harry is abused by his uncle and is bleeding out on the floor when he's suddenly transported to a different universe. There he wakes up in the hospital wing with his siblings (I think three? of them) surrounding him. His parents are also alive in that universe and Snape is his godfather I think.

He learns that he's a Hufflepuff instead of a Gryffindor in that timeline and apparently has major problems with one of the Slytherim students because James looked his father away. Anyway, he tries to hide that he's a different Harry but Poppy Pomfrey tells Snape about the signs of abuse and they both try to question him. They do tell Dumbledore and James and Lily at some point.

That's about as much as I can remember. If someone could help me out, I'd be eternally grateful!

Edit: Holy fuck, I actually found it after searching through all my followed stories! For anyone who wants to know it's In Another Place by whats up with jeremiah.


** I don't know anything about this story but it sounds great. Is the Harry he replaced like a stereotypical Puff?

  He had done it. This time, he had done it. His uncle had gone too far, and Harry had to pay the price for it. As he lay dying on the floor of his Number 4, Privet Drive bedroom, what unexpected force will save Harry? (Rated T, warnings inside, rating may go up later; AU).

*** Basically. He's friends with Cedric and a couple other Hufflepuffs. As far as I can remember the other Harry was rubbish at Defense (which James teaches) and everyone is surprised at how good Harry now is.
