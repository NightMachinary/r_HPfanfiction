So I've been working on a new Ron, centric fanfiction and I was wondering if you guys might provide me with some title ideas for my story! The basics of it is that it's basically the Harry Potter series but told through Ron's third person point of view! Right now, I'm doing the first book so that I can get a grasp on writing from Ron's perspective! After this, however, I'm going to write the books in whichever order I please! I wanted to know if you could give me a good title for the Sorcerer's Stone but for something Ron centric!

Ron Weasley and the [blank] is the format I'm looking for! Thanks, guys! I'll be sure to make a post whenever I post the fic if anyone is interested in reading!


** Assuming you're staying as close to canon as possible, Ron's first year is dominated by encountering and befriending a living legend, so: Ron Weasley and the Boy Who Lived.

*** I struggled to think of another option, but your idea really does seem to fit best. Ron Weasley and the Game of Chess would work if OP had any inclination to building up Ron's strategic mindset.

**** Just wondering, because it is so played up in fanon, is there any canon evidence of his strategy other than being good at chess

***** No not particularly, though I wish it was. That's why I said my suggestion would need some tweaking to work.
