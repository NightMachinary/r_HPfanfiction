Before every conversation, he offers the other person one in order to bring them on the same level as himself but because he is always refused, people are always in awe at how smart and powerful Dumbledore is.

** The ministry had actually banned the potions dumbledore used to create the sweets.

Dumbledore is secretly hoping to by offering the people the sweets and them accepting he could slowly elevate the population of the wizarding world.

basically its like a magical version of nzt

**** One fic that seems to have been abandoned (one of the Champions of Lilith challenge fics) had it that his long-term use of his own personal variant of Wit-Sharpening Solution via lemon drop had left him sort of addicted and distinctly unhinged.

** I love this.

It also means that every time he offers someone a lemon drop, he is genuinely trying to help them, albeit in a slightly unethical and round-about way. And if they're too much of a stick-in-the-mud to accept a lemon drop from a old man, then its their own choices that caused them to lose out on the knowledge boost, so its a test of character as well. Its just... so Dumbledore.

** Ironic, since those spells and potions would be either regulated, prohibitively expensive or take some serious skill to brew... So he'd have needed to be a damn scary customer to obtain them in the first place...

****** True. It would have been funny if he mostly used the potion to get the sourness just right, with the upper limit of the enhancement below his baseline. Rendering the Super Drops merely candy for him... Bloody delicious, though!
