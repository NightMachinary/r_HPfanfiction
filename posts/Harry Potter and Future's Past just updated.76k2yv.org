*** Same, and was confused about why I didn't get the alert, then realized it was a different fic when I read the summary and instantly noped out as that summary sounds terrible.

Last time NoFP updated I couldn't remember what had been going on when I originally read it, so I didn't actually even read the update. At this point I'm just going to wait until there are a bunch of new chapters, if that ever happens.
