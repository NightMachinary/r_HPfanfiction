Stories like "Harry Potter and the Homemaking Dilemma" which just show their life without some larger plot.


** linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) is rather fluffy and is just a part of their life at Hogwarts. Short and sweet.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

*** This was okay but nothing great. I felt the author relied too heavily on flowery language which struck me like lightning right out of the story. Also, I didn't associate Harry Potter with how he was portrayed here. It was just...off, somehow or another. But it can be enjoyable. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it all that much.

** I'd recommend linkffn(Baby, It's Cold Outside by Potato19). In it, Harry spends winter break of 5th year at the Grangers' House. It's very laid back, and there's practically none of the Voldemort stuff. Be warned that t's a bit too fluffy at times though.

Check out Potato19's other stuff too. He mostly writes Harmony like Stanrick.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.
