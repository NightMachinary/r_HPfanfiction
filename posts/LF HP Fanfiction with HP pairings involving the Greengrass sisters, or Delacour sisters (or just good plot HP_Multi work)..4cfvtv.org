** The best example I can think of when it comes to Harry in a multiship is Darth Mars story. Unspeakable things. It's okay, at best.

But as far as I know, it has never been done well.

** For multi with plot, best I've got is linkffn(Witches of Westfield). Plot, no porn... for now. Only Daphne, though.

** There are no Harry/Daphne/Astoria or Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle stories with good plot. They're nothing but wish fulfillment, or involve dumb soulbond shenanigans. Sorry to disappoint you.

*** Agreed. The closest you get is smut with a relatively original and decently written set-up.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

** Hey :)

I've written the Delacours in a few stories. And I'm writing a few at the moment. There's not a whole lot of plot though. It's heavily smut based. I did however make them mother and daughter (secretly).

** Not at the same time, but [[/u/Sescquatch]] fic Unatoned features Harry with each of them. So, depends on if that's enough for you.

Good plot (and, more broadly, good writing) it certainly has in spades.
