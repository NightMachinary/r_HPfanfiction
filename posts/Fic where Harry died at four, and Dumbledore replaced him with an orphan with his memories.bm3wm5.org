:END:
It was on [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]] way back in the day, fake Harry became a runaway at like seven, when "Harry" learned the prophecy he went and did a whole bunch of body modifications in order to empower himself.


** Its on ffn also. Can't remember the name but fake Harry was named Jack and he was friends with the Oracle of Delphi.

  Prophecies where tricky things and lies are even tricker, Sirius's death becomes a catalyst and Dumbledore's lies crumple like a house of cards. Harry is left with a burning question...Who is he really? Crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Co-written with the lovely Araciel, who got me back into writing, go read her work, all of it is amazing!

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
