I was just wondering is there is any fanfic's out there where Harry is turned into a werewolf and Fleur and Harry start a relationship. It would be nice if it was just purely Harry x Fleur. Thanks.


** I would be actually interested in any good Lupin-bites-somebody-in-the-third-year stories. All I found were two very lame weremione stories (why did she have a tail in both cases?).

*** In FILFY Teacher, a DxD/HP crossover, Harry was bitten in third year. But that's just setup, the primary story happens with an adult Werewolf Harry post-War who's just broken up with a cheating Ginny and moved to Japan to get away. It's basically "Adult Dad Harry in DxD" really, but pretty good if you like that crossover. If you want focus on the post-Third Year stuff, not that, though.

Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?

**** I find it's hard to get up to date on this fanfic because the writer posts MASSIVE chapters. Like +30k words each. Interesting story though, even if I don't know much about dxd
