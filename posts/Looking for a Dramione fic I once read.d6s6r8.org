:END:
The details I remember are :

Dramione, post-Hogwarts?, there was a marriage curse so they had to marry, Draco had a son named Jules (Julian or Julius?), he never spoke about his son's mother (Astoria I think), Draco and Hermione once got transported somewhere dangerous due to the curse, from a party at the manor, Narcissa was nice and loved them together, Hermione was nice to Jules, Dramione slowly fell in love, they played in the manor's garden with Jules when it was snowing, there was a blast somewhere in Diagon Alley when the pair were there. There was also Harry and Ginny, Ron and Lavender, etc, Blaise, etc.

Please give me the name!
