We know that Tom Riddle was in London during the blitz in the summers when he was in Hogwarts and was born in 1920s. So he finishes school somewhere in the 1940s and then starts working at borgin and Burke's for a while before he disappears. It is said that he travelled far and wide for ten years before returning to Hogwarts to hide the diadem.

Are there any stories about these travels? I've been reading for a while now and couldn't find any and would really like to try some. I don't mind good/bad/crazy mindset of Tom and anything goes since it's pretty much unexplored territory.


** Sadly, I only know of a few one-shots and some longer fics that have brief flashbacks to Voldemort's past.

The short stories:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/The-Crown-of-M%C3%A8tis][The Crown of Metis]] - A story about how Voldemort acquired Ravenclaw's Diadem.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][The Children of Set]] - An H.P. Lovecraft inspired story about Tom Riddle searching for ancient knowledge in Egypt.

The following fic co-written by Ansketil also contains some great ideas for Voldemort's travels. I love their take on Voldemort's personality and backstory, but it definitely falls into the "crazy" category, and the HPLV pairing is a turnoff for many people.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][In Somno Veritas]] - Contains some dream sequences from Voldemort's travels, and at one point the characters revisit a location that Voldemort once explored.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
