** This prompt gives me two completely opposite vibes.

Either:

a) Harry is saying that they should kill all muggles.

b) Harry is saying they should leave the planet.

I prefer option b, honestly. There are /way/ too few space-opera like fics.

***** Eh, Rise if the Wizards was actually big in wizards are better. Savior of magic had the war be pretty much one-sided, there was also another in which Harry was an ice elemental in which Voldemort wiped-out the muggle-world with little to no effort and For the Love of Magic had a somewhat equilibrated power balance until Harry gives up and starts the apocalypse in his own terms. All in all it is kind of a mixed bag.

** Really, avoiding war would be super easy.

Step 1: Allow highly qualified muggles to be granted knowledge of the magical world.

Step 2: Hire muggle experts to cooperate with wizards in keeping track of secrecy hazards such as social media.

Step 3: Hire muggle experts in genetic modification and medicine. Also create a fake biotech startup that acts as cover.

Step 4: Have scientists and potioneers create a potion that contains three things: A massively complex mess of modified Crispr proteins, RNA snippets, engineered viruses and other biological elements that looks like it could be a super advanced cancer killer, a magic potion that is undetectable by nonmagical means and renders all that RNA stuff inert, and finally a potion that actually slowly cures cancer. Important: Potions have to be mostly plant-based with as few components of long lived magical creatures (dragons, griffins, ...) as possible.

Step 5: Have gene editing scientists, economic engineers, potioneers, herbologists and enchanters figure out how to mass produce the cancer cure at massive scale, unprecedented for the tiny wizarding world. Here's where minimizing magical creature parts in the potions is important, scaling production of plants by several orders of magnitude is far easier than animals.

Step 6: Have your fake biotech startup sell the magic cancer cure. Might take a while to get it approved since no outsider can make sense of how it works apart from the fact that it does somehow work really well with no major side effects.

Step 7: Cure cancer on a worldwide scale.

Step 8: Repeat process from step 4 for some other extremely hard to cure illness.

Now if secrecy fails, you can immediately jump to step 9: Inform the world about the cure's true nature and publish statistics of how many million lives you saved. Should be a sizeable portion of the population. Now if any leader threatens war you can just respond by pointing out that it'd cut off access to cures, and nobody wants that.

** He gestured to the small dome behind him. Constructed of glass panels and polished brass struts, it reminded many attending the press conference of a greenhouse.

"This is just a model, a demonstration of what the Committee is proposing. While many, myself included, hoped we could continue to share the Earth with Mugglekind, it's become clear that we can't," As Harry looked out at the crowd before him, he saw some people's eyes widen as they finally recognized what he was suggesting.

"Wizards have lived separate from Muggles for generations. We must now fully sever that connection and create a new society on a new world. The early years won't be easy. Muggles have set their sights on the easiest target, Mars, so we must go beyond. But magic," he paused, then repeated forcefully, "Magic will make it possible, and more successful than the Muggles will ever be. But we must begin now! If we act decisively we can be well on our way before the Muggles have even begun."

*** There was noise in the crowd and Harry's fierce gaze wasn't quite enough to contain the murmuring. He scanned the crowd quickly, seeing plenty of lips open or flapping like fish and yet no one spoke. /Give 'em a minute/, he thought, /it was a big proposal/.

Harry looked to the sides of the stage where he could see all that had supported him in what had to sound crazy. Ron, who stood gesturing to him, holding a thump up as if telling him he had done well, Hermione bushy hair covering her eyes and hands over her face, he knew her to be chewing her nails to deal with the nerves. Ginny - Ginny who had promised to follow him wherever he went.

He had been away from her for a whole year, when that whole Horcrux thing had been afoot and he had hated it. He didn't think it was someting he would ever want to go through with again, especially not now Ginny had gifted him with kids. He had what he had never had, a family. He wasn't going to be a coward, as he had tolld Lupin so long ago his father had died to protect him and he would do the same to protect his children.

Finally, as Harry's eyes rested on Ginny in the dark side of the stage for a bit too long someone spoke. It was a question. Harry had expected them to have them. "Why?" or "Are you crazy", he was prepared for them all. Just not the one that actually left the old looking wizard's mouth.

"Are you saying that we'll colonise space? The rest of the system? Where will we stop, do you have a plan?"

Harry's lios thinned in a smile.

"Yes, that's exactly what I propose."

...Someone else piped in, annoying but Harry couldn't say he didn't get it.

"Are you saying then that..."

Before anyone else could interrupt he made his statement, the last one he'd do all night.

"Yes. That's what I'm saying. Wizardkind, all of us? We're going to colonise URANUS"

Witchy young adults excited about traditional mason jars and candles and old fashioned calligraphy

Hordes of kids wanting to buy an intelligent owl to send messages to their friends in the night (bc everybody knows owls sleep by day /duh/)

EVERYONE WANTS TO RIDE A BROOM

Everybody welcomes magic into their lives like coaxing frightened animal to pet it. Noone mentions witch burnings and when someone does none would support it. Magic is /delighted/ by all the attention. As much so it barely notices when wizardkind withdraws; it has all those youths now.
