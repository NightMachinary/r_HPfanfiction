I read a fanfic once that made the point that most Slytherins were closer in character to Slughorn (self-interested and ambitious but very talented and good natured and not actually immoral) than to Draco or Snape.

That fic made the point that under Snape's leadership the house had darkened up considerably, but the majority of inmates even during the books were not actively horrible.

I don't question that; what I question is the absolutely f***ed up (often quite violent) descriptions of a violent scourging being a weekly occurrence, just as an example. That's not abuse, that's attempted murder, and WAY past anything implied in canon (unlike what IS implied in canon, which is plenty to depict the Dursleys in a very damning manner).

The only time I have seen it well done (though I did end up droping the story for another reason) is a fic where the Grangers, after being scared by all the "strange" thing happening around Hermione, send her to some kind of Institute where Harry is already a resident.

I liked it because their meeting was believable (while unaware of Magic at first, the Institute was the only one in the UK taking care of these "strange" cases), and because Hermione was not the only Muggleborn in the world (I remember Harry also being quite close to Dean Thomas, who was sent there for similar reasons).

*** As a literary plot device, rape can actually be used, despite how distasteful it actually is.

For example, Hermione is raped by someone. As a result of the trauma, she becomes more unstable mentally because, you know, she was violated. Or perhaps the rapist is caught yet let off for some reason, such as greased palms, bias, or a DLME screw-up.

From there on, it could go in any direction: Hermione getting revenge. Hermione being powerless to stop the injustice that was done to her and the fallout continues to erode her.

There's actually a film series where this horrific crime is used for the protagonist to get revenge: Day of the Woman/I Spit On Your Grave.

Her friends take matters into their own hands the perpetrator "vanishes" one night.

Unfortunately. instead of being treated as the serious issue, the violation of body it truly is and the serious fallout it creates in a story or as the catalyst of a plot, it just seems to be treated like "rape porn" or a "rape kink".

Same deal with murder or being forced to take a life for some reason: The consequences these wouldn't just be 'brushed off' -- it'd seriously impact the character responsible.

If we take into account that the Death Eaters are most likely alluding to the Nazis, I can promise you they absolutely did rape people who were considered 'beneath' them. It's not sex, or intimacy. It's rape. It's about power, and about seeing the one that you rape as lesser and wanting them to feel that. I personally think it's very much exactly what Death Eaters would do to muggleborns.

Not only the nazis example, but IIRC when the Russians invaded Germany, they did the same. Africans were constantly raped too while enslaved. It is a common way of showing power over someone else, unfortunately.

When an author tries to make out that 'purebloods' haven't done anything wrong in excluding and ostricising muggleborns from magical society, and it's all the fault of the muggleborns for not integrating (into a society that violently doesn't want them).

** - rehashing Canon with no meaningful changes. I know what the plot of the stories is already, I don't need to see the sorting hat's song is unless you're changing it as a plot device

- death eater/voldemort/Snape apologists. I have read some very good apologist works regarding these, but they take a Lot of work to be plausible and enjoyable

- genderflipping. I understand that some people do this so that they can relate to a character better, but the vast majority of the time it's done just to force two characters together

- relationships between 11 year olds. Most boys still find fart jokes funny and think girls are icky, while girls are starting to deal with puberty. No serious relationship before15/16 years ever come off as believable

- giving death eaters/voldemort power ups without buffing the heroes. This turns a difficult journey into a hellishly impossible one. They're rarely fun to read.

- excessive author notes and the phrase "let me know what you want to see in the comments". I enjoy short author notes for the insight. I hate essays longer than the chapter. Also seeing authors asking for suggestions makes me feel like they have no plan.

** I really can't stand “out of character” for the main romance these days. Yes, I /know/ Snape and Harry have a *lot* of issues. That's the /point/! The point is a long detailed story making them actually work out and seem like a perfect couple. The point is to not have Severus see Harry's eyes, blurt out like a first year, “wow your eyes are so pretty” then have sex immediately afterwards and be the perfect couple.... that ones been harping on me for awhile. I like Slytherin/Harry stories because they're a harder ship to manage properly not because I want an extremely out of character crack fic.

I can't stand female Harry at all. I think I've read far to much slash at this point but, no, I don't want to read about “Harriet” becoming “wet!” when she meets /whoever/ for the first time. It's even more annoying when they use Harry‘a name in the summary and don't warn you that it's a “Harriet” book and make you waste your time... speaking of not warning you...

I also hate it when writers don't tag their stories properly. I feel like it's to trick you into reading them when it's a tag you don't want to read. I feel this happens a lot with hermaphrodite-Harry. They use subtly about it until it's a full in sex scene and then the main love interest is going off in their head about Harry's vagina. Like, where did THAT come from? How did I miss it in the 20+ chapters?! There was only one time I was okay with hermaphrodite-Harry not being tagged and that was an extremely heavy book where the author warned heavily on body modifications, rape, use of sexual potions and spells against ones will, etc. The author warned the readers about it without /saying/ it because she didn't want to spoil part of her book. Tags are there for a reason, and on AO3 tags are super easy to manage IMO (I've written on there). Just tag books correctly!

Agree. I'm working on a fic right now with that exact premise - Harry is smarter than in canon and gains a level of control over his magic at a younger age, which has a butterfly effect on canon events. But a lot of my readers seem to view the story as an AU and often ask questions with the assumption that I'm going to be playing hard and fast with the rules of canon even though the only changes I've made are either a direct result of Harry's changed circumstances or little things that technically could have been true in canon but just weren't shown.

Comically evil, abusive Lucius Malfoy. - this is just a personal thing. Lucius Malfoy has (somehow, don't ask, it just happened) become my favorite character to read and write about. Bar none. And somehow through reading just about every fic I can, that has him in a big role, I became incredibly picky with the kind of Lucius I want to read about. There are some really good Drarry or Dramione or Draco redemption fics out there... yet the moment they introduce evil, abusive Lucius - shwoop! I'm out of there.

Lord Harald Black-Peverell-Prince. Overall a lot of pureblood politics fics.

Unless the summary and Tags look REALLY NICE most magical creative AU's I avoid. So no Vampir/Veela/Hinkypunk Harry for me. (Werewolf is ok).

Genderbend... Trans Characters is ok if done well, as long as they keep their pronouns.

On that note, really most fics that give the characters random new names, I click away from.

Most Fics that have Snape in a Major pairing... their are some exceptions that i read regardless and even enjoyed, but for the most part I have no interest in that whatsoever. (Namely, due to my aforementioned Obsession to read everything where lucius is in... turns out there are quite a few snape/hermione stories where he Features in....)

*** Lucius Malfoy is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite characters to read about in fanfiction. Even back in the days of 2008 I would scour the internet for well-written stories or even write my own featuring him. There's something about him that gripped my attention and has never let go; I absolutely adore reading the rare redemption arc story written for him, or the even rarer fics that let us see him as a father. The man was an arsehole in every sense of the word, but HBP makes it beyond clear that Draco loved his father and Narcissa her husband - their dedication to him is one that I find fascinating, because even Snape points it out.

As you said though, there's plenty of downright stinkers that make Lucius out to be a moustache-twirling hyper-villain that tends to engage in a lot of forced sexual acts and torture with usually underage Hermione/Ginny. Or is an awful, abusive father that takes great pleasure in beating his son. Those things usually come out of nowhere with no warning, too. I don't see it nearly as much nowadays, but there used to be a popular trend of Harry/Lucius fics that were almost always entirely cantered around Lucius engaging in essentially raping and abusing Harry, and once again the authors never gave any warning which left curious readers like me constantly getting so far in only to have to retreat the moment that stuff reared it's ugly head.

Don't get me wrong, Lucius was a dark and potentially abhorrent man. He was Voldemort's right hand man at the peak of the first wizarding war and I'm sure Barty Crouch Jr as Mad-Eye makes a comment about old Lucius and the awful things he'd done during that time period. He was one of the death eaters at the Quidditch World Cup that wholly endorsed and probably laughed at the little muggle boy being span around in the air like a top. He wanted the Chamber of Secrets reopened. But that cruelty didn't infest every part of his life, he was a good father (outside of radicalising his son) and evidently a good husband, and even a good friend to Snape from Hogwarts all the way until the time Severus died. I wanna read about that side of Lucius. I wanna explore more of him. Give me the good and bad together, rather than some over the top villain with no humanity whatsoever. Especially in Dramione/Drarry redemption fics where people are depicted as being grey rather than static black and white.

Do you have any recommendations for some good LM fanfictions? Any pairing is good if you do!

**** Oh I'm so glad to find a fellow Lucius fan. For me I just love his downfall in canon. He goes from being one of the most powerful men (politically) to almost losing everything. His own hybris lands him in Azkaban and later he's abused and humiliated in his own home by the very man he dedicated years of his life to. At the same time, he's forced to watch as Voldemort twists and manipulates Draco. Ultimately, he only cares about getting his family home safely. Which gives him just enough redeeming qualities in my eyes to both root for his betterment, but also wanting to see him suffer just a bit in fics. He's one of the few characters where as long as his characterization is right, I love to see both the good and the bad. I can enjoy him both in a fluffy family story, as well as in a dark torture fic where he gets his commupance. I both enjoy him struggling with his own past mistakes, as well as haughtily turning his nose at the Weasleys, thinking he's better.

Sadly, somehow, in Fanon it's mostly just forgotten or ignored that he also tried to protect his son. Narcissa gets the most credit for that. I don't know how many fics I've read that show both her and Draco as victims of Lucius abuse and vile bigotry, even when I'm certain, Narcissa's worldview was very much in line with Lucius'. Your absolutely right, most fics don't even warn you before throwing a cruel and abusive Lucius at you...which sadly makes me believe that many fans perceive that to be the truth... Never mind, it's such a convenient way of redeeming Draco, cause we all know, racist acts are much easier forgiven when committed by somebody who was the victim of any sort of abuse themselves.

If you have any fics I gladly take recomnendations too. As for some I remember (I have to admit, to my shame, I'm one of those people who devour fics but don't remember the titles /authors):

I really like Muggle Studies by speculating, which I surely read once every two years. (It's Lucius/adult Hermione) The Ties that bind us, blind us by accio_magic (though a but short, 😅) Sententia by Anchanee (mostly a Drarry fic and Lucius takes very much a backseat in the second half) And I actually quite enjoyed Life Adapted by MGL_Dramione_Lover (which you guessed it is a Dramione fic. There are actually Parts of it that I normally don't like in fanfic like souldbonds, and a somewhat perfect Malfoy child, nur Lucius character is great)

***** We fans need to stick together considering there seems to be so few of us!

As you so succinctly explained, there is a duality in Lucius that is really quite expertly exposed through the course of his fall from grace. It's rare we get to see characters at both their best and worst in canon materials, but with Lucius we get to see both, and we therefore get to see what otherwise is left to the imagination. We get to revel in and detest him for his smooth arrogance and cruel intelligence when he's in control and planning the deaths of muggle-born children in what is essentially a cleansing of Hogwarts, but we're also challenged by and somewhat endeared to him by his enduring love for his family and the vulnerability exposed when he causes his own downfall.

The same almost goes for Snape, we see mostly bad throughout Harry's time as a student, but Deathly Hallows gives us just enough of a glance at the good that sprang from the pain of his own selfish mistakes that he becomes grey and thus much more interesting.

Absolutely, I cannot stand the fanon trope of Lucius singlehandedly being the abusive, bigoted husband, when as you said, Narcissa very much stood by those same beliefs. It's noted on Pottermore that when Astoria later started teaching Scorpius about being tolerant of muggles and muggleborns, Narcissa and Lucius both were frustrated and disappointed. They are each snobbish, bigoted people but they stood together through it all. One of my favourite moments of all the series is in Deathly Hallows, ‘The Dark Lord Rising' where we see Narcissa holding Lucius' hand under the table as Voldemort mocks and belittles them. It's such a small gesture, she doesn't even look at her husband - but Narcissa holds on and comforts her husband through everything. If that isn't symbolic of their love and Narcissa's desire to protect Lucius just as much as Draco, I don't know what is.

But as you said, evil Lucius makes it much easier to redeem Draco without much effort when it comes to fanfiction. I'm not necessarily totally against it, Lucius was by no means a good man, but just like Vernon Dursley, the abuse and cruelty is usually written to such an extreme degree in fanfiction it becomes disturbing to read and completely does away with the character, instead replacing them with a torturer with no purpose other than “hurt the main character so much that their otherwise out of character change of heart makes sense”.

I actually don't have any other recommendations outside of what you and I/BaronVonRuthleas91 suggested! I've been wracking my brains and searching through my old bookmarks but yeah, there's not really much out there! Thank you so much though, and I shall certainly update if I find anything good on my travels!

** Harry-centric stories.

I don't know, but I'm starting to get the feeling that writers don't like canon!Harry all that much. They change his characterization too much. They either make him too smart or too motivated or too evil or too unforgiving. He might as well be a self-insert for how much of canon!Harry is left in these stories. So no, I nope out of them.

Also, emphasis on gender roles in fics with heterosexual pairings. I can't stand fics where the women are happily slaving in the kitchen while the men are getting drunk in the living room for example. Or that bit where sons can do whatever they please but there is such a tight leash on the daughter. It's so annoying, and they get an instant no from me these days.

Like when the story is super cool and action-ey and then Harry reveals his traumatic backstory and the whole plot is put on hold so all his friends can hug him and tell him he didn't deserve it and that the dursleys suck ect. for the next 4 chapters. I mean yea thats how you're supposed to treat those kinds of situations but when it completely derails the genre just keep him traumatized bro its better for the plot, trust me.

- A/B/O (or any other wierd fetish relationship model) I dont think I have to go into this one.

- AU that doesn't tell you its an AU until some random character shows up and starts talking about things that didn't happen in canon. Yes I'm talking about that Harry/Daphne GoF fic where it just drops her in and goes "actually she's been hanging out with Harry in secret for the past 3 years so this isn't sudden or wierd yeah totally." This also goes for any story that thinks that's how you make people care about the dynamic between two people.

- Harry spontaneously becoming an entitled douchebag out of nowhere. Usually in the first 5 minutes after a fic starts. You can't miss it.

- Harry spontaneously knowing about wierd laws whose only purpose is to solve whatever problem he happens to be having with the least effort required. Like, really? If you're going through the trouble of making a plot point at least make it an actual plot point ok?

- Ancient and Noble House bullshit. There is an exception, though: when Harry's first reaction to it is "hey lets use this convenient political power to troll politicians and completely destroy the system that gave me this political power" (see: A Black Comedy). Like seriously whenever they use this crap its always "well, this clearly flawed political system puts the protagonist at the top and makes it legal for him to have a harem so is it really that bad? Lets just kill Voldemort and say everything's fine now" and every time I get those vibes I die a little inside

** I really hate it when they make a character blatantly evil and then immediately stick them in slytherin or use slytherin as a pint to show “oh look their so evil!” I have no problem with the character being evil and dark but just sticking them in slytherin because they can is annoying like just because they decide to make Hermoine evil and dark doesn't mean she automatically would carry the values and world view of a slytherin anyways it just annoys me to no end.

Also extreme bashing without any proper motive you can't tell me that Dumbledore is evil and doing all these horrible things for no reason or a reason so out of character I see this a lot with Hermoine, Ginny and Ron where they have them all turn on Harry for the stupidest reasons instead of actually picking smth that would make them do it like with Ginny instead of just being an evil and slipping love potions to Harry for money or some other stupid reason give me smth where she never recovered fully from being possessed by Riddle or where she was convinced that she had no other choice or because they genuinely believed it was the right thing to do their griffindors for gods sake they wanna do what they believe is right but just having these nonsense reasons make me want to pull my hair out.

Dumbledore basically being an all powerful manipulative god if your gonna make him evil at least make it somewhat realistic instead of just making him omnipotent.

I have more but you guys already covered a lot of them

Haphne

fem!Harry (unless the character is significantly different than canon Harry because otherwise what's the point? Pureblood Pretense pulls this off well because Harry is basically an OC).

fem!Voldemort why???

Over the top Dumbledore and Weasley bashing (why does Ron need to turn into Draco Malfoy in so many Slytherin!Harry stories?)

*** As much as I like Harry/Daphne, I can understand your frustrations: As most authors just use the cookie cutter Ice Queen Greengrass and its associated tropes these days, Haphne has become stale. :(

Fem!Harry... yeah. Just either OC's, SI's, or "bait and switches". A lot of Fem!Harry stories are agenda-driven by authors, too.

*** I would agree with everything you say, save for fem!Voldemort being bad. I guess it allows the author to right off the bat show that their version of Voldemort is very different from canon. It also allows them to make Voldemort more sympathetic, since people tend to sympathize with female characters more.

​

Plus, it allows for a Harry/fem!Voldemort (if the age gap allows it), like it's going to be in Departure from the Diary.

** MC being with more than one person (I'm not against people who are, I just prefer reading monogamy)

Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione - don't like them in canon so I'm not going to read them in fanfiction

Harry/Hermione - no, just no. They are best friends and that's it

OP/Anything that makes Harry way more knowledgeable than the professors when he is still learning. Like I read a scene when he was all "Why do we need to learn certain spells to Transfigure when all it is is intent" and proceeded to cast some wandless Transfiguration that even McGonagall couldn't do.

I also severely dislike fem!Harry unless he chooses to become a female. I loved Holly where Hermione brews a few potions to make him a female. Link below.

** I usually nope my way out of Dramoney and Drarry as fast a possible. (If the fic have a redemption of Draco, than that is okay, but romance, no thank you.) Also, no Harry ship with characters like Snape or Voldemort. There are some ships that would never make sense, and you really have to work to get halfway decent. But I will also say that in the hand of a good (or more likely amazing) writer, almost anything could be possible. I once read an interesting Bella/Harry fic, but to get that to work the author had to rewrite the entire character of Bella to be one of a slave trapped in her own mind that was finally freed by Harry. I feel that when you go to such lengths to make something work you should usually just make an OC. Though, again. An amazing writer that really knows what they are doing can get anything to work. E.g. I used to not read harem fics, but then I found one by Silently Watches called Faery Heroes that was really good, and actually made it work and made me more open minded to such fics.

Also, other tropes I usually say nope to include, angst that never ever end, too OP harry, fics with torture, abuse, etc... that have no point and DARK!/EVILLORD! harry.

To conclude, an amazing writer can do almost anything in a good and consistent way, unfortunately most writers are not Amazing. (Not that there is anything wrong with that. Writing fan fictions is a good way to become a better writer. I myself am planing my first fanfic now to practice writing. Also people have different definitions of a good writer and what they want to read, and that is entirely okey. And I think that is what is so amazing with fanfictions. You usually find whatever you want to read, independent of what others might think.)

** I can't stand anything more than the barest hint of bashing. Quite unfortunate because most fics have it at least somewhat with at least one character. It seems OOC to me. Many people might not even consider this bashing, but for example if Harry/the trio suddenly decide that they can't trust Dumbledore anymore it doesn't seem realistic to me. It just seems like the author is channeling their own opinion on the character. And it also takes away a lot of the complexities of the characters and makes them one dimensional. Nothing is better than when a fic absolutely nails a nuanced portrayal of Snape/Dumbledore.

** If Harry's abandoned by James and Lily and then forgives them. Maybe I'm just a vengeful prick but I would not be so kind. Also fics that have an extreme definition of bashing. For example Ron was shown in cannon to be a bit of a disgusting eater. Now it wasn't everytime they were in the great hall eating that it was mentioned. So I'll grant some of you that some fics go annoyingly overboard on that; however, if someone chews with their mouth open that's disgusting. Calling it such is not bashing. Doesn't mean they're a terrible person, but that is disgusting. Lastly super powerful 11 yearold Harry, and obnoxiously overconfident Harry.

** Drarry, Snape/Harry, Harry/Tom I've only read two fics I enjoying that pull Drarry and Harry/Tom off really well with good explanations.

The Weasley siblings bashing - I enjoy fics that (rightfully) criticize Molly's parenting but I hate Ron Weasley Bashing. It's like omg Ron Weasley is a manipulative rapist at the age of twelve who only wants Harry's money and fame! Like dude they are fucking kids don't make that a thing.

Hermione Mary Sue/Overpowered

I see this with Harry too but fic authors turn Hermione into a golden character with no flaws who can do anything and then dismiss either both Ron and Harry or just Ron and then make Harry and Hermione a couple. The Golden Trio is meant to be a foil for the characters but instead they make one or two perfect and disregard everything else.

Manipulate Albus Dumbledore

He's definitely an asshole and manipulative however every fic makes this a million times worse. Like he's paying for Harry to be abused by the Dursley's and stealing Harry's power and money that Harry must then discover by inheritance test at gringotts.

And wrong boy who lived where Lily and James abuse Harry or abandon him with no contact are the worse.

A little smut in a story is understandable, but if it has more Fifty Shades of Gray, it's too much •Basic retelling of Canon •Overused clichés not done well. If they are some well they are fine, enjoyable even, but when they aren't done well it just gets annoying

And last, but not least, if it's on Wattpad, I nope the fuck out. Largely due to the absolute Shit layout of the app.
