In response to [[/u/Vercalos]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/h04i4t/he_stared_long_and_hard_at_ollivander_how/][prompt]] from a few days ago I originally posted a few hundred words in a comment, intending it to be just a one-shot, but then someone asked for more, my Muse awoke, and I give you ... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13611655/1/The-Wandmaker-s-Rest][The Wandmaker's Rest]]. Five brief chapters, complete. I hope you enjoy it and would very much welcome constructive criticism.


** Glad my prompt inspired you.

Wish they inspired me half as much :P
