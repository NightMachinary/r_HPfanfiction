  You've read the wbwl ones where Harry is abandoned. But what if he wasn't? What if he was kept and loved the same amount as his brother? See the Potter Twins face off against the challenges the world has for them and attempt to come out on top. Certain Weasley, Hermione bashing, Dumbldeore, Snape bashing. OC is Daniel Potter. Pairings undecided.

** The only one I ever found was by an author called The Santi, it was an amazing fic but for some reason he just vanished into thin air ending at a cliffhanger which was a massive disappointment.
