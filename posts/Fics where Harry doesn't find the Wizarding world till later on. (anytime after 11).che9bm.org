  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

*** Great recommendation. I just reread that story a few weeks ago and hope the author eventually writes a sequel, but it also stands on it's own.

** Linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina) is a fic I love. I saw a recommendation for crammer for delinquents because of that fic so, maybe what you're looking for? Crammer for delinquents is on my to read list.

Life skills has homeless!Harry who nonetheless manages to get by and evade capture for years, and is ambivalent when he does find out about the Wizarding world.

The author has a really interesting method of storytelling that's light and fun, and some really hilarious moments in their fics. They also have a long series I recommend on AO3 too.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

  Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?

** Shameless self promotion, but linkao3(17469269) Harry's a squib who doesn't know about the Wizarding World until he gets kidnapped by Wormtail. Chaos ensues.

  Harry James Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Chosen One, etc. is a squib with no knowledge of the magical world. By general consensus, he is most useful as potions ingredients. General consensus being unanimous agreement by everyone except one Harry James Potter. But who cares about his opinion anyway?(aka: Harry is having a good day, until the part where he gets teleported into a creepy graveyard with some even creepier... cult members?)

There's nothing sexually explicit but it's still not for everyone.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
