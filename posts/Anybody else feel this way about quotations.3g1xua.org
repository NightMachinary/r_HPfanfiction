** In British English single quotation marks are preferred when marking a quote. Rowling also uses the single quotation marks in her books. (In the British version).

** Hate to break it to you, but that's British English. Surprised me the first time, too. You want proof? This my copy of Philosopher's Stone. I bought a beautiful set a few years back when I was studying abroad in England. One thing that also surprised me was the lack of a period after Mr. or Mrs. To be honest, you found a fanfic writer who is ACTUALLY British. Doesn't mean they are better at writing Harry Potter, but it does have a little bit more authenticity.

** From my understanding, the use of 'quote' instead of "quote" is simply a difference in region. British books use the first style, while American texts use the later.

If you are used to the American style it can be a tiny bit offputting to see the other style, so your feelings and opinions are valid ones, even if both ways of using quotes are technically correct.

** As everyone else said, it's a British-English thing, but as an Englishman I do actually agree with you. Not so much that I'll stop reading (though I can't recall often coming across it in fanfic), but I think double quotes look better--at least for speech. While it appears to be standard to use singles for quotes inside speech if you use doubles for speech itself (and vice versa), for quotes in the narrative people seem to use the same quotation mark that they use for speech. Personally, I prefer to use doubles for speech and singles for unspoken quotes; it helps differentiate between the two.

**** I agree. They don't separate the quotes enough, especially when used in a sentence 'where they say something' and then stop for a moment 'and say something else.' It just looks out of place then. But I also agree with the others that it's just a regional preference that we grew up with.

** In Britain we're never officially taught but it's this: "[insert content here]" for speech and '[insert phrase here]' for quotation. Yeah, it's just a thing that happens. Monkey see, monkey do.

It's never made me stop reading to see that messed up, though I do get incredibly confused when someone has a literal paragraph of text using "[content]" for speech /and/ quotations.

** I'm going to be honest, I use ' for personal thoughts, " for speech, and italics for flashbacks without doing that stupid /Flashback start/.

** What I find strange about all of this is that I've seen only around 5-10% of fics with these kind of quotations. I'd figure at least 30% of fanfiction writers were British. Yet all American writers are consistent.

*** In schools there's never any issue with us using doubles and none of my uni professors said anything about it either and I studied creative writing, so I think most English writers are going to be using doubles, but in published fiction they always use single quotes. It's peculiar.

*** 319+ million people in the US.

64+ million people in the UK.

30% would be quite a stretch. I imagine the actual percentage is between 5 and 10% with 1-5% of that number actually being from other countries that have studied English. I use double quotation marks for my drafts and single quotation marks for my final drafts.

** Yes. I don't care how they do it in Britain, it doesn't make it any easier for me to read it. I can't read a story that does that.

** Yeah, it's how we were taught in school (UK)... and it pretty much burned me when I first started writing online. A couple reviewers actually mentioned that single quotes were too bothersome, so I actually went through each chapter to revise them manually lol. Still forget sometimes, though.

** I use the doubles precisely because of this reaction, but I am also British so literally the only reason I don't do it in my fanfics is because Americans get annoyed and complain about it. Like, Americans will complain about the smallest language differences and I'm just like "w/e" so sometimes it's easier to just comply. I'll never go with 'Mom' though because it's ridiculous to hear a British person say, and 'trash can' or 'sidewalk'... these are just not words we use.
