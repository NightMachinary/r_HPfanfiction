As the title says, what is the number one one shot that you have read, and that has left an impact on you.

​

The one that you can never stop reading again and again, of any genre


** There are two master Occlumens teaching at Hogwarts. What happens when Harry takes lessons with the other one, and not Snape?

Lessons with Hagrid is superb - I highly recommend giving it a shot if you haven't already.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

*** I hate when fics try to justify their existence using a canon quote like this. Because when their argument is inevitably wrong, it positions the fic in a much more negative light.

The fic could have just said "Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Hagrid was an Occlumens?" and that would have been fine. But instead it tried to make a clever point about canon and failed (Quirrell =/= Voldemort).

  Jungkook of course has heard the ghost stories before. It's the first thing you hear about when you join the company, the rumors about a phantom that haunts JinHit Entertainment's building. He's not sure how the story started or why it became so popular, why so many people seem to at least consider the possibility that it might be true, Taehyung being one of those people. Jungkook doesn't believe in ghosts. But even if he did, he never once during the two years he's been a trainee has heard or seen anything that would indicate that the phantom exists. “Hyung, I think that if JinHit was hunted, we would have realized it by now,” he says. * Jungkook doesn't believe in ghosts until he does.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

And it has my favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic ever:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** Ok, I've read a lot of one-shots most of them silly and shippy or pwp, but I still couldn't chose just one.

Linkffn(The Animagus and the Owl); linkao3(Obliviate)

Those are anon compliant and nicely explain things that had left me rising my eyebrows in canon. First one deals with Hogwarts seemingly not contacting parents when something happens to their children with an example of telling Weasleys about Scabbers/Peter fiasco. The second one explores Hermione's relationship with her parents, especially focusing on a interaction leading to the obliviation.

Now, I just realized how many hilarious Hermione/Tom|Voldemort one-shots I've read, it's impossible to choose favorite

Linkao3(The Facilities Expert); Linkao3(Lions and Serpents); Linkffn(Once Upon a Dream); Linkao3(communication errors); Linkffn(How Hermione Granger Learned About Shipping)

In the first two there's not really any pairing, so if you adverse to it you should be safe. The last one is an absolute crack that collects all possible awful clichés and thrust a canon Hermione into them. Once Upon a Dream is a great play upon eastern eggs/references. Communication errors made me dubious about format but turned out easy to read, weirdly believable and in-canon.
