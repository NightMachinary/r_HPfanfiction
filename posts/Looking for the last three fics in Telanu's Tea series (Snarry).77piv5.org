So I remember reading these forever ago (and by forever I mean like 10 years ago, an epoch in fandom time) and now I know they were once on ao3--- I remember because I noted them like, oh three years ago, and I was like oh yeah those I should read those again--- but they've disappeared, and my usual archive/google-fu tricks aren't working. Does anyone have a copy they could send me or a link they could post? I know these were very popular fics at one point and I'm kind of devastated not to be able to find them now. Thank you if you can.

*** Thank you! You have know idea how much fumbling around on archive.org and befuddled googling I did last night. Oh thank you, that's such a relief- it's like I wanted to go back and reread, say, The Hobbit, only to find that all the copies are burned and gone, ugh. Thanks again!
