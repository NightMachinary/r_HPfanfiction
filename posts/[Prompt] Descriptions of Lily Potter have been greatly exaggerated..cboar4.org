She was actually quite the blood ritualist back in the day. Through the lens of the past, most people who had described Lily to Harry had misconstrued what Lily was /really/ like. Lily was indeed quite good at Charms, but also went on to excel in Ancient Runes, as well as developing an obsessive fascination with blood magic.

In school, she remained polite to the teachers, but constantly hounded her classmates for blood samples for "experimentation purposes." She disregarded both her own and others' safety during her many experiments. Her relationship with Snape was more of a one-sided obliviousness due to her other obsessions, and James would only go on to date her because he was the sole student who was brave enough to ask her out up front.

Later on, when Lily and James were in hiding with Harry, Lily thought it would be hilarious to turn Harry into 'a living deathtrap,' and that granting him the ability to burn Voldemort's face off on contact was 'totally badass.' She felt that killing Voldemort would be her coolest and bestest accomplishment yet, and that she would go down in history as the Woman-Who-Blew-Up-Voldemort.

Unfortunately, Lily held off on the completion of the ritual until October 31st so that it would be /"thematically appropriate."/ When Voldemort attacked, Lily was forced to take action and, in a bout of madness, decided to use /herself/ as the blood catalyst, screaming "SHOOT ME, SHOOT ME FIRST" even as Voldemort offered to spare her.

She would have been quite outraged if she were alive to find out that Harry got all the credit.


** This is hilarious.

** I love this! I've always headcanoned that Lily had a talent for blood or dark magic and that she lacked the taboo association from a childhood with Snape. Baby Harry having special powers makes 0 sense, love doesn't actually save people bc plenty of magic parents have died protecting kids: the only logical answer is Lily did something. Not that anyone would give her credit bc of her blood status.

*** My headcanon is that Voldemort made a promise to Snape to spare Lily, part one of the accidental ritual. Then, three times, he asked her to stand aside, fulfilling his promise. Three times, she said no, don't kill Harry, take me instead. So he killed her, thus binding his promise to Harry in exchange for Lily.

When he sent the Killing Curse at Harry, having made a magically-binding promise through this accidental ritual/magical contract, his own magic revolted, reflecting the curse back at him.

*** My headcanon is that it has something to do with Harry's Peverell blood, the concept of the Peverells being this ancient and powerful family which had some divine connection to death always sounded cooler to me. Lily to me, was just a medium for the magic to protect Harry.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
