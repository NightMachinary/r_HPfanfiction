Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly update if at all possible

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes.

If there is any Weasley Bashing please tell me ahead of time.

Maybe the pairing was minor or major or somewhere in between, in the story that's fine.

Note mention the pairing and any stories with that pairing that you like.


** Luna / Hermione

I got into it after reading Crazy Little Things by Dreiser and they became my OTP.

** My favourite ship is probably Harry/Ron/Hermione, which is annoyingly hard to find good stories about. There is linkao3(tell me whether he is dead) which is amazing, and fluffy as hell, though hardly romantic. Then there is linkao3(Relentless, We Survive) which is an Assassin's Creed crossover. It's a good enough fic, unfortunately abandoned before it could get to the more interesting parts.

For something different, there is linkao3(Shadow Magic by Lomonaaeren) which is Harry/Theo, and it's one of my favourite fics in general.

** My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron. The Trio friendship and relationship is a fundamental theme in the Series, and I love seeing them getting together. I'm not bothered by the unconventional M/F/M relationship. Given how many writers push M/Multis, why can't I support my favorite female character have both her beloved boys?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]] is the best, but the author avoided romantic depictions of their relationship, only stating that they live and sleep together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]] is rather an unique crossover. There are more battleship actions than relationship scenes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]] is pure smut, but very good smut.

***** Thanks. Agreed, "Sum" is a great fic.

"Girl who walked on water" I gave a try like 6 months ago, despite usually avoiding everything written by Starfox5, his style just rubs me wrong, and sadly it held true again. Couldn't get into it even tho weird crossovers are pretty much my favorite fics.

Will give "No Boundaries" a bookmark for later reading, thanks again.

** Harry/Andromeda in linkffn(What we lost). Just because it makes so much sense the way it happens in the story that it could have been canon. I am a sucker for may/December relationships, and this one really stuck with me as one of my favorite. Never found something that came close to this. The one thing I truly dislike about it is the veneer of death eater apologia (the malfoys/regulus).

There is a sequel but while the beginning of it is fantastic, it is going in a direction I really don't care for.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

  My answer to Reptilia28's “Don't Fear the Reaper” Challenge. Six times has Harry Potter died young instead of fulfilling his destiny of killing Tom Riddle and of marrying his soulmate Hermione. The seventh time that Harry's soul is sent into his younger body, Harry keeps his older memories and he has a plan. But this time, if he fails, both his body and soul shall die.This is an H/Hr story that bashes Dumbledore and our most unfavourite Weasleys.
