I read little uzumaki by lucilla and I thought this would make a great fanfiction The golden trio Or just Harry and Hermione Find the fountain of youth in 3rd year And are Forcibly deaged To 2 years old maybe Sirius is deaged as well but to 7 or 8 years old but because he is an animagus He retains his memories Cue chaos and shenanigans as everyone flips out
