I was just wondering if anyone had any information on the Aorist Subjunctive series by Minisinoo. I know she took down her site The Medicine Wheel, so its hard to come by news of the series. Anyone have any idea on the status of this series. I couldn't find anything using google search.


** She gave up writing fanfic many years ago, it was a very sad day for me. Dulce et Decorum Est was left uncompleted, as was the Aorist Subjunctive series.

I have a particular soft spot for Chronicles in her Aorist Subjunctive series, as it's the only fic I ever beta'd. She wanted a gay guy's perspective on the chapters about Cedric in gay London.

/Sigh/
