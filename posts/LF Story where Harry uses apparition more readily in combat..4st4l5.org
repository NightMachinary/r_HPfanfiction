I had the sudden idea that if Harry took advantage of his appearing on the roof of his school and developed his "jumping" skill (that he later learns is apparition) he could become like the Shunshin no Shisui from Naruto.

Tl;dr Is there a fic where Harry becomes adept at battle apparition and uses it readily?


** I assume that generally, one side or the other casts Anti-Apparition Jinxes right away in any given combat, since they don't want the other side to escape. It certainly would be a standard tactic for Aurors trying to arrest anyone, and Death Eaters trying to massacre a their enemies.

So, I would assume that battle apparition would be of very limited use against enemies - suitable for a battle where you want to drive of attackers, maybe, and don't care if they escape.

*** I agree in a long drawn out fight or when trying to apprehend a criminal there would be an anti-apparition jinx or ward, but i am immagining a blitzkrieg style attack where Harry and maybe one or two others all dressed alike and wearing the same mask/ cloak to hide their identities show up with harry or one of them being first and then using apparition to make it seem like that one person is incredibly powerful to appear in 3 places at once. Also if it is not technically apparition and is just Harry using a "unknown ability ie jumping/ flicker/ phasing" he could circumvent the jinx and if it were well written, he could use it selectively and with drawbacks to keep him from being OP.

**** The problem is that unless there is something that has to be defended, the best and most natural reaction to a surprise attack is to apparate or portkey away.

** While I agree with [[/u/Starfox5]] about apparition not being useful in battle (but for a different reason), linkffn(Brutal Harry) and its sequel linkffn(Hero Harry) come to mind. Spoiler alert: they both suck. Brutal has its moments until it shits the bed in the last few chapters, and Hero is incredibly incoherent.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
