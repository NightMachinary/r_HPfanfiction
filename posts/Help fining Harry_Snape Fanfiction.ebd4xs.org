:END:
Ages ago I read this fic and wanted to re read it. Its a Harry/Snape pairing. Due to some sort of prophecy they are forced to marry/bond using a really old ritual so that Harry can tap into Snape's power and use it to defeat Voldemort. They need to become lovers so that the ritual works and Harry can use Snape's powers. I believe it takes place in his last year of Hogwarts and afterwards. Snape is still an undercover Death Eater. I remember when the ritual takes place there needed to be witnesses and there was Albus and Arthur. I think its split into two stories, not sure.

I tried finding it on my own and have had no luck!

Please help!
