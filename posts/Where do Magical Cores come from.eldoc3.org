I've seen a lot of mention of them in fanfic, but nothing hints at them in canon. Where did the notion originate, and why do people still like it?

I find it extremely annoying when "Magical Core Size" is used like DBZ Power Levels or as a way to bash someone. (Example of both: Dumbledore restricted Harry's magical core to keep him weak and docile, but now that the restriction is lifted, he can kick everyone's ass!)

What are you guys' thoughts?


** It /sounds/ like it is inspired by eastern literature. In the chinese Xianxia or Wuxia (I always mix them up) it's about attaining godhood. On that journey, you are amassing energy in your daintain, which turns into a core at some point, which turns into something else, ad infinitum.

​

Personally, I like the idea of magical cores because it gives a /reason/ people have magic. None of this "you're a wizard, but besides being able to do magic, you are 100% indistinguishable from any muggle schmuck you pick off the street.

​

Another plus side is being able to measure the cores. In canon they keep throwing around that Harry is powerful. That's it. This gives a way to quantify that, and you can even throw in some "pure-bloods are magically weaker because of inbreeding".

​

Oh, I just figured out a way to measure magical energy a person has, strength, and whatnot. Boil water with a channeled flame spell of some sort. Since you can't cast magic forever, you have data points to measure against everybody: how long to boil, how long you can boil, highest heat, etc. Everyone says it's impossible, but I say YEAH SCIENCE BITCH!

*** We never really /see/ these limits in canon though. To me, it looks like wizards draw from some external source or possibly multiple sources, or maybe even their own emotions.

Where in canon did they explicitly state that Harry's powerful? The Patronus doesn't count, since everyone and their mother can do it in Bk. 5.

**** I think it was book 5, 6, or 7.

I don't think it counts either, but for a different reason. It's an intent/memory based charm.

waitwaitwait... Doesn't Harry feel drained while learning the Patronus? Or was that when he was practicing near the Dementors?

***** This just supports the theory that magic is at least partially dependent on emotion. Canon supports this a lot. Accidental magic is done when emotions run high. Patronus and Cruciatus run on emotions (happiness and hatred, respectively). Dementors drain people's emotions and their magic somehow.

** Harry Potter is smack dab somewhere in the middle of Hard magic system and soft magic system.

Magical cores make power quantifyable like mana bars in video games. Good writers usually use this style of magic(hard) to make magic more of a tool and impose limits. It shows magic as a finite resource or something that has concenquence like die if you empty mana pool. This way its kinda the Force in Star Wars where Midiclorian count says how sensitive to the force one is and how much they can utilize it or Fullmetal alchemist with its Law of Equivalence. While soft magic system is more like Percy Jackson or LOTR where magic is wild living force you dont mess with. But in Harry Potter there is no magic limits other than knowledge, state of mind and body as the only power regulator. Cant create love or resurect the dead is another but generally there's little to no limit. So, cores are made to "impose" more rules to magic and make it more limited or structured.

My problem with most magic core trope user is that they use this excuse, the magic core is now unbound you're powerful now and can do all neat stuff. Usually, a person gets power boost when they reach their peak, Villain is above current power cap or they get emotional growth or something. Its like they mention a limit only applicable to others and not the hero. A methos to just say, well my Potter is way stronger than Canon!Potter. Its the same way why people hate the later seasons Legend of Korra and Naruto, their hard "magic" system becames this over the top awesome fight but destroyed established hard magic system. It became spectacle instead of growth and tactics, its not a plot armour anymore but a deus ex machina. A god like version where while still relatively consistent came out of nowhere and stuckout like a sore thumb.

My thought with magic core binding: Heck why not let the constraints be the thing making Harry stronger like, in yu yu hakusho training, in short, placed to deliberately force magic to get stronger but since he removed it he became weak as others grow stronger. Or why not go Naruto route and the bindings are for Horcux as kyuubi subtitute. Or even a binding to prevent magic from eating up the body and thus unleashing it started to cause their body to breakdown because they are unused to it. The bindings are meant to self break when the tolerance level of the body increases. But no.... It is ALMOST always used to simply establish BAD/EVIL!Dumbledore or even to simply Bash Albus. Dude, if you only add that to establish Albus is evil, clearly you desperately need to learn writing better Villains/Antagonists.

** Plot service, for one. It's a quick and easy way to make Super!Harry if he has a great big core that no one can compete with. Or you can have bindings, locks, blocks, and the like.

It works, for two. Tropes are tropes because creativity is hard.

Laziness, for three. See #2.

It comes from “anime” like DBZ, which a significant portion of early FF writers watched on the regular growing up. I use quotes because I don't quite consider DBZ as traditional anime, it's very Westernized.

***** Not crossover, just a full rewrite. Wizards train to get stronger routinely; Draco is a stock shounen rival; Harry sees Ron and Hermione as nakama; quidditch becomes a yearly tournament arc like Tenkachi Budokai; etc.

Also, Gohan is way too overused. Why don't we see any crossovers with Yamucha? Or Kullillin?

****** I've been considering writing a fic where rivalries are legally recognised in the HP universe and considered a crucial step into adulthood. As an extension of that, the associated shounen (and shoujo?) tropes would obviously be at play.

** They generally serve as lazy devices to do two things. One is to introduce artificial tension, 'Harry's magical core was running low, how could he possibly win this fight?' The second a lazy way is to power rank people. A >B because magical core is bigger. We know Harry is special because the goblins told us his magical core is bigger than normal. Doing so essentially removes talent/experience etc from the equation and turns fights into top trumps. It also removes the need for character growth etc, earning your power. Who needs that when your number is bigger?

Really it just boils down to really lazy writing and are often used as shortcuts.

** Magic core is an easy way too show that harry is voldemort equal, there is no magical core in canon though.

I think at least in canon some people are more talented at using magic than others just like playing soccer some are more talented than others.
