  As a captive of Lord Voldemort, Luna Lovegood never thought she would live beyond the first 24 hours. Saved at first by her quick wit, Luna learns the depth of human evil...and becomes the Dark Lord's greatest weakness. Eventually LVLL.

** This was posted months ago so idk if OP still wants to find other fics, but I have been a fan of this rarepair for almost four years and I've got you. Here is a tumblr link to a Tuna blog with an alphabetized list of Tuna fics. [[https://tunavibes.tumblr.com/ficrecs]]; the author of The Astronaut runs that blog so it's also linked there.

I second Twelve Dark Moons, Into Your Gravity, The Astronaut, and anything by BellonaBellatrix (link for BellonaBellatrix's account since it's inaccessible on the blog: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052809/http://www.fanfiction.net/u/768219/BellonaBellatrix]]) . For one-shots or drabbles, kurojiri has you covered. Everything's in the link, really. Happy reading!

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
