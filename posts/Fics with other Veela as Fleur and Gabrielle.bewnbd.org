Are there other Fics that have Veela like Fleur and Gabrielle? I would gladly accept Veela, that use their allure for their advantages. Or Veela that just want to have fun and tease the men....possible intercourse is fine too. I could imagine, that "real" Veela are more powerful and tempting than Fleur and Gabriele, since them are not full Veela.

​

So, if you know, some, let me know. If it has a serious Story or a Veela Harem doesnt matter


** In my story "Patron", a number of Fleur's cousins play a role - there are no half-Veela there, so all are full Veela.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I tend not to read Veela-centric fics. Too many soul bonds and teenage hormones.

** There's a lot of Veela in For love of Magic. Mostly in the latter half, considering it spans roughly seven to ten years and Harry only meets Fleur and the rest of her family in year four.

IIRC, the powers and culture of Veela in that fic make them /absolutely terrifying/, but the fic doesn't really acknowledge it.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** There is an evil veela (interesting combination, but why not?) in “Terms of Matrimony” by Galad Estel (links and more information from [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my review]]).
