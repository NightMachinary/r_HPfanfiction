It wouldn't be a crossover just the Infinity Stones, I feel like the resurrection stone is already so close to the Soul Stone. And with the Diadem, you could argue for the Mind Stone.

I don't know, just an idea that came through my head :)\\
Also, it's my first post, I hope I didn't mess up with the tag


** And Time Turners contain the crushed remains of the Time Stone?

** Depends on the story. Ideally I'd want it to be good, and not just an excuse to give Harry an overpowered advantage. There are a lot of magical objects in Harry Potter. I can see a few of them being derived from an Infinity Stone.
