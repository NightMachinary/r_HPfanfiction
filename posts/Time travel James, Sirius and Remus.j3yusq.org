I'm looking for a small fiction (I cant remember if it was a one shot or not) James, Sirius and Remus all travel to the future they meet Hatry Ron and Hermione when they need to return to there time Harry is super upset and Ron makes a coment about the Potters getting "RATed" out the three boys connect the dots and save the Potters the story ends at a quidditch game (I think the next day) with both Lily and James in the stands cheering for there son.
