Also Johnathan is one of Dumbledore's professors/mentors. Dio becomes a feared Dark Lord. Hamon and stands become required for being an Auror. Voldemort or Grindelwald are either scary or non issues. Etc.


** Jotaro folows his "beating up cocky teachers" policy and proceeds to bully Snape and Lockhart out of hogwarts. Stands only work for certain people so your auror requirements are stupid.

*** There are like 20 Aurors total so I don't think it's THAT bad, but OK. Just remember only Stand users can see stands and things like mage sight probably won't. So how does one apprehend a stand users who has an unknown, invisible ability

**** Magic sense might actually work and there are more senses than sight. Some stand users can be taken down.

***** Of course you can still incapacitate the person so yeah: no mandatory stand having then. And someone will eventually figure out a detection method and presumably spells have the same effect one stands where possible and this is carried over to the user. So you don't need to sense the stand: Just fire stunners or something if you suspect someone has a stand and then they'll get stunned anyway when their stand takes a hit especially if you use AoE spells like bombarda or if they don't know magic works on stands.
