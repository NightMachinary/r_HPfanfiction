Mine is 'could someone stay up without their flesh'. Trying to see how workable a Dark Magic spell would be if it removed all the meat from a person, but left the skin and organs and bones and such alone. Nothing conclusive as of yet, if you were wondering. :)

So, yeah. Got me thinking. What other weird stuff populates the search histories of the writers in this fandom?

***** A very fair point. I did some googling from that and you're right. I assumed there was some errant padding-tissue that we called meat, like the packing peanuts of the body. In retrospect, that does make little sense. I guess that's why I got no results. :D

Detailed research of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage][the Rjukan heavy water sabotage]] (and no, the story was about Hermione leaving her parents, not from the Second World War), organization of medical care at British Navy (for Doctor Granger; yes, there are dental surgeries at flagships of large navy units), or finding a doctor through NHS.

My weirdest Google search was probably "traditional Japanese men's undergarments," which makes my fic sound more deviant than it actually is :)

***** I found a journal article that might be of interest or answer your question.

It's 'Combustion of pneumoperitoneum: a rare danger in the operating room by William T McSweeney and Brian Kirkby'.

Talks about how a guy with pain in the lower torso (stomach area) went into surgery and, due to the highly oxygenated atmosphere of the surgical suite, caught fire when they popped the lower body cavity.

So, there's definitely flammable stuff in there, but it needs more oxygen than is inside the body to actually burn properly.

** u/PlusMortgage:
#+begin_quote
  could someone stay up without their flesh
#+end_quote

The short answer is "No except in some very specific and unlikely cases".

The long answer is : while we are standing up, we are continuously using our muscles to do some small adjustements to maintain our balance. If you try to stand upright while closing your eyes, you should feel these small movements.\\
Without flesh (muscles), a person would be unable to do these small adjustments, and should quickly fall. Now, if a person squeleton is in a perfect equilibrum when he loses his flesh /and/ if there is no outside force to make him fall (wind or explosion nearby) , it is "technically" possible for him to still stand after the spell. But such a scenario is extremely unlikely. Other scenarios for this scene must also exist, but are equality unlikely.

*** Some cool extra info, thanks! Definitely sounds like I'm going to have to tap into the 'magic overwrites mundane reality' thing and make it a hard spell to balance out the particularly pernicious reality it'd be overwriting.

As I've commented elsewhere in this post, I was operating on some mistaken assumptions on what 'flesh' is that made absolutely no sense when I actually thought about it and did some googling for clarification. I was assuming we had extra padding meats to cover up and insulate and basically act as 'packing peanuts' for our organs and bones and muscles and whatnot, but that's just fats, so it's no wonder I wasn't getting any answers that fit my understanding of the question. :D
