Recently I've been really into AU Ron-centric fics that give him the ability to know about the war in advance or the future in general, whether it is due to time travel or visions or some other method.

I've read a few and have a few waiting to be read. Fics like:

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/][Fate]] by TheTrueSpartan

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again][There and Back Again]] by Chuchi Otaku

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/][The Red Knight]] by Demon Eyes Laharl

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/][Choices]] by random-fruitcake04

- [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/27226075/chapters/66507277][Center Of Attention]] by Neville_Severus_Black

Are there anymore fics like these? Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Thank you.


** There is linkffn(Voleur D'ame by Twubs). It's a Ron weasley SI. And is complete. In terms of quality I'd give it a 3.5/5. Maybe 4.5/5 if you like SI's.

  A soul from our world is thrown into the body of Ron Weasley in the exact moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Teenage hormones, dark lords, and missing memories is a hell of a combination. SI

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board?

** Well, I have one rec.

linkffn(Ron Weasley and the Philosopher's Stone by Jon-Riptide)

Ron travels back to first year by accident. He is not happy about this and just wants to go home. It seems to have reached the point now whe Ron is starting to realise it may be better just to try and change things (mostly because "not changing things" did not work too well, to be fair. ) - Shows how weird it would feel to an adult to suddenly be a kid again.

**** I did not get the feeling he updates too slowly.

But hey, I am still always waiting for updates on "Nightmares of Futures Past", so my perspective may be a bit skewed.
