He's an old man, headmaster of a school, leader of a court system, representive to an international body and a spiritual leader of sorts.

Any fics that show Dumbledore's mistakes as a result of this overburdening, rather than some evil scheme?


** I mean, there are several ways for Dumbledore to circumvent being overworked/having too much on his plate. His obligations aren't all under some kind of Magical oath sworn by Mugwumps and Chief Warlocks (as shown when he was relieved of his positions on a whim), the idea that he can't quit all of this due to some kind of 'moral obligation' is a fictitious one, as Dumbledore isn't a moral man either,

"We both know there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom." Dumbledore said calmly. "Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit -- "

The idea that he abstains from taking lives is also a fictitious one.

**** In Magicks of the Arcane, Harry learns some obscure, old spells to fight against dragon. Because these spells are pretty freaking hard, he seeks advice from Dumbledore. He starts spending more time with him and Dumbledore also introduces him to some wizarding etiquette and all that jazz. Eventually Harry gets powerful and he becomes best buddies with Dumblydore.

*** Agreed. Though dialogue and plot consistency leave a lot to be desired, I'll let it slide as it's one of the first of its brand. The author could also do without all the anime influence too, but that's just a peeve of mine and not really worth noting if you enjoy mentor-student relationships that are built upon incredibly sporadic movements.

*** There's also the fact that Hermione used it wrong largely. Instead of also using it to get more sleep or get most of her homework done in a timely fashion, she just uses it to get to the classes but not help with coursework. Why is she considered the smartest of her age again?

  My take on the "Sirius Black is married with a child" plot, except that it's not enough to keep him out of Azkaban. But at least he managed to rescue Harry from the Dursley's. You'd think that Dumbledore would notice this and he would have...if he didn't have three full-time jobs. Eventual HHR.

** linkffn(A Different Professor by AsphodelWolf15) has Dumbledore suffering from old age (and thus being overworked). A half-decent incomplete story if you ignore the Severitus-get-his-princess subplot and the saccharine H/Hr relationship that appears out of the blue.
