:END:
I don't remember much, but there were two fics by the same author. In one, Harry uses the Cosmic Cube to make a new planet for the Mutant Kind, after defeating Strange Fate and fixing the Multiverse.

In another, he's a New God, born on another planet and Apokolips attacks, his father sacrifices himself, and Harry activates some sort of device as he comes through the Veil of Death, where he gets adopted by the Potters or something.

What's that fic??
