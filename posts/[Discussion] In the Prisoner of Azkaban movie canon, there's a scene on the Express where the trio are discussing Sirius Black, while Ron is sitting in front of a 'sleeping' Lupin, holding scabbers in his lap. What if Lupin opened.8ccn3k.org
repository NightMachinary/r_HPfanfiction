:END:
On one hand, yes Scabbers does look like pretty much any rat, no particular reason for Lupin to believe it's Wormtail, especially given its been 13 years. On the other hand, Scabbers is 3 feet from Lupin's face, might be trying to hide or looking otherwise shifty (for a rat) since he presumably recognizes Lupin it at the very least heard Hermione straight up say 'R. J. Lupin,' and the whole memory tangle of the Marauders/how Harry's parents died/animagus forms/Wormtail 'dying' would be front and center in Lupin's brain making it easier to draw a connection between the rat 3 feet from his face and Wormtail's animagus form.

Maybe going something like this:

Lupin opens his eyes, either to 'wake up' or just to get a view of Harry after 13 years. His mind is ruminating on Sirius and Peter, and the night everything happened, and how Sirius 'killed' Peter. Sees Wormtail. Freezes for a second, assumes his mind is making things up given how he was just thinking of Peter. Waits a few seconds. Wormtail is still there.

"Excuse me, may I see your pet rat, Mr...?" Lupin said, mildly. Scabbers froze.

"Weasley, sir." Ron squeaked, surprised. After all, Lupin talking startled them all a bit, as they thought he was asleep. Harry and Hermione stared.

"Mr Weasley, then. May I hold your rat for a moment, please?" He held out his hand mildly to further emphasize his point. Scabbers remained frozen. /Maybe if I don't move, he won't notice me anymore,/ he thought. Harry and Hermione continued staring.

Ron unconsciously held Scabbers closer. Scabbers sighed in relief.

"Why?" Ron squeaked.

"He looks rather like a rat I once owned. An eerily close resemblance, in fact. He ran away a long time ago. I had assumed a dog got to him, there was one where I lived. I am curious if he could be the one I used to have." Lupin said mildly, continuing to hold out his hand. Harry and Hermione continued staring.

Ron's forehead wrinkled. "I don't think this is him, sir. My family's had him for 13 years," he squeaked.

Lupin's mild smile twitched. "13 years, you say? What a strange coincidence. That is exactly how long ago I lost mine." He said mildly, continuing to hold out his hand. Harry and Hermione continued staring.

Ron looked doubtful, but began to hand over Scabbers. After all, this was a trustworthy teacher. It's not like he had been dragged by his foot to an abandoned shack by a dog that turned into a delirious sounding prison escapee convicted of 14 counts of murder. As soon as his hand started moving in the direction of Lupin, Scabbers went ballistic, using every ounce of strength to escape his grip, finally resorting to biting him. Ron squeaked in pain and dropped him. Luckily Lupin was there to catch him. Lupin had a much more secure grip, and held Scabbers up closer to his face, who continued to struggle.

"I see he is missing a finger on his right paw. When did this happen?" Lupin asked, mildly. Harry and Hermione continued staring.

"It's been like that since we got him, sir," Ron squeaked..

"I see," said Lupin, mildly. "Mr. Weasley, would you and your friends kindly step out of the cabin for a moment? I am about to cast a spell, and if it succeeds, I'm afraid we'll all be rather wanting for space. I promise you, no harm will come to your pet rat." Ron nodded, slightly in shock, and stepped outside the cabin with Harry and Hermione. They all stared.

Lupin pulled out his wand, and cast an unknown spell, no longer mildly.

Where Scabbers the rat once was now a pathetic looking man of 30ish years of age, who immediately opened his mouth, presumably to beg for his life. Before a sound could come out, he was on the floor, unconscious. Remus turned to the trio. Ron squeaked.

"It seems the Prophet has been wrong once again. Mr. Weasley, I'm sorry to say that this man has been disguising himself as your pet rat for 13 years. Mr. Potter, I am glad to tell you that the man who gave your parents location to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has finally been revealed." Lupin said, mildly.

And then the dementors showed up.

#+begin_quote
  Some witches and wizards may manage an incorporeal Patronus, which resembles a mass or wisp of silvery vapour or smoke. In some cases a witch or wizard may choose to produce an incorporeal Patronus deliberately, if he or she wishes to disguise the form it generally takes (Remus Lupin, for instance, is afraid that his corporeal Patronus gives too much away). The incorporeal Patronus is not a true Patronus and while it will give limited protection, it cannot provide the defensive power of the corporeal Patronus, which has the form and substance of an animal.

**** Yes but not quite. There's no more official relationship between one's Patronus and Werewolfry than between Patronus and Animagus; it seems Lupin's Patronus would have been a wolf regardless of whether Greyback had bitten him or not. It's not a matter of being "outed". IIRC, Lupin's just come to loathe anything that reminds him of his condition.

Although, if your patronus is something you consider to be a protective sort of icon, doesn't it make sense, in a sick sort of way, that for all Lupin detests his curse and would do anything to change it, some part deep deep /deep/ inside him considers it to be a kind of protection, a part of him that no enemy can escape from, not even himself?

** I'm not sure Remus would see Ron's rat and go 'wait, could that be Peter?', mainly because of the whole thing about Peter being dead for 13 years (or so he believed).

But, I could see him looking at Scabbers and going 'huh, that reminds me of Peter'. And then he might go 'I had a friend who could, I mean, he had a rat like that once, I was just reminded of him', and from there that could be the catalyst that gets him talking about his school days with James & Sirius & Peter to Harry and co.

Although that line of chatting would probably be interrupted by the dementors searching the train, but maybe later Harry might seek Lupin out to hear the rest of his story, then when Fred & George ask where he went, he shares the tales Remus told and about how they created all sorts of enchanted items during their years at Hogwarts...including a certain map, which makes Fred & George realise that Remus Lupin is one of the Marauders.

And then, from there, Fred & George end up showing the map to Remus, who engages in a bout of nostalgia playing with it for a while...until he notices, overlaying Ronald Weasley's name on the map, is Peter Pettigrew...

...But then what? Would he rush to Gryffindor tower to retrieve and reveal the rat? Would he go tell Dumbledore about what he saw? And, would he hypothesise that Peter Pettigrew is who really caused the explosion?

*** Yeah, I cam up with that as the most likely possibility pretty quick. But to be fair, the scene I'm talking about had Rog literally just going on about Sirius Black, and it's implied ish in the books that Lupin is fake sleeping, so from Lupins perspective, he's hearing this kid talk about Sirius, and he's imagining his memories of the marauders and the animagus forms, so his mind is already really leaning into the past, and he cracks open his eyes, 0.000001 seconds after having worn tails animagus form in his minds eye, to see... Worn tails animagus form. Obviously he's not immediately going to jump straight to 'worm tail is alive and Sirius was framed.' but he sees wormtails form, and since he's just been thinking of his form, his first thought is that he's imagining it, because wormtails has even dead for 13 years. And then he kind of mentally reality checks himself, expecting to open his eyes again and just see a wormtails look a like, because again, dead for 13 years, and instead sees... Still Wormtail. And what he thought was a vision or a hallucination isn't going away, that is literally wormtails sitting in front of him, but he still has to make sure, so he asks Ron if he can take a look, takes a look...and it's /still/ Wormtail. And now he's got taken readjust everything he knew, break it down and piece it back together again, and that's when he realizes what most likely actually happened that night.

It's a bit like when you see someone who looks almost exactly like someone you know that died years ago, and for a split second your mind goes, OMG IT'S THEM and then you reality check and realize you were just seeing things. Except in this case, it actually was them.

So it's less that Lupin saw a rat that looked a lot like Wormtail and immediately figured out that it was Wormtail

And more like Lupin saw a rat that looked a lot like Wormtail, went OMG IT'S THEM for a split second, then realized it couldn't possible be them, reality checked himself, looked again, but instead of seeing a rat that just looked a lot like wormtail, he was looking at a rat that still looked EXACTLY like wormtail. And then proceeded to check for himself, realize he wasn't going insane, that this actually was wormtail. Then the dementors show up.

ADDITION: human minds are programmed to look for patterns and familiar faces, that's why so often we see someone from the back, and we swear on all that's holy that it's Abby, then they turn around and it's not Abby. So if someone sees a cat who looks /EXACTLY/ like Abby, their dead cat, immediately after watching a video of Abby, the first thing they're going to assume is that they are literally looking at Abby the cat, then remind themselves Abby is dead and go cry in bed. But if that cat actually was Abby, it makes a lot of sense someone would immediately think it was Abby, only to snap out of it, then realize no wait that IS Abby.

I volunteer at a cat shelter, and sometimes I see a cat that looks so much like my cat oreo, that for a split second I actually think it is my cat, despite knowing full well my cats at home.

***** The dementer ex machina was just my way of cutting off my rambling, since I couldn't be arsed to write any more + my phone was about to die. It was also an attempt to add a bit of humor to the ramble, as well as acknowledge that if I'm counting from when ron says the line about serious black, there's about 60 seconds until the dementors show up. The whole remus talking to Ron situation went a bit longer than it should have, considering. So when I was done writing, I figured I might as well end it with the dementors showing up as they should have 30 seconds ago. I thought about adding a scene where Remus tells them to grab a prefect to get hold of staff or smth but was too lazy. Wasn't an attempt to seriously say that the dementors solve the problem or whatever.

As to the professor, I had thought that hermione identified him as a professor when she points out the trunk name, if not in the movie than in the book. But I could be totally wrong, I have shitty memory.

Remus referring to Harry by his name and mentioning his parents was me trying to give a potential example of Remus revealing himself to Harry as someone who knows the situation with Black and Pettigrew, to give a hypothetical jumping off point for a discussion between Harry and Lupin. Harry wasn't intended to recognise Lupin, if anything i intended him to be somewhat off put by Lupin knowing his name off the bat. After all, the whole thing was just supposed to be a hypothetical version of what could happen in that situation, not necessarily exactly what would happen. There's a lot of stuff that should have really happened that I left out. Hermione should have asked at least one question, and as I mentioned the dementors were late.

All valid criticisms though.

*** It basically diverts the ENTIRE plot, given that the core conflict everything leads up to is solved in the span of 2 minutes.

Fair warning, it's been over 6 years since I last read PoA, and I only got 30ish minutes into the movie before getting too tired and going to sleep.

But going from the moment I finished...

-The dementors show up, Lupin immediately patronuses them (I quite like [[/u/jahoan]] s idea that Lupin is so out of fucks to give that he just blasts out a full blown corporeal wolf patronus), so Harry doesn't have his flashback. Everyone just feels a bit shitty, overall. Chocolate is dispensed. Because I am a slut for Hinny, I'm retroactively adding Ginny into my previously written scene since she's there in the book canon.

-Lupin gives a very short, perfunctory goodbye, takes Peter, and apparates the fuck to Hogwarts, an immobilized, invisibalized Peter floating beside him. Why Dumbledore instead of the ministry? Well for starters, what with him being a werewolf and all, I'd imagine he'd have more faith in the man who gave him access to an education despite his condition, over the Ministry that has made it a mission to ruin his life. So he marches his furry little ass straight to Dumbles office, says every single sweet he knows of till he gets in, walks in, uninvisibalizes Peter, and drops him to the floor. He does not make any effort to be gentle, other than to assure he doesn't die/become brain damaged.

-Dumdum jumps out of his chair faster than you can say my-lemon-drops-absolutely-arent-laced-with-any-sort-of-potion-why-do-you-ask. He rushes over to pettigrew on the floor and starts casting a plethora of spells, lots Lupin can't recognize, looking progressively more grave the more he casts.

-'This is Peter Pettigrew' he says. It is a statement of fact, not a question. His face is so grave, one would expect his lustrous beard to start growing daisies any second.

-'Ah.' Lupin says, mildly. Inside, he is not nearly so mild.

-'Explain.' Dummyboy commands, gravely.

-Lupin explains.

-Dummeroo goes and grabs 2 strong drinks and sets them on his desk.

-'Sit' he gravely says, gesturing to his chair.

-Lupin sits.

-Dumbledore pushes a glass towards him, then takes a hearty swig from his own. Lupin drinks.

-Eventually, though, through a series of political machinations, threats, bribery, boldface lies and other such sinful activities that I can't be bothered to write, Sirius is declared innocent. The dementors are called off.

-He is released from Azkaban, into the care of St. Mungos, for mandatory physical and mental therapy. Regardless of if the man's sane or not, one does not come out of 12 years of what is objectively the worst prison on Earth without needing therapy. Even if you discount the whole 'surrounded by crazy people and literal soul sucking monsters,' he's still got to adjust to the fact that 12 years have passed, and he was isolated from all outside information for 99.99999999% of it. The world is a very different place than what he knew, and the people are as well. Lupin absolutely visits and they rebuild their friendship again. (Or if you're a poor slasher soul like me, rekindle their teenage romance, learning how to reform it around the new people they are/finally confess their undying love for each other and go form there) Either way, I think Lupin being there and being able to tell him about the world, and tell him about Harry, would help to preemptively waylay any urges to pretend nothing has changed. It would also help Sirius realized that Harry is almost nothing like James, and that it wouldn't be fair to him to expect him to be. That way they can have a more solid foundation of a relationship, able to learn each other as they are instead of as they think they are. After a lot of tests and jumping through hoops, Harry is allowed to visit. It involves an intense amount of nervousness on both sides, a lot of awkwardness on Harry's, and a lot of trying to seem nonchalant and not like he's about to cry on Sirius'. (So he's still a little mentally fragile, cut him some slack. The man's been through a lot.) Sirius spends a lot of it telling stories of the Marauders with Lupin pitching in (he's there as a supervisor, just to make sure things stay low key), and Harry is just happy to learn anything about his parents. The whole James-was-a-bit-of-a-dick thing comes up, but they have lots of time to explain how he grew out of it. Severus and Lily being close friends also comes up, as does the end of their friendship. Harry is surprised by this, to say the least. In hindsight, Snapes undying hatred for him makes a bit more sense. All in all, the visit ends happily, with light hearts and high hopes for the future of their relationship. Harry's also become a bit closer to Lupin along the while, since Lupin mostly likely escorted him to this and any future visits. Sirius also get plenty of other visitors, such as Dumbledore (he was one of the first, given the the circumstances), Fudge, the head of the auror department as well as various aurors, etc.

-Sirius eventually leaves the Hospital, and he and Remus probably move into Grimmauld place, and clean it up. Given the special circumstances, I don't think it would be too unlikely for Harry to be allowed to visit on weekends, A) because having healthy relationships is an important part of Sirius' treatment plan, and B) because the boy had his parents murdered when he was 1, he should get the opportunity to make healthy parental relationships for himself. He definitely stays over Christmas, and perhaps invites Ron and Hermione along as well.

-With Remus, Sirius, and occasionally Harry's hard work, they manage to turn Grimmauld into a place worth living.

-Since Grimmauld is getting cleaned up, Kreacher is definitely going to pop up. The question being, does Sirius treat him as he does in OotP, or does he choose the nicer route? Because in this AU, Sirius is a little bit more mature than in canon from the therapy he had to go through, and has frequent contact with Harry, and a live in Boyfriend/platonic life partner, and isn't being confined in a miserable house, I'd like to think he's going to act a bit nicer, be a bit more understanding than in canon, and have a somewhat better relationship with Kreacher, or at the very least not treat him like shit. Maybe he let's him keep some of the not so dangerous possessions, such as Walberga's portrait, a treasures book, a locket trinket, in a soundproofed room way up in the attic far away from the used bedrooms and living/kitchen area. (in other words, Kreacher still had the locket horcrux, but he's a lot more willing to play nice with Sirius if needed.) So now Kreacher is a hit more willing to help with the house clean up, knowing that if something isn't dangerous and he wants to keep it in his keepsake room in the attic, he can. So the house is a lot less miserable than in canon, and the portrait from hell is removed to a better location.

-Don't ask me how it got moved, just assume that they asked Dumbledore for help, tore down the wall during probably necessary renovations, or Kreacher's house elf magic could get to it somehow.

-Dumbledore receives letters from parents expressing concern for hiring a teacher who lives with a (acquitted) mass murderer. Remus gracefully steps down at the end of the year.

-As summer approaches, many screaming shouts between Dumbledore and Sirius (and sometimes Remus) later, it is finally decided that Harry will spend the absolute minimum time at the Dursleys required to recharge the 'blood protection', but Remus and Sirius will visit every weekend, and 'Padfoot' will be making frequent visits to the park Harry frequents. As soon as they are recharged, Harry will hop over to the newly remodeled freshly dubbed Marauder's Place and spend the rest of the summer there.

-Obviously there are much hopping between the burrow and marauders place, and visits to both from hermione.

-In short, nothing exciting happens past the political shitstorm Sirius hitting the ministry of magic. Harry gains 2 father figures, and gets to spend all year stressing about quidditch and girls instead of a potential attempt on his life. He is happy. Ron has to go through his own share of therapy, as well as Percy. Basically the entire Weasley family comes out stronger for it, as they get the chance to work out their issues individually with a therapist. So Ron's inferiority complex might not stick out as bad during the tournament next year (if there is one), which is obviously good news. He is happy. Hermione still figures out Lupins secret and after getting to know him better outside hogwarts, from harry and maybe from seeing him over Christmas break, she goes to him personally and explains how she knows, but that she won't tell anyone and will protect his secret. They get to bond over being bookworm dweeb. She is happy. Sirius is no longer in prison, and is working towards becoming a well adjusted, if somewhat rebellious, member of society. He lives in a swanky ass house rigged to the teeth in booby traps he Harry and Remus set, gets a healthy good relationship with his godson, and has rebuilt a friendship/romance with one of his closest friends, and is finally able to start moving past the trauma of October 31st. He is happy. Remus has gone from being entirely alone in the world, the only shining light being getting to teach his best friends son, to living with another one of his best friends/boyfriend, having a good healthy relationship with his best friends son, getting to do a job he loved for a year and then fairly peacefully leave. He keeps finding mysterious bars of chocolate around the house with positive notes on them. He is happy.

-oh, and Peter is launched into Azkaban faster than you can say launching-off-at-the-speed-of-light. He no longer has to live as a rodent, in fear of being found out. Surprisingly, he is (somewhat) happy.

Everyone is happy.

For now, at least.

-Harry most certainly does not forget what he now knows of his Mums and snapes history. It shines an entirely new light on Snapes hatred for him. He doesn't ever day anything to him about it, he's not stupid. But it's not something he forgets. Perhaps, if a year or two from now, he gained access to a part of Snapes side of the story, he might say something. But not now.

-Sirius got a big ass check of monetary reparations. Most likely uses it to sue the ministry. Consults hermione Granger encyclopedic knowledge of laws and rules for help when needed. (sues the ministry in 3rd year for their terrible anti werewolf legislation, sues the ministry in 4th year for the ridiculous binding contract nature of the goblet of fire. Sues the ministry for interference in private school affairs in 5th year in an attempt to prevent him from becoming the defense against the dark arts teacher. Sue's the ministry in 6th year for refusing to acknowledge a fire threat existed. Doesn't bother suing the ministry in 7th year, just burns it to the ground.)

-Dumbledore gets to see a boy he greatly cares for finally have a family. He gets to see a man he watched grow up find his hope. He gets to see a foolhardy youth mature into a competent adult man. He is happy.

-Sirius and Remus ABSOLUTELY give harry hell on the subject of Ginny when he finally comes round to that realization. At least one joke about Potters and their redheads is made.

-Harry gets to legit go to Hogsmead, as Sirius and or Lupin signed the permission to slip. He has much fun trying to convince Lupin to go to zonkos to help him pick out something to prank sirius with. He also stops in honeydukes and picks up a giant ass bar of chocolate, like the kind of bar so big its normally given as a gag gift to give to Lupin for Christmas, as well as a book from flourish and bottles. He picks up a few pranks to give sirius from zonkos as well. Seeing as he didn't bring the invisibility cloak, there is sadly no invisible snowball fight against malfoy. He does get into a real snowball fight though. Harry has a lot of fun, since he's more okay with easing up on his rivalry with malfoy. He's trying to learn from his father's mistakes. Ron gladly joins in, hermione with a bit of nudging from Ron. Malfoy probably takes the fight a bit more seriously than really warranted, but I imagine somewhere in that angsty bigoted heart of his he is enjoying himself too. Perhaps this can be an Itty bitty baby step towards not being such a prissy brat all the time. Hermione gives malfoy a solid fastball to the face. It is glorious.

-Buckbeak. Buckbeak is an interesting one, because I barely remember any of it. Let's just say sirius uses some of that sweet reparations dough to sue the ministry and and make waivers a mandatory form as they should be for a class dealing with dangerous magical creatures. He also pays to buy Buckbeak to save him, then low key just gives him back to Hagrid. The ministry is so stupid they don't notice. Idk if it would be from the ministry, malfoy Sr, or remus/sirius, but Hagrid probably has to undergo some kind of class on safety procedures and appropriate animals. The trio remus and Sirius all make sure to express him the animals aren't evil, but that not all the animals are good for an in person class, at least without a prior instructional class to the students on how to treat the animals properly and safely. He is also now supposed to send and instruction slip with his textbooks on how to open them.

-im pretty sure sirius gets possessed by the spirit of James for a nanosecond when he finds out harry rode a goddamn hippogryph, he is so filled with pride.

-I'm going to go ahead and assume that neville gets injured in potions somehow, and Sirius sues the ministry to make safety equipment and lab procedures required in potions, as well as moving the potions room out of the dungeons and into a room with lots of windows so the fumes have somewhere to go. Yes, 90% of his motivation is to piss off Snape. Whatever works, hey?

-Harry is talking to Ron or Hermione about the Sirius and Remus, and uses the names Padfoot and Moony. The twins overhear, and ask what he was going on about. He explains that he was talking about Sirius and Remus. They have a fit of dramatics, then give him the map.

-Hermione ends up burning herself out via time turner to the point that harry and Ron corner her and make her explain, then express that they don't want her to exhaust herself. (Harry's picked up all these nifty healthy communication skills from Sirius, who gets them from his therapist. He loves to explain in detail how he's using each skill as he uses them in the most dramatic way possible.) I don't think she actually drops a class, but probably tried to eat a bit more, get more sleep, sit by the lake, just relax a tiny bit. Not too much though, of course, she's still hermione.

-Remus probably has some issues feeling like he can't become too close with Harry at first since he's his teacher and all, but a sirius pointing out that in all likelihood he's only gonna be DADA teacher for a year, and what a shit childhood Harry's had probably persuades him that it's okay.

-So as much as I'd like to get out of this, it's is most likely that Lupin misses at least one class due to full moon sickness, so Snape does his whole werewolf class. By this point I think Harry's been told about sirius's fuck up with Snape, so he knows why snape is trying to get them to figure out Lupin secret. He also has an internal struggle, because one one hand, this guy's a total douchecanoe, and harry hates him. In the other hand, what sirius did wasn't okay, and an near death encounter with a werewolf would give anybody nightmares, a vendetta against said werewolf, and a good reason to try an out said werewolf. He's still a douchecanoe tho.

-Scabbers is a moot point so Ron and hermione don't spend the whole year bitching to each other about their pet. But, they wouldn't be ron and hermione if they weren't bitching to each other. So they are probably fighting over hermione being all sneaky prior to getting her to confess and about hermione burning herself out. This mostly involves Ron making typical ronnish comment trying to help in his own way, and hermione getting mad at for butting into to her business (but inside she's a little happy because I think by this point she's aware that she's a little bit into ron.) Harry suffers.

-the dementors aren't at hogwarts, so harry never faints, and never breaks his broom. Sirius is probably a 'rich people spending' kind of guy, buying unnecessary things for the people he loves, so he gets harry a firebolt anyways. Remus sighs. They win the quidditch cup.

***** To hell with it. Here goes nothing.

Fair warning, not much changes plot wise. It's mostly a bunch of little changes that would stack to make bigger changes next year. Ripples making waves here, people.

-We start Harry Potter's first year at Marauder's Place. Harry, Sirius, and Remus are all getting ready for the trip to the meet up place for the port key to the quidditch cup. Everything goes pretty much the same. Other than Harry remus and Sirius having a tent next to the Weasley+hermione, it goes the same.

-Krum catches the Snitch, Ireland wins. Death eaters attack. Sirius and Remus stay with Harry, so he's at least got that. They act all protective dad like when the aurors start firing at them, and Sirius threatens to sue the ministry. Again. 50/50 chance if he does it just so he can give some of the winnings to the weasley's. After all, Ron was being attacked too, so it's not charity. they probably lie about the exact percentages that would technically be for Ron, and give them more.

-so I remember exactly nothing about the whole winky thing, but let's say that sirius and Remus buy her to work for them, because shes so obviously miserable not having a master. Maybe she'll lighten up kreachur. Or maybe they'll just make each other 10x more dedicate to their cause.

-so now winky resides at Marauder's Place. Dobby is still at hogwarts.

-so everything is pretty par for the course, up until the champs are picked. Harry goes into the room, dumbledore /calmly/ asks Harry if he put his name in the goblet of fire. So on. Harry gets back to the dorm, him and Ron fight. It is not as bad as in Canon. ron's still got jealousy issues, but the therapy he went through over the summer helped him work through them so the fight is mostly limited to ron make a few bitchy comments about harry putting his name in the cup, harry getting angry and bitching at ron for thinking he would do something like that, both going to sleep, then ron apologizing, and harry returning the apology.

-you ask how therapy over your pet rat being a mass murder leads to better relationship development? I answer. Pettigrew is scabbers>scabbers is his rat>what did scabbers mean to him>scabbers was just another hand-me-down from an older brother, like everything else he owns>how did that make him feel>jealous, worthless, inferior>as part of your continued treatment we will explore your feelings of jealousy worthlessness and inferiority>jealousy worthlessness and inferiority is worked on>ron is a significantly less jealous worthless inferior feeling boy, and a lot more confident and sure of himself and that he is not worthless or inferior>Ron no longer treats the people he cares about such as Ron and hermione as if he is jealous worthless or inferior to them, or at least does it less than in canon. Therapy is dope yall. You should try it added. note: as to the expenses therapy incurs, I think a good portion of it was paid for by the court because it was their failing that caused Peter to run free, and any further unpaid therapy related expenses are paid for by sirius because he's filthy rich and he should have caught him the night he ran free.

-On the note of therapy,Ginny is also 99% over her celebrity crush on harry, from the therapy she had to go through for pettigrew, she also used the chance to work through the chamber of secrets as well, and she able to just see him as a boy she'd like to be friends with not the boy who lived or 'her hero.' So she's spent a lot of this year making an effort to be friendly to harry, ask for a spare quill in the common room here, some help with a DADA assignment he had last year, stuff like that. She's also done things like offer to carry a book if he's holding a lot and they're going the same way. Ask him about the weather, his opinion on a piece of quidditch news. Ginny's a confident girl. She'll find things to talk about. So by the end of the year harry would put ginny solidly in the 'friend' box, and hed be comfortable going and hanging with her if Ron and hermione are getting on his nerves. She's not just Ron's little sister, he sees her as her own person. She's still nowhere near as close to him as Ron and hermione, he doesn't quite let her in on his secrets of deepest feelings.

-there is one difference before the champs are picked, and that's the amazing bouncing ferret. After Draco is put back into human form, he goes off to a bathroom and cries. (The kid is only 13, every truth he's ever known about his identity has been violently torn from him, all of his house mates are making his life miserable for the last year and a half, and now he's just gone and been turned into a ferret and bounced up and down, with numerous classmates laughing at him. He puts on an arrogant face, of course, but that doesn't mean he really feels that way. So yeah, he goes to a bathroom and cries. Same one he's sobbing in in HBP, in fact. Gotta keep those internal references going. Harry, who is intimately familiar with the feeling of being ostracized by all of your peers for something you have no control over, as well as having a deep knowledge of what happens to people who go through that (not good things, he knows), goes after him. He's not quite sure what drives him to follow Draco, but he trusts his gut. So he follows after, and comes across Draco basically doing exactly what he did in HPB. Crying in front of a mirror, to be exact. Harry moves forward, for what exactly he really has know idea, and Draco sees him and throws out a non lethal spell. (He's a shithead yeah, but he's a 13 yo shithead. I don't think he'd be throwing avadas just yet) Harry counters with an expelliarmus. (no hpb's journal=no sectumsempra.) Draco dodges, and runs out. Harry just stares out the doorway for a minute, baffled at what occurred, just kinda processing it all, and then moves on to where ever he was going in the first place. He doesn't mention what he saw to anyone, not even Sirius or Remus. It just felt like something very private. Draco spends the next week in agony, just waiting for the rumors of him crying in a bathroom to start circulating. And when nothing happens, he spends the week after feeling a strange mix of half confusion and half binding anger. 2 weeks to the day after the whole bathroom incident, while running through a deserted hallway shortcut, trying his best not to be late to class, Harry Potter finds himself suddenly pushed with a magical force against the closest wall, and with a wand shoved in his face. It takes him a moment to recognise Draco as the owner of the wand. Draco: “What do you want?” Harry just stares at him, confused beyond belief as to what is happening. Draco, looking around furtively before whispering: “You haven't told anyone what you saw.” He stops, seemingly waiting for a response. Harry, at normal volume, still CBB: “What I saw? What the bloody hell are you- oh. You mean a couple weeks ag---.” The still raised wand is jabbed into his neck. Draco, panicked: “DON'T! Don't talk so loud. Just answer the fucking question, Potter.” Harry, shrugging as much as he can with a wand jabbing into his neck: “I dunno. It just seemed like it was meant to be private, I guess. You may be a pompous git, but I'm not that cruel.” Draco, with an offended look on his face: “Pompous gi---” he cuts himself off. His face fills with anger. “Don't tell anyone what you saw. If you don't keep your mouth shut, you'll regret it.” Harry: “Well if I haven't told anyone yet, I don't know why I'd suddenly start now.” Draco glares. The wand presses further into his neck. Harry's rather surprised his neck hasn't been punctured, the way things are going. He sighs. “I won't tell anyone. Is that good enough for you, Malfoy?” The pressure from the wand increases one last time --- /Really, is all the wand poking really necessary?/ Harry wants to say. He elects not to, in the name of his livelihood. --- and then fully recedes. Malfoy gives him one last glare, then runs off in the opposite direction Harry had been going. Harry stares at him for a moment, rubbing his neck, then continues to class at a leisurely pace. /After all, it's just potions. I'm sure Snape would take points for some imagined transgression anyways. Might as well get something out of it myself./ Snape's face when he arrived, more than half the class over, was truly a sight to behold.

-Up until this exchange, the amount of insults and jeers directed his and his friend's way had been steadily decreasing since the Pettigrew trial. By this point, they were a rare occurrence, usually limited to when they happened to run into each other in the halls, or had to pass each other to get to their classes, and even then it almost seemed automatic, like Malfoy was too stressed to put forth any real effort, and was doing it to keep up pretenses, to keep anyone from thinking he held any regard for Harry. After Malfoy's sudden ambush, they stopped completely. The glares disappeared as well. Indeed, it seemed as Malfoy had just decided to ignore his, and by proxy his friend's, existence. After a few weeks had gone by, Harry realized that even any eye contact had almost entirely vanished. Even the few times did happen, it seemed to be truly unintentional. Eventually, Harry just took it as his new reality, and moved on. He never mentioned either of the events that had transpired to Ron or Hermione, knowing he would just be pestered with questions he couldn't answer. Any curious remarks on if he knew anything about the Malfoy's sudden change of behavior were met with a lost expression and a confused shrug. And it's not like he was really lying. He honestly had no idea why Malfoy was suddenly so set on ignoring his existence.

-He beats the dragon, hermione and Ron are both there to support him, so no love triangle shtick thrown around by skeeter especially since shes fired and presumably got a job at some mega trashy wizard gossip mag.

-gets the egg. Opens egg. Immediately regrets it.

****** Note:I forgot to mention, in regards to the dragons, harry finds out like in canon, and tells Cedric.

Harry also has the mirror he canonically got in 5th year, so please internally change all mentions of him owling sirius and Remus to him using the mirror to communicate beginning in 4th year.

Also I can't believe I've said this before, but sirius absolutely makes harry go through therapy over his first 2 years at hogwarts. And the dursleys. His whole childhood really. And it's not like a punishment, Sirius is just so fucking psyched about therapy you have no idea. He wants everyone to be psyched about it as well. Of course he hated it at first, but because he got a therapist that really understood him, he grew to love therapy. He attempted to propose to his therapist at least twice. Probable 3 times. Remus suffers. Speaking of remus, Sirius eventually gets him to go to therapy as well. He is reluctant at first, because he doesn't like talking about his issues and doesn't want to burden people with them,but his therapist probably pointed out that they are quite literally paid to listen to people's problems, and they went through years of schooling to be able to listen to peoples problems, and honestly if he's not going to talk about his problems, he's wasting his (read:sirius) money. Remus learns to talk. I'd also really like to point out that I'm headcanoning that therapy culture is pretty much nonexistent. Like, in a world where almost any physical ailment can be fixed with a potion or wave of a wand, the idea of your mind being a problem is just not there. The only real time therapy happens when a doctor prescribes it because you're severely fucked in the head. The therapists are there, but a lot of people are probably surprised that kind of job exists. The Weasley's were given court recommended therapy mainly because the ministry was desperate to save face after their monumental fuck up. So sirius getting therapy is kind of a novel concept to begin with. But this guy just loves it so much, he insists both remus and harry get it. To remus, it's like having your life partner insist you try this brand new foreign diet they've been on, they feel so great on it, but he loves sirius so he goes anyways if only to get him to shut up. He goes to one or two sessions, then drop making any. He's goes to many more this 2. Harry, on the other hand, has heard of it in the muggle world, from the dursleys, but mostly in a negative light, the dursleys are of the opinion that all therapists are quacks trying to steal your money (says the used cared salesman), but he figures maybe Wizarding therapists are different, he'll give it a try, what does he have to lose. He loses very little, and gains very much.

-trio remains tight. Krum flirts with hermione. Ron's jealous obviously because he loves her and just doesn't know it yet, but he doesn't actively treat her like shit, especially the night of the dance. Maybe a berky comment here or there, but not so much as in Canon, and if she gets really upset he'll apologize.

-sirius gives a LOT of advice on getting a girl to go with him, like 3 pages, trying to figure which girls are taken which ones are interested in him. Consequently, he does not ask out cho, because he'll have bothered to ask around and see if she's dating anyone, most likely asks hermione. So he ends up asking the patils to go with him Ron. (this is because I think Krum/Hermione is an important relationship for her development as a character, and her self confidence. She can see herself as more than just brainy boring hermione Granger, she sees herself as a desirable girl. This is not to say she thinks her value is decided by a man, just learned that she has qualities considered attractive by a guy, and that she should be happy and confident about that. And I just honestly think ginny/neville is adorable. I'm still a Hinny maingirl, but I live gineville. I love how proud of himself is is with the dancing, that he can actually be good at something. He looks so happy after the ball, I couldn't bear to take that away.

-When harry mirrors his dogfathers about needing robes, he adds that Ron's robes look absolutely hideous. So sirius of course buys an extra set of Wizarding robes in Ron's size, and sends it with Harry's robes, including a note that explaining that they accidentally bought an extra in a larger size, but that the store doesn't accept returns, if he knew anybody that was the right size in need of a new set of robes, he should pass it on. And thus, Ron's dignity is saved.

-hermione goes with Krum, harry and Ron go with the patils, ginny and neville go together as per usual. Bright side to it, when sirius found out harry got a date, he sends a TEN PAGE essay of advice on hot to be a good date, make sure he has a good time, and make shire his date has a good time. Sirius mentions he should be a good bro and share it with Ron. Do harry shares it with Ron. So while now even though they aren't the pinnacle of perfect dates, they make a solid effort to be a good date. The patils have a pretty fun time, not perfect after all ron and harry probably at least unconsciously take a glance or to at hermione/cho, but they give most of their attention to the girls, and they have a fun time actually getting to go on a date with a girl. Hermiones night ends very well, having had a magical time with a guy who thinks her brain and looks are beautiful. All well that ends well.

-So for the sake of switching things up, because so little has changed, let's say harry mirrors his caninefathers explaining the egg, and Remus, having some experience with magical creatures from third year curriculum he taught, it maybe a line from when he took care of magical creatures in 7th year, says that the screaming he's describing sounds like mermaid language above water and that he should try opening below water. So harry goes to the lake, or sneaks into the prefect bathroom, something like that, listens to the egg, hears the song.

-tells remus and Sirius and hermione and ron, and Remus mentions some kind of plant he had heard of that could allow you to breathe underwater. Ron's goes 'neville's really into herbology, why don't you ask him?' cue harry in asking neville, neville telling him about gillyweed, and Sirius ordering a bulk order of it for harry to practice with. So harry gets a lot of time to practice, and has extra gillyweed in case he need more during the contest. Yes gillyweed is rare, but sirius is loaded and can buy whatever. So harry doesn't almost die trying to save everyone.

-when explain to sirius where he heard about the gully weed from, Sirius mentions his parents, and what happened to them, who he found out about when staying at st Mungos. Harry comments that he's really shy, but really brave. Remus who is there, wonders out loud at the difference and similarities between Peter and neville. How even when both teased by their peers, neville found bravery, while Peter found cowardice.

-this conversation strikes a chord in Harry, and he makes a point to compliment neville on his bravery in year 1, in standing up to the trio, that harry respects him for it and he doesn't think he ever told him that,and that neville deserves to hear it. Nevilles a bit stunned, and manages to ask what brought this on, and harry explains that his father and dogfathers (does not actually use that term) once had a friend who they teased more than they should have, but that instead of rising above the teasing and choosing to be brave, he fell to cowardice and that that cowardice cost his parents their lives and Sirius 12 years in prison. Neville is even more stunned, but thanks him. Harry makes it a point from then on to be friendlier to neville, spend some more time with him, not because he pities him, but because he respects and admires him. By the end of the year neville is solidly in the friend box, like ginny.

-Everything else pretty much proceeds as normal.

-maze contest. He and Cedric touch the cup. Because he is primed to react to any threats from the prank war he had at Marauder's Place over the summer, he is a moment faster in recognizing a dangerous situation and forcefully grabs Cedric to run to the cup Cedric is a bit closer and gets to the cup, worm tail is fast enough and pretrificus totaluses harry. Just before the spell hits him, Harry manages to push Cedric who hits the cup and shows up at hogwarts. Harrys encounter with voldielocks goes exactly the same, up until the prior incantatum. Dumbledore, either able to apparate from Cedric memory, track where the port key went or whatever, apparates with sirius and Remus who were obviously at the contest, with Aurors who are probably there as security for the minister. They all show up in the graveyard. Voldemort and Dumbledore trade spells for a few minutes, voldemort confirms he is actually voldemort, and the Aurors all see that he is really alive. Voldemort and Co split.

-everyone who is alive shows up back at hogwarts. Barty crouch has escaped, not bothering to take the trunk in his panic. The Aurors can prove voldemort is really alive, so the minister can not pretend he isn't. Moody is presumably rescued and identifys his kidnapper as Barty crouch.

-Is this all an ass pull so Cedric lives? Yes.

-Do I care? No.

And there's year 4. As I said, mostly nothing changes. Just a bunch of ripples. Will probably do year 5 tomorrow.
