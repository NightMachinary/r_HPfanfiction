full title: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, the fic where McGonagall turns Hermione into Elizer's self insert's slave and property via Unbreakable Vow for her own good because the alternative is Hermione being sent to Azkaban because Mysterious Figure from kingdom hearts popped into existence again and memory-edited her and Draco so he thinks she attacked him or something. What are your thoughts on this story?

Personally, I hate when Mysterious Figures pop up in stories. If you need conflict and mystery to be artificially injected into the story by someone in a black hooded cloak, look at why and fix that.


** Your summary made me want to re-read it again...

Seriously this is a great story, ways above other fanfiction written before and after. It's like Tolstoy: you can love him, you can hate him, but you can't object that he deserved his place in the World's literature.

*** Man, don't go making outrageous claims like that. I've read HPmor. It was a fun ff with an arsehole Harry and I had more than a few laughs. But it doesn't even make it to top twenty best fanfics. His was a series of cracky scenes intertwined with boring shit about an arsehole who doesn't know shit about science.

**** Anyone can have his/her own opinion.

It's still funny how fanfic authors and readers reject its influence despite the strong reaction even its mentioning causes (all the downvotes I got for just expressing an opinion :-) )

***** It's influence would be seen in tropes if it was as good as you claim though. I think it's a good story, better than most, but not as good as the author pretends it is. It has little to no character development, an incoherent story line and deeply flawed logic that falls apart as soon as you give it a seconds thought.

That being said, it was outrageously funny at times and I quite enjoyed some of the ideas and the way they were presented.

My point is, while HPmor was a good fanfic, it is nowhere near as good as that.
