I am currently writing a chapter in a story I've yet to start publishing. In it, Harry's parents survive that Halloween night, and he and his parents go to the Quidditch World Cup. Well, their arrival at the campgrounds is a little past six-o-clock. So Harry has to get up early that morning. He wakes up at five-o-seven that morning.

Until I reread a specific scene of Harry arriving at the campground in canon, I totally didn't realize the coincidence. In canon, the Weasleys, Diggorys, Harry and Hermione... arrive at "seven past five" from Stoatshead Hill. Five-o-seven. The same time Harry wakes up in my story on the very same day. But the time he woke up... was purely my own idea. I totally forgot about that moment in Goblet of Fire.


** Well, for a scene set in a muggle area, I randomly picked Watford in Hertfordshire. Later I found out that that's where the studio in which the Harry Potter movies were shot is located.

** linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by Ruskbyte) was begun more than a year before the release of J. K. Rowling's /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/. I've heard that it was a coincidence that the titles were so similar.

**** I don't know and if you have a link I'd like to read it.

In the case of her last two novels in the series, titles were known some months in advance but my Google-fu didn't indicate when she announced the title of her fifth book.

***** I think I remember people writing fanfiction guessing what the Order could be. I know I read a story wherein it was an ancient order of wizards including people like Merlin, Gryffindor etc.

According to this article, the title was known in 2000 and revealed the previous October, so basically in the previous millenium.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

**** It was one of the first in the "super!Harry" stories, an over-the-top juicing of the lead character.

It was good fanfiction for its time, but then this was fifteen or so years ago and there wasn't a whole lot to read back then in the fandom.

** I was always annoyed by the potter(claysmith) etymology usage in fanfics and decided to have the first potter be the son of a christian viking king(Harthacnut) who banishes him for being magical and he's cared for by a witch and her potter husband. I then found out the potter name came from a +king+dude called 'the potterer' and realized i got close to canon by accident.
