I've read a lot of fics these last 6 months. So much so, I can't visit my favourite tropes without having to scroll past dozens of fics I've already read. Now I want something that isn't on the top of every recommendations thread, or high up on the list on fanfic searches.

I've me anything, but id prefer no slash and minimal bashing


** So obscure stories? I see what I got.

Fever - linkffn(13441078) - Frozen Crossover: A story that I wish there was more of.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - An interesting story about Hogwarts becoming artsy.

Uncle Harry - linkffn(12282305) - A cute one-shot about Harry being the favorite uncle.

Rupert Grint and the Tears of Osiris - linkffn(13408693) - A story of how the actors were the characters they played.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Harry uses his parseltongue abilities more and slowly becomes a snake expert.

When Harry met Wednesday - linkffn(11674317) - Addam Family Crossover: One of the few that I found to behave good character dynamic.

Raptor - linkffn(11689576) - A Jurassic Park Crossover: One of the two that I have found that was well done.

Pack - linkffn(13391615) - A Jurassic Park Crossover: The other fic that was well done and engaging.

Best Served Cold - linkffn(12149140) - Just a fun crackfic about Harry being an auditor.

A Different Sort of Bond - linkffn(11260631) - An underrated Harry/Daphne fanfic that deserves more mention.

Some of the more obscure stories I know. I hope you enjoy this list. If you need more feel free to ask.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!

** Crossovers tend to get overlooked quite a bit. I'll see if I can dig up a few that don't really need the context of the other fandom.

Felix Fortuna: linkffn(13347956)

Only context you need is that the people mentioned in the opening scene are all Superheroes or Supervillains. They quickly become irrelevant after that. MC also has a superpower, but it's pretty apparent what it is, and I didn't find it detracted from the fic.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20: linkffn(8096183)

Classic example of crack played straight. Crossover with one of the earlier DnD editions, but you don't need to know anything about it.

Batman Doesn't 'Do' Magic: linkffn(8827254)

A little rough around the edges, and a bit weird, but this one filled an afternoon for me. I've never read or watched anything with Batman in it, and I followed this fine.

Full Metal Alchemist (linkffn(11823256), linkffn(11949378)):

These two both have the same rough premise are probably on the edge of fandom-outsider comprehensibility. If you're unfamiliar with Full Metal Alchemist, you could you could muddle through things with a quick wiki-walk or two. Maybe give them a miss if that's a problem.

  Due to unfortunate circumstance. Batman has landed right in the Great Hall at the Beginning of third year, and somehow acquired an undesired and unwanted magical ability in the process. Until he can find his way home and be rid of his new ability, he'll have to deal with the Wizarding World and all the quirks that come with it.

  They're still not sure exactly how they ended up on the magic side of a place called London, but Edward and Roy are not new to dealing with the unexpected. Needing to get home, they figure out how magic energy works and they make a mutual decision to go to Hogwarts. Neither of them are prepared for what they find at Hogwarts, or for what happens when Ed starts lying to Roy...

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.
