I've realised as of late that while I still love the HP world, I am getting a little tired of Harry, especially as a protagonist. I recently read "Harry Potter without Harry Potter," which I really liked... the HP world has so many really cool and interesting characters in it, and it was nice to take a break from the constant torrent of fics where Harry is the center of everything...

So! Can y'all recommend some good stories where the focus is on someone OTHER than Harry? It's okay if he APPEARS in the story -- long as he's not a major character -- but I want to see the other characters get some time in the spotlight, away from Harry.


** Most of the non-Harry centric stories I've read are romances. Is that okay with you, or are you looking for fics focused on adventure and action?

*** Mmm... I'd be more interested in adventure, but I can take romance. Long as it's not Hermione/Snape; that's where I draw the line!

**** Haha, same! I've tried, but I can't stand the pairing.

I'll try to keep the romance-heavy fics minimal:

linkffn(10871795; 11187179; 7148992; 4586362; 3157478; 9824342; 4590039; 9980492; 4030448; 11636560; 11923164; 3124159; 11946284; 8601821; 11867729; 7523798; 11453335; 10070079; 11027125; 12386916; 12139291; 3037156; 8260570)

You've probably read some of these since they were, at one point or another, recommended a lot on this subreddit. I was also a bit liberal in my interpretation of 'adventure', by which I mean some of these don't fall under that category at all, but are more angst, hurt/comfort, etc.

I'd also recommend Colubrina for non-Harry centric fics, though I'd also like to put a 'warning' of sorts with that. Colubrina's fics usually focus on a very specific kind of Hermione--badass, cunning and powerful. It can get a bit boring after a while, but that's just my personal opinion. Colubrina's most recent fic seems to have recently shifted towards a less worshipful portrayal of Hermione, though.

Edit: I might have gone a bit overboard with the recs ._.

*** Very nice... with one exception.

"Seventh Horcrux" counts as a Harry-centric story. Yes, yes, he's "really" Voldemort-in-Harry's-body or whatever, but the story lists Harry as the main character, everyone in-story refers to him as Harry, and he's essentially in Harry's role -- plus, he's not that different from your traditional, annoyingly arrogant Power!Harry. For all intents and purposes, he's Harry.

The rest of the stories seem to follow the criteria, though! :)

***** Sorry, but I have to disagree there. If it looks like Harry, answers to the name of Harry, is in the same situation as Harry, and is viewed as being Harry -- then it's Harry.

True, the Harry of this fic has none of Harry's actual personality, but neither do the Harrys of most power!Harry stories I read, so that's really a secondary concern for me.

Yeah, and a many of those should be labelled OC as protagonist too (excluding those that clearly start out with the original Harry and show some believable shift in morals or character). They just use Harry because they know that it will attract more readers than labelling as what it is: A shitty self-insert OC fic.

#+begin_quote
  Six months after Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, someone decided to turn back time and change history where Harry Potter was reduced to nothing more than a myth. Strangely, only Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, mortal enemies at best, were unaffected by the sudden time shift. Now they must find a way to return to their true timeline as only they know the truth.

** How do you feel about slash and femslash? (I know this sub tends to be anti-slash, but I figured I'd ask.) Also, my favorite authors tend toward shorter fics, mostly character studies and romance, for very loose definitions of romance. But if that's not what you're looking for, I won't waste your time linking them.

*** Well, I'll admit that I'm generally not too interested in romance stories, no matter the gender of the pairing. I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to romance stories, and fanfic writers in general don't write romance to my standards.

That said, as a bisexual woman, I'm not anti-slash, OR anti-femslash, by any means....

...well, okay, I'm definitely anti-any-stories that pair Harry or Ron or Neville up with Snape, Voldemort or any of the Malfoys, but that has nothing to do with the pairings being slash, and everything to do with the pairings being STUPID.

**** Ah. Well, I have some recs that don't include Snape, but on the other hand, as someone who reads and writes Snape/Harry slash and was going to rec you a Snape/Neville slash fic, I suspect my tastes will be too far from yours to give you any pleasure. But it looks like other commenters in this thread have come through with a bunch of long fic recs, so you have a decent selection to browse. Good luck with your search!

****** I only have two fics to recommend, since the others I used to enjoy have disappeared from the internet along with their archives.

The main one, which I love a great deal, is linkao3(1104139). It's old, and since it was written before canon ended, the author created her own version of the Battle of Hogwarts. It's wonderful and moving, and one of my favorites.

The other has some dialogue punctuation problems and a too reasonable Snape, but it's still a lovely fic. linkao3(51549)

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.

  Wherein I take a giant leap from set-ups in book 7 to create a post-war wizarding world that isn't quite the bright shiny penny we get in the epilogue. Neville gets whumped a bit; Severus acts a touch more well-rounded; Hermione is confident and caring; a bunch of new teachers get vaguely silly names, and there are quotes from Monty Python.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** I started writing a story because i wanted this too!!! To explore the normal life of an average magician in the world! My story starts at the end of the first wizarding war in 1981 and goes through those ten years before the main series with Harry starts in 1991. My main characters are adult witches and it is about their families and how they learn to live and heal from the war.
