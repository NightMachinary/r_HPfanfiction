*** I know what you meant... but now I am disappointed that Harry doesn't literally use gorilla warfare in this story.

As in transfiguring things into gorillas.

  He also uses "battle" transfiguration, which comes close to Guerilla Warfare.

If you are good enough with transfiguration, you can probably be part of /Gorilla/ warfare too.

*** I think a big reason why I liked it so much was that it had one of the most satisfying endings in HP fanfiction. A lot of stories start great or have an interesting premise but just straight to hell mid way through and have terrible endings or worse, no ending at all. Many deaths of HP was fairly consistent throughout (except for a minor rita part, but it's only a single paragraph that's off).

**** Yeah, he finished off Voldemort in a believeable way using the skills he had earned throughout his life so far despite Voldemort being a more powerful wizard. Very satisfying ending which is rare in most fanfics.

** I did enjoy it a good deal myself, minus some pacing issues. But besides being a tad too long it was really good.
