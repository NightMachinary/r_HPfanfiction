I don't know about you guys, but I want more Harry Potter but I was satisfied with the ending and wouldn't change a thing. (Except Cursed Child).

So I decided to write a story about set a bit into the future, around Harry's grandchildren's time but focused on new characters and a different wizarding world. Muggle technology has advanced, so wizard kind is more stringent than ever about the statute of secrecy. There is also a new deadly threat that if not stopped will mean the end of wizard kind.

I'm currently 3 chapter's in and at 4k words. I'm trying to gauge interest but am going to write the story anyway because I'm in love with some of the characters already (even the villain(s)!


** Whoops! I didn't leave much of a premise did I?

A young boy discovers his power and with the support of his parents begins his magical education underthe brightest headmistress since Dumbledore. But rumors of strange disappearances and magic unknown disturb the sleep of the wizarding world and the one closest to the truth behind them is a first year with an affinity for potions.

*** Yeah give it a bash. My only advice is that first and foremost write for yourself.

*** Well, its still not that much of a premise. Its a summary and from that alone, I'd probably give it a go if someone recommended it on here, but I probably wouldn't click it when I see it on FFN.

For a feedback on your premise you'd have to expand on it a bit. I'd also work on your summary, give it a bit more urgency.

As a general thing: Of course, go for it. If you're already liking what you did, doing the rest is gonna be a blast. OC stories normally don't gather much audience, so don't be scared off by a lack of attention at first. Alexandra Quick had a hard time at the beginning as well.

*** This is a much better summary. Like seriously though, your first summary sounded like every EWE fic ever written, but this actually sounds pretty interesting. Please do give us an update when you release it.

** I don't generally read OCs but it does sound interesting. As someone already said, write for yourself.
