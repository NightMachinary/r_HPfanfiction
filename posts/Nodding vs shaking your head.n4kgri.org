I've read a few fics that confuse me when someone is described as shaking their head to say yes. Has anyone come across this? Is this an Americanism or even in different parts of the UK?

Edit to clarify - I'm talking about the phrasing, not the action itself!


** It's definitely not anything from Britain, I did read somewhere that certain places in Eastern Europe do shake their head in the affirmative, like Bulgaria iirc.

*** I've read a fic where that was part of Krum's characterization: it took him awhile to remember British people do it the opposite of Bulgarians, so he'd do the wrong one and Hermione'd get the wrong message, then he started self-correcting so he looked confused.

I think it was Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire?

***** Sort of but not quite. The fic I meant is actually titled with an ampersand and the author hasn't written anything else linkao3(21187844). So if you were looking for Books 3 and 4 of another series, I think the answer's "no".

  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

** When someone says "He shook his head to say yes." I'm pretty sure they still mean the person nodded his head up and down, they're just using another word. Other cultures do shake their heads side to side to say yes, but they're not prevalent enough for me to see it as often as I do in fanfiction.

*** Yeah that's what I mean. When I read shake I assume no, so I have to double take to understand yes. I think it's a vocab difference rather rather a different action.

** We definitely don't do that in America, I think it's just an odd way of saying they nodded.

** never understood this either.

up down = yes,\\
side to side = no.

That is how I have been taught it and how most people in my country understand it, and it always takes me a second read to make sure whether or not the character was saying yes or no, taking me out of it.

** I've always taken nodding to mean up and down, meaning yes. With shaking your head meaning moving it left and right, meaning no.

** YES! this annoys the crap outta me, for me it's nodding the head for yes, and shaking the head for no, I don't write, but when I see it I almost always do a double take and have to re-read and think for a second.

** Sometimes people roll their eyes, and shake their heads, but it is still taken as an affirmative. It depends on the situation and context.
