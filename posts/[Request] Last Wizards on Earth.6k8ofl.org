Some time ago, I saw a Reddit post that asked about a story in which Charlie [Weasley] and Hermione were the last two wizards (or in Hermione's case, witch) on earth after some type of event. However, I can't find that exact link anymore. I believe the story is on Wattpad and dealt with the different POV's of both Hermione and Charlie, and how they came together after, what seems to be, some post-apocalyptic scenario. Does anyone know what story this is and where I could find it? (I unfortunately do not remember the author's name.)


** To those that wish to know, I found it. The story is called "Whom the Gods Would Destroy" by ianthe_writing. It's available on LiveJournal and was posted back in 2008.
