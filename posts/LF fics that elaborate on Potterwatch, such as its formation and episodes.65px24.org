  "Potterwatch was legitimized by its dedication to truth, capacity for serious discourse, and avoidance of reverse-propaganda. This separated it from other rebel media, such as the short-lived radio programme Up Voldemort's Arse which spent several months insisting that Harry Potter was raising an army of dragons in Romania." - Snackleholt, Bingsley. "In A Time of Great Need." Wixen Politics Weekly 24 May 2002. Print.
