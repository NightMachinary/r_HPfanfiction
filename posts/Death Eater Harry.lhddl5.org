I want stories with Harry being recruited to Voldemort's side. Whether it's through blackmail or willingly doesn't matter (though I do love the ones where Harry is sarcastic and disobedient). I find I like Tom/Harry and Harry/Draco the most. Or at least the ones were Harry and Draco are friends. I enjoy bad/manipulative Dumbledore a lot but I also like the ones where it's Harry's upbringing and the abuse that pushes him to the Dark. I know in most him going dark stories puts him against Sirius and Remus but I'd love it if anyone knew any where they learn Harry's reasons and the follow him.

Currently reading *Death of Today* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2093991/Epic-Solemnity][Epic Solemnity]] and it's a great example of what I'm looking for.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.* “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.”
