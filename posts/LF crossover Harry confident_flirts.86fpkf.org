  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
