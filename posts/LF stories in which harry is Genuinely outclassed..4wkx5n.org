*** Well, in canon, Harry was outclassed even in final battle. Every single time, Harry escaped Voldemort due to luck provided Harry was courageous, daring, credit to JKR, each time due to different variation - first year - Lily's sacrifice, 2nd year Phoenix & Sorting Hat, 4th time - brother wand, 5th year - unusual bond with Voldemort, 7th year - during seven Potters events, due to Phoenix wand's reaction, in the forest, due to him being a horcrux & lastly due to elder wand.

But when an author writes a fanfic, s/he can't genuinely always use these elements, can s/he? Because readers always expect new things. But again very few writers can bring original ideas that isn't ridiculous. So most of the stories tend to super Harry's.

****** While I wouldn't say Dumbledore didn't genuinely try to beat Voldemort because we really can't say I am sure he could have done a lot more. Perhaps the prophecy did hold him back.

And Dumbledore did expect Harry to sacrifice himself. He 'guessed' Harry wasn't going to die and no matter how good his guesses are there wasn't a certainty that he would survive.

There are flaws with characters and there's nothing wrong with that because that's what makes us relate to them and like them. But my issue is with the fact that so much was left to chance.

#+end_quote

Harry dying was by far the most likely outcome, unless a miracle happened. Harry had Voldemort --- one of the three mightiest wizards in the century --- out to kill him as his number one priority. Harry, while a plenty talented wizard himself, was not in the same league as Voldemort, not in terms of raw talent, and definitely not in terms of ability achievable in reasonable amount of time, regardless of how hard he trained. Sooner or later, he would run out of luck and out of miracles like Sacrificial Protection and Brother Wands. And then, he would die. (Now, Voldemort taking his blood and anchoring him was nice and all, but that would just mean that he would die; then die again; and then Voldemort would visit upon him such suffering that he would wish he could die.)

The only one who could challenge Voldemort directly was Dumbledore, but Dumbledore could not protect Harry forever --- especially not if he wanted to protect others as well, or accomplish anything else, for that matter --- and I don't think Harry would want him to, either. Nor was Dumbledore able to defeat Voldemort when they actually fought. And, with Voldemort being immortal, and Dumbledore an old man, time was on Voldemort's side.

And then, he discovered that Harry was a horcrux, so even if he managed to kill Voldemort, Harry would still have to die to make it stick.

And so, Dumbledore set up a miracle. He did the best he could to set in motion a sequence of events that required a great deal of luck --- or Karma, or Hand of Fate, if you prefer --- so that perhaps Voldemort could be killed but Harry could survive after all. And it worked.

1. Executing prisoners is evil, and Potterverse is not a morally indifferent universe --- in the long run, it does punish evil.

2. I may be misremembering, but most likely, he deferred to the Ministry, which made the actual decision. He could have probably overruled them, but he doesn't want to set a precedent that Might Makes Right and having a crippling fear of his own power and authoritarianism /is/ one of his character flaws.

3. As long as Voldemort was around, he could always recruit more. They might not be as good in battle as his old followers, but Voldemort was providing most of the firepower in the first place.

Just like a team of aurors was able to arrest Dumbledore at the end of OotP? For better or for worse, wizards of Dumbledore's and Voldemort's caliber can fight off virtually any number of lesser opponents, barring a miracle.

If nothing else, Death Eaters are useful to Voldemort because without them, he wouldn't be able to actually rule (i.e., govern) his conquest.

Competent wizards are awfully hard to catch when they don't want to be caught. Studies of justice systems show that when it comes to deterrence, certainty of punishment matters far more than severity. No matter how ruthless or severe this Dumbledore would be, certainty would be even lower than it would be for a Muggle police state.

Logistical issues aside (E.g., what do you do when SK dies of old age or has an accident?), I see your Fidelius and I raise you Felix Felicis: a luck-enhanced adversary would know exactly whom to target, exactly how to cast a good Imperius, and so on, in order to assassinate your SK, and then everybody in your society-within-a-society is an SK.

I think that you may have lost track of what we were talking about. This isn't about people punishing each other. This is about an epic cosmic slapdown for an epic crime against nature times six, or something comparable. It's Ariana dying to turn Dumbledore away from Grindelwald, so that rather than conquering the world together, he instead fought and stopped him; it's about a prophecy appearing in the darkest hour, and Voldemort falling for it hook, line, and sinker, getting himself defeated for the first time; and it's about the Elder Wand finding its way into Voldemort's possession, while being loyal to Harry through a sequence of events that fundamentally could not have been planned, so that Voldemort could be defeated once and for all.

Oh, and I think we've already had the whole "They should've punished Death Eaters more!" discussion months ago, and the answer is still the same: there are many ways to handle this sort of a situation, ranging from summary execution to Truth and Reconciliation; and which one is best depends on the situation.

** Harry was hopelessly outclassed in canon, and he only won through an insane amount of luck and countless stupid mistakes by his enemy.

Canon Harry (actually ALL good guys) failed to have any kind of coherent strategy to defeat Voldemort. They basically stumbled and reacted passively to whatever their enemies threw at them, and left their enemies have the initiative. Fortunately, Voldemort and his Death Eaters were also barely competent, and with a good amount of luck, they prevailed.

For example after year 5, when Harry already knew the stake, he didn't continue the DA to increase his support base, and neither did he use his 'chosen one' status to least get the trace for him and his friends revoked. Of course, Harry getting smarter would make things easier for him later and JKR certainly wouldn't have none of that.

Also after year 5, when Dumbledore knew he was dying and the Ministry was likely to fall, he didn't prepare Harry and his Order for this eventuality. With his knowledge and experience, he should at least tell them of the Taboo! If Harry ever got captured, it would be basically game over! (The lucky escape from Malfoy Manor should never be included in any planning!)

After year 6, Harry should have at least the foresight to withdraw some serious money and transfer his Potter and Black accounts to some secure foreign locations. At least Hermione should have thought of that. Then the ridiculous camping trip from hell would have never happened. But no, JKR wants our heroes to suffer and readers to feel for them, so heroes had to remain STUPID.

*** Indeed, why not put some house under the fidelius (that's not easily compromised - like headquarters - because only the 3 of them know) with say Hermione acting as the secret keeper or do what some fanfictions do: Make a house-elf (Dobby!) the secret keeper (Voldemort would never think of it because he's to arrogant to consider beings that aren't human to be worth anything, I mean he doesn't even consider 90% plus of the human race to be worth anything (the muggles!))

Indeed, Dumbledore and the order are relatively worthless in a war (it's only because the deatheaters and Voldemort aren't all that competent either that they have a chance and it's luck that they win in the end!), no planning, no contingencies (like say: move everybody to diverse locations under the fidelius (like resistance-cells, only the cell leaders stay in contact with each other but don't know the others locations, so the network can never be compromised if someone is captured!)), no bringing in international support or even use money to get mercenaries etc. etc. or put prices on the DE's heads (!)

No, not even training...the order doesn't even train its own members (I would make it mandatory, kind of the order version of the DA...make Moody the one to do it and you'd get a fighting force in the end and not something that resembles a headless burned chicken!)

Don't get me started on Harry! The only time that idiot (and I mean that, he's got potential but never uses it!) ever applies himself really is when his favorite past-time is in danger (quidditch when the dementors knock him out!)...even the training for the tournament wasn't great (come on, he did learn what? 10 new spells (if that)?...summoning, point me, reducto and what exactly?) and in the DA he only taught them one thing (everything else they should already know, but don't thanks to crappy defense teachers!): The patronus, his only real accomplishment (sorry, but the marauders and the twins apply themselves more and those people aren't threatened by Voldemort, no they do it for frivolous reasons (pranks!)...IMHO Harry should have at least tried to be the best he can be after first year and his brush with death at the end! In his own way Harry is worse than Ron and kind of has a victim mentality: Oh look at poor little me...Oh woe is me...etc. etc.!)

linkffn(Harry Potter And Thre Elemental's Power) - might be what you are searching. I am yet to finish it, read 40ish chapters, so far I like it.

Sezza's Denarian series linkffn(4359957; 3473224; 3856581)

They are actually fairly similar to the wizards of Britain in the story, in that they always get told how amazing Dumbledore is and what kind of power he commands and therefore expect him to be perfect and solve every problem without any difficulties.

They completely disregard his past and his morals most of the time. There's a reason he didn't want to become Minister, there's a reason that he wants to give some people second chances.

*** On The Way to Greatness is my favorite Slytherin!Harry fic. It's one of the only ones that has a portrayal of the House that i find reasonable. There are way too many fics that make all male Slytherin out to be rapists and all the females pushover whores, it's ridiculous.

I'm not a big fan of the Denarian series. I only read the first one to about 3/4 until i realised that Harry is never going to change and while his attitude was somewhat entertaining at first it gets rather boring if there's literally no character development.

And James Spookie i generally find to be too fluffy. I've read some of his stories when i'm in the mood for it but it's not really what i'm looking for.

I'll check out the Elemental one though. Usually i shy away from that kind of fic because it just sounds like teenager wish fulfillment what with Harry having some kind of special power and then usually starting a Harem because why the fuck not, but i guess i can at least give it a try before i judge the story by it's name only.
