Looking for a few fics where the pairing is Harry/someone who is not a main character or usual pairing. I recently read a Harry/Susan Bones fic and it has me interested.

Requirements are no slash, no bashing of Dumbledore or the Weasleys, and obviously no main characters. I'd prefer it to be well written and long novel length, so 100,000 - 500,000 words. Any longer and I find myself getting a little bored to be honest. I'm fine with original characters as long as they make sense to the plot, so no self inserts just for the self insert of it all, and it's fine if those original characters are muggle as well. Also, if it's the best fic you've ever read but it doesn't quite meet my requirements you can ignore them and recommend it anyway.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
