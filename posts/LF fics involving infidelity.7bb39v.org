  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

A few more years later, while Harry was having his fun killing enemies, Hermione was cracking under its strain. She felt neglected by Harry and cheated on Harry with Jack O'Neill, Harry soon knew and killed Jack.]]

  Harry Potter has escaped grief twice now, looking to distract himself as a volunteer at St. Mungo's. But it seems he's not alone in this escape, and it may be more than work that distracts him. But perhaps he was looking for more than a get-away in the first place... Hear a playlist for The Volunteer by visiting the link on my profile!

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
