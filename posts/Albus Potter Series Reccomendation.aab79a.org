** Personally I couldn't make it past the first book, but that's because I have a major stipulation for /any/ next-gen story: No clones. The series is well-written but it lacks truly unique characterization.

** This could be a personal thing, but I found the series introduced a lot of characters and it was difficult for me to remember who was who. Especially given how many Weasleys there are in next-gen, it's tough to remember who that character is when their name is dropped.

It also was advertised as having the Wizarding World revealed to Muggles, and while that does happen by the end of the first book, it never really feels like it has much impact on the story; you never really see the effects of it firsthand.

All that being said, I did overall enjoy the series! The mystery which unfolds throughout around powerful new spells is quite compelling, and it comes to a head nicely.

Regarding your questions, Harry is a bit sidelined, he isn't the focus of the books much, though he does make appearances every so often. I can't even recall where Ron and Hermione show up, so that answers that, I guess. As mentioned above, they do wind up searching for powerful spells, so eventually things go above the power level of canon, but things are kept balanced nicely, and the villain is convincing until the end, IMO.

Overall, I would recommend it if you're in the mood for a long next-gen series, though I can't see myself rereading it anytime soon.
