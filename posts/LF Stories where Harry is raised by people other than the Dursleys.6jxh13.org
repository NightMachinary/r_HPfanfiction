They can be either magical or muggle, it doesn't matter.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871), is one of the better robst fics. James and Lily survived and raised Harry, who had a quite enjoyable childhood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is extreme AU, even in Muggle world. James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and ran off with Harry to the Continent. Harry never went to Hogwarts and made his career in the Muggle military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving...

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), Harry ran away at age 5 and was picked up by Grangers. Dumbledore found out soon and was actually happy about the situation. He also told them about Harry's real deal and brought Tonkses to help them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings and had lots of fun together.

In both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542;10937871), Harry was raised by 'good' Dursleys.

There are lots of 'Harry raised by Sirius' fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] especially likes this theme. However, my favorite here is still [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), where a more cunning and sinister Lucius Malfoy managed to kick out Dumbledore and had ruled magical Britain for almost 20 years. Dumbledore would however make his return after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. He and Sirius prepared Harry extensively for the eventual showdown with Malfoy and Voldemort.

Finally, McGonagall raised Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]], linkffn(3160475).

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Away from manipulative old men and corrupt governments, Death Eaters and Dark Lords. They never intended to land on the world of Remnant, but it may just be the perfect getaway.

** Methods of Rationality, linkffn(5782108) . Although you probably know about that one already.

Another one is Whispers in the Night, linkffn(12104688). In this one Harry is adopted (in third year) by Amelia Bones. Imo it gets a bit too slow and long and drama-y at some point. Plus after a point the pairing is hillarious in a bad way. But still. It has Daphne in it and not in the Slytherin Ice Queen persona. It has unbearingly huge sex scenes sometimes. But it starts great. It has a fucking amazing beginning and only gets tiring after the middle of what has currently been written. And we are talking about 49 chapters and 600+k words.

There aslo was another one I read where Harry is adopted by the Woods but I don't remember the title.
