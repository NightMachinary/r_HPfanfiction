** I haven't actually read it, and not quite the same as what you are asking, and it's also abandoned. But there's Hogwarts Battle School. Which is basically Enders Game but at Hogwarts as far as I can tell.

** Amicus Protectio Fortis linkffn(11547735) has superwealthy Harry funding the DA as a private army. Including using a Britain wide version of the Mauraders' Map to track Death Eaters.

#+begin_quote
  "Everyone else," he spoke up. "Tonight, we're going to be tagging as many of them as we can with the tracking spell Hermione and Chie developed. If any of them get away and come into contact with another dark mark, the tracking spell should spread to them. Eventually we should have one big map of Death Eaters,"

*** It sadly devolves into something resembling a Lord Harry fic after like 3 chapters.

I was extremely disappointed, but only because the premise was so good to start with.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

** OOOH finally I can answer!! Through The Fire by SongAngel on ao3 really ramps up the DA, but changes the vibe to a pack of wolves. It's insanely well done and my all-time favourite fic
