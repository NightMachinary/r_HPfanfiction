Okay so I've read this fanfiction like three time before but I always end up forgetting what it's called and I NEVER SAVE IT BC IM AN IDIOT anyway I was looking for it again and I CANNOT find it at all and I was hoping somebody else had read it and could help me out here bc it's seriously got a lot of good writing and I'm bored in quarantine and need to read it again.

Okay so it basically goes like this, so on Harry's 16th birthday he gets a letter from Snape telling him that Lily told him to make sure he got letters from her about the creature inheritance he was going to get. Now by creature, I mean a djinn, or essentially a genie. He quickly discovers that he's a very powerful djinn but can not access his powers without a master, and the only way someone can own him is if they have possession of his wand. Fast forward a little bit and Voldemort attacks hogsmead and the ootf and the da all go out to help, it ends with a big clash between Harry and our boy Tom in town square where he manages to take Harry's sand and, lo and behold, Harry's djinn powers activate and he's under Voldemort's control. Over time they get closer, at one point there's a hot vampire lady there? Like it's just a lot but honestly it was such a good book and I seriously need help finding it again please, please, PLEASE, somebody help me! If you've read this book you know exactly what I mean when I say Harry is an absolute unit of chaos and I need that in my life rn.
