The bloodstatus of characters in the wizarding world is always important in stories - even if the protagonist believes that muggleborn are equal to purebloods, there is always scrutiny from the side of some families or the government involved.

But at least they are magical. I think I haven't read a single story where the love-interest was non-magical so far. And I do mean stories with the protagonist being magical, not some AU story where magic doesn't exist.

Any stories that have a dynamic like this?


** This came up a few weeks ago and we didn't get many recommendations however feel free to look. "Grow young with me" is fantastic and should be the first comment on the thread.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

Draco Malfoy ends up dating a Muggle in this series. That sounds terrible, I know, but it works a lot better than you'd think and the story does a pretty decent job of showing how the character could get to a point where that wouldn't be completely absurd and OOC. It's not actually a romance story, though - that's a fairly minor subplot and the character isn't even introduced until later. So if you're looking for something that focuses on that more heavily, you'll probably be disappointed.

** Maybe no one can really imagine it. To be honest, if I was magical I wouldn't date a muggle. But here's a story where Draco Malfoy does.
