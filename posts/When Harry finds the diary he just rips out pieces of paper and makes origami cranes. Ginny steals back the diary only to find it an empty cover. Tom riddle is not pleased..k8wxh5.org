** Harry races into the girls bathroom only to be annoyed at finding Myrtle there.

/Crap, I might have picked the wrong door. Blimey, nevermind, I have to go on with this. No turning back now./

He bolted to a stall and yelled.

"Get out!"

Myrtle was stunned, and between sobs turned to the enraged boys. His face almost red. "Harry? I-. I never seen you like this."

"I said out!"

Myrtle stopped crying to show a frown. "Fine! No one cares about old Moaning Myrtle. It was only matter of time before you turned up like them"

And with a wail she splashed into the toilet. Harry, found himself unpleasantly wet with toilet water, but in the current case he didn't care. She would get some of it as well.

Harry unbuckled his belt and pulled down his trousers. Then he sat down.

"Run away form this one Myrtle!!!" Harry said as the first loose stool came out of him.

It felt as if the whole the bathroom shook with the blasting sound of his farts. He pressed his hands against the other stalls as his feet clung to the floor for dear life.

"Oh Merlin! Here it comes again!" thundered Harry, the ghost of his last pumpkin juice coming out of him.

"Harry! You're disgusting!" Myrtle's voice echoed through the pipes.

With his next trumpetish succession of sounds, Harry's sweat intensified. "To hell with Voldemort! This is it! This is what is going to kill me! Bloody Indian food! Last time I listen those two girls and their food suggestions!"

The squishy festival of Harry's lose stomach as he felt as if his very magic wanted to exit through his arse.

"Expecto.... Crap!"

The biggest and loudest shite in the world was released and, in the deepest pit below him, it seemed as the very spirit of Salazar Slytherin was mourning. Then utter silence. Only a distant droplet of water was heard.

Harry heaved, looking around. He was alone. It was over. Finally over.

"I made it. I got rid of all that crap..." Harry whispered... Then started laughing like a madman in triumph.

His euphoria was only interrupted by the most macabre of realizations.

"Blimey... There's no bath tissue!"

Harry turned around desperately as the worst of his nightmares came true. Then proceeded to his last resource .

"We, Myrtle!?" He called "A little help here?"

"The nerve! Forget it Harry! Curse you and your rotting arse!" Myrtle shouted from afar.

"Brilliant," whine Harry. "Now what?"

That's when his eyes fixed on the wet floor in front of him and something made him smile. An old book in a poodle. It seemed old, but all that mattered to Harry at the moment was the fact that it had plenty of blank yellowish pages.

"Great. This will do." He said.

*** What. The. Fuck.

That was revolting, and maybe it's because it's midnight but I legitimately gagged a few times reading it. That's the thing. As much as I wanted to look away from this I physically was unable. I vividly imagined the scenario while reading and now I feel like vomiting. I also actually forgot the prompt until I read the last paragraph. Hell, I couldn't even remember my first name while reading this. I was in some sort of trance, unable to think about anything other then Harry shitting in the most grotesque fashion. I'll never recover from this. I'll never be able to erase this image from my mind I'm going to have nightmares tonight, and it's all your fault. I hope you're happy. On a side note, I think that there is one more thing that is able to destroy a Horcrux.

**** "I would hex you if I didn't felt like I was about to shit the crap out of me!" Yelled Hermione at Draco as she went looking for the loo.

Narcissa made a face of utter contempt at the middle of the Quidditch world cup stands. "Third class filth, you better staying away from her Draci. Can you believe it dear?"

"Barely"said Lucius almost in a drawl.

"They want to think they're the same as us. But these mudbloods keep using the loos like cave people. Instead of using convenient waste removal spells, as the fine people we ought to be." Said Narcissa, raising her nose, "Actually, if you excuse me"

At that Narcissa went down, pulled her knickers down and started shitting in the stands. At one point Cornelius Fudge passed and raised his hat as he moved across from them. He gave no sign of anything unusual going on.

"Will join you as soon as my wife finishes with pending affairs." Said Lucius as Narcissa kept shitting next to him.

"Oh no need to hurry," Fudge says, "let the lady do as she pleases. Hope everything comes out alright"

"Thank you Minister" said the squatting Mrs Malfoy after a particularly dreadful stool. "Such a delight to have civilized people still around".

With that the woman stood up and and flicked her wand, making her greenish brown mess disappear. "Would you mind?" She asked her husband leaning forward.

"None at all" Lucius said, vanishing the remaining excrement out of her fine wife's arse.

"Can we go to the game now?" Urged Draco in a hurry.
