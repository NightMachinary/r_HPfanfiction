Of the same premise, where Hermione ends up raising the children of death eaters as a foster parent. And does anyone know the origin of the Thorfinn / Hermione nicknames Princess and superstar. I don't remember this from the books so it is from a fanfic?


** Everything Thorfinn/Hermione is fanon and mostly based on one author's ex boyfriend. Thorfinn and Hermione have, I think, two possible interactions in canon: Battle of the Astronomy Tower (Rowle was the crazy blond wizard firing off random spells that even killed a fellow Death Eater) and the coffee shop in DH when she obliviated him.
