  and the character development

I can tell you that any story with Hermione and Lucius in a romantic relationship throws that out of the window. Hermione would never get together with the magical equivalent of Heinrich Himmler. Well, maybe to arrange his execution in a NÃ¼rnberg trial setting, but that isn't particularly romantic.

In canon universe, pairing Hermione together with Lucius together is indeed the equivalent of asking [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Jonas-Rosenzweig][Helen Hirsch]] to marry Heinrich Himmler or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Hess][Rudolf Hess]] (whom I think actually was more similar to Lucius Malfoy).

Unless of course you go into extreme AU, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny][Roundabout Destiny]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]. I mean if you can get Harry/Bellatrix to work in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], I'm sure an author of reasonable skill could get a very AU Hermione/Lucius to work.

**** Not in a postwar setting. Lucius owns the place where she was tortured, he nearly got all Hogwarts students killed, mistreated Dobby (and Hermione hated Crouch for Winky, so that counts for something) and was an inner circle Death Eater.

How can you have a romance when one party should either be outright executed or, at the very least, thrown into prison for life? If you really want to pair them, time travel would be the only believable tool to do so, and even that would still make Hermione incredibly OOC.

** I would certainly be interested in having a look, and can then advise if I would have the skill to critique?
