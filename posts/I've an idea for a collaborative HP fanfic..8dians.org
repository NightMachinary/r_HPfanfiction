.....where someone starts a Harry Potter Fanfic, posts it to reddit, and the first person to comment will change the direction of the story in someway, by posting the next chapter. I would imagine this could go on for maybe a month where the story evolves from one thing to another, with a new chapter being written each day. Characters and story ideas should only be relevant to HP canon.


** Wanted to post this to reddit but never got the chance. Starting fourth year after the badges were made. (Not reviewed by a Beta so sorry about and grammar and spelling errors).

Chapter 1:

Harry had finally mastered his newest spell that had no relation, well most likely no relation, to anything he'd have to do in the tournament. Quite frankly with the fight going on with his best male friend, the whole student body practically turning on him, again, and Dumbledore and the staff doing nothing to help him... he was past the breaking point.

The new Potter stinks badges were what finally did it, as he waited patiently for the dining hall to fill up at dinner.

Once all were in attendance he stood up on his bench, cast the newly learned sonorous spell on himself and began.

“Hey Draco!” he started as the hall went quite, causing all to look at him or the platinum blonde haired boy. “I agree with your badge. Diggory is the true champion. The other part, Potter Stinks, although worth a laugh, not very clever. How about something like ‘Potter's so hairy that his dead parents must have been part acromantula'?” he asked as there were many gasps, wide eyes, and shocked expressions.

“Oh come on, everyone knows about my dead parents, the ones who sacrificed themselves and stopped Voldemort?” he asked again to more gasps. “Oh, while we're on the topic of dark lords...Draco, you should add, ‘Potters so stupid he went against professor Quirrell, a follower of Voldemort's, who could have killed anyone at this school, to keep everyone at Hogwarts safe. Or Better than that, ‘Potter's so dumb that he went recklessly against Slytherin's pet beast, the one that tried to kill and petrify all the muggle born student body, to again keep everyone at this school safe'. Even though they whispered about Potter going ‘dark' and ‘evil' because Potter can speak to snakes ” he added, seeing the looks of someone who just got told a secret, especially from the foreign students.

Harry saw the staff wanted to stop him but luckily a certain house elf had slipped a potion into their drinks that momentarily stopped them.

He still decided to speed things up “Or how about Potter's so gullible that he thought his Godfather, Sirius Black, betrayed his parents but really it was Peter Pettigrew, another Death Eater and unregistered rat animagus. The same Peter Pettigrew who all believed to be dead because all that was left of him was a finger, the same finger missing from my former best friend's ancient pet rat!”

“But that mass murder was put in prison, tried and convicted!, you might want to yell...The same incompetent government that let an underage student be placed into this tournament is the same one that denied Sirius a trial!” Harry continued.

“Why not ‘Potter is so dense that he thought the student body would obviously know he didn't put his name in the goblet because he is not remotely talented enough, nor is he stupid enough to think he could possibly make it through the tournament and beat the three highly talented true champions'. Not to mention the fact that if Potter did it, he is such a glory hog that he'd admit it and boast that he did it. Or there is ‘Potter is so stupid he thought that everyone would know it doesn't make sense to pull something off and so readily deny it'. Potter thought people would know that Potter gets in enough trouble so it can't be to save his hide from a punishment” he continued before putting an end to it and striking back.

“Here Draco, I got it! ‘Potter is so arrogant he would never believe that students could wear badges made by Draco Malfoy, the son of Lucius Malfoy, a Death Eater, A Death Eater like Headmaster Karkaroff and Professor Snape, and one of the most trusted of Voldemort's. The same Lucius Malfoy who was ultimately responsible for having the Chamber of Secrets opened. Potter, the boy-who-can't-fathom why students would be wearing badges that have ties back to the Dark Lord Voldemort' ! ”

Harry had to hide his smile at how angry Draco had become or the varying looks of confusion on the student body.

“Then again, you could always have badges that say ‘Potter Lies but is still willing to repeat himself under veritaserum'...I think that'd be much more clever, don't you?” he ended contently, sitting back down to dig into his dinner. It took a moment but soon the whole room was a fury of noise as people began to talk over each other from every direction. The students, the staff , the people surrounding him asking or demanding if what he said was true.

Harry tuned all this out and felt good as badges were being chucked away, Draco and the staff table where being looked at intently, especially when Snape and Karkaroff made their leaves. Harry was tired of trying to maintain safety, order and secrets. He decided that destruction, chaos and the truth would keep him entertained for now.
