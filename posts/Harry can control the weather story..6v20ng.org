Looking for any story where harry can, and does control/manipulate the weather. Preferably completed or past third year, and no slash lease.


** That looks like a creative idea, but I've never seen one. If none is uncovered I may even get a shot at writing it once I finish /Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones/.

*** Yeah. I know it's unique, but there are stories which have eluded to it, but never actually fully explored it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4005092/In-Defilade]] Has two stories where Harry can control the weather. The first is a Harry Potter story while the second is a spin off of the first and is a Harry Potter / NCIS cross-over. It fulfils your request but no promises on quality.

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.

  ElementalElemental Harry Response: Earth. Wind. Fire. Water. Four elements that people say grants us the ability to live; well this couldn't be any truer in Harry's case. For him, the elements grant him life in a very different way. Grey Super-Elemental Harry; Harmony; Good-Trio; Good Dumbledore;
