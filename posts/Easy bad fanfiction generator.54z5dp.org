** I....don't know what just happened.

Harry was marrying Voldemort, and needed to introduce him to his parents. His parents were dismissive and insulting, and then Harry was a mermaid.

** I changed the villain to Snape, the MacGuffin to a bottle of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, and made the pairing H/Hr. Max violence and cliches, but no sex or ego.

The result was a goth shopping trip fic where Harry falls in love with Ron.

Wat.

** I don't think I'll top the first one I made with this -- a reader-insert story with Voldemort as the love interest. It is a thing of beauty and horror. Why, how could it not be with characterization like this:

#+begin_quote
  So you wanted to find Hermione Granger. After their adventure, you and Hermione had been spending a lot of time together. You kind of started to like her.

  So you went to the witch and told the whole story. She listened to you without saying a single word.

  Then she said: "WTF, this is sooo big"
#+end_quote

Yep, it nailed Hermione's dialogue. But wait! -- there's more.

#+begin_quote
  You were confused. You didn't think that memory would be in there, and yet it was there, burning like the heart of a newborn star and the centre of the earth. We now turn out headlights to full beam in order to gaze forward through the mists of time.
#+end_quote

Amazing. Do go on. I think I hear Voldemort speaking to our heroine. What does he say?

#+begin_quote
  "Do you remember that thing that happened 10 years ago? The one that seemed like it would split us apart forever, but instead brought us closer then ever? That brought us.......to each-other?"

  "The time with the Horcrux?"

  "Yes!"

  "Oh, yes right"
#+end_quote

I pretty sure now that Ed Wood has come back to us. It's far better (worse) than the above quotes let on. Thanks for the link, OP. This shit is wonderful.

Suddenly he bumped into Snape.

"Whoa I didn't expect to see you here at your house."

*** "Harry Potter and the Bathroom of Secrets"

Life is like a hurricane

Here in Hogwarts

Race-T-Rexs,Machettes,Eagles

It's a Harry-blur!

Might solve a mystery

Or rewrite history!

HarryTales! Woo-oo!

Every day they're out there making

HarryTales! Woo-oo!

Tales of derring-do

Bad and good luck tales!

D-d-d-danger! Lurks behind you!

Voldemort-s out to find you

What to do, just grab on to some...

HarryTales! Woo-oo!

Every day they're out there making

HarryTales! Woo-oo!

Tales of derring-do

Bad and good luck tales! Woo-oo!

Not ponytails or cottontails, no

HarryTales! Woo-oo!

--------------

Harry stopped and gazed into space.

Oh no.

It was happening; He couldn't help thinking about Malfoy again. He tried not too. Desperate to avoid the thoughts that could not be, no, - would not be- held back. But like dozens of unstoppable manticores they came creeping forward till they filled His brain;

Malfoys smile shined like water, as impressive as a saturn, it filled the farmhouse and The chosen one was helplessly but willingly absorbed into them.

Malfoys eyes were like hamsterballs.If you rolled them they would go quite far.

Malfoys legs were like a diplodocus. Straight and tight.

Malfoys chest was like a Manticores. Powerful and impossible to ignore.

How could The gryffindor not be helpless in the face of that?He wanted to hug Malfoy so much, and maybe, just maybe kiss Him one dayon the cheek.

** The Brunet snapped out of it. But the thoughts of Malfoy would be back. Would He be able to resist next time?

Interlude:

** Harry was finding it really hard to concentrate at this movement his thoughts kept trying to think of Malfoy. Despite what was happening, it was hard to focus!

   :END:

--------------

And then, at the worst possible moment. It happened. Again. Harry Potter gazed at Malfoy. It was impossible to resist this time. Like a mini The chosen one was pulled towards Malfoy. It was a like guerilla tactics in a war. It was a like a wand piercing through His heart. It was a like magnets. There was No resisting. No mercy. No longer anything else mattered.

Malfoy looked shocked and then...and then...not shocked. He had known all along. Of course. How could Harry Potter have been so stupid? Those long looks at eachother,the times they gazed at the stars together, the candle lit dinners. The tender hugs.. It wasn't just friendship. It never was. It was more and Malfoy had known all along. "I knew" Malfoy said. "oh" Potter said, realizing all this for the first time. But there was more...Malfoy wasn't pulling away. He was pushing tighter. Holding The chosen one like a wild whale. At some point their clothes came off. They got ripped in the process of the pashioning He didn't care. This is what He had needed for so long. too long. Solar Day. maybe more. But this was now now. The seeker and Malfoy together at last! They canoddled like lovers and just kissed..

They cuddled a lot and then held hands. Afterwards they looked at eachother as if for the first time and had a cigarette. But they knew they must leave. They didn't want anyone to see. Their forbidden love must remain hidden for now. Perhaps forever. The bespacled boy took one last look at Malfoy. "Goodbye my snuggly one" "Love you too, my one and only The Brunet"

And then they departed.

** Hi!

My name is ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia and I work for the NATO organisation. I am not the boss of NATO - thats Steve. However I am pretty important and normally Steve does what I say. Theres also my best friend, Jill, who also works for NATO. But they arnt in this story.

One day we were all called to the meeting room at the top of NATO's biggest tower.

"Hi" I said.

"I have called you all here today because I discovered something important" I continued. "It seems someone is trying to find the secret Horcrux and are going to use it to take over the world. We have to stop them!"

"Thats bad...but is it the NATOs responsibility?" said Bob. He was always saying stuff like that to get out of work.

"Yes. Of course it is. Because someone has to do something about it and we are an organisation that does stuff. Stuff that has to be done" said Steve.

Everyone cheered his speech. He was good at speechs ever since I taught him to be. (I am also the speech writer for the president,btw)

"I have found new information" said I.

"It seems NATOs arch-enemy, Illuminati, is upto their old tricks again. They are the ones after Horcrux!"

"omg" said everyone.

"We will have to send in our best secret agents" said Steve. "Thats you, of course, ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia" (I was also a secret agent,btw, but I told everyone as it makes the story easier)

"I will assemble my team and leave tomorrow!"

When it came to assemble the team tomorrow I knew just who to pick.

"Potter"! I said. (The bespacled boy had started working here recently, as he had a change of heart recently and decided it was their true calling)

"Hay, ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia" said The green eyed boy. "Thanks for picking me!"

"No problem" I replied. Potter was the obvious choice for this job. I then told the team to assemble in the planning room so we could plan the mission.

In the planning room we evaluated the data we had.

"Ok, we know that Illuminati is trying to find the Horcrux. This is probably so they can use it to dominate our friends and family"

"Now I have called our friends at the Friends of the Earth and they have narrowed the location of the Horcrux down to Brussels."

"Cant they do better then that?" said ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia

"No, its only Friends of the Earth""

"-sigh- stupid Friends of the Earth."

"yeah.NATO always has to keep bailing Friends of the Earth out of trouble..

"Well, I guess we are of to Brussels!" said Harry.

So we all leaped onto our NATO Reliant robins and went there!

Once we got to Brussels we decided to split up, with me and Potter finding where the Horcrux was hidden and the rest doing something which doesn't mater for the story.

Me and Harry explored the town, checking out all the nightclubs and skyscrappers in Brussels. Eventually, after I had done enough teamwork, I found where the Horcrux was hidden.

It was inside a new church in the dead center of Brussels.

"Look! Its the Horcrux!"

"But Voldemort is here already! whats going on?"

At that moment Voldemort spotted us and came over.

"Mahaha it was me! I was Illuminati all along!"

"What?" we said in shock..

"While you and your goody-two-shoes NATO were being all 'la-de-da' "we are good guys" la-de-da', I was being Illuminati! And now I have the Horcrux there is nothing you can do to stop me! Even with Harry to help you! your powerless"

Voldemort grinned evily at me.

"oh, noees ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia, what will we do now?! " said The gryffindor.

"Dont worry, we still got time. Activating the Horcrux takes time. If we both Singing together we can take Voldemort/Illuminati out! "

"On the count of 3! 1 2 3 GO!"

With that we both Singing together right into Illuminatis face.

Illuminati stagged backwards. "Nooooo you cant!"

"Again quick! while they are stunned".

So we did it again. "Bam! Pow!"

"Noooo!"

With that Illuminati died.

"We did it! Illuminati is defeated once and for all! Thank you ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia!"

Me and Potter celebrated are victory. But it was only the first of many more to come. As there was more evils in the world then just Illuminati and they will all be coming after the Horcrux now.

So consider this the end of part 1 of ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia and The bespacled boys adventures!

** Well, I did ... something, and the end result is a story from ... someone's point of view (I presume Harry, since, you know, main hero), where ... she (I have no idea what happened since I've left him male) works as a telemarketer and was trying to sell a horcrux faster than Voldemort who works for a rival company. No character other than Voldemort is mentioned, though for some bizarre reason the company Harry works for actually had a name, and in all-capitals at that.

I have no idea what the fjord.

Edit: Also, it got named “Harry Potter and the Educational Stone”. There just aren't enough words.
