I'm looking for fics where, even if James and Lily are total jerks, Harry's brother isn't. Either he shields his brother or pulls him into the spotlight too, just makes sure he isn't alone. Dark!Harry/Dark!Brothers (something I've never seen before) is fine, as is Manipulative!Dumbles, so long as the brother never acts like a jerk to Harry (aside from if they have a brief fight or something). Never actually seen a fic where this happens, so curious as to if they exist.


** So like the sacrifices arc?

****** There are some moments of awesome in it, but it's like a million words long, and some of the conflicts get repetitious. If you didn't like it by the middle of the first book, no need to go on.
