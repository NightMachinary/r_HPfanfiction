** A first year with no proper magical training and with a wand that is not his own, can cast an unforgivable curse on a person who's known to have very high willpower to resist it.

Why would that kid go unnoticed in his family? Ron would be a prodigy.

** and to further expand this prompt, Ron also charmed Harriette into a boy, because Harry is actually a girl, but Ron thinks girls are Lame! Oh and he secretly nicked gold from Harry's vault, went back in time and made sure Dursleys mistreat Harry so Harry would like him. He also planted the prophecy so that Harry would become famous and he would have a celebrity friend! It all makes sense now! Evil Manipulative Ron!

*** Within the right AU its conceivable. And at that point in time harry might not have the ability to resist it. Especially if he never saw it coming

** I would (slightly) believe this if it was some innate accidental compulsion magic (like how tom riddle used his magic to terrorise the kids in the orphanage) but the imperius curse....Come on now
