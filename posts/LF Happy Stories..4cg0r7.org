It doesn't have to be humor or crack.Just genuinely heartwarming stories.


** Have you tried linkffn(Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281) or linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes)?

Halfaslug as a lot of cute little one shots, I like linkffn(twosome tinsel by halfaslug) and linkffn(I'm going to Kill you by halfaslug)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4bvt2f/fanfiction_friday/d1dc2cu][I made a bigger list of m preferences last week]], most of it it's happy. I don't like sad.
