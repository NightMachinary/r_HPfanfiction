** I personally would be interested in this.

Conflict doesn't have to be huge good vs evil high stake situations.

It could be a nice slice of life fluffy piece. Or you could use the story to explore the characterization and relationships between Harry and his family

One thing I like about AU is when the author slowly reveals the world to us. Voldemort is gone and we wonder what the state of the world is like.

You could also use the story to focus on your world building, for instance how politics or magic theory works

Or it could be a nice coming of age story with lower stakes

Anyways don't get discourage and if you do write something I'll be happy to read it!
