Do you know some good horror fics with dark or grey harry


** I remember reading a cthulu mythos crossover. Can't seem to remember the story name though.

The main character was the only one who could remember people that disappeared into the shadows. When they were taken, it was like they never existed.

Dumbledore legitimized one of the things and was driven insane over a short time. Tore his own eyes out.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** Linkffn(2452681) Hellraiser crossover I think. Short, but I've always found the characters disturbing.

Not HP or fanfic: For an actual series, if you haven't read them and like this, you should read Simon Green's Nightside.
