Possibly he mentors Harry. Also a competent voldemort. The idea is : Voldemort kills Harry and becomes a wraith, but since having horcruxes without having a way to come back to physical form straight away is plain stupid he has a decent backup plan.

voldemort/dumble being rational people Voldemort has won / duble trains harry while saving as many people he can with an intelligent OotP


** One of the most persistent traits (arguably --- flaws) of canon Dumbledore is that he is afraid of his own power, so he /refuses/ to be a strong leader. So, the problem with your request, I think, is that if Dumbledore were a strong leader, then there wouldn't be much left for Harry to do. (Not that there's anything wrong with a story where Voldemort arranges for his immediate resurrection, and the war is over (one way or another) long before Harry even begins his magical education.)

For that matter, would mentoring Harry even be a good investment of Dumbledore's time? Given that, even in canon, he has four jobs and can barely hold magical Britain together, doesn't he have anything better to do? For that matter, given the rate at which they learn things (and the amount of time they are willing to put into what extra "homework" Dumbledore assigns, Hermione is probably a better investment --- and she is still probably not good enough.

*** In the context of my request the OotP would have gone underground , and dubles wouldn't be burdened by jobs he couldn't keep.

I've read stories in the same line of thinking but noone really satisfactory (mostly because they were badly written , i didn't even save them).

In this context the story would be a complete AU anyway , and we know that harry isn't stupid he mostly got the will to achieve destroyed by his relatives. In this context he would be groomed to be (one of the) best.

I want to read a fic based on strategy not based on smart people doing stupid things ( silly teen romances red flag).

I know it is an hard request and the niche hasn't been explored a lot but for instance a spinoff of HPMoR (following the phoneix) does a good job on showing a really good political leader Dumbledore.

**** My point is that if Dumbledore were willing to be a Strong Leader, then Harry wouldn't be needed, even with a relatively competent Voldemort. If StrongLeader!Dumbledore failed to prevent Voldemort's rise in the first place, then, certainly, after his first fall, Dumbledore would have made sure that if he ever came back, he would find himself without useful supporters. (If nothing else, he would have acted to impoverish the Malfoys, by any means necessary.)

For that matter, a more competent Voldemort would, after his unfortunate initial encounter with Harry, do his best to avoid stepping on that particular rake again, and work around him, making Harry even less useful in the war. (As Dumbledore points out in OotP, it is by believing in the Prophecy that Voldemort gave it power over himself.)

On a more meta level, Harry's importance is driven by the adults being less-than-competent a lot of the time. If the adults are made more competent, then Harry isn't as important, and that would be a /good/ thing, because if children have to fight in a war to save the world, something has already gone very, very wrong.

It's a matter of opportunity cost. The question is not how many jobs he'd take, but what else he could be doing in the time he would be spending Mentoring Harry.

  and we know that harry isn't stupid
#+end_quote

I never said he was. But, he is not a prodigy who could actually benefit from Dumbledore's personal tutelage and mentoring.

#+end_quote

Citation needed. It's true that he works hard at things he enjoys (e.g., Quiddich, DADA) and avoids things he doesn't (e.g., essays), but that just makes him the same as nearly everyone else his age. For that matter, The Hat saw a thirst to prove himself in his head, though that's telly-not-showy.

What would be the point of that? Unless you invoke some "magical core" BS that's set at birth and measurable, and give Harry the biggest, magickest one, evar, all Dumbledore would be doing would be (probably) ruining Harry's childhood even worse than it already has been, while destroying Lily's Sacrificial Protection by taking him away from his closest blood relatives.

***** Yeah i see , you're right there's aren't many points that can be brought aganist your argumentation.

I was searching a niche focused on politics and strategy (and guerillia wars possibly) , i figured that the key for such scenario for that would be upping the difficulty of the game.

Fanfiction has been amusing and entrataining for me but not much a brain-stimuli (exept in a low degree HPMoR) , the sad thing is that i love how the HPverse is structured but the plot in it is not what i find optimal for me.

ps: i ABHOR magical cores , i find that magic in the canon-verse has to be an on or off switch , otherwise voldemort would be (almost) right because some wizards/witches are just stronger than others , i guess that in canon it all boils down to experience and force of will (applyed in the right way)

****** That said, while I spoke of "magical cores" with disdain, if you /do/ make Harry a genius, so that he is useful to competent "grown-ups" even as an adolescent, that does change the calculus a bit. You're still ruining his childhood, but at least it's for good reason.

I think Taure's /Alexandra Potter/ series works along these lines (since she /is/ a prodigy on the same level), and it has a very political Dumbledore. Even there, he doesn't actually kidnap and raise her, but rather begins mentoring her once she arrives at Hogwarts.
