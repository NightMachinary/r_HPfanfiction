  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Eventual Dark Harry/OC

** The only other semi-decent one I know is this fic with the waitress he flirts with in the little cafe-diner thing before going to see Slughorn.

I could also be droll and say that any fic with Daphne in is technically an OC, since she's literally just a name in canon, but the fic I mentioned is all I know of pairings between Harry and actual good OCs.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC
