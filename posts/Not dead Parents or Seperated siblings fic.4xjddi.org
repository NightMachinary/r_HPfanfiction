Looking for good fics where either Harry's parents abandoned him and are still alive, either with/without siblings who lived with them, or fanfics where Harry has siblings who were raised apart from him and where they meet at Hogwarts for the first time. For the separated siblings, preferably ones where Harry isn't "Oh my you're my twin who was raised with love whilst I was abused? I instantly accept you and aren't in the least jealous!"


** Nearly every /Harry's Sibling is the BWL/GWL/ story would fit your criteria.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is a good one. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]])

*** Ah yeah should have specified I'm wanting Harry to be the known BWL, not a wrong bwl story. But yeah I've read this one before, really good, may re-read.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.
