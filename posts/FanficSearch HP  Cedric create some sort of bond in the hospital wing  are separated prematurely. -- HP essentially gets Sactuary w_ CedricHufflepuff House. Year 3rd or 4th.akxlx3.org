I read on either FFN or Ao3. The story was multichapter and (I think) complete. What I remember of the fic:

The fic had HP in the hospital wing either after 3rd yr dementor-quidditch match or after 4th year graveyard-living Cedric.

Cedric comes to see HP (which makes me lean toward 3rd yr), and after some discussion, Cedric offers a “bond” of pretty much protection almost brotherly (I don't remember if it morphs into slash as they age or not). Dumbledore comes in before HP completes his half of the phrasing and while Dumbledore tries to guilt HP into not completing the “bond” or maybe “vow” that Cedric starts HP wants what CD offers and completes the “vow” anyway. Dumbledore is pissed.

Scene change we discover Cedric is forced from the infirmary by Dumbledore and HP has blacked out. Hermione comes to visit HP later in the evening, and he is practically incoherent. She manages to get the bare minimum from HP and w/ Hermione smarts figures that the separation from Cedric so soon after the “vow” is harming HP. (Later it is revealed as illegal to separate such a “bonding” so soon after “bonding”?)

So she sneaks HP under the invisibility cloak to the Hufflepuff common room where Harry essentially gets sanctuary among the Puffs.

I think the Hufflepuffs have a whole inner structure of support that goes past school, but I might be off?

** I read a surprisingly good fix that had harry and Cedric becoming lovers through the trauma of the tournament. They both knew it wasn't healthy, but were so scared of dying they needed the comfort to make it through. Does anyone know the one I'm talking about? I can't remember the name

*** You'll prob have more luck if you post your own FanficSearch thread. A lot of ppl only read the post title and might not see your own searching-comment.
