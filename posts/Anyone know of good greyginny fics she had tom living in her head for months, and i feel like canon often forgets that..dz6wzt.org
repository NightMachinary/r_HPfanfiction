I would prefer not to have "exaggerated bashing". i have no preferences regarding straight or slash. i do not want massive age gaps unless it is clear that this is evil. thank you!


** Well Ginny does a lot of grey things in linkffn(The Changeling by annerb). That's as close as I can get to grey. Now if you're looking for a fic where Ginny gets much, much more affected by Tom than in canon, there's Black Ink, Red Rose. The author did a self-promotion on it awhile back here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byzws2/looking_for_a_dark_ginny_shameless_selfrec/]]

It's progressed to 163k words now and just updated last week. Warning: this is a super, super dark fic

*** I'd like to second the recommendation for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19381933/chapters/46118053][Black Ink, Red Rose]]. The author has done a great job showing the perspectives of both factions - and Ginny's downward spiral - without bashing the good guys or excusing any of the horrible things done by Voldemort's supporters. In particular, one of the pairings in the fic fits OP's requirement of no "massive age gaps unless it is clear that this is evil." The fic shows just how unhealthy the relationship can be.

***** Eh, I figured OP might enjoy the story anyway since she's grey for roughly the first half. In my opinion she doesn't slip completely over the moral event horizon until chapter 22.

** I'd say that linkffn(Aspirations by megamatt09) has a grey Ginny, although there is quite a bit of bashing.

I'd recommend reading it once as the only readable (inverted is debatable) megamatt09 fic.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] is really good but you've probably been recommended it before.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader/][Book Learning by Zerrer]] is an interesting one, with it being a fic where it's debatable whether Ginny is Tom Riddle, Ginny, or a messed up combination of both.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13323999][Paying It Forward]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/pawn_vs_player/pseuds/pawn_vs_player][pawn_vs_player]]) is a one-shot, second person.
