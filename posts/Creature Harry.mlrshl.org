I want a creature fic that doesn't have any slash and is more about harry being an interesting species and having to deal with side effects and benefits than romance. Romance could be a side plot but I don't want it to be the main thing.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkao3(17912252): Hear the Ocean Call You Home. Yes, it does contain the start of a relationship, but it is explicitly not tied to the creature portion. At all. No fated mate bullshit, a lot of pelt-based angst.

linkao3(3334649): That Boy Is A Monster. Harry adjusts to vampirism.

linkao3(29486223): Harry is a Dementor and That's Okay. Crack fic. Harry is a Dementor, Snape is bigoted.

linkao3(25160617): Sealskin. Pelt-based dysphoria feels.

linkao3(23391646): The BMI of a Young Wizard. The Dursleys is not a good place for a sangivore. Set in Year 1 with a competent Snape.

linkao3(15832620): The Fire that Swallowed the World. Harry died and her body was accidentally possessed by some sort of fire spirit who really doesn't get humans.

linkao3(25833736): Sparks. Orphaned dragon hatchlings will adapt to survive. Harry is very good at his disguise and very bad at avoiding suspicion.

linkao3(18152387): Hold your Breath. Friendship amphibious merrow fic.

linkao3(14495835): Cephalophore. Not actually Harry but a fun post-canon fic about a fae student's first day.

linkao3(2281026): A Flick of the Tail Fin. Cool series about carp dragon animagery. Not technically a creature fic series, but thematically it fits.

linkffn(5786099): Cold Blood. Basilisk venom and phoenix tears are the catalyst for chimerization, which happens in 4th year.

linkffn(5621051): Outcasts' Alley. Harry just wants to take care of this baby someone handed him. Chaos ensues.

linkffn(11607795): Small (Creature) Comforts. Somewhat tropey inheritance one-shot, but no infidelity from Lily.

  Harry is a dementor, and has been for a few years. Now the only question we can reasonably ask in this situation: Are dementors allowed at Hogwarts?“Not traditionally no,” Dumbledore says, “But I'm sure we can figure something out.”

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.

  If newborn dragon hatchlings are abandoned for any particular reason (the mother could've been killed, certain species of dragons bury their eggs in the sand to fend for themselves once they hatch, etc), they will immediately adapt to the environment so that their chances of survival are guaranteed. This can mean burying themselves even further into the sand, becoming invisible, or even shapeshifting.Or alternatively:Harry is a dragon. No one knows. Shenanigans ensue.
