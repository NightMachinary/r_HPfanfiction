Hi!\\
I'm wondering if there are any fics out there in which Harry is the Girl Who Lived that are just a take on how the cannon story changes if Harry was born a girl. (meaning no weird magical sex change accidents) Most fem! Harry stories I have found seem to be a bit too out there for my personal taste.\\
Any recommendations? Thanks in advance :)


** Linkao3(Certain Dark Things) Slytherin Fem!Harry AU. Mostly sticks to canon. Best writing in the genre by far.

Linkao3(the girl who lived by dirgewithoutmusic) High quality fem!Harry one-shot with canon pairings.

Linkffn(Girl in the war by astridfire) A rare Gryffindor Fem!Harry. Sticks to canon.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wait, Scratch That ) Summary fits your request exactly.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

  what if Harry Potter had been born a girl? Would the Dursleys have treated him differently? Would he have the same friends? Would he be in the same house? Now starting 6th year!

** I think there was one where her name was Hope, it was really long and pretty much a rewrite of the whole series, but it remained close to canon with only a few changes

Edit: I found it!

** Probably not what you want, but I really enjoy ongoing “The Three Sisters” by mumuinc linkao3(29799375), that I thought OK to mention it here as well. It is fem!Harry (no gender swap), it is not weird, but it is different from what you wanted.

  Aunt Petunia gasped her pain out against Holly's clammy neck even as she turned, her head lolling, to glare hatefully at Bellatrix. “You will not take her. My sister---““---is dead, little muggle,” said Bellatrix. “As will you if you do not give us Potter.”Holly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her. She'd gotten Uncle Vernon killed. She'd brought the war to their doorstep. She'd---“Over my dead body, you stupid witch!” Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. “You've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!”Bellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. “On your head be it. Avada Kedavra!”

** By “sticks to canon,” how closely related to canon are you looking for? Same upbringing with the Dursleys, same Hogwarts house, same major events, etc.? I love Fem!Harry but I could better recommend something if you clarify what you mean by “too out there”.

*** Yes basically what you said. I went through a couple of highly recommended fem!Harry fics from other threads, but they all involved stuff like time travel, Slytherin!Hary, or Harry/Snape pairings etc. which I personally just don't vibe with. Fem!Harry is of course inherently AU, so I can't be too picky about stuf like that. But please feel free to recommend whatever you think would be interesting!

**** It seems like we've got similar tastes! I've found that there's a lack of good Gryffindor Fem!Harry - a lot of authors put her in Slytherin and I'm really not a fan of anything that puts her in a relationship with Snape, regardless of her age when it happens. I'm outlining out my own Fem!Harry that's more to my taste, but it'll be a while until it's ready for reading.

My favorite is one that already got linked - “Looking Beyond” with Hope Potter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3178778/chapters/6905645]]

She's in Slytherin in this one, but if you're interested in world building with holiday rituals, they're really well done in Mary Potter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/340966]]

The characterization of her in this one isn't to my tastes so I stopped reading fairly quickly, but she's in Gryffindor and it's fairly canon like in this ongoing series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26307580/chapters/64056670]]

I'll keep digging and see if I can remember any other good ones!

***** I'm just generally not a fan of Snape tbh lol. That's funny that you mention that you started outlining your own fic, because I started writing my first fic just this week!

I did start reading Looking Beyond today, am enjoying it so far. I'll check out the other fics you recommend when I finish LB :)
