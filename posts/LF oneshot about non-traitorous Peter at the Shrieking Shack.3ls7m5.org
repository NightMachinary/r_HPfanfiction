It was a crack fic I think, where Sirius and Remus halt their murderous intentions when Peter transforms screaming their failsafe password and it turns out that the Potters had made him a backup plan code delta-epsilon-doohickey-something-something which was hideout-forever-as-a-rat-if-everything-goes-to-shit.

The closest I can find are linkffn(Well, That Plan's Been Shot To Hell by Lucillia) and linkffn(All Too Human Weakness by Rumour of an Alchemist). Can anyone tell me if there is a fic like that out there in the wilderness or if my sad desperate mind combined the two above into an unholy amalgam? Thanks!
