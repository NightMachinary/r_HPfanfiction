The Weasley children, Harry, hermione, or their kids, are nervous about coming out to Molly. They spend a majority of the story dealing with self doubt and loathing among with homophobia from others. The mc finally works up the courage, they're trembling, and she is extremely supportive. She makes sure they feel comfortable and happy. We see a couple scenes of her showing up to pride parades and going out of her way to make them happy.

It'd ideally be a short one shot, probably just writing practice. But hey, you wanna take the idea and do something bigger? Be my guest. I imagine it being really angsty until the end when Molly is being supportive.

Edit: adding a bit of detail and clarification

** A Weasley child coming out to Molly? Oh boy he better quicjly promise her that he will adopt a lot of kid because nothing will ever stand between Molly and her grandchildren, even if they don't exist yet.

** And then....? Where is the conflict? Drama? Plot?

Without any of that, your prompt may as well be the complete story. While I think the evil!Molly trope is way overused, that would at least provide some kind of momentum to drive this plotline forward.

Otherwise, what's the point? "Character A and B were worried that Mrs. Weasley would judge them harshly, but she didn't, and so everyone lived happily ever after as a loving family. The end." ðŸ˜‰

*** You underestimate emotions. I can't tell you how much years of self doubt and loathing made everything so much worse. It'd be a short story, probably a one shot, but you seem to be taking this a bit too seriously. I just want angst with fluff at the end
