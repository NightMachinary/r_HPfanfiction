I don't remember much, but I think Harry ran away at Halloween and he and Sirius were living on an island in the pacific. Hermione visited him over christmas and no one knew that she did. I think it could be possible, that everyone believed Harry had died after his name came out the goblet. One scene that stuck with me: Harry was experimenting with his magic and accidentally shot a lawn chair into orbit.
