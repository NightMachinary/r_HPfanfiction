Are there any good Harry/Susan Bones fics?

She always seems to appear in a Harem or Multi partner stories like "Searching For The Power" ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power]]) but I can't seem to find something with just her in it. I've read James Spookies "The Forgotten Contract" ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7985543/1/The-Forgotten-Contract]]) which is so far the only decent Susan story I've found and I'm looking for more like it.

I'd appreciate any recommendations you can give me. Thanks :)

#+begin_quote
  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

This one is my favorite Harry/Susan

#+begin_quote
  Harry asks Ginny to the Yule Ball. Everyone believes Harry is destined to be with a redhead. There is more than one redhead in Hogwarts, though.

  Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world.

*** I'll second To Fight the Coming Darkness. An excellent fic, one of the few I end up re-reading every once in a while.

*** I've read all of these and I will recommend To Fight the Coming Darkness and Junior Inquisitor, I will say Junior Inquisitor has probably one of the most outlandishly evil/manipulative Dumbledore I've ever read.

I also want to say Not the Only Redhead gets...weird to say the least near the end. It is also very heavy on the bashing from what I remember and not in the way you'd expect.

Pretty sure it's abandoned, but it's the only Harry/Susan I can think off that's on my favourites list on ffn.

By the way somebody suggested Reunion in their list, I don't believe it has much of a pairing, but if it did it would have been a harem with Hermione, Luna, and Susan.

** I'm partial to Heather Sinclair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2775697/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-War-of-Wills][Harry Potter and the War of the Wills]], an old, incomplete story, but one for which I have fond memories.

If my memory is crap and it's a bad story, nobody say so. ;)

** "Searching for the Power" +1 - The author is pretty bad with punctuation and some spelling. He really needed a beta for this story, but man can he write smut and his humor can be off the charts.

I still hate him for what he did to Gabrielle though...

I have re-read this story several times and am constantly amazed at how awesome the author is despite the flaws.

Yes I am mentally masturbating, I'm just always stoked to see one of my stories mentioned on Reddit :P

*** Lol well yeah Searching For The Power is probably the best Harem fic I've read, it's the only one where the girls actually seem like different people. So kudos to you for that. My only complaint with it really is that the end seems really sudden, it takes 30 chapters to get to the end of the summer then the final term takes like 5 chaps... but that might just be me wanting the delightful smut to continue for as long as possible.

**** If you like harem focus like sftp. You might like not go gentle by cloneserpents Or the harem war by radaslab I really like this harem fic its incomplete. It's called love has no age by easysurfing.
