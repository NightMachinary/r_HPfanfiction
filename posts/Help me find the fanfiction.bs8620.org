:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's about Harry getting sick of the war so he decides to run away so he takes off around Europe for a vacation.

Whenever someone is following Harry he just kinda looks in their direction and they all think he has seen him when it's a coincidence.

Whenever deatheaters try to get near him they just die.

But Harry doesn't know this and all the magical governments think it's him killing a bunch of people.

o they're all scared to him and want him out of the country. Harry has no idea any of this is going on and everything is just a coincidence.

(Sorry I'm not good at explaining things)

** Make A Wish. Quite possibly the most entertaining HO fanfic i've ever read. I usually re-read a lot of stories from Rorschach's Blot every few months.

**** If you didn't know there is an "official" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][sequel]] and some other derived fic. Amongst those, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11965672/1/Terminal-Justice-by-Overkill-AKA-Irrational-Intelligence][Terminal Justice]] (DC crossover, mostly the Justice League animated series from the early 2000's) which is unfortunately not complete but close enough from the end that you can read it without getting too frustrated. Sad because apparently the author had said on his original blog that it was missing only one chapter.
