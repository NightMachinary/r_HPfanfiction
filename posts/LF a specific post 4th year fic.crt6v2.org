I can't remember much except near the start Harry goes and joins a scout camp going abroad (I think Scandinavia)....Any ideas of what it is?


** Is this the crack-y one where he goes to an evil villian type training camp or the one where he's missing for the first part of the fic and it turns out he was at a scout camp when he returns?

*** The latter. So he was 'missing' but really at a scout camp.

** This might be totally off but I recently read a fic where Voldemort kidnapped a bunch of kids from Hogwarts and then held them at a camp forcing them to become soldiers for him. The term “camp” is used quite a bit. Might that be the fic you're thinking of? I can try to find it again if you'd like.
