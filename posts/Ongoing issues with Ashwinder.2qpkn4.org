Is anyone else still experiencing issues with the Hermione/Snape archive, Ashwinder.Syncophanthex? I know they were down for several days, but now that they're back up, all stories seem to be blank when I try to open one.


** Oh no :( I just tried a few stories, and they were blank for me as well.

I think last time someone posted about this site (when it was down for a few days), they found a livejournal post on an HP community that it was just for maintenance.

Let me see if I can find that site again, and see if she's posted anything else.

EDIT: Here we go!

*** Yipes, that sucks. Although I'm glad it's not just me. Thanks for digging up those links! I had no idea the webmistress posted on LJ.

** Yeah still having tons of issues. I'm really frustrated because that's like the only pairing/site I read. These past few weeks have been a real test in expanding my horizons haha.

*** Ff.net does have some excellent ones, if you know where to look. Here's an amazing one I've read start to (well, as yet unfinished) at least three times: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/532103/1/FALLING-FURTHER-IN][Falling Further In]] (not my story, just an excellent one more people need to read).
