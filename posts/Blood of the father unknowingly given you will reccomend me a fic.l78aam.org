****** Not a spoiler for you but a spoiler for others The Squib Trial at the start was weirdly tense. Abs death properly killed me. I had to put my phone down and take a second. I completely adored the Pirates. Everything about the Azkaban Prison break was fucking brilliant.

I'm so glad you enjoyed it!!! Its my favorite fic. I cannot believe you read it after a rec written in Shakespeare ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ thanks for giving it a go!

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
