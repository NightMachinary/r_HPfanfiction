What are some of the more creative and unique divergence points in HP fanfiction, or some that you've considered using in your stories? I always tire of stories that diverge between books. That's not to say I don't enjoy them, but it is somewhat of a copout for a way to start a story, and it does get repetitive after awhile. My personal favorite of a seemingly innocuous event being twisted around is linkffn(When Harry Missed the Trick Step), as it gives me some of my main favorite pairings and also allows the humanization of Snape in a unique and earlier way.

  When Harry went to see what Barty Crouch was doing in Snape's office in his 4th year, he managed to just miss the trick step of the staircase on his way to the dungeons -- what's going to happen now? Read on to find out! Compliant till a part of the chapter "The Egg and the Eye" of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. LATEST UPDATE - Chapter 13 up on January 31, 2018.

  Creeped out by all the tombstones, Harry and Cedric leave the graveyard almost as soon as they arrive. As result, much is different. Not sure of pairings.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** A lot of oneshots diverge during the school term because they tell a fairly limited story, often without specifying when exactly things change.

Just to give a few examples from my own pen: Linkffn(13147431; 13110690)

Another thing you can do is diverge off screen and set the first chapter to the point where things start to have effects. For example, in Dawn of Darkness I had Harry and Tonks meet during the summer after the DoM battle and they became friends, but the story begins with Slughorn's Christmas party, where Harry invites Tonks because he needs someone to talk to about the whole Horcrux thing.

Linkffn(12774582)

As for divergences I have considered, pretty much everything works. You can have Tonks named as Harry's guardian in Sirius will and they spend the summer bonding as siblings while tuning Tonks car. You can have Susan decide that she wants to stick it to the Ministry and Seduce Harry after the DA is exposed. You can have Lavender in the TWT instead of Harry. You can have a hurt/comfort Harry/Hermione/Lavender fic set after the war. You can have a marriage law in Britain, but Harry and Hermione watch Britain burn from Australia ir France. Fleur could "rescue" Harry from the Dursleys after the Graveyard. The possibilities are basically endless.
