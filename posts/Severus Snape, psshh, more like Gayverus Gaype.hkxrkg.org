** Holy shit I love this idea- If I ever have the urge to write a fic with Snape as a more prominent character, I might steal this.

Add to it, someone charms his hair to look like all the other flags. It changes every hour. Snape knows exactly who did it and exactly how to reverse it but he does nothing. All the muggleborns and half-bloods start donning similar attire. The purebloods are extremely confused. Those of the purebloods who aren't dicks and also know a muggleborn somehow are brought into the know, and start doing it as well. As a bonus, what would the Golden Trio be wearing in this scenario? I personally headcannon Harry as Bisexual-Panromantic and Hermione as Bi in general.

*** I'm glad someone likes it, at least. I've got no idea what that one person was hinting at, saying it was offensive.

***** I mean, yeah, I guess the whole "Snape was a death eater" thing is a bit problematic, so that should probably be fixed somehow, but I was half asleep when I wrote the post and the fics I'm reading right now don't have him as a death eater, so I'm cutting myself some slack on that.

** How terrified of GLBTQ citizens are you? Because no one can be this offensive without an agenda.
