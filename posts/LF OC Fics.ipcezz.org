It can be slash or no slash, i just wanna see if theres any well written OC fics out there! Anything :)


** linkffn(To Be a Slytherin) : Harry grows up with a loving oc twin sister who sorts into slytherin. Must read if you liked The Changeling or Six Pomogranate Seeds. The OC has some very good characterization. My favorite part of the story is the epilouge-arc which provides better closure then any single fic out there. This is what Canon should have had. Also has Snape paired with another refreshingly appropriate muggle OC. Despite the length you are unlikely to regret reading this one.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC
