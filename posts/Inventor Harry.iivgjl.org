I'm talking about Harry inventing magical items for money or personal gratification or because he's just a genius.

It would be nice if there's magical version of the internet.

NO HAREMS!!!!!

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!
