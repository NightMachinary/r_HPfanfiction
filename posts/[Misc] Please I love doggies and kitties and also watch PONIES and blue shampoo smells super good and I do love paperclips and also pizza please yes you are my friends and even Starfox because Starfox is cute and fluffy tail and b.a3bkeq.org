*** Florea you are my friend and your name is so cute like florea ice cream and also castellum is like final fantasy name and it is very cool and also TE7 talked to yargle blarge about the Packers Football in a misc post once so I think I can talk about other stuff too yes I can and I have not even made a post about other stuff in like five months anyways so it is okay yes it is. Florea do you like MLP show it stands for My Little Pony and it is about ponies and they are magic and they are friend and also cuties?

**** I understand that, and it's ok to go a bit off topic sometimes in threads that are already to do with Harry Potter, but in general people come here just for that. Maybe if you want to talk to people about MLP, you could post in that sub?

***** But FLOREA I want to talk about stuff with my FRIENDS. It is so stupid and boring to talk about Harry Potter all the time 24 7 it is the same pet peeves every week and every day it's atomterns newest depraved idea and it's everybody worshipping that Taure person and Starfox and TE7 and Hellstrike being rude and aggressive to like everyone they ever talk to in a thread and every single post I ever make being negative votes even if its the most on point and profound statement ever possible to make on a topic and then it's people being mean to me and their posts not getting removed for it because I guess the MODS just hate me so much too they ignore it and I'm tired of it all I want to talk about other stuff. We don't have to talk about MLP we can talk about SPONGEBOB i love spongebob too!
