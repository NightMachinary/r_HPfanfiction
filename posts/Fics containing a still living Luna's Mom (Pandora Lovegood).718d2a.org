*Credit to [[/u/AnIndividualist]] who in another thread talked about "Bringing back" Luna's mom to see how it would have changed things. It really got me wondering as I have never come across one beyond a few Marauder era fics where she played a small role or is mentioned casually (and of course Luna is not alive yet in those).

Are there any fanfics that contain an alive and at least semi-prominently featured Pandora Lovegood or Luna's mother (does not have to be the same name)?

And just to clarify, I am not talking about one where she is alive but just casually mentioned or something, but one where she has affected the story in some significant way, is still alive, and is at least somewhat featured.

She is often described as an extraordinary witch who was amazing at experimenting and developing spells, and sometimes talked about as close friends with the Potters, Longbottoms, and/or other prominent families. Such a person sounds like they could be amazing within the context of Fan Fiction. In addition, who knows how Luna Lovegood would be affected as a person if she was still alive (ditto for Xeno and others who she knew). Also, who knows... perhaps Harry might have grown up with the Lovegoods!

Anyway, full on speculation aside, are there any fanfics that feature a still living Luna's mom in some way?


** In time travels [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][Dodging Prison]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545;11574569), she's alive.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), her ghost is very important to the plot.

*** In dodging prison, she hasn't had a huge impact in the plot yet, though.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
