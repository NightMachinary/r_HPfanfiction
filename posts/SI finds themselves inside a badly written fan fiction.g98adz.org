Like the SI dies and suddenly ends up in front of platform 9 3/4 so they enter fully expecting everything to o there way but then there's like harry the goblin friend, Ron bashing for no apparent reason. Greater Good Dumbledore bashing, and harry is lord of multiple houses like all the bad tropes in one!


** There is 'The Red Running Fool', where an SI wakes up in Ron's body just after Harry and Hermione travel back in time to the start of first year in Robst's 'In this World and the Next'.

*** I was starting to enjoy that, and then Chapter 5 happened. It turns into an SI!Gamer fic, fair warning...

**** while this is true... it ends up being somewhat in the background.

When I think of !Gamer fics I imagine quests being showered on the MC, stats being examined once or even twice per chapter and so on.

When compared to that it's not a focus of the fic :P

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.

** As a guy, I don't think that it would be bad. I am not likely to end up in any harem, I am not linked to that story, Harry will win with little effort, so I might as well just stay out of Harry's way and focus on all that sweet magic. Maybe I'll figure out what magical Astronomy is really about.
