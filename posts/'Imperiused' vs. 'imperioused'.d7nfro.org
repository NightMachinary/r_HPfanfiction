As far as I can tell in the books anyone under the imperius curse is referred to as 'imperiused' but I commonly see 'imperioused' used in otherwise spelling-accurate fanfiction. Is there something I'm missing here - was it spelt differently in the American editions or something? Or is it just a very common misspell of the word? It's always bugged me so much for such a minor thing!


** Imperious is a real word, and Imperius isn't, that's why.

*** Sure it is. It's a very powerful word (according to Marvel).

IMPERIUS REX! *POW!*

...thanks, Namor.

*** Sure, but it's the "Imperius" curse, so in this case imperiused would be correct. "Imperioed" could technically work but I don't like the fanfic tendency to have characters just say the incantations of the Unforgiveables in place of the names.

** It was the same in American editions. It's just a commonly misspelled word and autocorrect doesn't help.

*** I figured that - however 'imperioused' is not actually a real word so I guess that wouldn't autocorrect?

**** Autocorrect has gotten scarily competent. In German (my native language) Google's autocorrect has started correcting parts of "made up on the spot" compound words, so I would not be surprised to see it correcting a "non-standard form of a known word root". In this case it would be correcting the "wrong spelling" of imperious, regardless of the tacked on -ed.

Either way, both my mind and my TTS software read that with the vowel from aroused, which is both confusing and annoying (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

** I think I would say "he was put under Imperius".

** Probably an attempt to hypercorrect to British spelling.
