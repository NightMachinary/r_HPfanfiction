Hello! I'm looking for a fic in which the golden trio becomes really renowned, either through sheer power or lethality. They must be not necessarily as strong as each other, but at least stronger than the good majority of the other wizards. One of them don't need to betray, but bonus points if they do. Thanks, and cheers!


** The Sum of their Parts linkffn(The Sum of their Parts)

We are the Golden Trio! linkffn(We are the Golden Trio!) has the three speed run the entire gauntlet of Voldemort stuff as time-travelers, then take out Voldemort in front of all of Hogwarts.

Technically, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) has Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna regarded by all the school as some of the best students and an unbeatable team, confronting everything that challenges them together.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** /Sannin/... that's enough to make me run away from here.. A bunch of egotistical brats who after failing to kill some guy decide to take pride in being the only three to be left alive, to the point of deciding to call themselves /the three/.. By canon standards those three weren't even that strong, just average S-ranks, and that was thanks to their summons so... I have utter disgust for anyone that tries to make them more than they were, and people that tries to make that stupid /Three/ tag and use it as a badge of honor or worse, a rank.

Fuck, at least the golden trio is mostly fanon..

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

*** Interesting. How do u find the fic in general?

How are the relationships between the Golden Trio? Still friendly as in canon?

How is Ron potrayed? Is he an equal part of the trio? Or is he sidelined?

**** Well, Ron Hermione and Neville betray Harry, throw him in Azkaban for (i think, 4 years) after Harry removed every limb from Ginny, after she killed his pregnant wife. All 4 become extremely notorious. Neville and Hermione are called Oberon and Titania, Harry is the Dark Lord Potter and Ron is the leader of Titania's army.

So I guess, no, they aren't friendly.
