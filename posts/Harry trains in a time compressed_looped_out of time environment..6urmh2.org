Basically i'm currently interested in any stories that have harry training using a time turner over, and over again, or using the room of requirement, and it has a function that displaces harry from time, or anything else. The only requirements I have is he gets a lot of training through this strategy, it is either completed or more than 50k+ words, and no slash in anyway, I don't have a problem with that stuff, but harry is not potrayed as gay. I hope to hear suggestions from you soon.

*** Oh yeah. I've actually got this opened up on one of my many tabs here somewhere. Could you tell me a bit more about it. It's just a 240k+ story is something that I could really use a bit more information on than the one line as the summary.

***** He sounds op in this. Is he op. Please i've had my fair share of op harry stories lately. If he can challenge voldemort great, if he can swat voldemort like a fly i'll still try it, but it would have to have a really good story.

******* I wouldn't call it OP. He attends lessons multiple times because of his death and gets better at magic. And also wants personal tutoring in some subjects to not die. But he doesn't become godlike!Harry. Also he uses cutting charm too much hand gets very good at it.

** This makes me think of a Stars Wars crossover fic where Harry goes through a mirror in the Dept of Mysteries and gets trained via torture by a Jedi (must have been a Sith?), and comes back kind of a sociopath who forgets who he was and attacks Tonks. Hermione has to remind him who he is , and ultimately it's a Harry / Hermione romance .

**** That sounds like him to a t. I accidentally read some of one of his stories the other day and was really confused as to why harry abandoned his friends in favor of Ginny and a sociopathic Luna. He really does like his sociopathic characters, doesn't he?

** linkffn(H J Potter by S.M wane) is a good one but if you hate soul-bond and/or Harmony then you'll hate it. Doesn't go really into detail but they do visit quite a few times in the beginning chapters:
