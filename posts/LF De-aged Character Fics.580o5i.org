A bit ago, I read "Playmate" linkffn(10027124). I was really fascinated by the regression Harry went through. Unfortunately, the story didn't focus on what being a kid for a second time and having to grow up again would be like as much as I wanted.

Does anyone know of any good stories where any HP character is turned into a kid and has to be a kid for a while/grow up again and what the experience is like for them?

Thanks!
