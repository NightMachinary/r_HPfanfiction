I was having a silly conversation with a Redditor about fan fiction, but HP isn't their fanon. I mentioned how I thought it would be funny if Lord V stole the Elder Wand from Dumbledore, but didn't notice the wand had been replaced by a set of painted Muggle anal beads until he goes to kill someone with it. Complete crack fic, of course, but the Redditor asked me to PM him/her if I find one. Help?
