** As far as I know all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] Fics have the first part in the worldbuilding, with the wizarding side of the Americas being a lawless place constantly at war with itself, the idea being most magical countries are offshoots of whatever muggle country was there when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect. The Americas didn't have a european style government when the SoS went into effect so is constantly being fought for by various enclaves of wizards.

 

The second part is hard, because to have a world where inventions are different the author has to basically invent them in their mind and most authors don't have the ability to do that. The best I can do is Starfox5's depiction of wizarding fashion in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]). I thought that it /felt/ like how fashion would be if you didn't have to worry about pesky things like: "structural integrity", "keeping warm", or those /"laws of physics"/.

**** In that case, you may want to read the fully canon compliant postwar fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126). Set in 2009, flying invisible cars with portkey capability are common in Magical Britain. Harry's Auror office has several such Land Rovers, and Hermione has one such Austin Mini.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), they did some truly amazing things, such as building a spaceship, making an interstellar voyage, colonizing two alien planets, and solving the population bottleneck. Unfortunately, this fic has some serious problems, and another author is trying to improve the underlying concept in a new fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929).

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter by Taure]] has some of the best arts and music innovations I've read in fanfiction. There's a scene where Victoria attends a play of Lockhart's Break with a Banshee that's pretty amazing and really highlights the differences between Muggle and Magical entertainment. Usually fanfiction regards movies as an amazing example of the superiority of Muggle entertainment so it's nice to see the reverse. linkffn(12713828)

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
