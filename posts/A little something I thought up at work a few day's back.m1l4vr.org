The second war has been won but not without grave costs a broken community now struggles to pick the pieces in the aftermath of the conflict. Haunted by the bloodshed and atrocities of the war Magical Britain finds itself on the path to a uncertain future. Will the wizarding world be able to pick up the pieces and attempt to move on in a post Voldemort world or will the Dark Lord have the last laugh even in death


** You might like my story "Divided and Entwined", which features that scenario in its second part - how to rebuild the country after a much more brutal war.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
