** In spite of obstinate men and its sadly still unfinished sequel in spite of appearances by quartermass are really good harry/fleur romance. He takes a more realistic approach rather than love at first sight/veela bondmate/soulbond

**** If you want a veela bond fic try the price of being noble. Its unfinished as well and my only grip with it is they used the bond as a way to force a harmony pairing along with harry/fleur/gabrielle. I actually like veela bond stuff just to many use it as an excuse for smit which I dont mind but it does get old

** Super slow burn here, linkffn(9774121) but I really enjoyed everything about it. The only real blemish is that it hasn't been updated in 2 1/2 years.

Edit: I really do need to read the entire request. I do stand by my recommendation though.
