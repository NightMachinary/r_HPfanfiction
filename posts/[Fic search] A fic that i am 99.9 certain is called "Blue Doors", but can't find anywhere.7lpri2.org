It's a Drarry fic, a few years old by now, Harry is in St. Mungo's for a checkup and Draco comes crashing through some doors being restrained by Healers. Harry gets irked, eventually takes Draco away from there, etc etc. I can remember the entire thing but for love nor money I can find it nowhere.


** You should try asking in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]], where they're more likely to know.
