Hi, everyone!

I'm looking for Dramione fanfiction, but have very specific criteria :)

It should be:

• post Hogwarts only

• general category without or with minor romantic subplot

• very slow burn or already together

• G-R rating

• strong plot, no pairing just for pairing

• Ron/ Hermione breakup before Dramione

My hates, which shouldn't be included:

• cheating

• Ron, Harry, Ginny or Astoria bashing

• Ron&Hermione's big argument and Ginny supporting Hermione bit not Ron

• veela theme

• all school love affairs

• big OOC

• their love out of blue

I believe someone know similar fanfiction. Maybe some detective, action or mystic, maybe some afterlife or remix :)

I like this OTP but don't like tonnes of cliché!


** Just a heads up: the general users on this subreddit loathe Dramione so they'll more than likely downvote your request into oblivion. I'd recommend asking on the Dramione subreddit instead.

Now for recommendations, I personally love Lena Phoria's The Deadline and HeartofAspen's This, Too, Is Sacred.

*** Oh, I know about these very biased ones of fandom! I know they wouldn't be together in canon, in school, but it's fanfiction!

Thanks for recommendations!

** Along with the dramione sub, I'd suggest askdramione on tumblr, which is good at coming up with specific refs, or at least pointing you toward a list of fics that will meet some of your (extensive) criteria.
