  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** The entire series is fantastic - I can't link just one, haha: [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]]

#+begin_quote
  boy with a scar: What if Neville was the Chosen One, and James and Lily survived? & What if Neville was the Chosen One, and James and Lily were tortured by the Lestranges?

  the kids who chose themselves: What if Neville and Harry were both killed as infants, and there was no Chosen One?

  no place like home: What if Petunia refused to take him in, and so Harry was raised in Hogwarts?

  the family evans: What if Petunia had raised Harry like a son?

  the heir or something or other: What if Harry was Sorted Slytherin?

  he will have power the dark lord knows not: What if Harry was a squib?
