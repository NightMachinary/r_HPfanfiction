Hello everyone, I recently went through some crossover fics and I remembered this one story where harry is a spark, it's quite a long story but close to the end harry is a transformer animagus? (Animamagus?) He can turn into a transformer and he has the ability to merge forms to create a bigger form, and he also changes a giant plane into a transformer. I dont remember much about the beginning. Anyone please help! Thanks
