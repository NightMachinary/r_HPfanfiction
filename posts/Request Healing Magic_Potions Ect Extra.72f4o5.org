Looking for stories that deal more with healing magic/potions ect extra, doesn't have to be the main point in the plot, but would like to see it used more.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Do NOT like Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione, any other pairing is fine.


** I also request this, but instead of making a new thread to ask for H/H and allow H/D I'll just say this in the comments?

** linkffn(Chasing the Sun) has Hermione as an apprentice in healing. I'm not very far along, so I expect the healing magic to get more complicated as the story progresses

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.
