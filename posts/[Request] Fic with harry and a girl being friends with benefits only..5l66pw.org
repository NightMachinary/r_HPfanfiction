** I would be interested in a non smut take on this. It's a complicated subject and teenagers can get very emotionally attached via sex. What starts out fwb doesn't always stay that way and it would be interesting to see how authors think Harry would respond to the situation.

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass
