  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. NOT ABANDONED

** I really liked this fic linkffn(3464303) from The Santi. And while not as good or famous as his second major fic, I think it stands on it own. It has some unexplained age changes, making Harry and Tonks peers while in Hogwarts, but just take that in strides. It also has a bit of Super!Harry but it isn't that bad.

Sadly it's very doubtful that the second part will ever be made, but at least the first part has an ending'ish.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
