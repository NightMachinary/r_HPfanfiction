What would happen, if Umbridge forced Muggleborns to also use the Blood Quill during detention? I want Harry or someone else, to stumble upon this; and Harry and the others tell Dumbledore of the news and they arrest Umbridge.

I don't want Manipulative Dumbledore, that's been done to death.

I also don't want Weasley bashing.

I don't want Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

But other than that, go nuts with the idea.


** I don't quite understand - what is it about Muggleborns that results in different consequences to when she uses it on pure-bloods like the Weasleys?

**** OOtP Chapter 25:

#+begin_quote
  This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class.

  “Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That's not information relating to your subject!”

  When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of Murtlap.

Umbridge was using it on other students, and Harry knew about it. In any event, if this practice was "revealed" to the world at large, I doubt much would come of it. It was Dumbledore, not the Ministry, who banned corporal punishment at Hogwarts.
