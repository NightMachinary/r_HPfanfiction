We all know certain fanfics, either by the author, the actual story, or by people recommending them constantly, even if we, ourselves haven't read it.

But, what is a story, or stories that you consider to be good, that just doesn't get the recognization you feel it should?

*To make it fair, it can be about anything, and have any pairing, and doesn't even have to be Harry centered. As long as it's a story (or stories) you consider to be good, that doesn't get recommended or talked about much.*

It can be on fanfiction.net, or another site entirely as well.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] by stoplightdelight is a personal favourite that I've never seen recommended on here. It's a maurauder fic from Remus's POV with, IMO, very good writing and excellent dialogue. It is, however, /very/ long (700k+ words), and /very/ slow paced (barely into third year), and the author generally takes huge breaks between bursts of updates (and last update was, like, 2018). No parings as of yet, and the author apparently doesn't intend for it to turn into a wolfstar fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/][blood crest]] by Cauchy has an interesting premise and quality writing, and it just updated today. I don't think I've seen it recommended on here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7549384/chapters/17168488][Sunshine in my Eyes]] by monroeslittle is a Jily fic where lily and petunia are raised by Mcgonnegal. One of the best writers in the fandom IMO, but they don't seem to pop up much on the rec threads. Others by her that I'd recommend are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9506432/1/][Just stay here tonight]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8809533/1/And-the-Wolves-All-Cry][the wolves all cry]] (both Jily).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/][Puzzle]] is a good one that completed recently. Incredibly depressing though. I don't think I've seen it on here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4913998/chapters/11273302][Quiet Like a Fight]] is one of the better Slytherin!Harry fics. Good writing, and no weird eleven year old politicians. Harry's not totally OOC either which is nice.

if I find anything else I'll put it up here.

Edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4134471/8/The-Moon-Is-a-Harsh-Mistress][the Moon is a harsh mistress]] has what is low key one of my favourite premises: Draco getting bit by a werewolf. Not only does it bring back memories of post book six theory crafting, but it has a shit ton of potential for drama and character interaction. Sadly, the author seems to have more or less abandoned it.

*** “Puzzle” has been recommended couple of times, but surely it is not enough, because it is one of the best fanfics ever written. I wouldn't say it is depressing, more like it is not a comedy like 99% stories here, but something like the Ancient Greek tragedy.

***** The classical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_tragedy][Greek tragedies]] (e.g., Oedipus Rex by Sophocles) were certainly not funny, but their viewing was meant to be something close to the religious experience, which should [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_tragedy#Mimesis_and_catharsis][“purification of the passions”]]. I don't think proper tragedy should lead to depression, but something similar to what proper participation in the liturgy gives (especially the Roman-Catholic one, which is related in its nature).

I read this guy a few weeks ago and remember being confused at first (because the Snape/Harry mentorship thing isn't something I normally go for) but then being really impressed with the way the author essentially employs Snape as a pseudo-therapist with Harry.

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history loom large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker---and more boring---than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web.
