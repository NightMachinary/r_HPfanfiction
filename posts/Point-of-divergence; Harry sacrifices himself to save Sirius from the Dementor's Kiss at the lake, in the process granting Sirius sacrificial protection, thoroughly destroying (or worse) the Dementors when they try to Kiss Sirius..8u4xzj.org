** Wouldn't the dementors still suck out his soul regardless? Because the dementors kiss doesn't kill you biologically, but simply destroy your soul

*** In book 7, Harry sacrificing himself (or at least attempting to) protects the students of Hogwarts against Voldemort's magic; his spells fail repeatedly against them, from silencing them all to immobilising Neville. So it's not just limited to killing curses.

Besides, this specific scenario would be Harry sacrificing himself to defend against Dementors, not the Killing Curse, so why wouldn't it work?

**** Yes but my point is that the dementors don't kill nor are they intending to kill. The dementors kiss isn't lethal or intended to do so, so I don't believe sacrificial protection could be at play here.

Harry in this case wouldn't die (im not sure why he would anyways) and the dementors would kiss him, shove his shell of a body aside, then kiss Sirius

** I don't think Harry would have a problem with a single Dementor's kiss. After all, he had his soul and a piece of Voldemorts' in his head, so it would be like his death in Book 7.

Sirius would probably still get that protection, though.

*** He could be the only person to make out with a Dementor and live to tell the tale. Talk about ultimate bragging rights.
