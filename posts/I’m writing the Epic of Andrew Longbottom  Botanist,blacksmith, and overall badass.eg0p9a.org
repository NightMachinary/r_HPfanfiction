The scion of the Longbottoms of Ludlow, son-in-law to the Man who Triumphed. Son of the Slayer of Serpents, The man who walked into Gringotts with a Broadsword and a bag of silver and came out with the Gong of Peace and a treaty ending the Goblin Uprising before a single life was lost. He is the husband of the legendary Cursebreaker Lily Potter. The man , the myth , the Director of London's botanical gardens, the legend Andrew Longbottom , his father's son , a Squibb but still the Longbottom of Ludlow.

Background for the concept is in the previous post : [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ed5c5k/nevilles_son_his_pride_and_joy_was_a_squibb/]]

I am trying to write this fic correctly and do the concept justice. If anyone would mind reading both post and giving me feed back it would be greatly Appreciated. I am nearly done with the first few chapters for the story but at I Kind of went down the rabbit hole of Lord Potter Tropes but this time with Lord Longbottom.


** I like the concept, is this going to be a series or a multichapter Fanfiction?
