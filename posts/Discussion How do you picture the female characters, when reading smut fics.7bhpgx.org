So, I was reading a smut fic involving Susan Bones (sue me), when I realized that Susan is ALWAYS described as incredibly well-endowed. Where did this fanon originate? Following this train of thought, because everyone has their own preferences, other people are going to picture the female characters differently.

Some of these differences are minor, while others are huge. E.g. Hermione is perhaps a character whose appearance are sometimes a vast contrast. How do you picture the female characters in your head, and if you could cast an actress, who would you choose? What can you NOT stand?


** Ahem. You got a link to that Susan smut fic?

** I made a subreddit for posting pictures of how you picture the characters. I happen to mostly post pictures of the characters who I consider attractive. Everyone is welcome to submit pictures but /please/ follow the posting format.

[[/r/HP_Casting]]

But to summarise:

*Harry Potter*: Tall (approx 180cm) and slim. Messy dark hair, green eyes. Glasses. Very handsome but in an athletic, boyish sense rather than a buff, manly sense. Casual dress. Confident but not arrogant pose/body language.

*Female Harry*: The female equivalent of the above: dark hair with a bit of frizz to it, glasses, green eyes. Very pretty. Skinny but not stick thin. Casual dress and pose but still feminine.

*Hermione Granger:* I actually have two different mental images of Hermione that I flip between. One is a petite girl with little in the way of curves. The other, perhaps inspired by the idea that she doesn't get too much exercise as a library-dweller, is a slightly curvier version with relatively large breasts (compared to Emma Watson) and a curve to her stomach. Either way I picture her as having a relatively pretty face and big, frizzy brown hair.

*Ginny Weasley:* Petite frame, freckles, hair more ginger than red, very pretty face.

*Fleur Delacour:* Neither too skinny nor too voluptuous. She's described as willowy, so she should be petite in frame, but given how attractive everyone finds her (and in a sexual manner at that) I feel like she needs to have at least some curves to her. Further, she should not be a "golden blonde" like the typical American beach blonde Baywatch style look. There should be a pale, silvery aspect to her. I enjoy depictions of Fleur in which she is casually dressed as it's an interesting contrast to the fandom idea of her as constantly dressed to the nines.

*Pansy Parkinson:* For some reason I have always associated Pansy with having curvy hips. I think it might be an association created via the idea of her wearing a pencil skirt from the office scenes in the fanfic /Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)/. Her other distinctive feature being her "pug" nose, which I read as meaning upturned and with a bit of width to it. Despite that nose, however, I still tend to think of her as quite pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way. Not "model pretty" but eye catching. Black haired.

*Susan Bones:* Below average height, hair mid-way in the ginger-red spectrum, large breasts, curvier frame (that's not a euphemism for "fat"), either no freckles or light freckles.

*Daphne Greengrass:* Mousy blonde, very pretty, petite. Classy.

*Lily Potter:* Average height, hourglass figure, hair closer to red than ginger, no freckles, pretty face.

*Parvati Patil:* Indian ethnicity, toned body and stomach, long black hair, medium sized breasts and relatively narrow hips.

*Lavender Brown:* Brunette, girl-next-door type, medium-to-large breasts.

*Cho Chang:* British-Chinese rather than pure Chinese ethnicity. Slim, small chest, pretty.

** I think the fanon for Susan Bones has to do with the movie casting a round-cheeked child.

If I'm reading smut, I may as well cast myself. I can't stand imagining the actual actors in those scenes. I usually just skim the smut the first time I read for possible important story bits, then read the scenes separately later, just so I can picture the actors while the plot is happening in my head.

** Initially my thought in reply was 'however they're being described by the author', as smut fics tend to be more specific about this sort of thing. Then it occurred to me that many smut writers are vague on the details that don't matter to them, which results in many girls being effectively faceless.

A few idle notes:

- For whatever reason (probably made worse due to fanon reinforcement), whenever Susan Bones in mentioned she comes with a footnote connected to Michael Palin in Monty Python and the Holy Grail saying 'she's got huuuuuuuuge... tracts of land!'

- Hermione wasn't black in my mind, but when the idea was suggested I rather liked it, except that the association of her being black /and/ involved in stumping for equal representation and ending slavery made it seem too obvious, edging toward racial profiling errors seen in Star Wars: Phantom Menace.\\
  She's most often portrayed as Emma Watson or a curvier version thereof, that no doubt was hiding her awesome rack beneath the shapeless robes of the school uniform. When she isn't being lovingly described in smut fic, I try to adjust my mental image of her to be like Anna Poppelwell (Susan Pevensie in the Narnia films) - chipmunk like with too-thick wavy curls that can be polished up into a jaw-dropper, but is generally too serious-minded to want to be attractive to boys.

- I like the movie twins, yet I'm confounded by the book description of them being of the stout like Charlie variety of Weasley. Ron should have been the tall one, and his representation in fanfic suffers from being 'Rupert Grint-ized'. If they'd used someone more like Sean Biggerstaff (who played Oliver Wood), I could see much nicer outcomes. The Harry/Ron shippers alone would quadruple.

Aside from those, I have some quick casting alternatives that I prefer:

Ewan MacGregor as Bill Weasley; Keira Knightley as Fleur Delacour; Karen Gillan as Ginny Weasley; Tim Roth or the guy playing Igor Karkaroff as Severus Snape; Emma Thompson as Minerva McGonagall, though her performance would probably be a version of Maggie Smith anyway; and Stephen Fry as Albus Dumbledore

** One of my bigger hang ups is that my mental image of Hermione is a black girl with crazy hair. It's not a common description of her at all and whenever any part of her is described by an author I have stop and go "oh yeah, she's white in this."

It's not an important thing at all but I've tripped over it more than once.

**** I've never actually seen cursed child. I did see the arguments about the casting, though, and that was when my image of her changed.

Her being black made more sense to me after I thought about it. I've seen smart know it all type people have friends growing up and the description of her didn't make much sense to me. Black Hermione, though, made sense. A black girl in a predominantly white environment in the late 80s would be made fun of and have few real friends. It also made her sudden outrage about house elf slavery so much more in character. On the whole I just love the image and it clears up some of the problems I had with her.

***** I'm not quite sure you understand race relations in 80s Britain. While there were race riots and racially motivated attacks which still continue into today, the Grangers were in a position of affluence as dentists. They would have been unlikely to experience much discrimination. It is also highly unlikely that Hermione would feel a connection to house-elves based upon a personal connection to black slavery, as slavery had been abolished in 1803.

In addition, Hermione's personality as a know-it-all very likely could isolate her. Depending on the size of her school, other children who could tolerate and be her friend would be rare. Moreover, participation in physical activities and childish games would be unlikely for Hermione, a bookish, unathletic girl.

All of these factors show that it isn't likely that Hermione being black would have any influence over how she acts. And in the Wizarding World, where the Shacklebolts are part of the Sacred 28, being black definitely wasn't an issue.

Edit: fixed spelling.

If you really wanted to double up the racial discrimination angle by adding a Muggle racial characteristic to the fact that she's Muggleborn, the better avenue in the cultural context would be to make her Pakistani.

****** As I said to the other guy, this wasn't meant to be a big thing. My wife is black and she has strong opinions on those things that have rubbed off on me and how I view things. We're both from the US so you're right, I know nothing about their race issues in the 80s and 90s.

******* IDK who downvoted you but I put it back up. I wasn't trying to make this a race argument. My wife is black and grew up around the same time period. Granted she's American and that makes a huge difference but she has strong opinions on these things and they influence my views. I wasn't makeing that into a 'hey everyone should see her this way' I was just say why I do.
