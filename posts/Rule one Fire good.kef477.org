:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've spent all day trying to track down a fanfiction on very limited knoweldge. Does this ring any bells for anyone?

I'm pretty sure it's either time or dimension travel, with the end result being a mature harry being quite good friends with Dumbledore (pretty sure on this due to the second, and main thing I remember)

Harry enlists Dumbledore into pranking the school, and they each make house handouts. Some were bookmarks. The gryffindor one had a list of rules, written for cavemen, including the above "fire good". The hufflepuff one was about how they secretly ran the school, and the slytherin one was on how to deal with the depression that comes with being in slytherin.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance
