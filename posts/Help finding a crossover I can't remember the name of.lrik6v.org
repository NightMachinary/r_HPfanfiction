:END:
First off thanks for clicking on this to help me out.

I can only remember one scene. In this scene the Harry Potter character is giving a TV interview on magic. they talk a bit about their personal history and then are asked to cast some magic. They end up casting the patronus charm and everyone enjoys it. I'm pretty sure this is a marvel cinematic universe crossover fic and the avengers are there.

thanks again for the help it's much appreciated.
