I read a dark lord rises and i really liked it. Basically I want a dark, ruthless powerful harry.


** NO

...

I kid, I kid. Not a single writer understands the +Sark+ Dark Arts or the mind of a dark wizard like [[/u/ScottPress][u/ScottPress]]. Thankfully, he wrote linkffn(Lesser Evils). Rough start, but very good.

Edit due to large thumbs, tiny phone keyboard.

*** The Sark Arts are the greatest asset of an Internet asshole. A less elegant weapon for a more troll age.

For realz tho, I've been feeling guilty af for not updating for so long. Next update is 70% done and hopefully to be posted this week.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
