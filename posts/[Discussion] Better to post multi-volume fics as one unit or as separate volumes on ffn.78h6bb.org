** As a reader, I prefer a single volume. No final chapters that are just ads for the next story, no having to go to the author's page to find the rest of the story, knowing whether the entire story is completed at a glance...

** Depends how long you're gonna make it. What I'm writing will likely reach over a million words, so I'll be splitting it up.

But that's just me. I've read series that go over a million words, but to be honest, if I saw the word count of the story as a million instead of like 250k words, I'd probably have skipped it. Something about it being split up makes it easier for me to want to dive in, you know?

Like if you gave me one book that consisted of the entirety of A Song of Ice and Fire, I'd probably not bother.

You might lose a few readers, I suppose, if you split it up, but anyone who's actually interested in the story won't have a problem going to your profile and finding the sequel.

If you split it up, make it clear in the summaries which part is which.

*** Yeah, the thing I was worried about was that too long a fic might discourage potential readers -- I'm almost done with part one of seven, and it's looking like it will be the shortest section and clock in between 60k and 65k words. The second volume is outlined and looks like it'll be closer to 80+ k words ...

**** So, around 500k in total when it's done? Wouldn't be too bad as just one, but two 250k ones likely wouldn't hurt either.

***** Possibly? I know each one is going to be progressively longer, and seven is going to be massive. Each volume corresponds to a Hogwarts year, so I might group one and two, three and four, five and six, then have seven alone.

*** I am personally more interested the longer the fic is because then if I love it I know that there is a lot more for me to go through

** I've always been a fan of telling the story in one “story”. If “book 2” starts a few days or weeks after the end of “book 1” and simply continues an existing story line with a small time skip, it should just be appended to the original. There's no real need to arbitrarily split a story over “books” unless you're dead-set on mimicking the feel of the canon heptology.

That said, if your book 1 concludes the story and you want to continue a new story with the same characters, then by all means start a new “book”.

** One volume. People won't necessarily check your author page to look for other volumes, and most people will subscribe to the fanfic, but not to you as an author. There's no way to link works together like there are on websites like Ao3, so one volume is the way to go!

** Really, if you're looking for exposure, it's better to release a chapter every 2 days or so, or maybe a bit faster than that. If you're looking to just post a story, if it essentially amounts to one continuous, developing plot, then a single unit is best. If it's many distinct plots, as in actual "books", it's better to separate them out into their separate books.

Edit: thought you were asking about how often to post chapters of a completed fix, my bad.

** Personally I like splitting the Volumes/Books up. One it reduces the fear of seeing 98 chapters and 2.1 million words and trying to find my place if I lost it a while back.

Splitting volumes also makes rereading entire stories easier as I personally can slam through about 80k words a night cutting through a volume in 2 days and be content knowing I got 2/3 chapters left rather than 40.

Plus new stories allow for changes in narrative feel and tone. Year one is light and easy, Year two being mildly darker but still joyous, year three significantly darker than the previous two, year three being a mirror of year 2 as things get easier and we have more adventures but we also have the Goblet plot hanging over. Even with OC stories it's better to split them after a while as thing become far more serious or lighter.

** Personally, I try to find large stories to read. Fanfiction is a hobby that I pursue when I'm taking a break from work or, as most of you are probably familiar with, going to the bathroom. So "How long can I expect to read this story before I have to bother finding another good one to read" is a huge factor for me. It's /probably/ a factor for other people, too, so a large word count could draw people.

Alternatively, if you're writing a very long story, take the time to polish your earlier chapters as you write and, consequently, get better at it. If I'm reading a 250k word story, I use those first couple chapters that I read to kind of gauge what to expect for the rest of it. No one wants to read 250k words of bad grammar or "ramble writing". If your writing gets /really good/ later, I might miss that entirely because I skipped out early. No matter how good the premise is, a person can only take so much.

It's not really a hassle for me to find the sequel on the Author's page. If I'm sinking, say, 20 hours into reading a story that's 250k words long, a 5 second detour and two clicks isn't likely to matter much.

If you /do/ split it up, though, I'd recommend writing both the last chapter of a prequel and the first chapter of the sequel at the same time. No one likes getting emails for advertisements or clicking "Next Chapter" only to find out that there isn't any more to actually read. If you write them at the same time, you can just add the note at the end of that last chapter that a sequel is available.

Again, this is just my opinion on a number of factors. I'm sure that are people who could disagree with every single point I've made, but until I'm proven wrong, I'll assume that my opinion is the average.

** Personally the longer the better! I'm a binge reader and have been known to read the first 2 books in the outlander series in a weekend (no clue how many words, just know they're big)

I love that on archive of our own there is the linked stories facility, but I will always check that all of the stories are complete before starting, as I once got really into a series that the last book wasn't yet completed and it completely bummed me out. But as ffn doesn't have that functionality, one big volume works best for me.

Though once I've read a fic that I really enjoy, I will always go and check out the author page for more stories and binge my way through them all.

** It really depends, when it´s written by an author that, has a good track record for finishing their fics and updates regularly, I don´t mind if the stories are split up, because I´m sure the story will be finished someday, but it really annoys me when I stumble on a complete fic, only to find out that the sequel hasn´t been updated for two years, if it´s all in one volume I at least know if I get a full story or not.
