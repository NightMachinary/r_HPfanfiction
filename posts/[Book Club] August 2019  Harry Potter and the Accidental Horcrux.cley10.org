  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I liked this fic for the (mostly) well written interaction between Harry and the scarcrux. There are some great moments where Harry has to deal with the consequences of his choices. However, since first reading this fic I've read others that handed that plot seed better. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this one.

The main issue I have with this fic is the author's choice to follow the stations of canon so closely. This was particularly ridiculous in 4th year when Harry managed to entirely avert Voldemort's Triwizard plans early on. It looked like the author might finally take the plot in a new and interesting direction after that, but then at the final hour the author just stuck in a deus ex machina of Harry getting randomly kidnapped by a Death Eater, so the resurrection happened in nearly the exact same way as canon regardless. It felt like the author was blatantly phoning it in because they wouldn't make the effort to come up with an original plotline even when it makes the most sense to diverge.

The fic does have its strengths, namely the well crafted interaction between characters. I loved the twisted mentor-mentee relationship between Harry and the horcrux. Their talks with Dumbledore were some of the best moments in the fic. The relationship between Harry and his friends was also well-written (though painfully tropey sometimes).

Unfortunately, in more recent chapters the author almost completely axed the interaction between Harry and the scarcrux. There's a plot reason, but it's so contrived that I'm left with the impression the author just got tired of inventing the scarcrux's dialogue and tried to write the character out of the story. It's a very dissapointing and baffling choice to me because the scarcrux has been a central character from the beginning, and it's the only aspect of the plot that I really enjoyed.

Do you have any examples of ones that did the scarcrux plot better? I really like the interactions between them in this fic and would love to read more fics with this plot line.

I fully agree with your review. The dialogue and the twisted mentor relationship between Harry and scarcrux was very well done but the reliance of the author on stations of canon just drives me crazy. I do like this fic overall though.

**** "Hit the Ground Running" by Tozette (completed in 2014) is the closest I've seen to "Accidental Horcrux", though its plot only spanned year one. Unfortunately Tozette took it down, but it was truly an excelent fic.

Other scarcrux fics go in very different directions. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12780767/1/A-Memory-of-Shadow][A Memory of Shadow]] starts in the summer after first year and has a somewhat softer personality for the scarcrux. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] takes the 'befriend the scarcrux' idea and runs off at high speed in a bizarre but somehow amazing direction that occasionally leaves you looking at the stations of canon in the rear-view mirror with a dazed and confused expression.

I've read a few other fics in which Harry talks to a horcrux in his head, but these are the only ones I can remember off the top of my head from favorites.

***** Thanks for the offer, but in my case I already downloaded the epub version a while back.

I used to link the fictionhunt.com mirror of the fic on this sub, but after that got taken down I figured the author is serious about not wanting the fic to be spread arround through alternate hostings.

** The problem with this fic is that I forgot it pretty much immediately after I read it, which speaks to the quality, good enough to read bad enough to forget. What I can recall is often sub par writing, long winded repetitiveness, and endless angst. Nothing especially interesting or distinctive to separate it from other fics using the same hooks. I can't remember the plot, but I'd bet on a canon rehash. I never got through the sequel.

***** It /isn't/ all under one title, though. Just like each book in canon tells a largely self-contained story which contributes to the overall plot, the first fic ends when its story ends. /Harry's/ story goes past that end, hence the sequel, but Accidental Horcrux tells a complete story.

****** I havent read Accidental Horcrux specifically, so I wouldnt know. But in general, I find splits like that are usually arbitrary. For example the Arithmancer, it ends at year 4, but the ending of year 4 doesnt finish the plot any more than the endings of year 1,2,3 do. Same with the brightest witch in the darkest house. If canon was split at end of year 4 randomly I would put it here too. I would call a fic complete if there is a complete change in plot/setting/tone for the sequel, aka something like Voldemort dies and then you have a sequel. The Changeling does that.

I dont know in which the accidental horcrux goes.

******* Accidental Horcrux definitely falls more into the same category as Arithmancer, where the split is mostly arbitrary, the main plot points are no where close to resolved, and tone/setting/characterisation remain largely the same before and after the split.

** I read it a while a couple of years ago, so I am vague on details, but it stuck with me- I was just thinking about it recently. In my opinion, it has some of the best development of characters who we hardly know in books. Avery and Theodore Nott are the ones I remember , but I think there was also a friendship with Anthony Goldstein? And the angst was pretty bleakly scary at times, which can be hard to achieve. I'd give it 8/10.
