Harry Potter (maybe with his friends from the DA) travels back in time to meet the Order from 1995 /or/ the /Order/ travls into /future/ to meet him and his friends. Some real plot would be nice. Ideally - Harry helps them with finishing the war earlier. It is important, though, that Harry does not travel back in time to save the world that's been destroyed by Voldemort or whatever - he still won the war. And by adult Harry I mean post-war, at least. Preferably post-epilogue.

And I really want Snape to be a part of it. Let them talk and bicker and troll each other ^_^


** From the top of my head Linkffn(Disorder of the Phoenix) is a wholesome and well-written story with this as a important part of the plot.

***** It was completed on 31 May, 2018 with 23 chapters, so ff2ebook version should be fine. Alternatively, you can download my copy from google drive with the author notes stripped out. That's [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9h_D4aobhLMIXcW5OUDKpFdZPDidre8/view?usp=sharing][HERE]].

For some inexplicable reason, the author took a bunch of their stories down and reposted them as single-chapter stories on a different account (complete with the original author notes scattered throughout - it's a mess).

****** Thanks! Awesome, downloaded your version. Do you store your favourites in google drive or something? It's a great idea I may have to do myself!

******* No problem.

Somebody was asking for it after the original was taken down and before it was reuploaded and it's just still in google drive (I wasn't aware of the other website at the time).

I just save things in calibre on my desktop, and use it to manage my read and unread fics.
