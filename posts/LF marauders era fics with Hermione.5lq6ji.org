Hermione + Sirius or Hermione + Remus. I /might/ be willing to try out a Hermione + James if it's /really/ well written but the idea of them sort of squicks me out.


** I've read a ton of these lately. Someone will come along, I'm sure, and post dozens, but until they do... here is a well done Hermione/James that is worth reading.

*EDIT:* I'll drudge up some more that I've seen around recently and have been recommended. If I find others, then I will edit this comment further. *EDIT 2:* I'm sorry I used the bot so terribly! I didn't really realize until afterwards. Sorry to you all, I'll link them myself.

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. --- Begins Mid Deathly Hallows, AU going forward. Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. (James/Hermione) *Art by colour me luna*
