I'm curious if there are fics out there that have this pairing and explore its consequences. Anything goes, really -timetravel, dimension-hopping or just an AU fic.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** You will find only a couple one-shots, most not really good and/or based on cheating. I had asked for fics a couple times and gotten basically nothing.

The prospects are almost as bad as with Sirius/Tonks.

I haven't encountered one with their pairing as the main story, though.

** I'd recommend [[http://ficsbynell.livejournal.com/14029.html][Smoke Gets In Your Eyes]]. It is a three-chapter story that starts off Sirius/Lily and ends James/Lily. I think it does justice to both -- it manages to create two convincing relationships of entirely dissimilar nature. Lily and Sirius's relationship is fraught with hormones and tension and an undercurrent of distaste, whereas James and Lily's is based on empathy and mutual understanding and something that might come to resemble love.

Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12597000][The Kind of World Where We Belong]]. Trope-y, but decent writing.

** The only story I know of that is decently written does not necessarily explore any of the consequences, although I haven't read it in a while... It's called [[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?psid=244074][Incandescence]].

Since I have to link it this way... It is complete at 54k words. The summary is this:

  /He was a magician, and I was his audience, and every time he worked his magic on me, I fell for it. And truth be told, I wanted to be fooled, for there can be nothing more sublime, more blissful, than that one moment in time when you open your eyes, and find the world to be exactly as you dreamt it./

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
