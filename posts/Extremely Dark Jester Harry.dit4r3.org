:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember one time reading a fanfic where Harry turns inexplicably, irredeemably, extremely edgily dark. He calls himself the Jester or something which is also his alt form which he uses to kill Umbitch, amasses a dark army to take over the world, invades Gringotts with said army, exterminating goblins in the process and later invades France. I also remember Neville being in his army but was about to betray him or something.

I can't for the life of me remember what fic that is. I read it I think in 7th or 8th grade so around 5 years back and it was posted on ff.net if anyone knows the name of this fic or if its still on the internet at all, itll be much appreciated.

To tell you the truth, its probably not as good as I remember it. Harry was super edgy in this one, more Joker than Potter. I just wanna reminisce and maybe have a good laugh.
