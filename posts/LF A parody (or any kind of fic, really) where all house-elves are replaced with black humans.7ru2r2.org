  Hermione smiled in a way that sent cold shivers down Ron, Seamus, and Dean's spines. "I did some period research. You wouldn't believe," she said with a fake cheeriness, "how many authors back in those days happily parroted ideas like 'Black people can't survive without White People', 'Black people are happy with their lot in life', or 'Serving white people gives black people a purpose in their life.'"

  Hermione smiled further, causing the three boys to swallow nervously. "I can't imagine why you'd think we'd be talking about House Elves. Why, there's absolutely nothing at all similar between the two subjects. There's absolutely no reason to think that House Elves are symbolic of the earlier days of slavery."

** Well, the house elves are an interesting case in that they actively advocate for their own slavery. The only house elf that isn't happy with the status quo is Dobby, and it's clear that he likes working for wizards just as much as the rest, even though he gets paid. What bugs me is that there's clearly some kind of magical bondage in place, given that Dobby hates the Malfoys, but isn't able to leave them until Harry tricks Lucius into freeing him. A common fanon explanation is that House Elves are somehow reliant on being bonded to wizard families and die if they aren't, which is both stupid and just a poorly thought out excuse to have Dobby working for Harry. There are a few things made clear by canon: house elves like working for wizards in general, an elf in service to a family can't leave on their own, house elves are very powerful in their own right (at least Dobby was, he's the only yardstick we have for measuring the rest by) and elves are perfectly capable of surviving without being in service. Dobby was doing great, and Winky was depressed and succumbing to alcoholism, not starving for whatever magic it is writers think elves leech out of wizards.

The comparison to enslaved Africans is too simplistic, possibly even a little insulting to the actual enslaved people, it's clearly not the same thing here. The worst punishment wizards can think of to inflict on elves is to free them. I don't buy the "they're brainwashed into liking it" nonsense, there's absolutely no evidence of any level of brainwashing going on, and nobody would free elves as a punishment if they were going through the effort of programming them to like being slaves. Also, we have Kreacher, who was devoted to Walburga Black well beyond her death, but hated Sirius and Harry, who were both supposedly his rightful masters, and took off the first chance he got, not to be free, but to work for somebody he liked better. Harry turned Kreacher to his side through being kind to him and appealing to his loyalty to Regulus, not by brainwashing him. And then there's Winky, who was traumatized by being fired, and was clearly emotionally attached to the Crouch family, and felt bad for her lack of action in stopping Barty. Outside of Dobby (who clearly has very good reasons to want to leave the Malfoys), we never even see any examples of elves who want to be free. Even with the fairly reasonable assumption that Hogwarts is a sweet gig that no elf in their right mind would ever give up, there's no evidence of any elves not being horribly mistreated that would ever want to be free.

On the other hand, the main evidence in favor of the slavery idea: the bonding. We have no idea what that's about, and it bugs me. Wizards have access to this whole population of thinking beings who want nothing more than to work, specifically elves seem to be into doing housework, I can't think of any canon examples of elves employed to do other jobs. Either the wizards then created some kind of system to force these willing workers to serve specific families, or else the elves came up with it themselves, or else it's something inherent to house elf nature (circling back to the "house elves need to bond to wizards to survive idea", which I still don't like). None of these explanations works for me without more background detail, which we don't have.

  My headcanon about house elves is that, some time in the past, when house elves showed up the first in the history of mankind, enslaved, a powerful wizard or witch used their power to force the elves to be bounded to some kind of basic law, like Issac Asimov's three basic law for robot, so they will remain a humble and dedicated servant of mankind (or wizardkind).
#+end_quote

I can't for the life of me remember what fic it was, but I read one where Hermione learns that house elves were actually horrific, violent creatures and their servitude was to keep them from killing everyone. It wasn't the focal point of the story, but out always stuck with me.

**** ...A question; house elves have the same body structure as humans, they have similar physical capabilities to humans, they have similar magical capabilities to witches & wizards, they speak the same language as local humans, they use the same body language as humans, and many of their ethics and beliefs are the same as that of most humans (they don't commit murder, they don't steal, they're generally polite to company, etc).

******* Don't really know how to explain in English but will try.

First of all, monkey look like human more than house elf do (if the picture that the movies give us is true).

Monkeys and humans share 85% to 95% of the same DNA.

Both human and monkeys are known for being very social animals.

Both human and monkeys use the same facial expression.

Both human and monkeys are omnivorous

Both human and monkeys are known for they sexual appetite. They are the only species who actually have sex for other reason than reproduction.

Human and monkeys have the same eyes. I mean that they can see the same color, and at the same distance.

Finally both human and monkey can use tools if they need to.

I'm not really the best in this Thema, so I advise you to Google it because it's kind of cool.

...Alright, hmm...I can't think of any plausible reason for house-elves to be magically bound to serve either.

There doesn't seem to be any good analogue in mythology:

- Brownies and hobs, the household spirits that house-elves are largely based off, may shun material wealth, but they're free and will leave if mistreated or offended; in contrast, Dobby & Kreacher were mistreated by Malfoy and Sirius, and couldn't disobey them beyond creative interpretations of orders.

- Dryads are attached to their trees; Hamadryads in particular couldn't live without them. But Dobby & Winky, physically-speaking (though not emotionally in Winky's case), do fine after being freed with the whole clothes ritual.

- There's the classic genie-in-a-bottle, but most of them are just, well, trapped in bottles or rings or whatnot. And generally speaking, they want to be free instead of granting wishes.

So yeah, house-elves might love to work, but I can't think of any reason why they would need to be magically bound to do so.

(I found myself wondering halfway through if part of the reason Kreacher went more than a bit nutty and had enmity towards Sirius, was because he was bonded to Sirius while the latter was in Azkaban; Kreacher therefore ended up absorbing some of the dementors influence, making him slowly go crazy but keeping Sirius from being overwhelmed.)

**** I hadn't considered brownies or genies, there are some similarites, but again it doesn't quite fit. The big thing with the stories of brownies I'm familiar with is that you can't seek them out yourself, they have to come to your household and work of their own free will, and will only do so while they wish to. Although some similar creatures, such as leprechauns and clurichauns, are sometimes suggested to bind themselves to a single house or similar location, or sometimes to a specific person, it's a similar issue of them doing so of their free will, and in the case of the clurichaun being more of a pest than anything else.

There is some similarity between house elves and Disney's Aladdin-style modern interpretation of genies (bound to serve the person who owns their lamp or other container by granting wishes), but the same problem presents itself. In genie stories, you either have a malevolent genie that the lamp owner would clearly want to be rid of, or the benevolent Robin Williams genie that wants freedom, but is too valuable for most selfish people to waste a wish freeing. House elves are unique in that they're powerful, rare, and people want to have them, but also are perfectly willing to give them up just for not doing a good enough job. Also in that despite how powerful they seem to be, their powers aren't well understood (such as being able to travel through anti-Apparation enchantments) and they're used solely as household labor.

It's an interesting idea, but I think there's already plenty of reasons. A combination of drinking the potion that protected the locket Horcrux, then seeing Regulus die, then being unable to fulfill Regulus's last instruction for years is more than enough to explain Kreacher's particular brand of crazy.
