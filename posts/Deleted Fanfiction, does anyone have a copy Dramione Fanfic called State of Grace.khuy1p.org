It's a dramione fanfic called state of grace. There's also an unfinished sequel that I loved reading, and now it's been deleted.


** I would recommend asking on [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]], this sub hates the pairing and will probably downvote you so no one else can see your post

*** “hate” is too strong word, I don't like the pairing, it seems completely impossible for me (without /thorough/ [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/how-redeemable-is-canon-draco-malfoy.html][redemption]] of Draco Malfoy), but I don't have stronger feelings against it than against Harry/Daphne, Harry/Tonks or many other ships I don't like.
