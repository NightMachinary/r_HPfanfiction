MC, preferably Harry or Hermione, in a place where there is either no remaining wizards, leaving them as the last, or in a world where wizards simply don't exist. I don't mind OP fics, since in this situation, they're inevitable.

Crossovers welcome, thanks!

#+begin_quote
  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

**** It's awesome. Especially the action scenes. The romance is a little awkward with two Rons existing and all.

** Any crossovers with LOTR or Star Wars would do it. I personally like linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force), as well as linkffn(The Wasteland). With the latter, it is best to have read linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), but not necessary. There's another good one, but I'm going to have to hunt it down.

Edit: Found it! Linkffn(This Dream's On Me).

Harry/avengers

** I've written one. It's a crossover between Harry Potter and the MCU and features a light slash pairing between Harry and Matt Murdock. It's a bit meandering but by some chance you may enjoy it. Here's a link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19878001/chapters/47078821]]
