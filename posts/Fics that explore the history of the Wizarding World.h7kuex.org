In canon, the 'History of Magic' class was just a joke where a ghost raved on and on about goblin rebellions. However, we can assume that magical history, if done good, could have been a very interesting subject, and also as a means of exposition. We don't know much about the first blood war and much less about Grindelwald's war. And they are just two events. The wizarding history is just as vast as the no-maj one.

Are there any fics which depict the wizarding history, and also the historical interactions between magicals and non - magicals. I would like to think that events in muggle history could affect the wizarding history and vice - versa, and this would happen more often before the Statue of Secrecy than after.


** I think linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and it's sequels and linkffn(Victoria Potter) do a good job of this. Although, Victoria Potter is still only in second year so there isn't exactly an encyclopaedia of historical knowledge in it yet.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** I agree, History is quite ignored as JKR hated history in her school years, which also sadly affects her worldbuilding. I particulary love the idea of exploring Wizarding History and I've put a lot of effort in my local magic government fanon to represent the history of the Colonial Río de la Plata.

** “Starnlicht” by Marquis Carabas explores the establishment of one particular Wizarding institution, through a plot focused on political and investigatory intrigue. Muggles and their interactions with Wizards feature as a plot point.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
