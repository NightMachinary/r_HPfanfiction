** "I don't trust Wormtail. I smell a rat!" Grumbled Lily.

"That's ok, because you are a cat, a big cat." Laughed James.

"My answer is still a no. Unless you have a backup plan."

"Ok, ok, so I guess you already have something in mind."

Lily stood up, walked to the entrance hall, and said "We need to place a trap here, a trap that could not be identified by conventional detection spells, a trap that could be activated by us easily."

She then walked over to the back entrance, and pointed to a spot "Another trap here, that should cover the ground floor. Even if he survives these traps, they will slow him down and give us time to prepare. Or Dumbledore could arrive with his Fawkes. Regardless, if he shows up, we will know who the spy is."

"I see you have given many thoughts already, Lily. I still have a hard time thinking that Peter could betray us. But you are right, too much is at stake. Give me some time and I will add more ideas."

"We don't have much time left, James. If he is going to strike, it will be over the next few weeks. Halloween could definitely be a possibility. I say contact Dumbledore NOW. If he's unwilling to share some alchemical concoctions, then I'm going to break into an army warehouse and get us some Muggle bombs!"

**** Being a (big) cat animagus, this Lily would harbor an instinctive animosity toward rats. Hence, she could view Wormtail with far greater objectivity than James.

Even if she was not very certain, having a backup plan in addition to the Fidelius would still be a very good idea. It was her previous Harry's life after all!

So, if Wormtail was good, then she merely wasted some effort and concerns, an extremely small price to pay.

But should Wormtail be the real traitor, the payoff of her countermeasures would be /priceless/ and a total game changer!

Considering this excellent reward to risk ratio, why not be better prepared?

On that note, why should anyone trust anyone? Wasn't Voldemort saying that only fools make friends?

****** Unfortunately, that's necessary when running combat and intelligence operations against sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis.

Some paranoia and strict operational security are fundamental to the survival of the organization. Sure it may hurt some people's sensitivity, but some interpersonal ruthlessness is way more preferable than losing 40% of your people and enemies winning.

As we have often discussed here, JKR really has no clue about fighting wars. She wants to write a fairytale in which innocence overcomes the great evil through Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, plot armors, and the lucky hero trope. Her good guys must not have political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical competence. They can only beg bad guys for mercy, rush into dangerous situations with little thoughts, and offer themselves for execution.

I don't want any of that! My Lily will trust her Animagus instinct and question her friends' loyalty and trustworthiness, especially if her own baby's life is in great danger! *Trust, but verify* is a motto this Lily believes in. Blind trust and misplaced mercy will only get good people tortured and murdered, while handing victory to those sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazi scums!

******* I understand your point, but this is a fantasy tale where good, love and friendship triumphs over evil, hatred and psychopathy. With that being said, we are never really told about the circumstances under which Peter Petigrew betrayed James. For all we know, he could have been telling the truth in the Shrieking Shack and did it under threat or out of fear. Sirius who knew him for a long time was willing to trust him and so did many people until the sixth book when Sirius was finally cleared of all charges. Furthermore this is reinforced by the fact that "Wormy" appears to be sad according to Lily's letter to Sirius when he visits the Potters in hiding. Also he seems to hate and feel repulsed by Voldemort in the fourth book and the only reason he sticks with him is because he has nowhere else to go.

Even realistically, I would doubt that someone as kind and gentle as canonical Lily, would suspect a traitor in their midst.

******** A few things here:

1. This is fanfic, and OP is asking for alternate scenarios, so I don't have to abide by canon fairytale at all.
2. *Even if Wormtail caved in under threat, the net result would still be the same. So Lily might as well prepare for this eventuality. In wars, treachery, whether voluntary or forced, must all be considered. Have a plan for the worst possibility is how you win wars.*
3. Even from the few memory clips we see in canon, Lily can be ruthless when she needs to be. Kindness doesn't mean blind trust in friends or lack of planning either. This AU tiger Animagus Lily could further have a sixth sense and be very proactive. This slight personality difference as a result of OP's request should help them win the war with much less pain.
4. OP is asking for AU here, so I might as well change the plot in a major way. I've had enough of those supposedly AUs where the new character simply added a few snarky lines, but nothing major changed at all.
5. Good guys should be cunning, proactive, and ruthless at least for once.

***** there is nothing to say that being an animagus gives people qaulities of said animal

also if lilly was a maraudor she would have had years of that form and said animosity would be gone

in fact lilly might trust peter even more due to her guilt of treating him poorly when they first became animagus
