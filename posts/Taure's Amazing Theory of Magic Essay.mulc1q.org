I came accross Taure's Theory of Magic Essay (/Taure: The Magic of Harry Potter/) and I simply cannot believe how good it is ([[https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1553449399513.pdf]]). It explains so many complex nuances of magic in a way that very few writings do. I wonder, are there any more such essays that dive deeper into the lore of the magical theory of the HP universe? Plus, while we're at it, are there any fanfictions that put an emphasis on magical theory and explaining how the HP world; not the political, but magical aspects of it; truly function?

For the past few weeks I've been reading fics that have some /Realpolitical/ tones intwined with them (i.e. the first chapters start out normally, but all of a sudden Harry becomes a political genius, the political system of the Wizengamot takes centre stage and everything becomes too formal (everyone adresses each other with "Lord", "Mr.", the phrase "The Most Ancient and Noble house of XXX" comes up way to often, etc.)). For me, the HP universe has always been about magic, not so much about political machinations; and I know what you'll say: /"Politics, racism and the like are fundamental parts of the Harry Potter universe, yadda yadda, yadda..."/. *Yes, politics has always been a part of the HP universe but not it's most fundamental aspect*.

The schemata of the hero's journey, the question of finding friendship, the importance of love in a world filled with despair and a way of escaping the mundanity of everyday life and, for a few hours at least, being a part of a world that is fundamentally, for a lack of a better word, */magical/* in nature. The themes of magic, friendship, duty and the positivity of a young person's understanding of the world is what I love about this series. That's the essence of Harry Potter. For me, that feeling of calmness and homeliness; that fuzzy, cozy feeling of sitting on a recliner, with an itchy wooly blanket wraped around me, gazing out the window and then returning to reading a book that fills me with such joy and a sense of adventure is what Harry Potter has always been about. Not politics, not power structures, but simply reading a story I enjoy for it's narrative, the magical lore and for the world-building connected to it.

I may have gone slightly off script here, but no worries. The original question still stands, even with my somewhat long quasi "philosophical" rant. Are there any more essays that deal with the theory of magic and which fics are the best for when it comes to world building and explaining the nuances of magic.


** Honestly there are some but I find that a lot of the ones who are lecturey should have written an essay instead of trying to cram their theories into a story because they just have that feel of an arrogant dude at university who thinks he knows everything.

The real good ones are able to communicate the wonder and interesting bits of magical theory without it feeling like a lecture

one of favourite stories for the second is Dobby's Deceit[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088][here]] because it has really great world building and especially elf culture but as Harry's a kid (if a smart one and really good at picking up spells) you get it one bite at a time and there is such wonder and joy in the tone

*** I also like linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist]]) though that ones a bit more lecturey, admittedly, but the tone is enthusiastic and I didn't find it boring any of the many times I've read it.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337/chapters/4677915]]) I like goblin fics because they often show a different side of magic, because they aren't allowed to use wands

  Few in the Wizarding world have a true understanding of the inner structure of the Goblin Nation or its corporate representative to the wizarding community, Gringott's Bank, much less any clue about how far they will go to protect their investments.

**** It's as yet unfinished but it's pretty fun if you don't mind a bit of Dumbledore/Weasley bashing. But as that stuff is mixed up in the magical theory I don't mind it in this case, at least Dumbledore is smart in it, and the Ron bashing is interesting (imo)

**** here's another good one for that I found while looking for something else. It's got some great concepts, I particularly like the world-building about the eyes [[https://quantumbang.org/a-certain-level-of-society-1-4-meyari-mcfarland/][A Certain Level of Society]] super Dumbledore bashing/good goblins though. But it's entertaining nonetheless, and it's not too repetitive like that trope can be
