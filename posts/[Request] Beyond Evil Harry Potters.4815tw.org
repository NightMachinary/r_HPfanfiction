I remember reading quite a few fan-fictions where Harry is this genocidal psychopath. He is both over powered and irredeemably evil and often leads a campaign of either the un-dead, former death eaters, or monsters from beyond Earth.

Basically anything that contains Harry being the evil villain with lots of gore that's well written.

A few good examples of the kind of fic I'm looking for are :

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7179133/1/Shadowed-Malice]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8517195/1/Heir-of-Dracula]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams-Part-One]])

If anyone has some fan-fictions that are similar please share! Thank you!


** My favorite story with an "evil" Harry is linkffn(Too Young to Die). I wouldn't say that he's overpowered as his progression isn't brutal but you might like it nonetheless, who knows.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** Yeah I read it, the ending was actually completely unexpected but amazing. So few works of fiction go that route. I never really classified him as evil though. Can you truly be evil if what you're doing is to save your little sister?

**** I guess he's not really EVIL, just ruthless. Still, it's not an excuse considering his crimes. But let's not enter a philosophical argument, that's not really the point. You're right, the ending WAS amazing. I wish we knew what Natasha thought of what her brother did.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
