I am looking for good stories with them either during Hogwarts, or after the war during a 8th year for example, or when they are adults. Thanks!

  Harry Potter is an Unspeakable. Draco Malfoy is the wizard who shagged him. Adventure! Intrigue! Secret identities, celebrities, spies! It's all right here, folks.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a trainee Auror, and Draco is living at Malfoy Manor, bored and petulant with nothing to do, and no career prospects. Draco's attempt to heal himself via Muggle psychology---including writing a series of 'why I hate you' letters to Harry---backfires when an overanxious house elf delivers the results to Harry. Harry is bemused, Draco is angry and together they have a lot of issues to work out.

** I love [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]], which has Harry dreaming about a parallel universe where Voldemort doesn't exist and he and Draco are together. Great AU characterizations, too!

  When Ron and Hermione get together, they notice only each other. A nightmare prompts Harry to return alone to the empty Chamber of Secrets, and leads to a new look at an old enemy. Harry enjoys the company, but with Lestrange actively hunting him, how far can he trust a Death Eater's son? (H/D -- mostly friendship, progressing to mild slash) Sixth year. Rated R for unseemly behavior (drinking, stealing, and Dark Arts), occasional cursing (the non-magical sort), and off-screen violence.

  "Losing his virginity was a bloody good time; waking up the next morning, however, next to a man's ribcage - that was a bloody bad time." Draco is a Veela and Harry is his mate. Crack!Horror. Dark humor abounds. One-shot, complete.
