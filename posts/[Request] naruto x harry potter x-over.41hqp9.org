** I'll warn you that most of those sucks.

In fact the worst fanfiction of all time (imo) is one of these. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8013278/1/Eye-of-the-Beholder][Here you go...if you dare]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653153/1/Someone-to-Fear-Not-Hunt][Sakura as Harry]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8784595/1/The-Fox-s-Sword][I haven't read this, but the concept is hilarious. Fem!Harry is killed by his friends, and reincarnates as Samehada.]]

***** Somehow I made it till the beginning of Chapter 8. The author tries to describe what is happening (a battle) with plenty of adjectives and descriptions. But how the hell does a black shirt (was told that in an earlier chapter) become transparent from the amount of blood on it?

  Sakura awakens in the early morning hours of October 31, 1981 with a blinding headache and a mental passenger. She has no idea how she's become this boy-child Harry Potter, but on a scale of weird things that have happened to her, it ranks only slightly above "ancient demon goddess defeated by the power of friendship". She'll persevere in a way the Wizarding World is not expecting.

** Hi, I'm new! Well I have been hiding in the background reading through the recommendations for a long time. This is an awesome community and now that a favourite crossover of mine, Naruto/HP, has come up, I felt an obligation to do my part.

That said, I have struggled to find a story where Harry has a bloodline from the Naruto universe in the Harry Potter universe that can... hold my interest? There are a few stories out there that are above average, and they have been listed, but I suspect that the battle type abilities of the Naruto-verse make Harry overpowered, often leading to revenge, angst and harem make-out sessions. I think if the stories escalated the "problems" then, perhaps, the stories may flow easier. This limits Harry's abilities in the Harry-verse, however, where Harry is sent to the Naruto-verse, the subtle magic and crazy powered people, do make for some very interesting reads. Here are a couple of my recommendations on Harry in the Naruto-verse. (and here's hoping I can link these correctly)

This is an all time favourite with sharingan - linkffn(7357616) - HP and the cloaked death.

This is not quite a bloodline but I do like it linkffn(7404024)

This is a different "bloodline" but good story linkffn(10554923)

But, if you really want another over powered harry with the sharingan, here's a good one - linkffn(7648998)

I hope this helps. Enjoy!

  To die and move on; it was what the Master of Death wanted more than anything. But not every victory ends with the victor getting what he wants. For Harry died, and he had moved on. But not to the realm of the dead. No, he ended up in the womb of a certain Uchiha. This is a story about how most plans seem to backfire. A story about sacrifice and love in more ways than one.
