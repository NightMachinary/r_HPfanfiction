:END:
I'm trying to find a fanfiction that I recall reading a few years ago. It is either Draco/Hermione or Draco/Ginny and there is a chapter that takes place at a ball at Hogwarts. I'm 95% sure it's a masquerade ball and everyone wears masks and either Ginny or Hermione wears a garter to store their wand but the other has a sheer dress and the garter would show through so she transforms her wand in to a rose and puts it in her hair. While in the washroom, Pansy and some other Slytherins attack Hermione/Ginny (at Pansy's orchestration, I think she's jealous and writes to Lucius out of spite about Draco's relationship and he helps orchestrate the attack)

It's multiple chapters and it would have been written at least 5 years ago, but probably 10-15. I know this is a long shot but figured I'd ask for help and someone might know or know someone who knows or be able to point me in a better direction
