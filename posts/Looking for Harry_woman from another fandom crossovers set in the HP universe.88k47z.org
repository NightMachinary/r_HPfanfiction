Are there any stories where a woman from another fandom is thrown into the HP universe and ends up together with Harry like for example "A witch and an Amazon walk into a bar". I don't particularly care which other fandom is involved or how much of the other world is included, but the goal should be to fix the mess with Voldemort, not Harry solving the problems of the other universe.

Preferably without requiring too much background knowledge of the other universe, Death Eater whitewashing or Ron/Hermione.

  After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

#+begin_quote
  After picking up a strange paper with Japanese writing on it in the Department of Mysteries, Harry accidentally summons a devil to Privet Drive. Of course, this devil doesn't look at all how you might expect. She looks to be a regular girl, albeit probably the most attractive girl he's ever met. Their lives now tied together, how will Rias Gremory affect the war against Voldemort?

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

  With the Weasleys popping out a kid every few months the subject has been coming up a lot recently. It's not really to do with having a baby, they're both quite firm on yes, a baby will be good. It's more to do with when.
