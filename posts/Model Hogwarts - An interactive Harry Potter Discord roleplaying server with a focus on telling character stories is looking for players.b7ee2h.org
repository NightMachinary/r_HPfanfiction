Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][wikia]]!

** *What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:*

   :CUSTOM_ID: whats-unique-and-awesome-about-model-hogwarts
   :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to choose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You only have to take a couple and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.

2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.

3) We're at a point where we are an established roleplaying community -- Model Hogwarts has recently hit our two year anniversary! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. While having the safety net of an established community with 200+ active players and systems and guidelines to guide you along your roleplaying journey!

4) As an established roleplaying community, we have developed -- and continue to develop -- a variety of systems to ensure you have the best experience possible! This includes a variety of discord bots, including a spell bot (that uses a combination of a learning and dice-based system to determine whether or not you succeed in casting a spell), a stat bot, and a chocolate frog bot, just to name a few! We also have a variety of systems, including the tokens system which allows you to purchase special abilities for your character so that your character, and every character in Model Hogwarts is truly unique.

5) We're welcoming to both new and experienced rpers. If you're new to RP it's okay! Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics][detailed RP guide]] to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you're new to RP and shy, you'll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!

6) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

7) *New addition:* Post-grad! Love Harry Potter but rather not roleplay as a student? We understand! Now that we have our first group of graduates, we have created a post-grad system where anyone can play as an adult in the wizarding world. Here you can start as someone that has already graduated Hogwarts, and navigate the vast wizarding world. Want to work in the ministry, and become a department head? Want to be a dark wizard and try and take over the wizarding world? These are all possible with post-grad!

*** *How to start:*

1) [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM][*Join the Discord!*]] This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You'll get a week of â€˜Hogwarts Summer Camp' where you can informally meet your peers in you year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.

2) [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][Check out our wikia]] for more information as well as some information about our classes, professors and some peoples' characters!

3) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they're totally optional if you're more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:

Charms

Potions

Transfiguration

Defense Against the Dark Arts

Path to Success in the Wizarding World

Herbology

History of Magic

As well as elective classes for third years and up!

4) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We'd be happy to answer them! We can't wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!


** Dear Sir or Madam,

I have previously written to you on 30 April 2018 to apply for the position of Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and I would like to reiterate my interest in teaching at your institution. You will find me a first-rate scholar and a charismatic teacher, who gets along with both students and staff, and who is totally not evil. Please find my resume and [[https://imgur.com/gallery/s1H9M#2][a recent picture]] attached. Letters of reference are available from Prof Horace Slughorn and Headmaster Armando Dippet.

Thank you in advance for your consideration,

Theodore ("Tod") Malboro Biddle

** Is the game played mostly through text or speech?

I'm an avid roleplayer and experienced GM, but I have never tried my hand at play-by-post. I would probably be a great addition to any voice based play, but completely mediocre at writing out scenes as they play.

*** We only roleplay through text. However, our members have varying RP styles and skill levels, so if you want to give it a try you should be fine!
