You know i read stories where harry becomes an auror and ones where he doesnt become one. Honestly i would rather read the ones where he doesnt become one. Why would he? If i was him i wouldnt want to fight aymore, would rather relax and be in peace and quiet. But i bet the only reason he joined the aurors at the end is because of peer pressure


** I have a personal headcanon that eventually Harry gets tired of the Ministry of Magic bureaucrats and goes to teach Defense against the Dark arts at Hogwarts.

** Doesn't Harry imply somewhere (HBP maybe?) that while he doesn't really like his fame, he does sort of enjoy fighting dark wizards/ magic and the other things he gets up to? That he's not content to just sit around when there is evil to confront?

I don't think so. Harry has this huge "saving people thing". In becoming an Auror he does exactly that. I don't think he would be unhappy as an Auror. He has the need to help people and he loves Defence Against the Dark Arts - Auror is the perfect combination from that two things. Aside from that: there will always be dark wizards. Harry is nobody who sits by idle and watches other people getting hurt. He enjoyed teaching the DA, yes. But the main reason he enjoyed it was not because he was a passionate teacher but because he wanted to help them fight for themselves. This part of teaching he can also have by mentoring younger Aurors. On the other hand as a Hogwarts teacher he wouldn't be able to help people like he is as an Auror. So if he would read about dark wizard attacks sitting in the Great Hall I think he would quickly get frustrated by not being able to help.

** Harry's life has been filled with fighting. It is all he knows.

Also the fight against Voldemort doesn't stop in DH. Yes Voldemort dies but what he stands for is still out there. The blood supremacy movement isn't dead because of him. His fight isn't done. So the premise that Kingsley hires Harry and Ron and technically anyone who wants to be an Auror from the Battle of Hogwarts it isn't hard seeing him say yes.

Then force of habit sets in. Being an auror is comfortable. Fighting Dark Wizards is what he knows. Ron would arguably be the most disillusioned by the work as it is nothing like what they did in the books. I could see Canon Ron go work with George after a while.

Harry however would likely stay until he feels like Voldemort's movement is well an truly dead. He wants to make a difference. I could easily see Harry start teaching after maybe 10-15 years maybe when his kids start attending Hogwarts maybe after they graduated depending on what type of parent he is.

If he becomes the literal opposite of his own adult figures from his childhood I could easily see Harry become a teacher when his kids attend Hogwarts.

Harry doesn't know how not to fight, so he would likely keep fighting.

The same thing happens to soldiers after they are done with a tour. They can't function in peace time and long to go back to war. Being an Auror is the closest he would come to that or maybe he would just become a hit-wizard or something.

He would only feel alive in a fight no matter how enriching teaching would be.

** Yeah, if Harry was going for anything 'action'-ey, I could see him better fitting the globetrotting approach more than the auror approach.

Teaching is definitely the thing I see him enjoying the most though.

I don't see Harry as an Healer because he simply never took interest in helping people that way - but his grades wouldn't be the problem.

For becoming a Healer you need exactly the same NEWTs that you need for becoming an Auror. Harry at least had good enough marks to fullfill the Auror-Requirements at OWL-Level. He would have to go back to Hogwarts to take his NEWTS but he has the basic requirements.

We often forget that Harry actually had pretty good marks because we have Hermione on his side who is the equivalent of a straight A student. But Harry isn't that bad either - Auror is one of the most demanding carrier-choices and Harry met that requirements.
