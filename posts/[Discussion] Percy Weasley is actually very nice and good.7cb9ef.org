Yes please readers and writers, please I know that lots of people like to be mean to Percy and do not like him, but yes I am rereading Harry Potter series today and Percy is so nice and good it is amazing! Yes in Chamber of Secrets he made sure Ginny got Pepperup medicine, and he was so worried about Ron and Harry being near Myrtle's bathroom and looking like they were the bad guys, and it says he also talked to Ginny the most and comforted her when she thought they would be expelled! He stopped Fred and George from jumping out and scaring Ginny too! And also yes in Prisoner of Azkaban it says a lot of times that Percy personally chose to escort Harry everywhere in order to protect him from Sirius if he had to!!! That is so amazing when yes you think about that Percy KNEW Black was a mass murderer and Voldemort's best supporter and he STILL DID THAT FOR HARRY! :) Yes so I love Percy as a character so much and I will write him with this protective streak in my fics. :) Also yes maybe this is the reason he joined the Ministry regime against Dumbledore? Because he saw that Dumbledore could not protect his sister in second year or Harry in third year? Yes it makes so much sense. :)


** Actually, I have to agree with the [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/percyandmama.html][Red Hen essay]] that Percy is a victim of his mother's expectations and the changing political situation.

It's a bit long but a good read.

** Right? I have for years maintained that Percy is my second favourite Weasley. ( and that Fred and George are at the very least annoying, if not worse...)

He is a mostly reasonable, protective guy. He is clever, though I think his high marks are more due to determinenation than pure raw intelligence. He is brave. I mean, he decided that the ministry was right and stood against his own family. People like to see this as a horrible betrayal. I don't. I see it as being naive, maybe, easily misled, but also as brave. Standing up against something your whole family believes in, knowing this will cause a rift and still doing it. In a way that is a very Weasley thing to do, too. - and then the poor kid was kinda stuck ( because, he /is/ a kid! He is not older than your typical college student... Who does not make mistakes at that age?) .

i have a lot of thoughts about Percy. I think he is more similar to Ron than Ron would like to admit. I think he has the same " I am just another Weasley... And poor, too" insecurities, but deals with them in a different way. Ron dreams about standing out ( mirror of Erised) , Percy is actually working on it.

And then Percy in other ways is similar to Hermione, despite them not being related. Somebody who probably came to Hogwarts a bit on the know-it-all side, somebody who has problems making friends and who relies heavily on authority. Hermione was "pushed" into the position of having friends, of realising early you cannot always rely on those in authority (several teachers throughout the years trying to kill her best friend and working with Voldemort, Lockhard pulling the wool over her eyes so completely, McGonagall not taking them serious towards the end of book one...) . Percy did not have this happening to him that directly, in a way was allowed to take his time to grow up in that regard.

I get why people dislike Pecy. I just don't. I really always liked him.

** Percy is actually one of my favourite characters and I hate it when the fandom bashes him or when he's just pushed aside in fanfiction. I always saw a lot of myself in Percy, I too have had high expectations put on me since I was a kid. I've often been referred to as “the saving grace of the family” and pressured to always be the best. I can never find much non-bashing fanfiction about Percy and I wish I could find more.

***** So it is a letter that is totally out of character to anyone who actually knows him but looks genuine to people who superficially are acquainted with him, written by a person who finds himself trapped behind enemy lines and so plays lip service to the party line because everything else would be tantamount to social, financial and career (possibly even actual, considering the way the ministry moved against Dumbledore) suicide.

In other word, he wrote a letter that he tried to get past his censors.

His failure was that he expected Harry and his brother to be as smart as he himself is. Instead they were blinded by their emotions and did not read any further than the superficial wording.

Do remember how empty of content the letters were he received over the summer because people worried that they would be intercepted.

Do remember That earlier in the same chapter with Percy's letter Harry himself attempted to do what Percy did and encode a hidden message while making it seem harmless and innocent in his letter to Sirius.

JKR announced what she was doing with Percy's letter in the very same chapter it is printed in.

****** Oh I remember, but that doesn't excuse his behaviour towards his family for pretty much 3 whole books. Now I get that he had to be careful in book 7, but he still was awful to his family in OotP and HBP. Even if the letter he wrote was ‘coded', it still a) was to get Ron to agree with him and stay away from Harry (I seriously doubt he cares about harry) and b) doesn't excuse the ignoring of his family and the stuff he said to them.

Look, I read Percy as a know it all and pompous, and someone who values status from the establishment over his family. Something I personally can't stand. Anyone who would reprimand his family and not support them (at a boarding school no less) and was seemingly embarrassed by his family's status is not a character that will ever be one of my favourites. You clearly like him, and have a higher opinion of him that I ever will.

*** Yes, thank you.

I mean, it's one thing to believe the Prophet shit if you haven't met the guy - but Percy shared quarters for three years with Harry, even had time to observe him as a guest in the Weasley home.

I'm not saying he should have believed Harry's story out of hand, but he didn't even give him the benefit of doubt, didn't try to talk to him and get his version of events, just swallowed the ministry propaganda like candy.

It feels a lot like he chose to remain on the ministry's side out of self-interest, to advance his career.

**** I think you just aren't viewing things from the proper perspective, because you already know the truth as observed from Harry's POV. If your little brother's best friend suddenly started making public statements about Adolf Hitler coming back from the dead and murdering his fellow student, it wouldn't matter how much you liked or respected the kid. You would think he's lost his mind.

It's made apparent all throughout the series that there /are/ hard limits on what magic can and cannot do (Gamp's Laws, etc.), and for most people in the HP universe, it's as inconceivable that Voldemort came back from the dead as Hitler's resurrection would be for us.

Exactly. It's not just wild stories and statements; there's a dead fucking student whose death was NOT investigated. There's Barty Crouch Jr who was kissed on sight, despite being a potential goldmine of information. There's the trouble at the World Cup. There's the dementor attack on Harry. Percy was at least peripherally aware of all those things but he chose to ignore them and side with the Ministry regardless.

As I mentioned in my previous post, I'm not saying he should have believed Harry out of hand. But before sending that letter, the very least he could have done, would be visit Harry and get his side of the story, so that he could judge for himself.

***** I'd maybe put more faith and standing in my parents opinions, plus he must've known about the diary being Riddle's. That should've informed his opinion. Fact is, Percy resented being the 3rd child, couldn't live up to the reputation of bill and Charlie so strives to make a name for himself. Hated being poor and (granted, this is an assumption) put a lot of stock in the ministry and thought by succeeding there he was a good person. He said some awful stuff to his parents and admitted he was a fool in DH.

I don't think Percy is a bad person, but he is by far the worst Weasley.
