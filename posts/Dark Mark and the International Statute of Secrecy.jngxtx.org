** Well, I feel like a giant rampaging through West Country in Britain was a bit more noticeable then a dark mark, and the Ministry of Magic did just fine covering that up. They did such a good job the Prime Minister was insulted at the notion that there wasn't a hurricane.

And it's even easier to pass off the Dark Mark as a fancy light-show or something than it is to cover up an entire giant attack.

Given the fact that satellite imagery and aerial photography was quite prevalent in the 1990s (see Google Earth records and google aerial photography) and the Statute is still intact (and will always be per JKR), it's clear that wizards have ways to change muggle records, electronics, etc.

So the Statute really wouldn't be impacted by the war. Obliviators might be a bit more busy than usual along with the Office of Misinformation but it wouldn't suddenly end or anything.

** Who cares about few Dark Marks, when you have a dragon flying through the centre of London in the middle of a sunny May day?

*** Can Muggles see dragons? Or are they invisible, similar to Thestrals and Dementors?

  (and even they were basically squatting on Muggle-owned land, I think)

Where do you get this from? I've always assumed they've owned their own land since pre-statute.

*** Well... ... they set up concealment charms didn't they? It's not like the wall that leads to diagon alley is a portal to a different world all together, they just made that part larger and made it so no muggle could normally see it. So it's like shared land that belongs to both wizards and muggles since it's in London but only wizards can access it.

**** Malfoy manor is in Wiltshire not London. I'd say that any concealment charms over the grounds would be more akin to a fence than anything else.

Diagon Alley is in London, however I think it's a bit erroneous to assume that all that land is muggle-owned. It's not to great a stretch to assume wealthy wizards didn't own land in the capitol pre-statute.

***** IK, but I never mentioned anything about Malfoy Manor and I know that wealthy wizards could have owned the land that London was on back then, but the same could have been said for a wealthy muggle. In fact if a wizard owned land back then and muggles started building on it, it would be safe to say they were a pure-blood since it was forbidden to marry muggles in those times. Since they were pure-blood they'd probably murder all the muggles trying to build London.

Much more likely however is that a wealthy muggle royal decided that they're kingdom was not good enough: bought the land, had people build London, built Buckingham Palace and then moved in with his family, later on wizards were hunted for using magic and the remaining grouped together and used concealment charms to separate them from muggles for good and made their own little alley, from their they developed and built until they had an entire wizarding world.

******* Your right I'm sorry just found out it wasn't ever illegal, ever since Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them I thought at one point muggles and wizards were not allowed to marry at one point but was changed later in Britain.

****** OP has edited out the piece I quoted (coward), but the implication was that all land was muggle owned. That's what I was addressing with my original comment, and why I bought up the Malfoys.

** I would imagine they Obliviate anyone they can catch witnessing the Dark Mark or other magic event. After the fact, if people are going around to newspapers and journalists swearing they saw something crazy, those Muggles would be easy to find and Obliviate as well.

As for the rest? It's not really a threat to wizardkind if some Muggle is quietly sure they saw something magical (or dare I say, paranormal?), but know they'd never be believed and keep it to themselves or only tell close friends/family who shrug their eccentricity off.

I remember a reference to a book called "Muggles Who Notice," I suspect the subject is explored there more in-depth!

** Well, I'm not sure but it seem's like they don't actually obliviate anyone. But here's my thoughts. Voldemort is pompous and a bit arrogant so it would seem he'd want to make muggles fear him and then kill them right? So his plan would be: conquering the wizarding world and killing all who oppose him, then he would reveal himself to the muggles who will think ‚ÄòIf he can beat people with literal magic, how will we stop him?' So then he'd kill all muggles and rule the world.

So in that case he'd wait until he had proof that he was that powerful, so that muggles would fear his existence, he then probably would have cast charms on the dark mark can not be seen by muggles.
