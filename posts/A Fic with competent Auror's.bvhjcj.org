It seems like 9/10 stories I read have the Auror's always arriving late and after the fight is over. What Fics have realistic response times where the 'Police', have the ability to teleport to the location?


** In Harry Potter and the methods of rationality as soon as the DMLE hear about a crime in progress someone immediately uses a time Turner to go back in time and assemble & brief a response team so that they are immediately ready to teleport to the scene in full force once time loops around again to when the call first came through.

** Instant travel with limited communications? There's only 1 widespread canonical form of communication and it has a lot of ways to be hindered or disabled. And then limitations to apparition?

As much as I enjoy a competent Auror story, its easy to see why it's common.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Harry and Ron as aurors. They're pretty competent, although some of their colleagues aren't.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** Yeah, that's a good example. I loved the auror scenes in that one.

**** Divided and Entwined also has some scenes from the point of view of aurors, but since the ministry isn't doing anything against death eaters they're pretty useless there.

** In my stories, Apparition is taken into account for response times - provided they get alerted, of course, and they sometimes still have to assemble a force (wouldn't do to send two Aurors if a DE attack was reported; they'd be killed easily).
