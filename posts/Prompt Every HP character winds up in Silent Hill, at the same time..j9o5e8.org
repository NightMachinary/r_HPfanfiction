I was thinking of using this for one of my fics.

But seriously, how would they all fare?


** Depends on if Magic works on the inhabitants or not. If yeah, they'd probably be fine but a bit freaked out (riddikulus, for one). If not... well. That would be fun. :)

*** I would say that Boggart rules don't apply to Silent Hill. Once a Boggart takes on a certain form, it looks like that form to everyone who sees it until it takes a new form. In Silent Hill, the same thing can look like two different things to two diferent people simultaneously - "They look like monsters to you?"

**** A fair point. But that was just an example. I did mean magic in general. If magic doesn't work, you get to play on their fear and discomfort and powerlessness. If magic does work, you get to play with their arrogance and disassemble their self-assurance. The experience would be significantly different for them.

***** Playing on the arrogance is an interesting point.

Malfoy would get rawdogged by Silent Hill.

****** Thanks, but not quite what I mean. It's not just Malfoy that'll have some arrogance. It's a natural state of being magical - you have the ability to rearrange reality to your whims and satisfy basically your every need. That's gonna lead to some self-assurance, and some serious arrogance when dealing with non-magicals. After all, what can they do to you? Even if you like Muggles, there's still that sense of inevitable superiority there from all but the most sensible/incorruptible.

The trick there is to remember that Magicals aren't just magic. They're people. And not the most sensible of people at that. So, you play against their minds and work around the magic. Misdirect their attention and hit them from behind, draw them into traps they don't see coming, let them throw their magic around while you sit back and watch them dance to the tune you haven't even started playing yet. That's what I mean. Let them think they're in control, then take it away from them, piece by piece, attacking the Mind behind the Magic. Like, they're throwing Killing Curses around wildly and any one of them hitting you would kill you instantly, but what does that matter when you're three rooms away and about to open a trapdoor beneath their feet so they fall into a pit of spikes that aren't far enough to kill them and will just debilitate, leaving them stuck there and unable to move while they slowly bleed out?

** Luna aces it because she's made peace with the fact that she has problems, and the town really doesn't have that much to latch onto.

**** Yeah, she gets annoyed. I said she was at peace with it, not the new Buddha.

Silent Hill really messes with people when they /deny/ their own nature. James didn't want to own up to his own personality flaws, so the town got him. Heather didn't want to be connected to the cult, so the town played up the pregnancy angle. Shattered Memories is entirely about denial of reality.

Luna, as I recall, does not at any point deny that she is different from other people. She openly acknowledges what she and her dad are printing in the magazine and she very bluntly makes comments about how she doesn't have any friends. The reson I say Silent Hill has nothing to latch onto is because for most of her school life it would have metaphorically told her "you're alone" and she would have replied "Yeah, I know. Big deal"
