Found an author who deserves more attention? Maybe a few fics that deserve to be up there with the greats (depending on your opinion on what great is). Present anything (NSFW for this reason), I'm not just asking for myself but for the whole community.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). An expansive, well done AU. [[/u/ihateseatbelts]] definitely deserves more recognition.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

*** I think that a sequel would ruin it. Or if they did a sequel it would have to focus on [[/spoiler][the newly resurrected Natasha]]. And them facing the reality of what Harry did. Maybe eventually meeting Harry and [[/spoiler][Natasha]] confronting Harry about everything he did, and Harry being confused, [[/spoiler][Harry going all "I did this for you"]].

Basically the main focus shouldn't be on Harry.

***** Yeah, maybe they realise that they need Harry's power to take on Voldemort, so they find [[/spoiler][Natasha]] and use them to influence Harry and that's when they have their confrontation. Hell maybe they are starting to Win, Harry is inflicting heavy losses on Voldemort's forces so they allow him to meet [[/spoiler][Natasha]] as a reward. They have their confrontation and Harry starts to question himself, his, already limited, sanity starts to slip away. Harry is less effective in combating Death Eaters, the Ministry is taking more losses cause Harry is off his game. So they try to force [[/spoiler][Natahsa]] into taking back the fact that they don't like what Harry did, so that Harry will be back on Death Eater killing peak. That way the story has cool bad-ass Harry killing Death Eaters. As well as a desperate Ministry willing to do anything, and also a moral sub-plot with [[/spoiler][Natasha]] trying to decide if the ends justified the means, while Harry has the same sort of moral conundrum. But I really think that to end this story Harry would have to die. He did horrible things in Too Young to Die, and he [[/spoiler][faced justice in the end, being put in Azkaban]]. But then in the sequel it gets glossed over and he's put to use and kinda forgiven because he's useful. So he would have to die to appropriately be "punished & redeemed".

Still could work really well, and now I kinda want to read it.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** *Children's Crusade* and *The Dark Lord Never Died* are two really wonderful fics, but have very few favorites. I suspect having Ron and Hermione as main characters caused that.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** I've not read /Children's Crusade/, but /The Dark Lord Never Died/ was excellent and only recently finished. It's one of the few stories where I genuinely got excited when I saw an update notification, rather than going 'oh, that's neat I guess'.
