my internet will be out for a few days next week adn i was wondering if there was a way to download all my stuff without having the bot link it


** AO3 has a download option. There are a few sites for FF. I use Ffnet-downloader.fr as it let's you download fics as PDF files.

**** Wait, what? Why would you need to type up fics? Even if the downloader weren't a thing, there's still copy and paste>>Save as PDF and then Dropbox. Et voila.

***** 10 years ago, when I had to go to my grandparents home for summer, I spent 2 or 3 days beforehand just copying and pasting chapters and chapters in .txt files.

That's when I decided to make a website which allows you to download a fanfiction in one go.

The advantage of using a website? You download the whole fanfiction in one go. Second advantage. Just provide your profiles link, and it will download ALL your favorites to your pc.

Isn't that easier? [[http://ffnet-downloader.fr/#/][ffnet-downloader]]

****** That's like a superhero origin story! I don't do much on FF.net besides upload my work, so I didn't realize that text copying was blocked. Most excellent.

****** Well there you go! I just saw that text can't be selected on FF.net. What a pisser! I guess to prevent pirating? As an author, when I go to the story manager there's a "download" option and I can select the text on there, but as a reader there is indeed no such option. I know on AO3 there are links to DL stories in ePub and Mobi format.

******* Most likely, and I can't blame them. For the most part, there isn't much reason for a reader on FF.net to copy and paste things on the website. Sure, there are writers who adopt stories - and then there's us who want to read offline, but I'm fairly sure FF.nrt disregards that, believing viewers will be fine with the minor inconvenience.

******* There are addons for Chrome that let you select the text.

I do so surprisingly often - generally, when something looks like a reference that I am missing, or the author recommends fics in the endnotes.

******** I'm on a Mac and don't use Chrome, but it's good to know. I do most of my reading on AO3, but I haven't downloaded anything for offline as I usually have at least my phone with me.

******* If anyone wants to get around this on Firefox, put the following on your [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserContent.css][userContent.css]] file in the profile folder:
