  Hey, everyone - as I said in the title, I posted about an idea I had for a story, and mentioned a couple of my ideas and stuff. I got some pretty great feedback and suggestions, and in some quiet moments I've drafted up what I would see as the first scene. If you're interested, let me know what you think!
#+end_quote

/Harry Potter and the Master of Death/

“Hey, Potter, wake up!”

Auror-Lieutenant Newark's sharp shout pulls me back to the land of the living, the slightly-too-high, reedy tones of his voice cutting through the quiet of my office.

“What?” I half-grunt in response, looking up from my lap -- I wasn't asleep, by the way -- and staring at the unwelcome guest stood in the doorway. Newark seems to think that the best way to offset the total lack of intimidation his physical presence brings is to obsess to an alarming degree over his uniform. His crimson robes are so immaculate they look like they've just come out of the box, and his shoes are shined so thoroughly that I reckon if you looked, you'd be able to see the colour of your eyes in the leather.

I've tried to sneak a peek a couple times to see if it was true, but I've not managed yet. For some reason Newark never wants me out of his sight on the rare occasions we occupy the same space.

Despite already frowning so severely that his beady blue eyes are little more than tiny malicious slits on his face, his brow somehow manages to deepen. Another half-inch downward and I think his nose would be in danger of being split down the middle. But he knows he'll never get respect from me, and for as long as he's stuck at Lieutenant, I'll do my best to make his lack of seniority abundantly clear.

“Captain wants to see you,” he snaps, spinning on an immaculately-shined heel and stomping out like the irritating pubescent pain-in-the-arse he is.

“You could've just sent a memo,” I hiss to his back as I take my feet off my desk and stand up to follow, scratching the rough grey-flecked stubble that covers my jaw. I'm not even lying this time -- the only reason I can think of for him coming to check on me personally was because he wanted to see if I'd died or retired yet. Either that or he cares about my wellbeing.

I suppress a shudder at the latter prospect as I close the creaky door to my office behind me and head through the narrow corridor towards the lobby.

The walk through the Ministry of Magic -- the centre of all of Britain's magical society and government -- has long since lost its appeal to me. Wizarding architecture is kind of like whatever products those big American corporations make and sell to everyone -- something new, colourful, wondrous in its presentation and marketed intimately enough to blow little barely-teenage Harry Potter's mind. Problem is, once you've been around it for /just/ long enough, the veneer of hope and grandiosity falls off like the twigs on an old Comet Two-Sixty, and instead you see it for what it really is: a soulless, empty thing, filled to the brim with people under the collective delusion that they're better than everyone else, and that their tacky statues, made of pure gold or no, actually symbolise anything other than the wasteful self-aggrandising bullshit that wizards seem to have instead of common sense.

Once, my mere presence would part the crowd ahead like Moses and the Red Sea, my silver Auror badge pinned proudly on my chest, but that time has passed. Nowadays I go plainclothes -- muggle, not the robes that the Purebloods still swear by -- my badge pinned inside my jacket over my heart.

Harry Potter is old news, now.

After an unpleasant minute-and-a-half of working my way through the heaving press of bodies in the lobby that seem to occupy the Ministry from dawn till dusk I manage to make it to the elevators and from there up to the floor I'm ostensibly employed on -- at the Auror Office.

Of course, I'm not an idiot. No, I got all my idiot out of me when I got killed for the second time, or if not then, then after the divorce for sure. I knew what being assigned to the aptly-named /Pertinent Investigations Office/ meant even as I shook then-Captain Robards' hand and pretended I didn't see the victory in his dark eyes. I knew what it meant when I left that smug twat's office to find the collected contents of my cubicle already packed up into a shoebox, ready to accompany me down to the windowless den that constitutes the Auror Office's official dumping ground for the select few unwanted employees who were slightly too competent or scandal-free to fire.

Pertinent Investigations, my arse.

My name -- if you haven't worked it out already, and if that's the case, I wonder how wonderful and carefree the world is for you, where all the grisly details slip you by? -- is Harry James Potter. Boy-Who-Lived, veteran Auror, now head of the PIO. That I'm now the sole officer of the PIO is, apparently, lost on most of the wizarding public, but then again these are the very same people who thought Gilderoy Lockhart was /legit/.

My trek through the Auror Office is less clandestine, unprotected by the anonymity the usual melee in the lobby provides. Here, my legend still carries a bit of weight, for better or worse. I catch a nod or two from some of the old guard, a timid glance from a nervous-looking rookie, and the usual muttering that I've never been free of since I was announced to the wizarding world at the ripe young age of eleven.

The door to the Captain's office is supposed to be intimidating in its professional austerity: dark wood, polished to a mirror sheen with a golden knocker in the shape of the wand-and-shield logo of the Aurors. Of course, for me this office -- and nearly every one of its successive occupants since I first joined the Ministry -- has only held my contempt, rather than fear or awe. If the main Ministry building is like the false front, the dry-cleaners that helps move the cash, then the Auror-Captain's office is the smoky backroom, populated with alcohol-soaked poker players and skinheads in dark glasses.

When I first learned the truth of the place, young and idealistic and stupid at that age, I was outraged. Outraged and appalled and disgusted and every other possible sickening feeling at once.

But now I'm here, outside Auror-Captain Fudge's -- yes, of /that/ Fudge family -- office, and the outrage is no more than a twinge somewhere in my stomach. Either that or the sandwich I ate earlier has disagreed with me.

Now that I think of it, it did taste a bit funny.

A giggle jumps in my throat before I crush it down, determined not to give an inch of ground to the sweaty bureaucrat in the room ahead of me. I open the door and stride in, turning my features blank as I approach his ornate mahogany desk.

“You wanted to speak to me, sir?” I ask with only the slightest hint of boredom, a tone perfected through careful and consistent application.

“Ah, Potter, yes,” Fudge replies. Artemis Cornelius Fudge is very clearly his father's son: short of stature, with a blustery temperament, watery eyes and a hairline that looks like it's trying to retreat as though his forehead isn't far enough away to prevent it being swallowed up by his prominent, flabby jowls. He seems to have inherited his father's dislike for me, too -- either that or (perhaps this is more likely, as Artemis has about as much of a chance of having an original thought as your average Garden Gnome) he's been /persuaded/ to accept someone else's point of view.

That the ‘someone else' involved likely has a /lot/ of money and not enough things to spend it on is entirely unrelated, I'm sure.

“Well, don't just stand there, man, take a seat!” he commands, but it is his voice that first throws me from the mild disinterest I held when I came in.

He's being /friendly/.

Oh no, this can't be good.

“Busy morning, eh, Potter?” he asks.

“Sir?” I'm growing steadily more confused by the second.

If Fudge is tripped up at all by my lack of response, he recovers very quickly. “Well, you're probably wondering why I called you here -- I'm sorry to say that it wasn't to catch up.”

Now I /know/ he's bullshitting me.

“No,” he says more to himself than to me. “You've got a case, Potter.”

“What do you mean, a case, sir?” I hope I don't sound as gormless as I think I do. “It's just -- I've got several open ones in progress already with the PIO.”

“I'm afraid this is rather important, Potter, and time-sensitive. Your other cases will have to be shelved for the time being.” Fudge waves away my statements and presses on, although his eyes are a mite sharper now. “There's been a murder, you see,” he says, “nasty business indeed.”

A murder? What?

“I mean no disrespect, sir,” -- in truth I'm quite certain I don't care either way -- “but shouldn't your office be pursuing this instead of the PIO? Why me? I haven't done homicide field work in years.”

He smiles falsely at me. “You're a skilled investigator, Potter.”

I wonder how much it hurt to say that with a straight face. Resisting the urge to grin -- and maybe laugh at the man across from me -- I stay still and cock my head slightly, subtly gesturing for him to continue.

“With the Minister's trip to the Americas it's been all-hands-on-deck here, and you've got the experience and enough time to see this done. We've been keeping it under wraps for the moment, but it might not be for long. The /Prophet's/ been sniffing around, you see -- they've been after the administration for a little while now, like a Niffler after Galleons,” Fudge finishes, watching me carefully.

“What do they want?” I ask.

Fudge fidgets with the collar of his robes. “Well, a story, of course,” he deflects. “Some of their reporters have been quite busy lately, and -- I'm sure you'll agree -- that we could do without any... /provocation/ that this incident might cause.”

“Provocation, sir?” I press.

“This needs to be handled, Potter, and with no small amount of discretion. Your record speaks for itself, and with any other likely candidates away in the Minister's entourage or working overtime here I'm not surprised that the Committee felt you were the best man for the job.”

Obviously, he doesn't realise that he's just given me more information with that last statement than in the whole time I've been in his office. In ensuring my compliance by bringing in that one, single word, he's just told me who's aiming at the target on my back.

The Wizengamot High Committee.

My stomach swoops and I clench my fists tight in my lap. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to /The Fall of Harry Potter/ -- and I'm centre stage. But I don't have a choice, other than resign right now, and even as my fingers twitch towards my coat to pull out my badge, something stops me.

Perhaps it's the slight glint of triumph in Fudge's eyes, knowing he's got me cornered good and proper. I don't doubt that I might be a good choice for this investigation, but the only one? No, that's impossible even with my bad luck.

Perhaps it's the vision of Chief Justice Theodore Nott's face when he hears that he's finally driven me out that swims before my eyes for a second.

Perhaps it's just my old stubbornness coming back, and not wanting any of them to know they've beaten me.

So, I do the only thing I can.

“What're the details, sir?” I ask, pulling out my notebook as Fudge pulls open a drawer and removes a thin file of parchment, sliding it over the desk towards me.


** I like the start you've got here. I like how you set up little tidbits to be expanded upon later such as the divorce. I am very interested to learn how Harry ended up in the PIO. I do find myself wondering if Harry's basement office comes with a red stapler... :D I especially liked the interaction and dialog between Harry and Fudge. I felt it had a nice flow and seemed natural. I'm definitely looking forward to more of the story and learning how Harry ended up in this situation.

Below are specific thoughts on specific things.

#+end_quote

Two things here. The "I wasn't asleep, by the way" is distracting. You're already speaking in the first-person, so I feel that's a bit of unnecessary fourth wall breaking there. I think there's a more creative way you can work in Harry's denial of being asleep at his desk. The second thing--you are doing first-person present-tense, which I adore, but you need to watch your tenses. "unwelcome guest stood" should be "unwelcome guest standing".

#+begin_quote
  Despite already frowning so severely that his beady blue eyes are little more than tiny malicious slits on his face, his brow somehow manages to deepen.
#+end_quote

This description is distracting. Brows down deepen in and of themselves and trying to visualize such a thing just takes me out of the story. I think just changing "brow" to "frown" would fix this easily and get your point across.

#+begin_quote
  “Captain wants to see you,” he snaps, spinning on an immaculately-shined heel and stomping out like the irritating pubescent pain-in-the-arse he is.
#+end_quote

The use of "pubescent" here is odd. Is this person young? He's a lieutenant, so maybe not? If he is young, then there's an opportunity to indicate that in earlier passages. Maybe describe him as having spots or pimples or maybe he has like one really bad one at the corner of his mouth that Harry fixates on. If that's not the case, then get rid of "pubescent". "Irritating pain in the arse" stands well enough on its own.

What? This is too long and by the time I get to the end of sentence, I've lost the thread of what you're trying to say here. I like the first part, "Problem is, once you've been around it for just long enough, the veneer of hope and grandiosity falls off like the twigs on an old Comet Two-Sixty." This is a great visual. You can move on to, "Instead you see it for what it really is: a soulless, empty thing, filled to the brim with people under the collective delusion that they're better than everyone else." He's walking through the Ministry at this point and here's an opportunity to help set the scene with a tacky statue. "I move past one of the innumerable statues that dot the floor. A wizard holds a huge book in one hand, his wand pointing up to the sky and as always, I roll my eyes when I see it. It doesn't matter if it's made of pure gold or not, it's still tacky as hell."

#+begin_quote

This is /fantastic/. This is our first hint that Harry hasn't given up, that he still believes in the core values and mission of the Aurors.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Style nitpick--I don't believe this is hyphenated.

#+begin_quote
  since I was announced to the wizarding world at the ripe young age of eleven.
#+end_quote

I understand what you're going for by the use of "ripe", but it's distracting because it's not a usual way of phrasing this sort of thing and I found that it tripped me up and took me out of the story. I would replace "ripe" with "tender" here to keep the reader reading instead of wondering if you meant to use that word.

Again, I think you've got a very good start, I love the first-person present-tense as it really lends itself to the noir detective style. I like the dangle of the press being interested in the case and the Wizengamot looking to hang Harry out to dry.

*** Thanks for all the in-depth feedback!

I definitely read you on the tenses - I thought I'd managed to get all of them (I'd originally written in past tense) but thanks for spotting it, and I'll look into better ways to illustrate a lot of the facts I'm throwing around, rather than have Harry telling the reader outright.

I do suffer from rambling, run-on sentences, so thanks a lot for pointing that out, and offering what's actually a better version!

It also appears I got Boy-Who-Lived confused with You-Know-Who formatting, and hyphenated when it actually isn't like that in canon. Although I like the way it looks when hyphenated, I'll change it to fit properly.

Yeah, I tend to have quite a bizarre vocabulary at times, and it's important that people pick me up on my bullshit or it's gonna go unnoticed, so thanks for that, I'll look into better phrasing.

Again, thanks for reading it through so thoroughly and picking out changes and mistakes, and for the positive feedback too! As an extremely novice writer it really does mean a lot to me to have people say that what I'm doing is pretty good. I'll likely continue drafting this in my spare time - in my current work I top off chapters at about 3,000 words give or take a few hundred, but for this story I was definitely leaning towards much longer chapters broken into large sections, /or/, conversely, shorter chapters taking place over specific scenes, conversations or sequences /a la Dresden Files./

**** Regarding tenses--I've done the same thing with starting out in past tense and then converting, so I totally get that. As for run-ons, I find that reading things out loud helps a lot. I tend to have everything straight in my head, so it seems fine, but then I read it out loud and I'm like, "Wait, what?" Don't forget to include action and reaction in your dialog passages. You want to watch out for talking head situations. People sigh, shift around, frown, lean forward, lean back, tap fingers, jiggle legs ... all sorts of things that can give the reader clues to the character's mental state.

Definitely looking forward to what's in store!

I thoroughly concur.

Seriously though, thanks for the positive feedback. I was really worried that I wasn't capturing the aesthetic correctly - I've not read many noir stories or seen many classics in film, so it's really good to hear that I'm close to the mark.
