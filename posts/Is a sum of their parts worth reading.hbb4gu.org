*** What's worthwhile about it? How does it distinguish itself? What are its strengths as a story?

** Yes, I didn't read for a long time because of how short it is. But it tells the story it wants to tell, and then ends. It is a very well done version of the Dark Lord Potter genre, maybe the most realistic depiction in fandom. The reason Sum of their Parts is so good is that it's the only Dark Lord Potter story that has a Dark Trio, and keeps their personalities intact. Besides Harry dark lord name is “The Fiendfyre Lord.”

** Oh, definitely, one of the best and more believable dark!Harry fanfics I've ever read right beside too young to die even though they have different end-games. Fair warning though, It won't have a super-complex magic-system or on-the-nose explanations for how magic works.
