Stuff like /The Seventh Horcrux/ or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order][Dear Order]]/ or even /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1604214/1/Flying-Without-A-Broom][Flying without a Broom]]/ - I don't really care how much it qualifies as insanity as long as Harry isn't exactly in his right mind, he's having fun, and its well written.


** linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) and its sequel are masterpieces of ligt-hearted loony fun.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
