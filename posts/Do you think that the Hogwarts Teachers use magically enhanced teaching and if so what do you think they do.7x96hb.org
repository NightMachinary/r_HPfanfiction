Like do they use magical items like a magical quill(like the quick quotes quill) that is connected to them so it can access there knowledge that marks assignments for them( because others wise they would be marking at least 280 assignments per week even if they only gave each student one a week)

Do they project information into the area around them as they teach so that students pick up the information easier?

Does hogwarts itself help students learn because over the thousand years its purpose as a place of learning has sunk magicaly into every stone.

How do you think the teachers in the magical world use magic to enhance there teaching?


** The issue as far as Hogwarts is concerned is straight up teacher â€˜contact' hours.

Assuming a rather low 4 hours per class per week in Y1/2 and 3 per in Y3 onwards, with 2-House classes in years 1-5 for the core4 subjects and 4-House classes for the OWL electives and all NEWT classes, the core4 teachers (who also happen to be Heads of House AND patrol at night AND have lesson prep/grading) would each have 38 hours just in class time.

*** It would be quite a bit more for some. Let's take Lupin for example. Harry had class with him with no other houses. It was solely Gryffindor. Let's assume that there's 3 hours per class per week. For third year /alone,/ Lupin would have been teaching 12 hours. That's 4 houses, 3 hours a week, equals 12 total hours. For third year alone.

Multiply 12 hours by 5 (for years 1-5) and you get a crazy *60 hours a week* for the first 5 years alone. Count in 6 and 7 years and it goes higher. But if we want to make it 4 hours a week per class (which I personally don't find rather low; in fact it's more than my average college class) for the first two years, then it's 68 hours a week for years 1-5.

I also believe Transfiguration is taken with only one house class, so McGonagall would be looking at 60+ hours of instructing time a week too.

Now, if we made each class only 2 hours per week, perhaps one hour long classes twice a week, it would leave people like Lupin and McGonagall with 40 hours a week for years 1-5. But you'd still have to put in years 6 and 7 (many of which, in my opinion, would still be taking Transfiguration and Defense). And then there's McGonagall's duties as Head of House /and/ Deputy Headmistress.

No wonder she doesn't have time for Harry's shit.

**** I doubt they use any magic. The only magic they could use to fit everything in their schedule would be if it involved messing with time.

** I read a story before where Harry, I think, gets the idea of making Squibs read books get those memories into prophecy spheres... Thus the wizarding world's equivalent of audiotapes is born. For some reason, I seem to recall that Lockhart was involved in this. But I could be mixing up stuff.
