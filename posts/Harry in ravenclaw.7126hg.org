  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** linkffn(11496914) first time I used this bot, hope it werkz. this version of Harry took some getting used to, but it was consistent. didn't like some of the betrothal stuff towards the end, but all in all I liked this story and its sequels.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

** If you can get past the first chapter's cliche about heir to dead vaults and other nonsense, linkffn(The Price is Right by Hi Pot and News) is a really fun read.

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) is probably the best ravenclaw and genius!harry fic out there. Great plot and amazing characterization with a serious amount if depth.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
