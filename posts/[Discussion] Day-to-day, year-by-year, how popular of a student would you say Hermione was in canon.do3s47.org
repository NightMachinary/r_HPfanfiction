** Hermione? Not very. She's got an annoying personality - the fact that she has more knowledge than most of her peers makes here think she is smart, and thus right in every situation. It's not how it works, and it annoys the hell out of most people (i know, i used to do that, altough more for shit and giggles than to prove i'm right), especially with situations like in book 3 with that rabbit or scabbers supposedly being eaten. Or the house-elves.

Ron on the other hand should be fairly accepted - he's a chill bloke for the most part, well-versed in the culture so he can connect and talk with people over sports and somesuch - apart from year 5 and the whole 'is Voldemort really back' debacle noone would really have anything to hold against him.

Fred and George are more creative and smart than Hermione, but they don't flaunt it and they don't care for grades at all! Hell, the Marauders have them beat, too (them together with Hermione would probably not hold a candle to James, Sirius, Remus and even Peter!)

I am not saying she is stupid (far from it), but reading ahead and knowing a lot of mindless trivia doesn't make you a genius or something like that!

** - Hermione: Unpopular, would be considered an insufferable know-it-all by most people outside of Gryffindor. Without Harry and Ron and the troll incident, she would have had no friends at all. She's socially awkward, doesn't understand or care about social cues when she wants to prove a point, and has no charisma. Would not vote Hermione as Minster for Magic.

    "Er," said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. "Well---er---hi."

    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.

    "Well... erm... well, you know why you're here. Erm... well, Harry here had the idea---I mean" (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) "I had the idea---that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts---and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us..."

Has no friends outside of Harry and Ron, for good reason.

    "I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?" asked Parvati.

    It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

    "Not really," said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. "I've never really liked horses."

    "He's not a horse, he's a centaur!" said Lavender, sounding shocked.

    "Either way, he's still got four legs," said Hermione coolly.

- Ron: Marginally popular. Has a reputation from a well-connected family; everyone knows the Weasleys from their "red hair and hand-me-down robes". Has the accomplishments of his older brothers, even if it makes Ron insecure about it. Earns popularity in his own right after joining the quidditch team and people start unironically singing the "Weasley is Our King" song.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders.

    "Weasley is our King,

    Weasley is our King,

    He didn't let the Quaffle in,

    Weasley is our King..."

    They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight.

**** I think this is taken a bit out of context. Lavender is talking about how dreamy Firenze is and how that's a valid reason to regret not taking divination. I don't think it's unreasonable to not be swooning over a different species, and it still isn't a valid reason to take a course. It comes across as a bit racist because there isn't human level intelligence in any other species in the real world, so we just don't have an analog aside from race. Plus, I'm pretty sure Hermione is just making fun of her without vitriol towards Firenze.

**** Harry and Ron are friends with Seamus and Dean from the beginning of Book 1, and Neville later on. Hermione never makes friends with the girls in her dorm, from Book 1 to 6.

Harry's first quidditch game:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are always the ones who get nobbled by the other team."

  "Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.

  As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath.

Meanwhile, Hermione's roomies gossip about her.

#+begin_quote
  "So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends."

  Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Hallowe'en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' toilets and wanted to be left alone.

And in Book 3 she acts like a dick about Lavender's baby rabbit dying.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then--- "Was Binky an old rabbit?"

  "N-no!" sobbed Lavender. "H-he was only a baby!"

  Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.

  "But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.

  Parvati glared at her.

  "Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he, Lavender just got the news today---" Lavender wailed loudly "---and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock---"

  "Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think other people's pets matter very much."

******* Very true. This is why I hate the "Badass Hermione" trope, because it's pure fanon and erases Hermione's character flaws within the trio's team dynamic. Hermione is a bookworm, Ron has the street smarts and social connections, and Harry is the action hero "saving people" guy of the trio. There's a reason why Hermione wanted Harry to teach DADA, instead of taking over the job herself.

During the battle in the muggle cafe in DH, Hermione was so nervous fighting Death Eaters that she accidentally cut open Ron's leg.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.

  "D---Diffindo," she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. "Oh, I'm so sorry, Ron, my hand's shaking! Diffindo!"
#+end_quote

JKR's writing is great because of the Trio's dynamic. They fight and struggle as friends, but they're always better off and stronger working together. So many fanfic authors don't get that, and make Badass Goddess Hermione into a character who doesn't need Ron or Harry to get the job done. And that kind of misses the point of the whole story.

*** I would note that Hermione can be rather sharp with some social cues - much more so than Harry and Ron in interpreting /why/ people act the way they do or sore subjects. Examples that come to mind there include her knowing why Ron was jealous in book 4, and with Neville/the Unforgivables in the same book (being the one to prompt fake Moody to stop using /Crucio/ on the spider because of Neville, being the one to take the initiative to go talk to him afterwards while both Harry and Ron are completely confused). She's also much more perceptive of Cho's feelings in book 5 as another example.

That's not to say she'd be popular, but she's more socially apt than usually discussed. As for her reputation it probably depends on the year - after Dumbledore's Army I doubt she'd be considered by those other members as too much of a know-it-all, at least in the negative sense. In terms of friends, I think it's also not quite fair to use a single section of first year to generalize to say that without Ron/Harry she'd never have gotten any friends the whole time.

For Ron, I'd bump up from marginally popular to rather charismatic and able to fit into groups. Of the trio, he'd be the one that I'd see able to insert himself into any of the friends groups with no big issue - shown by how easily he slotted into Dean/Seamus' group in 4th year during his spat with Harry. Sure, he gets more popularity later on with Quidditch, but I'd see him as the most generally popular of the 3 in their grade.

For students, I think the Gryffindors like her but don't actually want to interact with her. They probably love the points she earns for the house cup. As for the rest of the school (-teachers), I think honestly it probably depends on how popular Harry is at the time, for example:

The Boy who lived is Lying? lets go harass his friends.

Hermione is Best friends with the Chosen One? She might know how to get in his heart.

I do think she was mostly tolerated in the books, but there's a few moments when the Ravenclaws admire her. On the other hand, people aren't happy with her "know-it-all" attitude as seen in book 3.
