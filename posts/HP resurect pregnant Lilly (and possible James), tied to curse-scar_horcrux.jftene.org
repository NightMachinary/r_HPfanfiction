:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry resurect a pregnant (with twins?) Lilly - and possible James.\\
Their life-force had somehow been connected to the horcrux/Harry's scar, so when it's destroyed - either by Voldemort "killing" Harry during the battle, or earlier by Harry getting cleansed in some way - they all die. Harry is informed about this - in limbo or by someone (house-elf?) - and opts to travel back in time (or something), to a time when Lilly and his siblings can still be resurected. Also interested in other stories where HP resurects one or both parents.

Edit: It's possible that it was the dementors in PoA sucking away the horcrux that broke the connection.


** I like “Blood Binding by SphinxScribe” linkffn(10382653), which is post-GoF, and no time travel is involved.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
