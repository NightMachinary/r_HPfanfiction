I'm asking this because I'm genuinely not sure. In fanfics, I see OP!Harry with 15 familiars at the same time and stuff, but I don't remember the term familiar in the books.I don't think Filch and Mrs. Norris are familiars, or at least expressly called out as such at any point canonically.

​

So, do you know if familiars are canon or not? Thanks in advance!


** No such thing in canon. Wizards have pets, just like normal people. No special powers, connections, or anything else.

*** Can confirm. Just used [[https://www.potter-search.com][this search site]] to check every single time the word “familiar” shows up and not once is it used as a noun. “Familiars” doesn't show up at all.

I'm guessing that it's similar to wards, which show up a lot in fanon, but “protective enchantments” are the closest we get in canon.

*** I mean, there are Kneazles that appear to be far more intelligent than average cats and the owls are equally enhanced, but there's no sort of "help the wizard with his magic."

**** Kneazles are straight-up magical creatures.

The less time we spend trying to figure out how the fuck owls work, the better.

*** It's one of the things I stop reading over. So often it just ends up this cutesy OC that gets forgotten when they could actually help with the plot, or, conversely, is in the way of the human interactions.

*** It's one of the tropes that is a red flag to me. It's not a problem in and of itself, but often accompanies shit writing for whatever reason.

**** I hate it when the Familiar successfully and luckily overhears the ENTIRE PLAN of the Heros antagonist/s and repots it back to its master it's such lazy writing

***** Oh God, that's awful. I prefer the handling where they are clever pets, maybe hissing at the antagonist at most.

** They are not. Rowling has actually gone on record to say that wizards and witches do not have [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/familiars][familiars]].

*** Making a note of that. For now it's just a simple fact: I'll decide later whether it goes under "from the horse's mouth" or "ridiculous things in canon" (yes, those are actual categories in my notes).

** For some reason I remember the original Pottermore blurb from back in 2011 mentioning that familiars were a thing, whether or not you'd consider that canon, but I guess I was wrong. Checking the archive shows that JK specifically said they weren't a thing, even though Mrs. Norris was the closest thing in canon to being a familiar.

** They dont seem to exist in canon. The closest seems to be the patronus.
