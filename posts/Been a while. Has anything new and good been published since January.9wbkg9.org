**** The dogfather by hollimichele is that rare fanfic that captures the tone of childhood extremely well. The children are recognisably childlike and dialogue is done well. So many fanfics starting from first year have everyone acting like a mini adult or a teenager, but not this fic.

#+begin_quote
  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

*** +That's pretty much NOT how you should self-promote, yikes.+

+Popular fics usually are popular BECAUSE they're good. I agree with the other commenter, maybe link your own stuff for people to check out instead of making assumptions and passive-aggressive swipes at stuff people enjoy? Or don't say anything at all, if you can't bother being nice..+

EDIT: As you didn't mean it that way, I wanted to edit my comment to reflect that! It sounded shitty at first, but we've ALL been misunderstood online sometimes.

I was creepy and dug through your profile til I found you on ff.n and looked at one of your stories - I thought it was weirdly heartbreaking, and very good! I'm StrawberryShortcat on ff.n, and I would have reviewed from my account, but no one can log in to their accounts right now for some reason :/ Anyway, don't let the crappy people get to you.

*** Maybe you should link your fics, rather than making such a quick assumption about OP.

**** Yeah, who gives a shit about â€˜popular' fanfiction, anyways? I might search by most favorites, but that's because favorites are typically a decent indication of /good/.
