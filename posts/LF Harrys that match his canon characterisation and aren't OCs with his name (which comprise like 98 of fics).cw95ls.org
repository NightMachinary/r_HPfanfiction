Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) I'm hesitant to say this features canon!Harry bc that might just be my liking for the fic clouding my judgement, but have it anyway

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

** Anything by Northumbrian. They are fantastic mostly canon compliant post war stories. Fair warning, many of them are not finished.

** The simple fact is that if you are reading fanfiction, Harry will be OC. Maybe, because people remember differently, or due to different experiences. Even the most canon compliant Harry will still have a few OC moments. Basically if you don't want an OC Harry, read the books, fanfiction is all about experimenting with new, and interesting ideas, or maybe just a stomp fic, it doesn't matter.
