linkffn(10629488) Im looking for similar Dark Arts fics like this, that dont feel too AU (in terms of characterization) and don't fall into too many common tropes. I'd prefer long and gen fics, and the less bad tropes the better.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** It's a fun read, but I'm going to disagree - it's markedly different from Blood Crest and unabashedly AU. It's also not particularly heavy on the Dark Arts.

I'd recommend it in general, but not for someone specifically looking for something like Blood Crest.

I guess if the focus is the dark arts theory (which is what they ask for) but both fics have a lot of similar world building around diagon alley and harry making friends/contacts outside of hogwarts.

** Blood Crest is so good. One of the most fun I've read in a long time. I can't wait for badass necromancer Harry.
