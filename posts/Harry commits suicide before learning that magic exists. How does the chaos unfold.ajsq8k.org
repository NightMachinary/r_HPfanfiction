** Well that's 1 horcrux down so probably Dumbledore just goes ahead and hunts the rest of them

Also, an 11 year old killing himself is like the saddest thing I can think of. Are you okay OP?

*** I mean, said kid was kept in a closet, underfed, abused at least emotionally (and physically by his cousin and his friends), prone to cause unexplained things to happen that almost always went against him in the long run... if any 11 year old was gunna commit suicide, or at least try, Harry Potter would be it.

** The Ministry covers it up successfully since Harry was well hidden anyway. His life/death remains a mystery to Wizarding society as a whole. And the adults in the know have to act like adults instead of expecting a teenager to save the world.

*** I'd like to read that! Frankly as much as I like reading HP, I hate the incompetent adults (and I don't agree that you need them to write young adult fiction! Seriously, people can be competent and still make mistakes (not seeing stuff that a teenager might see or hear just because he is there and wasn't noticed and being unable to convince an adult doesn't make them incompetent (as long as they are truly competent otherwise, like say noticing the abuse Harry suffered and putting their foot down - "No, Albus! He's not going back there! If I have to I will resign and take him in myself! I'll even use the media against you, if need be! Oh - and don't think about obliviating me, I've told some others already!" (note: That is something a competent McGonagall could have said and done!))! It is a bad trope!

ps: I also hate it when characters (who were probably not even invented at that time) look kind of bad because they never did anything in the past! IMHO if writing a series you should really think up your full cast beforehand and give them excuses for not being part of the story from the start (So, the coward - Remus Lupin - needs an excuse for not ever looking for and visiting Harry!)...you also should have your story arc down (no sudden Deus Ex Machina (Deathly Hollows) or other things ('cruxes!))

** malfoy and his ilk would most likely put the blame on muggle(not without reason), which would probably make people dislike muggles even more and when voldemort got the stone he would come back in a stronger position then when he originally did. dumbledore would probably never learn about the horcuxes or at least have definitive proof of them, due to never learning about the diary so would never look for them meaning voldemort would remain immortal and eventually kill dumbledore and subjugate wizarding britian. he would probably conquer the world due to him having two forms of immortality.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** While it doesn't have Harry committing suicide before learning about magic, I'd still like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones][Digging for the Bones]]. Someone in Harry's year dies (not suicide) and it causes a big ripple effect on Hogwarts. Both Harry and someone else try to kill themselves later on, and it's a very beautifully written story.

** Isn't Voldemort Harry's horcrux as much as Harry is Voldemort's horcrux? Neither can die except by the hand of the other.

Harry would become a horcrux ghost.

That or Harry's spirit would be the one that dies. Then his body would rise as the piece of Voldemort takes control. Then the Durlseys have literally Voldemort living in their house.

**** Harry's forehead scar is a horcrux. Personally I like to believe that it's a co-horcrux and works both ways. Vodemort can't die as long as it exists but neither can Harry.

Hrm, come to think of it that would be a 3rd option. Harry hangs himself only to discover that he just won't die and instead keeps reviving just like a Highlander immortal. A tough lesson since he would hang there until someone gets him down.

***** It's dark but I really like the idea. The boy who found out he is, for some reason, immortal. That's gotta be a shocker (and an excellent set up for a horror/thriller take on the story).

****** linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) is a decent take on this idea, although he's killed by a wizard in his first death so discovering magic is not a large part of the story.

***** Hm...wouldn't that lead to a pre-teen who has nothing to lose (if he attempted suicide he does think so at least!) using that fact (note: Would that turn him into a wraith after he kills his body or would he simply wake up later (or would he simply not die)?) and doing all sorts of crazy things? Seriously, if I found out that I couldn't die? You bet I'd try a lot of crazy stunts :D

ps: I also wouldn't kill the means of my immortality (fuck the prophecy and fuck the uncaring sheeple in the wiz-world! Voldy? You can have the UK!)
