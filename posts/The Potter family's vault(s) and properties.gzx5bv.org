What is your take on the Potter Family vault concept that's so popular in fanfiction? Do you think that the vault Harry had the key to in the books is the family vault? Or do you believe there's a separate family vault, and what Harry had access to was just a "trust vault"?

I mean, for a family vault the security would be somewhat lax if the only requirement is to present a key. I get that the Lestranges (the owners of the only other family vault that we get to see) would probably be a lot more paranoid about their treasures and ensure more protections on their vault, but still. Also, there is no mention of other objects stored in the Potter vault. It's an old pureblood family - it would make sense that the Potters had some heirlooms, but perhaps they stored them somewhere else than Gringotts?

That leads me to another question; the Potter family's properties. Do you think there are any left? I mean, James' parents had to live somewhere before they died, right? And even though the building was ruined in a potential attack, wouldn't the lot still belong to the family?

Concerning the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, I saw a theory where someone suggested that hiding inside a property that you owned would be a bad idea (especially if they were already hiding before the Fidelius Charm was applied to the house). Maybe the Potter cottage originally was just a safe house, and didn't actually belong to the family?

I don't know, I'm just sharing theories. What do you guys think about this?


** My headcanon is that there must be a family vault. The Potters had /stuff/. We know from canon that vaults are not just for coins, but that's all that Harry has in the vault he's seen. Where is it, if not in their vault? Dumbledore bogarted the cloak and Harry's Gringotts key, but would he have left everything else to rot in the cottage? (WAS everything they owned in the cottage? I doubt it; they were in hiding.)

** We really don't know, because we are not told. On the one hand, trust accounts especially in time of war is something rich family do. On the other hand, we really don't have any information how really rich Potters were. James probably didn't have to work (although, it could be only for limited period of time, especially in time of war), but it is clearly possible that [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potter_cottage?file=Harry_potter_23_470x350.jpg][Potters' cottage]] was only real-estate Potters' owned (Potter Manor and any other Potters' real estate is a pure piece of fanon). Perhaps it could be longer to the back, but it is clearly quite smaller than Pemberley (or Malfoy Manor as seen in films).

** I think the gold in Harry's vault was all he had, which was more than just enough to get by. I think James either hid or sold his family's home. I'm partial to the former. I'm not about to believe a spoiled and pampered child whose father made enough so that James could provide for at least 4 people grew up in a small, 2 bedroom cottage.

I have the Potters as a quietly wealthy family before the late 70s. In league with the Prewetts and Slughorns. "The right sort." No one would be burned off a tree for marrying a Potter.

With that said, I'm not at all bothered by a wealthy Harry with a stately manor.

** In terms of "being burned off the tree" I think that has more to do with the potters willingness to marry muggleborns versus purebloods as well as their more open beliefs, rather than how wealthy they are.

And while we are never really told how wealthy they are we do know that while they are not one of the sacred 28 they are an old well respected family. That tells me they are most likely fairly wealthy. And the wiki has them as very wealthy as the inventors of Skele-grow, pepper-up, and Sleekeazy's potions.

I believe that the vault Harry uses is some form of trust vault for his education etc and that there is a family vault that exists. Otherwise we would have to believe that an old well respected family doesn't have a single "family possession" other than the cloak. So not a single ring, necklace, bracelet, silverware, china, painting, furniture etc, exists in the potter family. Logically I find that hard to believe.

So for that reason I believe there is a family vault as well as multiple properties (though the state of each property is unknown).

** As far as I'm concerned:

- During his long history, the Potter family always switched between Middle Class and Upper Middle Class (generaly free from want, with some prestigious members but still far from rich), and only became a "wealthy" family thanks to Fleamont and his potions.
- Harry's vault is the only vault of his family and contain all their remaining cash.
- This vault is less deep and secure than the Lestrange one because of the difference of standing between the 2 families ("Nouveaux-riche" versus a family whose members where already rich and powerfull when they followed Guillaume the Conqueror from France)
- Fleamont and Euphemia used to live in a nice mansion in a countryside. The house was destroyed for whatever reason (let's say Voldemort attacked it when he targeted the family, and its destruction was one of the reason which convinced the Potter to use the Fidelius)
- Any family heirloom owned by the family was either taken by James (like the Invisibility Cloak), or destroyed with the house (because of the difference in history, think more "old books and goblin forged necklace rather than Dark Artifacts and Middle Age armor owned by the Lestranges).
- Godric's Hollow cottage was owned by the Potters, but seized by the Ministry after their death to use as a symbol.
- Most of the official documents owned by the family where destroyed when the first manor burnt.

Basically, I prefer it when the Statu Quo from canon is maintained (Harry has enough money to not have to work during the summer or count his coins, but got nothing else from his family).\\
It's mainly because I don't remember any fic which managed to make Harry inheritance interesting. Some make him really rich, but he never make use of it outside of a pointless "shopping trip" chapter (where he buy robe in Acromantula silk and a charmed trunk with a mansion inside), and to buy racing brooms for all the Quidditch players of Hogwarts because Draco is annoying.\\
Same for his other inheritances, most of the times it can be resumed by "Grandpa managed to will his political power and I somehow became the most powerfull politician of Britain while still going to school".

I'm more interested by the magical aspect of HP rather than the economical or political one.

*** I agree on some of your points with the exception of Fleamont and Euphemia's old house, as they both died of natural causes sometime before October 1981 and it's unlikely that James and lily, being newly married, would be living at home with James's parents, so it's likely that the Potter's had at least 2 properties. I don't see a reason for Voldemort to attack the elder potter's home if James and Lily were living elsewhere.

My personal headcanon is that the older potter's property was more like a country house (rather than full on mansion) and what family heirlooms there were are likely stored there, with the exception of the invisibility cloak which James took possession either when Fleamont died or at a younger age.
