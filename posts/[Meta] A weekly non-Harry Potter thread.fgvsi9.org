What does everyone (and the mods) think of having a weekly non-Harry Potter fanfiction recommendations thread? The non-Harry Potter stuff would all stay in one post and the post would be labeled clearly.

I'm a little burnt out on Harry Potter at the moment, but I'd love to get non-Harry Potter fanfic recommendations from everyone here. The quality of recommendations here is really high (you guys have good taste!) and the older I get the less time (and patience) I have for treading through the muck.

If everyone isn't into that no big deal. I just thought I'd float the idea.


** If you're looking for non-harry potter fanfics, you should look for a non-harry potter fanfiction subreddit..

*** I thought he meant a thread for non-harry protagonists in HP fics.

But he doesn't? Why would we do that? This is HPFanfiction, we're mostly here because we like Harry Potter and would like to read more.

** Try [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]; I don't think this would make much sense on a Harry Potter subreddit. I believe they even have a weekly recommendation thread from a cursory glance.

** If it's a thread, fine. If it's a day where posting this stuff is okay, that's a day I'd avoid coming here

**** Oh yeah, I never implied you didn't.

By the way, great job on What's her name, it's the fic I look forward to updating the most. You're one of the very very few writers that captures the delight of magic, which is amazing. There's so much "gritty" stuff out there, with training montages for days - but you capture the amazement and wonder so well!

And I really like your OC, too. Really, the best SI out there by a long shot. Scenes like Everyone dancing on a pyre, it's just sooooo good!
