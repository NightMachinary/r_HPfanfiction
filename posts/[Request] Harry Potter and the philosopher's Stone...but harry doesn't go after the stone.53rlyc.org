Same as the title, but curious if there are any good AU stories where the majority of the plot of the first HP book is the same (or he could have been in another house, doesn't matter), but Harry doesn't find out /care about what's beyond the trapdoor.

Thanks!


** “Harry the Hufflepuff” (linkffn(6466185)) has that.

*** I find it funny how it's "not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story", but seemingly the only one that's ever recommended on this subreddit...

**** I think it's supposed to mean that, rather than Harry being sorted there because of his loyalty, it's his lack of other houses' traits that makes him go there. So in a way that would be true, regardless of how often it's recommended.

But yes, it's funny, in a way. Though I know there are at least two more stories that have Harry in Hufflepuff that get recommended every so often. The two I remember are “The Worst Muggles Imaginable” and corvidae9's “Switch”; I'm not linking them because they are relatively easy to find and they don't fit the request in this post.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
