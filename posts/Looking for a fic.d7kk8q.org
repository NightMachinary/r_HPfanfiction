:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is one that Harry is put back into his younger body, but instead of doing anything serious he's basically an agent of chaos. He messes with everyone with his knowledge of the future, looks for "tax breaks", is basically James. I've been looking for a while but can't for the life of me find it. Thanks.


** It's probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]. It's a really popular time-travel fix-it fic.
