** Definitely, the story is solid and although the last chapter is not an ending that satisfies you, it is still exciting and interesting. Bk 5 and Bk 6 are incredibly good and the author does a great job of developing Harry. Trust me, you /will/ enjoy it

** Keep reading.

Yes, it is abandoned but its well worth the journey. The world building and characterizations are amazing. I wish I could find a way to stalk the author and find out what they are doing now and why they abandoned the story so close to the end.
