So I have read a bunch of HP Fanfics, and I bookmark the ones I like to read again later. Last year, I read a great fanfic (at least IMO) called Come Ready and See Me, by starrymoonmaiden. I re-read it a few times after that as well.

When I got my new computer, I went to rebookmark all the stories that I had previous bookmarked, and I was completely unable to find the story again. I mean, I found the story, but fanfiction.net gave me an error code, and it looks like the author's page got almost completely deleted.

I really want to get a copy of this story again, but it seems like the author must've deleted it from everywhere she posted it. The only place I could find it was wattpad, but they don't allow copy-past or things of that nature, so there really isn't a way to download the story. And there is no way I'm retyping it all since it is over 100000 words.

I also have a downloaded copy of the story on my iphone, through an app, but an app just doesn't read the same as on a computer (and in a few days, on a tablet).

So can anyone contact starrymoonmaiden, or does anyone have a copy of the story somewhere? I really want to keep it saved (I've already lost a few great stories to the depths of the internet and I don't really wanna lose another. I've already started downloading all the other ones I like and saving them to offline/online storages).

tl;dr Anyone have a copy of "Come Ready and See Me" By Starrymoonmaiden?


** So through an unconventional (and horribly tedious and time-consuming) manner, I have managed to copy the fic from Wattpad. If you give me an email address and tell me what format you want it in, I'll send it right to you. I can do: rtf, pdf, mobi, and epub

Edit: Forgot to mention: because of the way I copied it and the quite frankly terrible way the chapters were split up on wattpad, there may be a few formatting mistakes - section breaks where there shouldn't be and none where there should be, things like that - but it shouldn't affect the reading. :)

*** Yeah, so I went trying to figure out what happened to starrymoonmaiden, and it seems like she wiped herself clear off the internet. Her profiles on multiple websites have been deleted, as well as all copies of her stories. According to one website, this all happened on September 1, 2012, which makes sense to me. Now I am just trying to figure out if she ever had an email posted, or some website, or anything really that I could get to try and email her. Her work seems to be pretty popular so it confuses me why she did this. I take it you don't know her from anywhere?

**** Nope. I'd never even heard of her or the story before this post, so no idea why she would have deleted it all.

Did you get the fic? I sent it last night; just wanna make sure it got there.

*** Meh, Doesn't matter. I can fix those things when I see it while reading through again!

Thanks So much!
