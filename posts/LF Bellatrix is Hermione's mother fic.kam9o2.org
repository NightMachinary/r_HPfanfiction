Title says it all. I vaguely remember reading a story where Hermione had been kidnapped by the Order and adopted by a random muggle couple (the Grangers). Through a series of events I don't remember, it's discovered that she is Bellatrix and Rodolphus's daughter. She then comes back into the fold, is accepted by the Malfoys and gradually discovers that the dark side isn't that bad, etc.

Any fic along this theme would be welcome!


** Strange and Invisible History by Madea's Rage on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] it's amazing. It's about Voldemort getting the stone when Hermione is in her first year, the Lestranges break out and find out that she's the child that Bella had in Azkaban.

  Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always completely mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge. Fifteen years later, Hermione must come to terms with a startling truth and become someone she never thought she'd be: the perfect Death Eater's daughter. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Spy!Hermione

  "Arbitrarily, if you had to pick the people I'd least like to have as my biological parents, who would you guess?"

  Harry stared at her then at her left arm. She nodded.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr
