So I've finished reading it yesterday and need something in the lines of Intelligent, independent!Harry, Dumbledore and Snape bashing, etc.

No need to remind you that it has to be well written.

Oh, and do you happen to know of a good fanfic where Dudley goes to Hogwarts? I've read one recently with a Quirell polyjuiced as a guy from Durmstrang named Poliakoff, and the story went to fifth year, when the author abruptly stopped writing it. It almost broke my heart.

Every suggestion is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
