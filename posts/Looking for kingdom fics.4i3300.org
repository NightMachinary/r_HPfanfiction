I don't know about you, but I absolutely loved the few fics i've seen where Harry runs out of fucks to give about the wizarding world and just straight up makes his own kingdom.

I would absolutely LOOOOOVVVEEEEEEE to have some more of these fics, or even if he just does some great stuff with land, like making a factory to create cool crap.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

** I forgot to mention PLOX DON'T HAVE HAREMS.

Also, I would prefer that there is no romance in them, or that there is very little (With the main character, I have no fucks to give about other people having relationships)

  You don't like the way this country operates? You think its bureaucrats corrupt, its politicians moronic, its people apathetic sheep? Fine! Go make your own!
