** An honest question: Are you always the same guy, or do we really have an extreme influx of never used and/or new accounts?

** There was this one that I've never been able to find after reading it. Luna ends up going down the trapdoor from the first book and going deeper into the castle than where the Mirror of Erised was. I remember her finding some creepy shit down there and freaking out. I think I was so creeped out because Luna was portrayed very well in the fic and to see her suddenly freak out and go wake up Harry for comfort made me kinda freak out.

If anyone knows about the fic, I'd love to know the name. I think Luna follows a floating light down there and some skull suddenly turns to look at her at one point.

Linkffn(That Which Holds The Image) also creeped me out a bit. Harry comes across a Weeping Angel.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
