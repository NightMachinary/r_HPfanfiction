:END:
I'm trying to find a story I read a while ago and I'm not sure if it was deleted or not. It's a dramione fanfic where hermione is the child of bellatrix and rod. There are a couple stories like it the only other thing I remember about it was a scene where the boys are being held at a Malfoy manor and hermione has to pretend she is being held captive in the basement.
