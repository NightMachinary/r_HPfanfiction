Writing a fast paced first to seventh year Dark Harry. Second year Sirius is freed - sent to st mungos - heals up a bit - then does a meet and greet with Harry. He's 12, slytherin, ect...

Would Sirius disown Harry? Would he try and support Harry? Would he try, fail, and go off the deep end?

I'm leaning towards a positive Sirius but curious how others would expect/prefer him to react?

It's a soulmate, got their mark, type of thing with it being a Voldemort/HP pairing. ðŸŒˆ
