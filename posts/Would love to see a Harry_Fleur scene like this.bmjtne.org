Not sure if this is allowed but I did this quick write up last night because I want to see a fic like this after all the instalove Fleur/Harry fics because he is Allure resistant:

Fleur found that Hogwarts was no different than Beauxbatons or any other part of France, if one ignored how unnecessarily cold it was. For all of it's grand stone walls and living tapestries couldn't disguise the amount of stupidity held in one building.

It was only their first day there and she was already hearing the most ridiculous things from drooling mouths.

"Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are?" Yes, extensively. And?

"Have you ever seen anyone do this?" No, and she never wants to again.

And, her favorite one so far, "Did you know I invented the broomstick?" A few hundred years too late rouquin.

It seemed every boy in the school had no self restraint, inventing accomplishments or achievements or flowery comments just to get her attention. True, she could cut down on these... annoyances by restraining her Allure, as some of her friends suggested, but who would want to do that? It would be like telling someone to suck in their belly all day for the comfort of others. She did not have time for that, not with how stressed this tournament was making her.

After the last stumbling boy was carried away by his friends, an unnecessary exaggeration in her opinion but it left her friends in stitches, she needed some space. So, despite her friends offers, Fleur was wandering the ancient school's corridors by herself.

And she was quite lost.

Not that she would admit it but she was getting a bit frustrated as she navigated hallways she swore were shifting about just to mess with her. She let out a huff as she passed a familiar painting, it waved to her in jovial greeting, and gave a stomp as she turned a new corner.

She fell on her rump as she walked straight into someone. The shaggy haired boy she ran into was still standing, irritating enough, and rubbing his nose where her chin hit him. He hissed for a second, rubbing away the pain, before noticing her.

"Oh, sorry." He said, rushing a bit to give her his hand, "Are you okay?"

She gave him a half hearted glare but took his hand after a moment. "I am fine, zank you." She said, brushing off her uniform with as much dignity as she could scrounge.

The boy stood there dumbly for a moment, hands wiping against his robes in apparent nerves,. As he opened his mouth Fleur braced herself for some obnoxious bragging or meaningless flattery, just what she needed to top off her oh so wonderful first day at Hogwarts. An insult on top of injury, in a very literal sense.

"Well, bye." He said before walking off down the hall.

Fleur blinked. And blinked again. Then she called out, "Wait!". He voice was just a bit too loud but it got the boy's attention.

"Yes?"

She hesitated, pride warring with curiosity and frustration. Eventually her pride backed down and she found herself able to ask for help, "I am quite lost and could use some 'elp."

"Oh," He said, turning to face her, "Where are you trying to go?"

"The courtyard or ze main gate, I am need of some air."

The boy was quite for a long second, confusion plain in his green eyes. "How did you end up here? Your almost at the top of the tower."

Fleur blushed as she hotly said, "It is an unfamiliar building. Anyone could get lost."

"I guess. Hogwarts can be a bit tricky. I got lost all the time in my First Year." He said, shrugging before waving for her to follow him, "It just this way, c'mon."

"Zank you."

The two traveled in silence, one that would have been comfortable if not for Fleur's mounting tension. Didn't he feel her Allure? He wasn't acting like a fool as boys his age usual do.

How was he doing that?

Willpower? Obliviousness? An interest in the other team?

Curiosity near bursting she decided to investigate, starting with the most basic of questions. ‚ÄúI do not believe we 'ave given eac' ot'er our names.‚Äù She started, offering her hand, ‚ÄúI am Fleur Delacour. And you are?‚Äù

The boy took her hand with a smile, ‚ÄúHarry, Harry Potter.‚Äù

Fleur let his hand go with a sound of disgust, ‚Äú‚Äòarry Potter? Really?‚Äù She said, arms crossed and eyes flaring, ‚ÄúYou couldn't come up with somezing more original?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Fleur just scoffed, stomping down the hall uncaring if she got lost again. Foolish of her to get her hopes up for some genuine conversation or even a break from the general irritation Hogwarts seemed to rile up in her.

Behind her she could just make out the boy saying, ‚ÄúRon was right. Girls are mental.‚Äù

** This is a brilliant one shot in itself - go ahead and post it somewhere. Because for all the lovely prompts that we get on this sub, how many of those ideas actually end up becoming a proper fic? So, instead of letting this nice story idea get lost in the jumble, you yourself do the honours.

This really could be the beginning of a great HP-themed rom-com - you know, like one of those classic Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan movies that I enjoy even today.

** This is great! I think i remember reading something sorta similar to this, harry introduces himself to fleur but she doesn't believe he's harry potter, so he just rolls with it. It was a fairly OOC Harry though if i remember correctly, so it would be super cool to see something like this with a more Canon Harry.
