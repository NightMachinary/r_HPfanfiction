Obviously it was Harry/Ginny centric (which weren't my favs) but had a fascinating storyline spanning two separate complete stories. I remember it had to do with Ginny having some Celtic Goddesses powers and the two going to an Irish Magic Graduate School. It's probably corny now. But I remember it fondly and would love any help finding it
