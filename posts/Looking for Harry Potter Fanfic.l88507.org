:END:
Hello I'm looking for a fanfic I read probably 2015ish. It's about Remus raising Harry I don't from how old and how Remus got Harry though. They live in the woods I think? And then Sirius broke out of Azkaban to look for Harry and make sure that he was ok. Remus hears about it and moves locations to a meadow near the Weasleys. Sirius finds them however, and convinces Remus that he was innocent and Peter helped kill James and Lily. They then become a family, and Harry meets the Weasley kids and becomes really great friends with them all. I do remember VERY clearly that Molly takes pity on them and knits Harry, Remus, and Sirius tons of clothes and embraces into her family. Some how Snape gets involved and with Remus consent helps Snape with making a proper research paper to show that werewolves are not violent all the time and deserve to treated like equal citizens in the Wizarding World. The fic ends with Harry probably being 11ish? He wasn't that old at the end of the fic.

The fic could honestly have been Fenrir Greyback and Remus raising Harry I can't remember. I do know that Harry was raised by a werewolf and that the fic was not in Harry's POV for a lot of it. The fanfic was in the POV of his parental figure.
