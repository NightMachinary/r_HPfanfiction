You know where one guy gets mad at another and stabs him in the gut only for tentacles to come out of it and put the stabber in a chokehold before they retract and everyone just laughs it off, or the shapeshifter who rips off his arm to whack someone in the head with it and that's just cool.

Yeah. That.
