  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** I've read Grow Young With Me a couple of times. Linkffn(11111990). There aren't many romance fics as good as this one.

I read Behind Blue Eyes once every two years or so. Linkffn(2095661). Again, another great romance fic.

Romance is my favorite genre but has fewer great fics than other genres, at least in my experience. So when I find good ones they get a few reads from me.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom. The relationship between Harry and Voldemort is a rare gem in fiction, not just fanfiction. It seems so uniquely suited to the world and backstory of the Wizarding World. I have a fantasy that one day I'll be able to write something similar, a mentor relationship between two people who, by rights, should be enemies but somehow fit together seamlessly while grinding like nails on a blackboard at the same time. Mizuni-sama accomplished something incredible there.

  Based on esama's 'Subject of Change', no pairings yet. When Harry Potter died, he didn't expect to end up meeting a giant fox, a pervert, get changed into a girl and end up with some kid who had was capable of giving Snape the warm and fuzzies.

** "Hope" by Jeconais (spelling?)...I have read it several times and it's quite tragic IMHO because Harry despite all his power (and he's quite powerful in that fanfiction) doesn't easily get his happy end (hell, I'd argue he doesn't at all - despite all that veela-mate stuff, because IMHO a relationship grows through friction (not countless and constant fights - like Ron and Hermione have in canon, but some fights and disagreements nonetheless!), so having a totally submissive girlfriend (who is in pain for telling you "NO!") is a no-no for me!) and everybody is still trying to manipulate him (despite him having done "his job" (taking care of the dark tosser!))

Still, even with all that it's - IMHO - well writen and I like reading it :)

**** The premise, highly contrived, is this: Harry needs to suffer in order to awaken an enormously strong power that is prophesied to be required for him to live and defeat Voldemort. So, a lot of people, Dumbledore and the Potters included, work to ensure that he does. This deception comes to a close at the end of canon year 3, and when the Potters reveal themselves to him he 'triggers' and awaken said power.

Learning about their betrayal pretty much sends him into a half-crazed state, which gets quite tiresome. However, unlike a lot of stories that follow a similar trajectory, there are two major differences: firstly, there was a 'reason' for the betrayal, and even despite that, there is a lot of disagreement amongst those who agreed to it whether it should have been done, and these disagreements have consequences (esp. later on, for Dumbledore). Secondly, while Harry starts out as crazed, there is a gradual clawing back to some semblance of sanity, which makes his fervid episodes more a bit tragic.

The authors borrows the setting from Dresden widen the scope of the world and drastically increase the stakes. Bringing in Outsiders, Mab, etc makes this story epic in a way few are.

But, the author is very clearly an amateur. There are plot holes, and for the first half, the dialogue is silted and cumbersome. But despite its many shortcomings, the anger pain madness etc in this story is very real, and feels quite visceral in spite of the writing and the contrived situations that bring them about. It gets immeasurably better in the second half.

It's a fun story, once you accept the fairly ridiculous premise and if you can get past the mediocre writing.
