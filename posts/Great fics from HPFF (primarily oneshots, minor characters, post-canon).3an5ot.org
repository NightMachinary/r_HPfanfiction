Every so often I see asks for lesser-known fics or non-FFN fics; a lot of great stories are posted exclusively on [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/][HPFF]]. The site's a bit of a headache to navigate and search, but the stories inside are very worth it. There's a small but active community of authors with astounding talent for original stories and odd pairings.

You might've seen me rec these fics in threads before, but I figure I'd make a list since nearly no one else recs them. I primarily read stories on the shorter end, starring minor characters, with light or no romance, that are set post-canon. I have more recs than these but those tend to have less attachment to canon (if you're curious, all favs are [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=151202&fav=1][here]], which includes those, as well as to-reads, gift fics, and incompletes). The list runs a bit old; feel free to comment with your own recs :)

All below are complete. Those marked with an asterisk are particular favorites.

 

*- - - Pre-Marauders Era*

*- - - Marauders Era*

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]]* by Celestie* | James/Lily, oneshot, drama. One of the few James/Lilys I like, for being a realistic rendition of a relationship with none of the trite characterizations that plague the ship.

#+begin_quote
  /"It's been a week, Fred. A whole week. I've never gone so long without talking to you. I mean, I'm talking to you now, but you're not saying anything back. I know you're listening, I know it. I can feel it. [...]"/

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

 

*- - - Next Gen Era*

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327979][Gladly Beyond]] by teh tarik* | Rose/Scorpius, oneshot, drama. Rose comes back as a ghost after dying. Not really a romance.

#+begin_quote
  /Rose Weasley & Scorpius Malfoy. Perfectly bland fruitcake couple. Life couldn't separate them. Death couldn't bring them together. Or is it meant to be the other way round?/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][The Stygian Trilogy]] by Slide* | Ensemble, action/adventure. /Ignite/ is the first.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /If romping through the Forbidden Forest on week-long escapades to hunt for a mythical plant doesn't seem normal to you, then you haven't met Hugo Weasley. Hinkypunks, nymphs, Acromantulas? Not a problem for this ragtag team of ordinary heroes. [...]/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] by MajiKat* | Rose/Scorpius, novel, action. Like a summer blockbuster action movie - entertaining popcorn fare.

#+begin_quote
  /The world is in chaos. Fear reigns and the Wizarding world is in danger of falling to its new enemy - muggles. The Ministry has become a paramilitary organisation, determined to go down fighting. Sent to Northern Africa, Rose must help infiltrate the group responsible for such terror. War is imminent. The only question is, when?/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]]* by ac_rules* | Ensemble gen, novel, humor. A year with the Muggle Studies professor and his class. Lots of silly references.

#+begin_quote
  /Archibald Penrose had a rubbish job: poor students, low levels of respect, high causality rates and some degree of amusement (depending on how you look at things). Why the hell would anyone want to be a muggle studies teacher?/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]]* by PenguinsWillReignSupreme* | Molly II/Teddy/Victoire, novella, drama. My favorite romantic drama entwined with family drama.

#+begin_quote
  /There have been six moments in her life when she could have changed the course of their history. Their lives are not infinite and she knows he will not wait forever. [...]/
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]]* by Celestie* | Ensemble, novella, dramedy. An ensemble Weasley family piece, told in a series of vignettes through Rose's eyes.

#+begin_quote
  /My family was never one for normality nor did we ever try to label ourselves that way. Through the years, we lived through our shares of fights and laughter and chaos. I didn't know much about living, but they taught me all I knew about loving. In the end, there didn't seem to be one without the other./
#+end_quote

*[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]] by Violet Gryfindor* | Lily II/Moody time travel, novel, drama. An aimless Lily Potter discovers a time-traveling vanishing cabinet.

#+begin_quote
  /Falling backwards through time, Lily Potter becomes entangled in the course of history. Past, present, and future collide, leaving Lily uncertain of who she is and, most of all, who she will become./

** Thanks for putting these up. Yes that site is terrible to navigate so I just haven't gotten round to reading anything from there.

*** The author's wonderful! She's gotten published, too. Her fics cover a lot of genres; most have a blend of drama and humor. Another favorite of mine by her is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All the Abstract Nouns]], which is a Molly II coming of age.

If you like next gen silliness, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] by RonsGirlFriday is another good one, with the Weasleys and OCs running a radio show. It's not complete, but it's also not super plotty, so it's still a lot of fun.

** Thank you! I really liked Amaranthine; great to finally read a non-perfect version of James/Lily. I wouldn't mind reading a version longer than a oneshot of this.

*** You should also read /Run/ if you haven't! It's an ensemble piece, but James and Lily feature quite a bit and have great scenes with the Marauders and Snape in the afterlife. I wish I had more to rec, but I don't usually read James/Lily because I hate the general fanon take on them (and the Marauders).

**** Reading it right now (ch.15), thanks for this recommendation as well! I like it very much so far, especially the way that all the characters really have their own voice in dialogues. I totally believe [[/spoiler][that it would be really awkward for Lily to meet Snape in the afterlife, him being still in love with her]]. The only thing I find a bit odd about the story is the role of the Founders, they just seem out of place to me, with so little other people that live in Cliodna's Clock for centuries.

***** There are a few world building contrivances, none that I mind much because of its ambition, but it actually makes sense somewhat later on. The characters are AMAZING. The author's trying to get published from what I know, and there's no one more deserving.
