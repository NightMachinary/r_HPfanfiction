It really is just a petty peeve but I actually have when people write "Straight Os" when talking about their results.

I get that it's a play on the phrase "Straight As" but surely something like "Os all round" (or is it all around? Either way- not the important thing here) sounds better.

I'd like to hear anyone else's petty peeves


** Huh, I never thought about it that way, I guess in a way it makes sense since the literal shape of an O is round but I had always assumed that straight A's meant the whole column of exams/classes had A's going down in a straight line.

*** I can see how people would come to that line of thinking but I've always throught it was the imagery of an A being all straight lines

**** That is an interesting idea, but that's not the definition of straight being used in that expression.

***** I mean if anything it could be used for both and therefore a play on words

So "O all round" could be for both too

****** "All round" tends to be used to refer to a collective group, e.g. if you said Harry, Ron and Hermione got Os all round it would mean that each one of them got straight Os.

** Actually, from canon, it appears that people mostly just say the number of O.W.L.s they got.

"Percy got 12 O.W.L.s. Bill got twelve too."

"Seven O.W.L.s! That's more than Fred and George got put together!"

*** Yeah I think in canon they refer to the number as on a pass or fail basis.

I think it's more fanon that will say straight Os

Although if bill and percy also got 12 owls does that mean they had time turners too like Hermione?

**** Barty Crouch Jr also got 12 OWLs... we don't know for sure but there are some students who managed it so I'm not sure whether they required time turners or not but I would believe that the schedule should normally be accommodating for people that want to take all the classes.

**** No, it doesn't look like it--Hermione mentions that McGonagall had to pull a lot of strings to get her a Time Turner.

It's possible that Lupin's lycanthropy tweaked with the class schedule, but I'm betting it falls under [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath][Writers Cannot Do Math.]]

***** Yeah I can accept either of those reasons.

personally I'd have thought you just need to turn up to the muggle studies or divination exam.

Read the textbook then make shit up when you get there for divination. Muggle studies (if you're muggleborn/raised is an easy OWL. Or again read the textbook.

Bill and Percy would have easily passed because they would have picked things up from their dad considering he works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office

******* Yeah, again I think they would use it as "I passed 12 OWL exams"

Like for me I passed all my standard grades. The fact that my worst result was by the skin of my teeth.... doesnt matter - still passed!

******** Actually, I think they just say "I got 12 O.W.L.s."

Since the O.W.L.s themselves are the exams, it seems a little redundant to say "OWL exams."

**** I believe Percy got one, but I can't remember if that's just fanon or actually one of JK's many retcons on canon that she did. It would fit canonically, because the best time for Hermione to get a time turner would be when the last student with a time turner is Head Boy

** When OWL results have "+" or "-" in them. It's clearly a different grading system than what we have (at least in America, I don't know how it works anywhere else) and we have no definitive metric of how their assignments are graded, so having those kinda annoys me.
