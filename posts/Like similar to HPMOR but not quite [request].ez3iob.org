So I liked HPMOR but not for the reasons it's famous for. I was bored by all the science and long winded explanations of it. I also hated Harry's characterization for the most part. But there were many I aspects I enjoyed about the fic so I thought I'd mention those here and see if anything similar exists.

What I liked: Smarter more competent Harry.

Raised by nice guardians. Doesn't have to be a story with nicer Dursley's necessarily like in HPMOR (well Petunia anyway) just Harry having a more loving upbringing by muggles.

Harry and Hermione in Ravenclaw and having a strong friendship bond with the hint of something more. They could also be in Hufflepuff and I wouldn't mind but definitely not Slytherin.

Neville playing a bigger role in the story early on and being good friends with Harry and Hermione.

Draco Malfoy having a redemption arc. So many stories have done this post Hogwarts battle which I didn't care for. So having Harry befriend and reform him from the beginning was preferred for me.

Well written multilayered Dumbledore that's not inherently evil. I loved his quirky insane side being shown more in HPMOR too.

More competent smart powerful Voldemort.

Dementors being destroyed and/or interesting discoveries made by using magic spells in different ways.

Competent DADA teacher who did awesome things for classes.

What I didn't like: Arrogant rude manipulative bullying Harry who looked down on others and thought he knew more than anyone ever. Also his dark side that reared its ugly head many times.

Hermione dying. (So glad she was brought back).

Science and endless amounts of info dumps that slow the story down.

The story taking place all in first year.

I think that's everything. If there's a story like that please post it. If not thanks for trying and I'll write it myself I guess.


** You might want to mark your complaint about Hermione as a spoiler, since what it's about is such a pivotal plot point.
