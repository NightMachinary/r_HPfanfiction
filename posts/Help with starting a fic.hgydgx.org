Hi!

I am an avid fanfic reader and I'm partial to Harry Potter themed ones.

I am about 300,000 words into the longest fix I've ever attempted to create. But I hate the beginning. I scraped it immediately when I realized a dream sequence is one of the big no-no's in writing hooks and first chapters. I was hoping some of you wonderful people might have some suggestions of wonderful hooks you've come across in the HP fanfic genre.


** generally, a fiction should start with everyday life before the conflict happens. I hate fics where the first chapter is confusing or if it's directly in or after a conflict. eg, in time travel, it's good to show the character in their future before they go into the past, and not starting it with already being in the past, or just waking up. my opinion.

I know, it's fanfiction, we already know all the characters and the universe (unless it's AU), but I still enjoy beginnings that show everyday life of the characters.

confusing is my big peeve. a mystery unveiling in the first chapter so that reader doesn't know what is happening, yet it still captures them is very hard to pull. it exists, but most often the effect is meh and I'm not really interested in what is happening enough to read more.

** I think the biggest clich√© is to start your fic at the very beginning of the school year - maybe because all HP books start this way. In my opinion, it's better to start directly into action, when it's possible.

Also, HP fandom is huge, so why people should read your story? Why is it special or different? Your first chapter should answer to those questions.

A 300k fic is a lot! You can be proud!
