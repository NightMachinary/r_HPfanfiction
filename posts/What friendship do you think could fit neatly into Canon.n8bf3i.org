I think it's a little bullshit that Essentially Harry has no friends outside of the Weasley's and Hermione. We don't see every day or every interaction, we see that people like Harry and treat him as a friend even though we don't see a massive amount of interaction with them. So what relationships and friendships do you like to see and how do they fit with in the Canon we've seen or not but at least make sense for what should be in canon


** I could see (and wish we did see) a friendship form with Katie Bell. She's only one year above him, and they were both the "new kids" on the Gryffindor Quidditch Team during the '91-'92 school year, so it's something for them to relate to the other with.

***** Keep in mind, that outside of Malfoy in year 2, Harry always had a better broom, and while Harry initially lacked experience, Oliver Wood was a taskmaster, and Harry was a ball of athletic talent with the ideal build.

Also, for the most part, Malfoy wasn't actually depicted as being worse at the sport at first. A lot of the Remembrall encounter was Harry bluffing and Malfoy being freaked out at Potter actually threatening to knock him off his broom. With no teacher around, Malfoy legit could have been seriously hurt, which is more than he bargained for.

By year two, when Malfoy does become part of the Slytherin team, Harry has a full year of Quidditch under his belt with a real team, but again, Malfoy had the better broom, so his inexperience on a quidditch pitch was offset, and they actually had some fairly competitive bouts. IIRC Malfoy only lost in year two because he got too focused in on Harry, rather than the game.

From year three onward, Harry's natural skill, combined with years under his belt of experience flying, and now the best broom on the market, It makes sense that he'd stomp everyone else.

Harry actually thought that Cedric's considerably larger size would make it harder for him to be blown off course by the wind.

Malfoy's only a little bigger than Harry and would not have had that advantage.

Edit: To clarify, on a sunny day, Harry beats Cedric, but with the storm Cedric very well may have beaten Harry fair and square.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

******* My approach to Quidditch in fanfic is that you should make the smallest possible change to make it sensible. I've seen a lot of "total overhauls" where the game is just completely different but then it stops feeling like Quidditch.

The change I make is to have the snitch end the game but score no points. That makes Seeker a very strategic position and you still have the catching of the snitch as the climax of the game, but it's no longer an instant-win. And you also keep the charm of Quidditch games being variable in length, from very short to possibly weeks long.

******* Quidditch and how much the snitch is worth makes a lot more sense when it's understood that games used to last for hours upon hours into /days./ Over that length of time, a 150 point match ending bonus makes more sense.

Even then, as you mentioned, the sport of quidditch itself should naturally have adapted the Seeker position. Hell, in the non-fictional universe you usually find a rapid change of player roles as rules in the game change, or different tactics are introduced. Go back 30 years in football, and the sweeper position was an integral part of the game. Now? It's a position that's largely a relic of the past.

[[/u/TE7]] has handled this incredibly well in his stories, with the concept of the 'hybrid' seeker. It makes much more sense in context of the 'modern' Quidditch game.

********* The implication is that when matches were much, much longer then the number of goals (and potential goal difference) were correspondingly greater as well. So in a match that had only been going for twenty-thirty minutes the snitch absolutely is overpowered.

But when it's possible for the score to be 1070-740? The snitch isn't going to make that much of a difference. It's more of a reward for doing what was at one point the more objectively harder portion of the game.

I am absolutely in agreement though that with how the game evolved that the point value of the snitch and the seeker position is heavily outdated. If this wasn't a fictional book there would easily have been a rule change by the time Harry came around.

****** Oh, absolutely. Molly fussing over little Luna after her mummy died is almost assuredly what happened.

It's just that fanon!Linny friendship often has the girls spending a lot of time together as young children and they're best friends throughout their years at Hogwarts.

This doesn't appear to be the case in canon--Ginny describes Luna as "alright" in /Order of the Phoenix/ though they definitely do appear to become very friendly later on, as they spend time together outside of classes, despite being in different Houses.

******** While Tom didn't help matters, I think the latter is more likely.

Canonically, Luna and Ginny legitimately don't have very much in common, beyond both of them being very loyal and not afraid of being honest.

Luna has a considerably longer fuse to her temper than Ginny, who is a Weasley through and through.

Ginny plays Quidditch. Luna commentates...about the shapes of clouds.

Ginny is skilled at jinxes. Luna's rather clumsy, at least at first, and even by /Deathly Hallows/ notes that she's only ever Stunned people in the DA.

Ginny has six big brothers and fights back when she's teased (one suspects that the Bat Bogey Hex became her speciality specifically because of this).

Luna takes most of her bullying in stride--except when Hermione insults the /Quibbler/ and by extent, her daddy.

But all these differences makes their latter friendship all the sweeter.

With the Gryffindor/Slytherin divide, I honestly can't see any of the younger years reaching out to him. And when they get old enough, they would have already been "trained" not to. So any Slytherins are out.

Depending on the fic, Tonks may or may not be in her seventh year when Harry is in his first. So having her introduce herself and interfere in his life because she knew him as a baby is not out of the realm of possibility. That would honestly bring a great number of Hufflepuff badgers down on him, seeing as they would be determined to help one of their own's loved cousin.

The only ravenclaw that is mentioned is Penny Clearwater. She gets petrified along with Hermione in the second book/year. The idea of her is noteworthy, especially if she interacts with the muggle raised so they understand where they stand.

Besides that we barely have examples of people from other houses. From gryffindor I dont see him hanging with Parvati/lavender or Seamus/Dean because they both seem very close to each other. Bht perhaps it would be nice to see him closer to some of the quidditch players, like Angelina or the Twins.

Then off canon I would like to see him becoming friends with a slytherin. Since we barely know the others my mind goes to Draco. It would have been interesting imo. Personally in HBP Harry sees him struggling and even finds him crying. Instead of attacking each other it would be nice if Draco acepted Dumbledores help and joined the good guys and they slowly became friends ala Zuko and Aang.

I mean I can understand staying with your group the first couple of years, but then when you take your electives for 3rd year you start mingling with other folk who took the classes. Then after the OWLs I can imagine its smaller class sizes with more mixing due to folk who would've left after 5th year and only taking the subjects you'd need for a certain careers.

Side note though. For the life of me I never understood why Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson took care of magical creatures. They don't seem like the type to like animals or want to care for them and all that entails. I can't see them wanting to learn how to clean up after them. They'dbe more likely to make someone else or a house elf do the feeding, cleaning etc.

Plus they definitely don't like Hagrid as a person never mind as a teacher, but I can't imagine they'd like Kettleburn much more considering how many limbs he had missing once he retired I could see them thinking hes careless or incompetent.

Also I find it hard to believe that you'd pick your subjects but realise "nah this isn't for me" and not be allowed to switch into another class. You would have to do it early enough (first couple of weeks at least) otherwise you'd struggle to catch up.

Also Hermione took literally every class and doesn't mention her classmates once to Harry and Ron? Mkay that

** The Quidditch Team and DA probably at least have friendly feelings toward Harry, if not outright considering Harry a friend. It could reasonably be argued that Hermione probably met a few people in the library who the books glazed over Harry meeting methinks, even if he didn't consider them to be important. Also there's infinite potential for post-Hogwarts friendships...

** I would really like to have seen the golden trio build friendships with people outside their own house but it seems as though they never really speak with anyone outside of class. Just look at the DA, Harry really didn't know any of them at all despite half of them being in the same year and having classes with with most of them at one point or another.

That really annoyed me

** Is not the problem that everyone knows the bad guys want him dead and that he is the most famous person in the Wizard world. Everyone in the wizard world learnt about him so they know more about his life than he does.

I think this is something that a tv show with more time could explore and it would make the turn against Harry more impactful when they all stop talking to him or believing him.

** I would honestly like to see Harry become friends with Daphine Greengrass, like maybe they could get paired up in a potions lesson or something and they slowly become friends and generally grow to enjoy each other's company, it would also be a good way to prove wrong the ‘all slythrins are evil' trope
