So I'm recently writing a HP fanfic (it only has two chapters up as I'm more of an “update as I go” type of guy) and it's focused around an entire group of OC's that are a few years older than HP and gang

The premise is that the first war didn't happen and there's more tension in the wizarding world than a family dinner in the south

Anyway, I had a friend read it, and she said it was good, but the only thing that saved it was my writing. She then proceeded to say that she didn't like the OC's for the sole reason that they are OC's

Is that the general opinion? Am I wasting time writing for an audience that doesn't like the characters I've fallen in love with? What's the fandoms opinion on OC's


** Most people are wary of OC's, for two reasons:

1. Most OC's are poorly written. I'd actually guess this isn't your problem, since your friend liked the writing. But 90% of all media os crap, and fanfiction tends to have worse rates than pro fiction.

2. I, like many others, read HP fanfiction to read more about my favorite characters - I want to see Harry doing new and interesting things. Take out the characters, and you might be taking out the draw of fanfiction.

I make exception to #2 for authors who've proven themselves to me or highly recommended works, but in general, lots of OC's is a red flag.

** Some of the most frequently recommended fics on here are OC heavy so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Some people won't read stories with OCs. They aren't your audience; forget them. It's perfectly possible to write a story with all the most popular canon characters and still get no attention, so write the story you want to read. That way you'll always have at least one reader.

** I don't mind OCs as long as they are worth learning more about and have an actual impact. Thing is though, a lot of times OCs are either completely and ridiculously OP, boring as hell or solely exist to fulfill the writer's fantasy with certain characters.

If you like your OCs and want to explore the HP universe with them then go for it. The HP fandom is so ginormous, you WILL find an audience. Maybe a small one but it will be there. Also, if you don't mind, link your story. Some of us may want to check it out. Good luck with your writing.

  The dark. It twists and turns to be morphed into what you want it to be, but be careful. It's addicting. MAJOR AU, lots of new characters. Wiz war 1 never happened, Voldemort has all his followers in secret. Read to find more!

** I enjoy a well-written OC, but I probably won't click a story without an established canon character to catch my interest in the first place.

For example, if you want to write about a group of OCs a few years older than Harry, perhaps consider giving Charlie or Bill a major role to attract readers and give them a character they can easily connect to.

** Some people don't like OCs. Some people read fanfiction because they are invested in the characters from the books and want to follow them through life. You get plenty of Harry/Ginny post hogwarts for that example.

Another thing people write about, now this isn't something I like but it exists, is the plot. HP plot is fun but its not the most solid, JKR's numbers and time keeping have left gaps etc. Some people want to explore those holes. I don't read that sort of thing but there are plenty of variants from the main books done 'right' to someone writing about where Harry was from the night Voldemort fell to the evening he arrived at Privet Drive.

OCs can't really exist with the main plot in my opinion. They're just clunky and come across as fix-it fics. You have a chance given you've gone really AU but at that point are you even in the Harry Potter world? I've asked before about how AU can an AU get before its not Harry Potter anymore. You don't have the main characters, you don't have the same background world. You've got a magical world and some tension. Some people see that as basically a very lazy original fiction leaching off the Harry Potter framework. I don't know if I agree with that but its a sentiment I've seen expressed. As a result some people will always dislike OCs. Many stories also are shit. Many of the OCs in stories are shit. People have seen enough to assume all OCs are shit. That's not true, The main character in Flo's Aurors is great, but its a common enough thing that OCs can't just be okay, they have to be great for your fic not to be ignored.

** OCs in fanfiction, especially in verses focused on characters as opposed to the setting, are somewhat problematic.

As was said, many readers want more of the characters they know and love. They want to read about Harry, Hermione and Ron, not Franklin Smith, Hufflepuff. You can get around that by keeping at least some canon characters - but you'll face some difficulties in balancing the OCs with the canon characters. Making them better than Harry at Quidditch, smarter than Hermione, braver than Ron etc. makes them appear as if they were a Mary Sue or wish-fulfilment. Making them worse or useless makes them a little pointless, unless they have other qualities. And you'll have to decide how they interact with and influence the canon events. If they don't change anything, or just a little, then their story seems more like a background/side plot. Not relevant when Harry and Co. save the school every year. If they take over, then many readers will feel cheated - they want to read about Harry the hero, not Harry the spectator to the OC hero. If you change the world into an AU, many more will be interested in how the canon characters are changed in that AU, not in OCs.

You can get around a lot of that - but it's not easy. I've used OCs in my own stories, though usually in a side-character role, or, at most, to show parts of the plot the canon characters don't get to interact with much. Like two Aurors investigating cases while the main cast is still at Hogwarts. Or exotic characters that have no canon counterpart - like a witch from an isolated tribe in the Amazon rainforest.

You can also use the main characters mixed with your OCs to draw in people. If you balance their appearances, you'll please a number of readers, and may get them to like and become interested in your OCs.

But even with ties to canon characters you'll still have to face the fact that many won't be interested in OCs because they're interested in canon characters. Especially if your OCs could have easily been replaced by canon characters, or canon characters adapted to your AU.

** I really like OC fics, but in an established fandom like Harry Potter it has to have someone familiar to catch my attention. Adding someone like the twins. Charlie, Tonks, or Bill into the group would probably make me personally more willing to read than only OCs.

** I've enjoyed some OCs in the past, but all of them have been sidekicks to main characters, /and/ were naturally included into the fic.

Fanfiction are stories based on an existing story, and that means they are heavily based upon the characters of this original canon. To have none of the protagonists be a recognizable canon character works only in very rare cases (Alexandra Quick). In general people come to fanfiction to read more about the characters they know and love.

In general I would say think about your characters and what you like about them. Then think about the necessity to have them in the HP world. If you truly think the characters and the plot you're imagining only fits in that world, go ahead. But if you think you could make do with another world (your own), maybe consider going OC in all things.

** OC's need to feel like they're actually part of the universe, rather than just an author's tool to push the narrative. Sadly, they're rarely written well so they get kind of a bad reputation.

** For me, I write fanfic for me. I just think it's fun. I have stories I wanna tell. I think if you're doing just to gain an audience then maybe rethink why your doing it.

That said, there are plenty of people who just enjoy stories about the world. And good characters and good work speaks for itself.

And not every fic is for everyone. Every fic is gonna have people that don't dig it for one reason or another. Don't get descouraged. Keep writing and keep having fun.

** I personally haven't found many fanfics with well written OC's, but the ones I have found were amazing. I think many writers struggle with making their OC's realistic and developing their characters, which leads to a boring, shallow character, with incredible powers but no personality.

** I've seen great OCs playing a role, but they are made so much better when they have a direct tie to canon. I.e. AU with a sister/brother/twin of Harry or a sibling for Draco a kid of Sirius, etc. Having random (impactful) OCs walking around requires you to very strongly establish the,, which is difficult.

** I really don't like OC's that have no real relationship to the canon. So like the kind of "Person X going in the same year as Harry and is just another random person" OC's.

But when OC's have understandble relationships to existing characters like being the sibling or parent or grandparent of an existing character, or a really close friend, I can imagine something behind them (best example are probably non-canon purebloods with known family names), when there is a well thought story behind it and the relation is quite well documented in the story.

If anyone knows well written stories that match my description, feel free to link them ;)

** OCs are like any other character except for the fact that they don't go unnoticed. They are under more scrutiny by the readers and thus we tend to see more faults in their character than we usually do with canon characters.

OCs aren't /more likely to become Mary Sues/, they're just like any other character except that while we might tolerate an OP Harry, most people feels as if OCs are the representation of the author's wish fulfillment, the poorer man's self insert if you wish.

** I personally never read any fics with OCs, and I'll stop reading if I realise there'll be OCs as main characters.

​

I guess for the people like me who don't like OCs it boils down to the fact that we read fan fiction to read more about our favourite characters from the books.

​

You're not wasting your time though, there will be some people who like reading OCs but more people would probably read it if it wasn't about OCs.

** I don't think OCs are necessarily bad, nor that they are inherently a sign of a bad fic. Bad fics with OCs tend to have bad OCs, good fics with OCs tend to have good OCs. If someone wants to read exclusively about canonical characters behaving in canonical ways, there's a whole series of published novels that's exactly that.
