I've been looking for a fic I read a while ago --- can't for the life of me remember the name --- that I quite enjoyed but can't seem to find again.

It's a Harry/Ginny AU romance, where Harry never went to Hogwarts, and lives in a muggle village not too far from the Burrow. Then Ginny moves there, and she's obsessed with the Harry Potter books which portray Harry as a womanizing Bond-like figure. I remember that Harry biked and Ginny jogged, and he bothered her once too many times and that that got Ginny pissed off. I also remember a sports car?

Any ideas?


** Sounds interesting! I haven't read it but I'd like to. Maybe try the [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] page?
