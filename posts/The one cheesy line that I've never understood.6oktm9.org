I know everyone has their pet peeves about cliches and bad writing like bashing and "emerald orbs" which are at least slightly understandable although lazy, but why does every fic use the stupid "Yep, popping the p" line? Is it some reference that I just don't get? Is it popular in other fandoms as well?


** Also making characters that it totally doesn't make sense culturally or otherwise do it! You can't tell me Albus effing Dumbledore would "pop his P's" or that Severus Snape would feel so inclined. Sirius, Fred, George, or a character you're trying to make look ridiculously immature would probably do this.

Typical 'independent harry' who's usually a little snotty shit would probably do this.

"Harry, are you going home for christmas?" Harry James Black-Emerys-Gryffindore-Hufflepuff-LeFey-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin ran his hands through his messy hair while giving a lopsided smile (or worse, a smirk!) "Nope! And no barmy old coot is gonna make me!" He said, popping the p. Suddenly, Tom Riddle entered the Gryffindors common room and after successfully killing Edge lord potter, the rest of the students cheered. "You know who's not so bad!" They'd say. "He who must not be named at least saved us from dealing with that stupid poser. Potter found out he had famous ancestors and then he was worse than "when my father hears about this"Malfoy. Dumbledore sure knewhat he was talking about when he wanted to protect potter from fame."

*** Oh you've read basiliskborn! For those who think that all the names were made up by [[/u/zombiequats]] :

I've only read up to chapter 50 but here are all of Harry's names so far: harryjames (together) salvazsahar ( later Salazar) emrys ( Merlin adopted him) lefay Pendragon ( he is the king of England since King Arthur also adopted him) malfoire ( french mainbranch of house Malfoy, above the malfoys) grim ( later peverell) Potter Slytherin (and thus directly related to the other 3 houses, especially Gryffindor who are descendants of Morgana lefay, his adopted mother) morganaath ( he became a clan leader of the goblin nation, above the goblin king sometimes in terms of power and respect)

So harryjames salvazsahar emrys-pendragon-potter-peverell-slytherin-grim-lefay , rightful king and ruler of England, most ancient clan leader of the goblin nation.

** It's very popular in Stargate, and I saw it fairly often in Buffy as well.

And I always found it super-annoying. I've never seen any other kind of pronunciation emphasized that way. Does it matter whether the reader hears that in their head? Really?

***** I want to say he does it a couple times throughout the ten seasons the show ran, but it's been a few years since I've watched it. Still, Richard Dean Anderson can pull it off; he's charming as Jack O'Neil. I can imagine how annoying it is to see it in a fic. Kind of like in an Avengers fic where the author has Tony Stark saying the same exact nickname over and over and over.

**** Jack always pops his Ps. Sam's only exclamation is, "Holy Hannah!" Teal'c's only response to anything is, "Indeed," with a quirk of the eyebrow. And Daniel just dies all the time only to be saved...somehow--except for when he didn't because authors didn't like "Meridian".

*** In Buffy the popping of the p could be related to them being teens in California during a time when it did happen as a means of annoying others though. Only if used right in some cases.

Stargate I could get from an alien world where English developed slightly differently.

** I'm ashamed to say I've used that one when I first started writing..

I don't even remember why I did it. I guess it was to try and make it easier for the reader to picture everything? Either way I used it once and never again.

*** I think this is common in new writers when they take show rather than tell to the extreme and iver describe body language and inflections. It's ok if your reader has a slightly different imagination to you, description is something that should be used to enhance, not control. Sometimes it's ok to write "he said casually" rather than "he said, popping the p."

*** Putting an extreme emphasis on the last "p" in a word (usually "yep" or "nope") to the point where it results in a popping sound. Usually done to sound like you're speaking in a lighthearted, casual manner, which can be meant sarcastically if you're speaking to someone who's taking the subject matter more seriously.

I'm pretty much indifferent to it, but I can't actually criticize people for doing the same thing that's on the original books.
