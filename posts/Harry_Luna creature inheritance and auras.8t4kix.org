I posted a search for this fic at a bad time a while ago and didn't get any responses, that or nobody at the time knows what it is. Either way I'm trying again and hoping for better luck.

This was an incomplete Harry/Luna that started some years before Hogwarts. Harry added up living with Luna and her mother, Xeno having did in this rather than her.

Harry finds out eventually that Luna is part fey and joins her as she is trained somewhere in the woods or on a small island on a lake near her home. I remember auras being a big deal in this fic with Lunas being green I believe. Harry's was white, which was unusual. At one point Luna investment Harry a necklace that will let him use her type of magic and he thinks he uses it to save her, but finds put his magic adjusted to replicate hers, with his aura changing in tint to match.

There is something super special about Harry (of course) and his return to the magical world is awakening the creature blood in many other families. Like he runs into Daphne Greengrass and Neville in Diagon Alley and their High Elf blood starts to come through. I'm pretty sure the Weasley's had leprechaun blood but I can't remember anyone else.

The last thing I can remember in the fic before it was abandoned was all of the special children being drawn together in a carriage on the way to Hogwarts and someone (probably Luna) drawing a picture of them that showed their true forms in the future.

Only other detail I can remember might not have even been from this fic but was that the Dursleys had drugged Harry and abandoned him in the woods to get rid of him and that was how he ended up at Luna's.


** Weasleys with leprechaun blood?

As a qualified Prequel Memer would say:

"Ironic"
