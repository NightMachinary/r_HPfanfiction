Harry Potter between the ages of five and ten is kidnapped by Belasco and taken to Limbo.

Twenty years later, in a world dominated by Voldemort, a strange wizard will appear armed with a sword made up of his broken and corrupt soul (the Soulsword). Harry killed Belasco and became the new ruler of Limbo.

Basically the story of Illyana Rasputin of the X-Men, in the world of Harry Potter but without the X-Men and without the mutant powers. (I haven't included the Bloodstones, but they may be present.)

The purpose of Harry's return can vary, he wants to take over the world, free him from Voldemort, etc. etc.

Thanks so much.


** The only story that I have read that includes Belasco, Illyana and a soul sword is Dark Echoes by megamatt09 but I don't remember enough of it to know if it is the story you're looking for.

** Fuck there was one where Harry ended up tossed into Limbo somehow (veil of death maybe? I dont recall)

He meets one of the locals, and hosts a dinosaur bbq which causes all the inhabitants to come over to "his" side of limbo, causing illyana to come and find out what happening to all her demons.

Fuck if I can find it though.
