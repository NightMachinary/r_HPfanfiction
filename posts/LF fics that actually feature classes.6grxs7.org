Hogwarts is a school, I want to watch the characters learn. Well written class scenes are fascinating, I love reading them. What are some good fics with scenes that show classes?


** Oh yeah I definitely want some of this as well, I'll be sure to check back, hopefully there is stuff out there.

In the meantime, in case you are interested in a non-HP suggestion, I would like to recommend *The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.* It's an amazing series on its own right (amazing score on goodreads and reviews), and has been likened to Harry Potter a lot of times, since it features a boy that is an outsider to the magical world that goes to a magic school.

Actually the school is much more academic, it is an actual university after all, and we spend quite some time learning about the classes taken there, as the main character starts to uncover more and more knowledge about magic and the world. Bear in mind though, the scope broadens a lot after a while, the book is not wholly about the school, but it's still featured in just the right amount, IMO.

*** Wholeheartedly second this recommendation, though the first 80 or so pages are rather slow, the books are extremely well written and well worth a read (or 10)

**** Only the first 80 pages? That series is way longer than it needs to be. And it isn't only the unnecessarily long-winded sentences either --- in many places the plot in general wasn't moving anywhere, or was sidelineing into some irrelevant random plot arc (IIRC, it was a drug-addicted dragon arc that made me give up my hopes on it).

I have no idea why [[/r/booksuggestions/]] is so fascinated with that series. It has its good parts if you're reading it diagonally, but I feel like it should be treated like pulp fiction --- or, at least, with less reverence than it's currently receiving on reddit.

****** The kingkiller itself is ok-ish enough to at least be worth of giving it a try. Just ignore Kvothe's own in-universe self-boastings, and if you don't like the current chunk of the plot (the already mentioned dragon-the-addict quest, protag's sex fantasies, etc) --- skip a bit ahead. Essentially, treat it with as much respect as your regular fanfics, lol.

The only other series I know of that features magical classwork is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(Grossman_novel)][Grossman's /Magicians/ trilogy]] (also has an ongoing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(U.S._TV_series)][TV show adaptation).]] I think it's a hit or miss kinda work, though, so if you don't like the first half of the first book, then maybe just drop it for the time being. Alternatively, if you /do/ end up liking the first book, either stop there or make sure to read all three of the books, because (IMO) without the third book the second one will make both books #1 and #2 look worse than they are.

And in the HP!FF realm, there are these:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][/Forging the Sword/]] --- magical lore is often presented in the form of classroom discussions;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][/HP & the Prince of Slytherin/]] --- plot development and lore exploration in classrooms. If you don't like the “prank wars” trope, there will be some skippable parts;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][/HP & the Temporal Beacon/]] --- Harry and Hermione manage to create for themselves a save checkpoint at the end of the third year and “reload” the universe each time something goes bad. They gradually improve in knowledge and skills, which is also demonstrated in their improved classwork;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][/Sitra Ahra/]] --- the muggle studies professor is protag's favourite one. Also features a clever and rational Lockhart and private practice sessions with older-year students.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/HP & The Natural 20/]] --- protag is from a D&D universe, so his magic operates differently and he has to fake many classroom tasks to hide his status.

   :END:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][/HP & MoR/]] --- magical lore expositions (and some [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract][author tracts)]] are often presented in the form of classroom discussions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Sacrifices Arc/]] --- /I think/ it had some scenes happening inside classrooms;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][/HP & the Nightmares of Future's Past/]] --- a time-traveller Harry convinces his gang to start training with him (physically, academically). Should have classwork too, I think;

Usually it can be pretty unmemorable whether or not a particular fic featured classes much or not, so some recommendations may be inaccurate. Feel free to add your comments if you have better memories on a mentioned title than I.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** Try linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). It has interesting learning snippets for Divination, though any mention of it doesn't happen until the 7th chapter, I think... and Harry whines about being kidnapped from his own universe a lot... other than that, I really wish the author would come back and write that 'Divination for Skeptics' thing Harry kept mentioning. It would have been a bloody blast.
