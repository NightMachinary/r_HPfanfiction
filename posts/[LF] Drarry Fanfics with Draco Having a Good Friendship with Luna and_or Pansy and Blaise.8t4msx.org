I have read so many Drarry fanfic and I've found that my favorites are always the one where Draco actually has FRIENDS. Supportive and Hilarious Pansy and Blaise, please. They are my Silver Trio and I always love a good fic where they aren't complete assholes and never cared about Draco. I also loved Drarry fics where Luna is close to Draco and they are best friends. I just think Luna/Draco is an amazing friendship. I'd love if someone could recommend a few for me!


** Please read Tales From The Special Branch, and A Piercing Comfort by talithan. Also come visit us at [[/r/HPSlashFic]]

**** I was going to suggest Harry's Pockets by RaeWhit next, but RW took down all of her stories a while back and a quick google search didn't turn up any working links :( I'm pretty sure I have a copy of it somewhere, I can look for it, so message me if you'd like one.

** Idk how you feel about self-recs, but "And the Sun Burned Through" ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5974362/chapters/13729425]]) features Pansy (and a little Blaise) as supportive friends.

"Moldova's Magical Tea" ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221299]]) features a Draco, Luna, and Neville friendship!

"Harry Potter and the Future He Doesn't Really Want, Thanks" ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7630993/chapters/17373415]]) also features a Draco/Luna friendship and is written by seefin, one of my fav fic writers.
