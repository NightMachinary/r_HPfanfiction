One of my favorite moments from either the movies or the books is the moment in the MoM atrium where Voldemort is trying to possess Harry. What fics do you fine people know that give a good adaptation of this scene?


** Not quite what you're looking for, but there's a fic where Harry learns occlomency from Hagrid and beats off Voldemort with a brick, if you're interested.
