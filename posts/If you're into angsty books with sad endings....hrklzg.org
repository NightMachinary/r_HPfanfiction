Okay so normally I hate books with sad endings, they leave me wanting more. But I have a recommendation if you DO like them. It's called "Hero like me" and it covers the topic of eating disorders. (IT'S ALSO DRARRY) The author also was apparently working on a follow up which I have yet to read, but they mention the name in Hero Like Me so you can check it out there. I highly suggest it because it's so beautifully written. Alright, I'll stop ranting. Here's the link:
