I'm looking for a specific fic I read a year or 2 ago where dark!harry is in an orphanage, pseudo-adopts a sister there who ends up going to hogwarts. harry goes to a different school then joins voldemort and i think its possibly hp/lv in the end? It was a complete fic.

I hope I'm not merging multiple fics in my head...


** there is one where harry is adopted by sirius and goes to durmstrang and it is hp/lv, linkffn(The Black Heir)

*** The first thing I saw when I opened this thing was "Summery".

wow.

edit: And "Summery" aptly summerizes the overall writing quality of it. If you wonder.

**** yeah after re-reading a few chapters the writing leaves much to be desired. it does get better but not by a whole lot. I can't really remember why I was looking for it but after searching for a week I really needed to find it.

***** I mean, I don't set high standards for fanfiction, I really don't.

But I just can't bring myself to read something with that amount of incoherence. Punctuation, grammar, sentence-structure... everything just dreadful.
