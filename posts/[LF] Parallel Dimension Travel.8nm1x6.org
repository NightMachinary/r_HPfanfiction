I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry is summoned by a ritual performed in an parallel universe where Dumbledore and Grindlewald rule the wizarding world. As far as I can remember, Harry had been in another universe under similar circumstances prior to being summed to the one with Dumbledore and Grindlewald being the rulers. I think it was part of a series. Also if you know of any other fanfics with a similar premise, finished preferably, please link those as well.


** The fic you're describing sounds like Linkffn(Yet Again) by silverfawkes. Never linked anything before so I hope that works. Anyway, it is a sequel to yet another universe.

  Things didn't go so well this time after Danzo betrayed konoha and joined Akatsuki. As the Kyubi was being removed from Naruto however, an unexpected stranger arrived to change all for the better... maybe. NaruHina timetravel some oc please review

** Sounds also like a 3 part story I recently read Resonance by GreenGecko followed by Revolution and Resolution (which annoyingly isn't completed, was abandoned with 2 chapters to go, I was devaststed)
