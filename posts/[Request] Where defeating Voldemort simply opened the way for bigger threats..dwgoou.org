Looking for any and all fics in where, much like a tv series or anime, Voldemort was simply the villain of Season one. Preferably with bigger and bigger stakes.

Bonus points for Magical people getting in contact with the origin of magic, what/whoever it is.

Extra bonus points for completed stories.

Thanks!

"Heh, heh, heh...foolish wizards. Foolish /goblins/. They didn't even notice the slightest difference when I killed and replaced the goblin king Regna. And the fools still bank with us! Soon, soon muggleborns and purebloods alike will return to withdraw gold from their vaults, like nothing had ever happened...the gold! The gold that I have cursed! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

"Tragic, isn't it? So many people dead, on all sides. So many victims of the Imperius, so many Death Eaters, so many muggleborns. The Aurors are decimated, as are the Obliviators, the entire DMLE, and the economy is in shambles after the destruction of the upper class...\\
...\\
It would be a /shame/ if, say, another Dark Lord had been saving their resources up and showed up just now to enslave the populace...eee-hee-hee."

"Gentlemen, ladies included, we've just confirmed reports that the British Magical Dark Lord, who we can now safely refer to as Voldemort, has been killed. Because of his conscription of a large percentage of the population and takeover of their magical Ministry, the British magicals are in a state of anarchy following his death, however, the survival of one 'Harry Potter' and his de-facto cult of personality means they may be able to re-establish a functional government before the next 24 hours have passed.\\
Nevertheless, we feel this is the best opportunity we'll have for a long time to seize test subjects and begin research and development of magical defenses and weaponry, as such, I propose that we immediately initiate Operation Bermuda. I hardly need to tell you that this is something we don't want getting back to our civilian government."

"So that boy Riddle has fallen, hmm? Idiot child, hiding his soul in the shiniest and most unique treasures he could find. Too easy to destroy and they gave him nothing! At least one of his traps dealt with that bulbous meddler Dumbledore.\\
Alas, though, it seems that the line of 'Salazar Slytherin' is extinguished. I was rather proud of that persona, but perhaps it's time that I created a new identity, a new legend...it will be no trouble at all to brainwash what few surviving Death Eaters there are to serve me, especially since that fool Riddle used /my/ snakes as his symbol.\\
Hee-hee-hee...Hogwarts, beware, you shall come to fear the name of Herpo the Foul once again!"

"So the Voldemort is dead, and the giants he lured to his cause are dead as well. And now the humans believe us giants to be extinct.\\
...Those prideful fools. They sneered at giants for being dumb, never considering the genius needed to survive at our size, never considering how to live in the wild. Imagining that tribal gang of thugs they recruited was all we ever was. And now they will pay.\\
I, the true Gurg, and my followers, have recreated the magic of our ancestors, and their England is in disarray. It shall be a fine stepping stone to conquering the world and showing these humans how blind they are."

"Hati does not like being a house-elf. Hati does not like being a slave...Hati thinks he...no, /I/ think /I/ will make the humans H-/my/ slaves instead, see how they like it!\\
H-/I/ heard of the Goblet of Fire at Hogwarts. How Harry Potter was trapped in a magical contract from one forged signature. /I/ think that Maste-/rrRR/, that blonde /creep/, is keeping his financial records and letters somewhere around here...soon, soon, they'll all be signed up working for Hati! Ee-hee-hee-hee!"

**** The hill-near-Hogwarts one is based on my idea a couple of days ago with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dvqc3a/horcruxian_antifidelius_hiding_your_soul_inside/][Herpo the Foul turning the very concept of snakes into his Horcrux]].

I don't know of any fics where a muggle military faction take advantage of the post-Voldemort disorder to try and kidnap a witch/wizard, though. Maybe start a request thread?
