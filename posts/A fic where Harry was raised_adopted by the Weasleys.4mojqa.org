I love AU's and haven't encountered one like this. Preferably one where he was placed there very early (didn't go to the Dursleys at all, or left very shortly after November 1, 1981), but a later pre-Hogwarts adoption/placement would be interesting too. Does such a thing exist?


** linkffn(Sticks, Stones and Broken Bones). He's older though.

  Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.

** I've read a few early on, they're usually Harry/Ginny stories where he somehow just magically appeared there, usually by gin's accidental magic and they're soul mates and i really feel like vomiting remembering readfing this trash.

*** Yeah... I did a cursory search on ff.net and they all seemed largely horrible. Figured I'd ask here in case someone had actually found a half-decent one. Shame.

** linkffn(Hard Wrought Joy). Not a perfect fit to your request, but by the end Harry is adopted by Molly and Arthur.

  Molly always wanted to have children, but when the unthinkable happens, her path to motherhood takes a twisting, winding turn. AU. COMPLETE. Now with an epilogue!
