Exactly what the title says. I'm in a mood for stories where Harry's mere existence is nightmare fuel to others.

Maybe he's got some outside-context power that the Wizarding World at large (or the world where he ends up, if it's a crossover) doesn't know how to deal with, maybe it's a side effect of the Scarcrux, maybe it's the Dursley Treatment becoming public knowledge and the Wizarding World thinking (incorrectly or not) that he could go full Carrie at any moment - or he's already done so, but doesn't remember it.

Either way, Harry is /scary/ - but the kicker is, he's still fundamentally a good person. He genuinely doesn't understand why people are looking at him like he's a Boggart, he just wants to make friends and learn about magic like most other kids at Hogwarts. It's only the Death Eaters that actually take the brunt of his ire.

Preferences:

- No bashing, particularly Dumbledore or the Weasleys.
- It's unlikely Harry gets shipped with anyone for the purpose of this request, but if he does I'd prefer it to be a sensible ship (ie not a teacher, not a Death Eater or Death-Eater-Wannabe) and to keep Preference #1 in mind (so no bashing of potential love-interests from canon in order to get them out of the way).
- No (Edge)Lord Potter-Black-Peverell or associated tropes.


** The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

This is an excerpt from a story called the eyes by Shadenight123 in which Harry sees things beyond comprehension is definitely creepy but has a heart of Gold.

2) Quo Vadis? It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way. Harry is definitely an eldritch thing creepy as fuck and Voldemort is scared as shit in fact its written from Voldemort's perspective. Harry's morality is questionable but he definitely has a playfulness worth reading about.

3) Leviathan Rising Set in Gof, what if Harry had found a way to overcome the second task? What if while searching through the library he came across an insignificant seeming little book that teaches him the magic he needs Creepy elements but Harry doesn't loose himself [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/952100/1/Leviathan-Rising]]

4)I think this hits the bill more than the others

tell me whether he is dead LullabyKnell Summary: Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying.

“Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

“What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”

** linkffn(12754810): Rather than simply being scary, Harry's a literal monster due to a rare involuntary and permanent transformation. Despite spending most of his time in the forbidden forest chilling by himself he's still rather personable, makes friends and learns some magic (albeit in a modified curriculum) once he's discovered. I found it enjoyable and pretty wholesome; there's also no bashing if memory serves.

*** Not /quite/ a monster in this one but he is considered "cursed" and with somewhat good reason (augmented abilities and berserker episodes). It's so AU that the Wizarding World is barely even an afterthought but I enjoyed it (even despite my initial reservations).

***** Based on the synopsis and with a title like "Hell Eyes" I expected something pretty edgy. What I got instead was an epic adventure in a large, high fantasy world and all that entails.

As another departure from the norm, rather than Harry being the only one from canon in the new world, he just sort of fell in ahead of schedule.

This is in the first chapter, so not really a spoiler, but the portal in question is a rare but well documented phenomenon and the Hogwarts staff were organizing a sort of field trip. Harry goes to check it out alone out of curiosity and gets sucked in.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

**** I've been kicking around an idea (read: thinking it's a neat idea then never doing anything with it) where Harry gets straight up killed by the first AK, and the Mother's Love magical sacrifice mcguffin just unkills him. He's best described as technically alive- mentally yes, physically about skin deep, as in he has no heartbeat or /measurable/ brain function (that's not going to be relevant until he gets knocked out, though), particular need to breath, eat, or drink, etc. Skin wounds show up but heal bloodlessly in a normal amount of time, and healing magics don't work at all, etc.

Plot twist is the sacrifice set him up to live exactly how long Lily would have had she lived a full life, and he's going to live it no matter what tries to interfere with that because of the magic locking in his life to the unspent time. From there, the plot can be about whatever is needed, though the creepiness comes from Harry being noticeably dead, except for the fact that he's as animated as any normal child/adult/whatever would be.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jh59bz/two_sentence_prompt_on_october_31st_1981_harry/]] This prompt specifically. Minus Lily's sacrifice, your idea fits really well - you could adapt it to be /Harry's/ natural lifespan instead of Lily's, and basically just have that prompt.

... Although I'm not quite sure why you responded in a comment chain rather than making a new root-level comment, but what's done is done.

** How about Harry did die when hit with the killing curse the second time. However, his sacrifice was seen as noble, he accepted death entirely, and was declared to be the Lich King by death. Additional kudos if he goes back to his eleven year old body with the same abilities.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
