Dumbledore, as the secret keeper of 12 Grimmauld Place, is able to be under the Fidelius Charm with no troubles at all.

Back in 1981 when the Potters were still alive, why didn't they make James or Lily the secret keeper, then have James/Lily repeat the secret back? That way, it couldn't be tortured out of anyone, and the only way for the secret to be leaked is if James/Lily went to Voldy and led the Dark Wanker back to their home. (True, Peter could have stolen the secret on the paper, but I'm talking about if James/Lily only ever said it, and didn't write it down.)


** I think [[/u/Faeriniel][u/Faeriniel]] gave a pretty good answer to this

"I maintian that for the Fidelius Charm to work properly requires complete trust in another person. Additionally the person invested with that trust must reside somewhere else. Homes are important concepts in HP.

We know that spells have emotional or esoteric components, like for instance the Protronus Charm, and I feel it's in keeping with the world that the Fedlius would require a strong feeling of Trust.

So James and Lily could have chosen Dumbledore as their keeper, however they didn't know him nearly so well as they knew Sirius. So the effect would have been diminished if they had chosen the Headmaster.

When Bill mentions The Fidelius in DH:24 it seems clear in the text as written (Outside of authors intent) that the spell isn't working correctly.

Ron is able to both travel to Shell Cottage when he abandons the hunt, and recall it and communicate it to Dobby when they are at the Malfoy's. But if the spell was working propperly he'd have been unable to do so.

“Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here."

In this same conversation Bill is able to divulge that the Weasley family are hiding at Muriel's and that Arthur is the Secret Keeper, which again should not be possible.

So that's my rational for the discrepency."

Ron probably got in touch with Bill, via eg patronus, Bill meets him, lets him in on the secret and takes him there.

The fidelius doesn't stop someone who knows the secret /recalling/ it, otherwise the whole Order would forget Grimmauld every time they leave and have to be told by Dumbledore ahead of each meeting. You only need to be told by the Keeper once, then you know it forever.

Agree he shouldn't have been able to pass it on, but is this one of the things that can be explained by "house elf magic doesn't respect wizarding magic?" Dobby can apparate into Hogwarts, I don't think he's bound by the same rules as wizards. And as he took them all there, and they landed on the beach and Bill came out etc, that perhaps gets round it. You're right though, logically Ron should not have been able to pass it on.

Ah, now I think you're wrong here for two reasons.

First. "Aunt Muriel's" isn't an address. The secret is the address. He hasn't said "the Weasley family are living at 5 Hedgehog Lane," (or whatever her address is), he's just said they are at "Aunt Muriel's." To Harry, who doesn't know where Aunt Muriel's house is, it's not giving away the secret. This is proven in canon- they talk about things and people being at "headquarters." Anyone listening wouldn't suddenly know the secret, because they still don't know where "headquarters" is. You have to give the specific of the secret, not just a vague "they are at headquarters" or "it's with my aunt." Even when they all became Keepers when AD died, you still have to say "the Order of the Phoenix can be found at 12 Grimmauld Place" to pass it on.

Second. You can say who the secret keeper is, that's not a term of the secret. That was sort of the point of the Potters double bluff- it would get around that. If Sirius was the secret keeper, people would assume so, and /tell others,/ leading the info back to Voldemort or similar, so they needed a decoy. Even if Sirius /had/ been the secret keeper, someone would have been able to pass to Voldemort "it's Sirius Black that knows the secret." That's why both Sirius and Peter went into hiding- so neither could be tortured to give away the secret or /the identity of the secret keeper./

*** I've not seen this analysis before, but I like it a lot. The Fidelius kind of breaks down in Deathly Hallows with all people who have been told the secret becoming secret keepers on the death of the original secret keeper. Maybe if you attempt to make yourself secret keeper for somewhere you live the spell starts to break down the same way. Where its not just the original secret keeper that can tell people, but anyone that they have told. It's still more secure than no Fidelius, but it spreads your trust thinner, you have to trust not just yourself but anyone you might invite into the secret.

*** So lemme see if I have it correct.

Tl;dr: The secret keeper has to have complete trust and not live in the house.

Which then brings me up to Grimmauld Place. Does that mean the WHOLE order trusts Dumbledore or that Sirius trusts Dumbledore more than say... Remus?

I can't say I follow that line of logic. It's never stated as impossible for people to say who the Secret Keeper is, and a "they're staying at Aunt Muriel's" is probably not the secret. I think anyone can say a location, and place it under the Fidelius charm.

Ex: So say Hogwarts was placed under the Fidelius. If the secret phrase was: Magical school, shouldn't anyone be able to say Hogwarts? The only difference is that nobody will be able to remember what location that is, just that it's called Hogwarts.

Which means that saying the rest of the Weasley family is at Muriel's and saying the secret wouldn't trigger the Fidelius, since that's not the phrase.

But yeah, the thing with Shell Cottage makes no sense whatsoever, since Ron is not the secret keeper.

**** I think in this case it's a little more esoteric and the nature and wording of the secret may be different.

The secret of Grimmauld Place is ‘The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is located at Number 12, Grimmauld Place'

Dumbledore is head of the Order, ergo everyone has complete trust that they will not betray it.

Whereas the Potter's secret may be ‘The Potter Family live in Godric's Hollow' Hence the optimal secret keeper would be someone who is as close as family to the Potters.

** Don't quote me on this, but I think Rowling might have changed the rules of secret-keeping later on in the books.

For the Potters and the Order, the secret keeper does not live at the house, leading me to believe that the secret keeper cannot live at the place of residence. In Death Hallows, however, Bill Weasley is the secret keeper of shell cottage, where he lives. I really think it's just a mistake on her part.

**** It's a major plot hole. It's said several times wizards basically can barely function in the muggle world. Lily grew up muggle. Lily and James had money (I don't think they were fabulously wealthy, but they had money).

The realistic thing would have been to travel by airplane, etc. out of the country as soon as they heard the prophecy. All parents, even shitty parents, would have run at that point if they had the financial ability and weren't ill. It's not like Voldy can off them in Heathrow.

** My take on the limitations of the Fidelius, from one of my fics (Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire, if anyone cares):

​

#+begin_quote
  "I've heard of that spell," he ventured, "but the way the Potters used it left me a bit confused. Why couldn't James or Lily Potter have been the Secret Keeper, and who actually cast the charm?"

  Filius's eyes glinted with his enthusiasm at imparting knowledge. "Second question first, I can only assume it was Lily who cast the Fidelius; it's a tricky spell, close to if not Mastery-level, but she was easily one of the most brilliant Charms students it's been my pleasure to teach. It had to be her or James, in any case, because part of the casting involves giving the secret over, so it has to be a secret that belongs at least in part to the caster. I could place the charm upon my own office, for example, but not yours. As for being their own Secret Keeper, well, that's one of the real limitations of the Fidelius Charm: If the Secret Keeper is hidden by the spell, it puts a growing strain on the magic. They can stay for brief periods, but the longer they remain hidden the greater the strain, to the point where it will eventually overcome the caster's skill and power and the concealment will fall completely. As tragic as the results were in this case, it's likely for the best - imagine someone being able to totally hide their existence from everyone, the ways that could be abused..." Everyone at the table shuddered at the thought.

  Shaking his head to clear it, the tiny Professor continued. "Regardless, those are two of the main limitations on the Fidelius charm, the third being that the power required to cast it successfully rises with several factors - how obvious the secret is, the size of the object or area being hidden, the number of people who already know the secret prior to its being hidden, and their familiarity with it. Even Merlin couldn't have hidden a large public location like Hogwarts or the Ministry. Other factors can complicate it further, of course, but those are the major ones. It's really a pity that it's such a difficult charm, since I'm sure everyone would like to be able to keep at least a small hiding spot for things like valuables or important documents."

** Because the Fidelius is a massive pile of author fiat.

In a project I'm playing around with, one of the major rules of defensive magic is something I'm placeholder calling door theory. The general gist is that defensive magic gets significantly stronger if there's a method to bypass it. For instance, magic to prevent a wall from being broken through gets significantly more effective if you add a locked door. Locking enchantments on that door become significantly more effective once you build a key for that lock, and so on. Azkaban prevents magical escapes by having relatively weak physical defenses, and that negative is countered by the legion of Dementors. Warding theory primarily centers on creating defenses that have relatively central bypass functions to supercharge the defenses, yet still keeping people from the bypass "keys".

The Fidelius is a crowning achievement of this effect by creating an incredibly weak "key". The secret keeper is given complete control of wards and grants access at a word. Access disables the effectiveness of every single defense on the warded building for that person, including the bevy of Someone Else's Problem-esque wards supercharged by the "weak key".

Not, “this is where their house is” but “this is where they physically are.” I think it makes the most sense to have someone else be the secret keeper, because the secret involves them. It seems like it would be some sort of protection charm or ward if James or Lily did it (they'd be keeping the secret of their own location- it would be stronger if a third party were involved).

** I'm of the opinion that the charm is complex and the way Fudge explained it was dumbing it down. Essentially saying that "only the Secret Keeper knows where so and so lives" doesn't feel like a strong argument for it, just like "it could only be broken willingly" seems a tad bit like false information.

The way it works(in my opinion at least) is that the secret is buried like a time capsule within a selected person. Sure, they could withstand torture and maybe fight the Imperius Curse, but everyone has a limit. So, it could be broken unwillingly, but doing so would trigger some kind of warning to the one who's secret was broken. That way it would still work by defending those in need.

But, if it is still unbroken, it would have to begin to fade. So perhaps there's a limit on how long it can be kept up. Like after two decades it is removed. This makes much more sense, as it essentially removes a lot of the problems, such as Bill and Arthur knowing that they're the Secret Keeper of two different houses. And it would also allow only those trusted to know of its location, which allows Bill and the other members of the Order to know where the others have safe refuge.
