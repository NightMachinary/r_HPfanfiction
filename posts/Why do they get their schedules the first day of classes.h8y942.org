Why not after the sorting ceremony/feast? I don't get it at all. As first years, the classes are separated by house, so no schedule is specific to a student. And there's no way the schedule is made ùíïùíâùíÇùíï ùíèùíäùíàùíâùíï. At the end of 2nd year OWL classes are chosen for 3rd, and their house is obviously determined by that point. The kids can't bring their books to breakfast on the first day because they don't know what class they'll have. The night before first years can't be given general directions about where they'll need to go by the upper years. Now breakfast has to be cut short so they can run to their dorms and get their books/supplies. C'mon bruh, it's not that hard


** As far as I remember, we always got our timetables on the first day back, which seems a bit nuts now that I think about it since obviously we couldn't go back home to get appropriate materials. I guess we/I just brought everything for every subject and lumped it? I imagine Rowling's school did something similar, hence why the day of the first lessons they get their timetables. And similarly the expectation was to carry all the books around (seems cruel, but this is Hogwarts we're talking about).

On the other hand and going back to my school days, the subjects were all sorted out before the start of the school year. And for senior years where subject entry was dependent on previous performance (instead of being assigned to a different stream) we'd had to go in for an appointment to see if we could continue our subjects. I assume this was only a few weeks before the start of school since it was mostly about external results.

That's not to say everything final was actually finalised. I once had an argument about whose class someone was in since I hadn't noticed they'd been moved out of mine and into the other person's part way through the school year. More equivalently to the Neville situation mentioned by [[/u/streakermaximus][u/streakermaximus]] there were people who bounced around different subjects early on in our final year. A friend of mine actually dropped out because of it (his situation was ridiculous and absurdly unjust).

Timetabling is actually a pretty Big Deal. If you've ever seen the movie The History Boys, its complexities and frustrations are a minor plot point.

A) It makes your food /not/ taste like overnight built up bacteria breath

B) Some people don't drink coffee and do not feel self conscious because they don't eat garlic or onions for breakfast

C) If you become self conscious after eating and need to brush your teeth at that point, what do you do at lunch when you're not home? (genuinely curious)

D) It's actually noted & studied you should brush before breakfast, and if you brush after you should wait at least an hour otherwise your teeth can become covered in the acids from (certain) foods and weaken tooth enamel

E) In regards to Hogwarts, it's not as though it's a 2 minute walk to the great hall. If a student woke up late should they not eat because they can't afford a 20 minute round trip to brush their teeth? Or instead just brush their teeth before leaving

What do you do if you go out for breakfast and then run errands? Bring a toothbrush and use it in their bathroom?

It's worse in 6th for NEWT classes. They not only get their schedules, their classes aren't even finalized. Neville had planned on NEWT transfiguration like Gran wanted, but McGonagall told him he couldn't handle the class and put him in advanced charms. So now, last minute, Neville has an extra transfiguration textbook he doesn't need and needs a charms book he wasn't planning on.

*** Is this a UK thing? Or even a non NY thing? We always got our schedules during summer. (Which was great for us because it gave us a chance to find out which friends were in our classes and see if we could come up with a way to switch out of a class with a teacher we heard bad things about or one where we didn't know anyone in it)

And we didn't have a form room; my school didn't at least. I went to public school and we had ‚Äòhomeroom' which was just announcements after 2nd period (which could be any class- art, english, social studies etc) & was about 10 minutes, where as my sister who went to private school had homeroom as an actual class at the beginning of each day

**** In my school we technically didn't get our schedules until first hour/homeroom teacher gave it to us, but everyone knew to just look it up online and then just copy it and you would be good so the whole thing about getting your class schedule after your already there and have no idea where to go is kind of stupid. So it was kind of useless to give people schedules when we probably already have it and if you didn't go to orientation your screwed because you have no idea where to go and good luck in finding it. And then during that first day there would sometimes be complication of your schedule where you just have an entire class just missing so you had to spend that class time going to the office to try and fix it when it should have been double check before school even started, but sometimes that was just the school's copy of your schedule that was messed up and your copy was completely fine so something happen between the time that you printed out you schedule and the school just completely mucking it up at the start of school so I don't know how that would be explained because the schedule were finalize at that point so why change things and just completely mess things up.

**** I went to a public school in Upstate NY and we knew what subjects we were taking. We received a letter during the summer and were also told in it what supplies we were required to have, any changes in the school rules and what our locker number and combo were. Other then that we knew nothing. We would come in place our coats/hats/locker decorations/lunch/backpacks/binders/folders/pens/notebooks/gym stuff/small musical instruments(big ones were stored in the band hall)/ect... in our lockers on the first day then head for the cafeteria(7th & 8th no electives less questions), auditorium(9th), library(10th) or gym(11th & 12th)it could be divided into 2 parts. Then they would hand out the schedules/school handbooks/club lists/maps. Then after questions we would leave for our lockers to grab what we needed for 1st period and the day would be run like a normal day except that classes periods 1-4 and 8 & 9 would all be shorter by around 10 minutes to make up the time that the orientation took up. Periods 5-7 were the three periods that lunch was served and they could not shorten them. We would get our textbooks during each class period it that subject had one. Our homerooms in Jr/Sr high school was what ever class you had 1st period for attendance and that and 9th period were each longer by a few minutes for the announcements. My 9th grade year my homeroom was a study hall that used the desks at one end of the auto shop. I was the only 9th grader everyone else was in 12th grade, the only girl and the only one who was not also taking auto shop. I would check in for attendance, listen to the announcements then head to the library until the end of period bell, without having to go back to the shop. Because the shop was at one end of the school half a story below the main floor, the library was on the upper floor in the middle of the building and my 2nd period was on the same floor as the library was at the other end of the building from the shop.

**** Yes, we had form three times a day. It was 2x when I first started, but not so long after it was increased as an anti-truanting measure. It also served as a sort of hub for having a familar teacher each day and a source of competition between other forms to keep us in order. We had 'Homework Diaries' and each week it had to be signed by the form our parent, our form tutor and finally ourselves and, yes, the order was enforced. So it was ~45 minutes of our day. In addition to us we had PSCHE (Personal, Social, Citizenship and Health Education) with this class.

The other lessons were all streamed by group - English, Geography and History; Language; Science; Maths; and Art, D&T, Music and Drama. In Year 7 they threw French (the only Year 7 language available) in with English et al., and made Science and Maths into a group (tbf, I think they mostly stayed that way except for the hopeless such as myself who were increased from Set 2 to Set 1 for Science and Set 3 for maths. Out of 5 - it was mirrored on the other side of the year from set 6 downwards.) Some teachers hated the setting and felt any decent teacher could teach all abilities, others clearly had a preference for lower/upper sets.

Each year we would go to our form room first thing (the room and sometimes teacher - if they got promoted, left or dropped the role - changed) and collect our timetable.

I'm trying to remember how it happened on our first day of Year 7. I recall that I didn't have a transition to my own school in Year 6; I visited the feeder school for the school I was in as did everyone in my class (though I know other areas or maybe more recently do their actual school). I believe Year 7 started... earlier in the day on the first day back? Maybe a day or two later? As I distinctly remember sitting in a hall and them going through an alphabetical list of the entire year, sorting us into forms. Except, SOMEHOW I ended up at the opposite end of the alphabet, I digress. I recall having a sort of 'meet and greet' session to bond us together - and a dull lecture from the head. Yet, my first full day of school was terrifying because even though I was early, hardly anyone was about and I had to follow someone the distance of the school to our playground, where we were lined up in dismal weather until everyone was there before being guided to our form rooms. Then, our form tutor gave us our timetables - myself and some others took the warning to be prepared literally by packing everything, some clever individuals just brought a pencil case.

So, basically, Harry Potter just had a much more magical and impressive version of what actually happened.

*** I'm Midwest USA and late-90s/early-2000s.

This sounds very similar to us. We went to ‚Äúhome room‚Äù every morning for attendance. But that's it. Why did you have to go back multiple times per day? Even when our school went to ‚Äúblock scheduling‚Äù and included a ‚Äústudy hall‚Äù period we just stayed in the class we were already in rather than move back to ‚Äúhome room‚Äù.

We'd get our class schedules and books the first day too. But we aren't a boarding school, so it's not like we had arrived on campus the previous night. First day of school was always considered ‚Äúsetup‚Äù day since the entire day is spent passing out books, schedules, syllabus etc. No learning actually occurs on the first day.

We had to wait in a big long line for textbooks for hours. You pay hundreds of dollars to ‚Äúrent‚Äù them instead of thousands to buy them. You just hope it's not all marked up from a previous student. The schools keep these books for 6-7 years before replacing them. They do try to check the textbooks for ridiculous markings since they can charge hundreds of dollars to a student that returns it in such condition, but it doesn't mean it's in great condition since they don't always check the books very well. Most kids in my school were so poor the government paid for these rental textbooks and free lunch/breakfast.

They do the same thing with laptops now. They didn't add rental laptops until I was long gone and in college/university. Everyone gets the same laptop so the school can control what they do on them and they return the laptops at the end of the year.

**** Mine increased from 2x a day to 3x a day in a move aimed to prevent truanting and teacher's letting good kids go home slightly early. The purpose was mainly the idea of having a familiar class and teacher ('tutor', only in the case of forms) watch over you. So, they would get feedback from all your teachers if something was going wrong (or very well) and meant it was easier to spot a pattern. Likewise, we were supposed to have someone we could go to. Other jobs included walking up to detentions, or reminding us about lunch time detentions/checking in. Sadly, it also provided the opportunity for them to have a rota for jobs around the school (like litter picking) without it eating into class time.

In the end, we were spending 45 minutes every day with the same teacher which is more than could be guarenteed with of the others.

***** I had actually not thought about that. Good point. But I'm in camp the house system is stupid. And will always support Marxist Draco:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúHouse pride means nothing!‚Äù explained Draco in very loud whispers while he repeatedly hit the Slytherin badge in his robes. ‚ÄúAll I'm saying is that the house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights.‚Äù

  Crabbe and Goyle were completely lost, but Zabini and Nott were listening and nodding their heads.

  ‚ÄúThey are forcing us to compete to destroy any semblance of solidarity, all so they can exercise power unchallenged‚Äù Draco went on.

  ‚ÄúI told you to keep quiet during study hour, Mr. Malfoy. Ten points from Slytherin‚Äù said professor Willington as he walked down the tables of the Great Hall.

  It should have ended there. Nothing more than a murmur between a few students. But then Draco abandoned the language of his readings and said something easy to understand and memorize.

  ‚ÄúBut that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!‚Äù Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! ‚ÄúThe point system is a lie!‚Äù

** I always thought that giving out the timetables at breakfast was weird, but it is also weird that they take the train on Sept 1st and classes always start on the 2nd. It makes no sense when the 1st falls on a Friday or Saturday. Also the idea that 1 teacher per subject if during the 1-5 years each of the 7 core subjects have 2 groups and say that there is 1 group per year for the 6-7 years, that's 16 groups. Now canon mentions both double and single classes for most of the subjects. Which means that that with a double and a single class each week of each group. So say that each single class is an hour and each double is 2 hours. So 3 hours a week times 16 groups equals 48 hours a week, Divide that by 5 days that means each teacher is teaching 9 hours a day 2 days a week and 10 hours a day the other 3 days. That does not work. And the 1-2 year students would only be in class 21 hours a week and the 3-5 would be in class 27 or 30 hours (2 or 3 electives).

The timetables should to be written before the start of the year. If each house has all classes together their first year and in the books at least the Gryffindors have a couple classes with the Slytherins, a few with the Ravenclaws and some with the Hufflepuffs. So they can not rearrange the houses so that each session of a class has the same number of students give or take one, unless they either split up a house or 1 session with the large house and the other with all 3 of the others.

*** Generally this wouldn't be possible, because of small intricacies that come up in the Canon letters.

The booklist is sent with the confirmation/acceptance letter, so first years would never get their timetables in the letter.

It also wouldn't really work for the 5th and 7th years, as, for some stupid reason, they don't finalise their choices until the day they start school. That's the most BS thing about Hogwarts, because no school in the UK would finalise choices on the first day of school, it's always done at least a month in advance.

**** I meant send another letter after they have accepted.

As for 5th and 7th year, just, you know, don't do that? Be a normal school. I mean the stress on the teachers who don't know if they will have 1 or 50 students in a class.

***** Aaaaaahhhh, OK.

The second letter does make sense, and all that jazz. But Hogwarts, unfortunately, doesn't operate on modern UK education standards.

I guess what they do is have the classes and which houses they'll teach at what time set out before, but not how many students they would teach.

If I may, I'm going to posit a theory: there's a quota of students that need to go into each house, so there's a set base amount of students that need to be sorted into each house so the classes are fairly balanced

Good luck convincing the Hat of that.

******* My headcanon theory is that the hat is designed to round students into fairly even numbers for each of the founders to teach. Sure, if you're top of the list you might get put into the best match, but further down the list the hat starts using its second (or third) option more.

In Harry's year, they were possibly a bit short anyway - so when he REALLY doesn't want Slytherin at P, it's not that big a deal but when his son tries it, the hat is like 'Oh no, don't try making this a thing. I'm sick to the teeth of it'

**** (In England:) We were allowed to adjust our options on the first few days, of term. In fact, we explicitly couldn't take certain courses in Year 10 and Year 12 (plus we were advised to drop one course in Year 13) if we didn't get high enough marks in the prior year. Not for every course, but many of them were ring fenced.

Back when I was in school (not even 10 years ago), it was perfectly legal to leave at 6. So you didn't necessarily know who was coming back, either.
