** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045112/1/Oswald-the-Ottoman]])

voldemort is turned into an ottoman, hilarity ensues.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1006&amp;warning=4][/The Pandora Complex/ by Nimori]]

Snape finds out about Harry/Snape fanfiction, hufflepuff loses a boat load of points and Snape starts writing fanfiction. This one made me cry tears of laughters, I can't recommend it enough.

** linkffn(11496562)

Just finished reading this last night. It was really good and well-written. Granted, the author could've made it longer but I think its current length is perfect (nice twist at the end). First part can be a bit off-putting (the writing style is a bit unusual) but I really enjoyed it. It's not exactly a Hermione/Lucius story, as they never get together but it's a great character exploration, and it pretty much stays true to cannon as much as possible.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227825/1/Telling-Him][Telling Him]] is a cute little R/S vignette; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7850423/1/Five-flavours-Katie-Bell-likes-and-two-she-doesn-t][Five Flavours Katie Bell Likes and Two She Doesn't]] is a wonderful little Alicia/Katie vignette; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] is a brilliant work exploring exactly what it says in the title (it's 36K words, but I suppose that's not too far over, right?); [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942254/1/Penance][Penance]] is a crazy angsty little piece of Harry/Tonks that's hard to describe; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White][The Assassin Wore White]], which is a fantastic piece featuring Madam Pomfrey, and one of the oldest Katie/Alicia vignettes that's around - it's from 2007 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3357118/1/Come-Fly-With-Me][Come Fly With Me]], which is wonderfully written.
