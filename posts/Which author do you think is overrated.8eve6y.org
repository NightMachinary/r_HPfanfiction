*** I was going to write a big long rant about myself and how I'm a worthless PoS author who should stop writing forever but then I decided that was too much effort.

So instead I was going to link that plagiarist account and say something like 'everything this guy writes feels oddly familiar.' But then before I could be bothered to google whatever that account is named now my burrito bowl arrived for lunch and I ate it instead.
