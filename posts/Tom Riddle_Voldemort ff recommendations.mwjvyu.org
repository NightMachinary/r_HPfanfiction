:END:
May you guys please share with me your top tier Voldemort/ Tom Riddle ff? I have tried to read a couple but I stopped because I didn't liked the writing (they were too juvenile) and I don't know which ones are the best recommended. Which ones do you consider have the best writing, dialogue, character development, plot, etc.

Thank you for the recommendations!


** What type of fic are you looking for? I've been reading a lot of Tom Riddle/Voldemort fics but most have more of a focus on romance and I think they might fall under the ‚Äútoo juvenile‚Äù thing you don't want (also, what were were the fics you didn't like?)

One I can definitely recommend right away is linkao3(Either must die at the hand of the other by Metalomagnetic) it's really good. I love Voldemort's character in this!

There's another fic by the same author linkao3(Ouroboros by Metalomagnetic) thats kinda wild and really well written. It's kind of popular here right now but tbh the pairing made me a little uncomfortable so I stopped reading

I'd be happy to give some more recommendations but I've mostly been reading Voldemort and Harry or fem!Harry or OC pairing fics and there are some really good ones but I'm not sure what you'd like!

*** I tried to read kneel by JulieHoscar (it reminded me of filthy a dramonie fic by -babynaomi and of what the room requires, I didn't like those ones) and I just couldn't keep on reading it Zealous by MissDisenchanted Mind games by LiviCaroline (again too juvenile) Celestial Soul There's something about the vocabulary and how they are too descriptive about the physical of the main character and emphasize so much how she is different from everyone

Maybe slowburn, enemies to lovers with an interesting plot, setting, and well written. TR and fem reader but if you could also please share what you consider to be the top tier best tom riddle books, like really well written.

**** Ah okay I think I see the potential issue. Those fics are from wattpad and I've searched high and low for good Tom Riddle fics on wattpad and couldn't find anything to my standard either so I think I know what you'd like! (I also had Zealous in my library and couldn't get into it)

Slow burn, enemies to lovers, Tom Riddle with fem character is my favourite! Here are some you could try:

OC fics:

linkao3(Seven Devils by please_dont) - This is an OC-SI fic so the main character grew up in our modern day world and read the HP books and now mysteriously gets thrown into that reality. I made it sound lame, but it's SO good. The plot, the characterizations, just everything is so well done and well paced. The MC stays Muggle and at first I didn't want to read it because of that but honestly her being a Muggle made the story so much better she was still more powerful than many wizards.

linkao3(Hierarchy if Need by iimplicitt) an OC from Harry Potters time gets thrown back in time to Tom's seventh year. Literally the only complaint I have about this fic is sometimes the author doesn't hit enter when a new person speaks (my biggest pet peeve) but I found a way to ignore it because the story is so good. There's a lot going on in the plot and Toms character is exactly what I'd imagine he was like in canon. He's charming but psychotic and dangerous and the OC senses it and doesn't like him. My favourite thing about this fic is the gradual build up to the two of them realizing they like each other, or to when she realizes his Voldemort, these things that we know are inevitable but the author drags it out deliciously it's amazing in my opinion

linkao3(Catharsis by daffydarling) - almost exactly like the Hierarchy of Need but I liked this one less. I thought Hierarchy of Need was done way better but if you like that then you'll like this too.

FemHarry fics:

linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles) - this is a really popular femHarry x Voldemort fic where Harry and Voldemort dream share and start to get close and she finds out his reason for becoming a dark lord is not all that everyone made it seem.

linkao3(When Harry Met Tom) - Hands down one of the BEST Tom Riddle fics Ive ever read. It's funny almost in a crack way but the plot is amazing. Basically Harry accidentally travels to the past and everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong. She tries to stay away from Tom but he gets intrigued and Tom falling in love with Harry is one of the funniest things ever. Lots going on in the plot, there's a curveball in like every chapter

linkao3(Appetence by elysian_drops) - one of my FAVOURITE femHarry x Voldemort fics, I'm literally obsessed with it. Voldemort finds out Harry is a horcrux when he's resurrected and his plans change. Very interesting take on Voldemort in power but at the Ministry through an alias. The author wrote this Voldemort really well, he's always scheming and has ulterior motives for everything he does, often cleverly disguising it as something Harry decides to do for herself. But he's good to her in the sense that he cares for her and wants all the best things for her but if you squint, the only reason he cares for her is because she's his horcrux, a part of him, and if that's not the most Voldemort thing ever then idk what is. (Highly highly recommend this one).

Those are some of my faves that I can think of off the top of my head. Sorry for the long paragraphs about each fic, I tend to ramble üò≠ I hope some of these interest you and you enjoy them like I did! :)

  ‚ÄúAre you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?‚Äù Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.‚ÄúNo, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.‚Äù‚ÄúI assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,‚Äù said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. ‚ÄúI just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.‚Äù‚ÄúYou speak of remorse,‚Äù Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. ‚ÄúIf I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --‚Äù‚ÄúNot Voldemort,‚Äù she interrupted. ‚ÄúTom.‚Äù‚ÄúYou are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.‚Äù Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

  In the throes of the second wizarding war, Delilah Meddows is killed by no other than Lord Voldemort. However, instead of dying like she was supposed to, Delilah finds herself at Hogwarts in 1943. She tries to tread carefully, but Tom Riddle is not someone so easily ignored.

  "The people who often times do terrible things, are the same ones who have had terrible things done to them."After Lord Voldemort murdered Harry Potter in the Battle of Hogwarts, the world became plagued with a darkness unlike anything it had seen before. Muggles were slaughtered in the streets, the Dark wizard's opponents were executed for show, and all those who had fought with the Order were forced into hiding. Avalon Hendrix had lost everything- her friends, her peers, her loved ones. Everything. So, when she was thrown back in time to 1943, she knew that it was up to her to change the course of time and rewrite a new history- one in which she must find the Horcruxes and murder Tom Riddle before he could ever become Voldemort. Tom Riddle.Avalon Hendrix.Either she was going to kill him, or he was going to kill everyone she loved. They were nothing more than two products of extreme circumstance that chose two very different paths, yet had time for their roads to converge. ‚Ä¢WARNING‚Ä¢ This book contains themes and scenes that are intended for a mature audience.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED ‚ô°]

#+begin_quote
  Appetence--- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might--- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.

** Ah here we go...

We'll start of with the classic linkffn(The Dark Lord Exposed by Hplover4ever3). This is Canon Voldemort's life fully explored. It shows his manipulation of his school ‚Äòfriends' into fully fledged Death Eaters, complications with Dumbledore, Horcux's, psychological issues, Charisma, everything. This fic really gets you inside the mind of Lord Voldemort. One of my all time favourites.

Linked in previous comment, but its so good have to recommend it again linkao3(Ouroboros by Metalomagnetic). It does have a bit of M/M so far which wasn't warned on the FFN where I original found the story but ahhh... Anyway it where Voldemort travels back in time to raise his younger self. Lord Voldemort(Marvolo, like 70) resuces Tom(like 6) from the orphanage and over time you see the differences it makes in young Tom Riddle as he is influenced by his older self.

Tom doesn't know that Voldemort is actually himself and see's him as his ‚Äòdad'. Tom is very keen on getting his ‚Äòfathers' attention but Lord Voldemort being the stoic Dark Lord he is, is very hard to impress and not familar with raising a child.

Both Voldemort's are written extremely well,the plot moves at a good pace and the suspense grips you.

However if the Voldemort/Voldemort relationship gets too deep i'll stop reading like the original recommender.

linkffn(Light of the Moon by Maloreiy). Very AU, but the twist is amazing.

linkffn(Tom, just Tom by Ciule). Lord Voldemort Time Travels into the year 2000, after everyone thinks they are safe.... This fic really brings out the manipulative and possesive sides of LV. His cunning is top tier in this.

Hermione/Tom Riddle linkffn(Your Secret to Collect by Tempest E. Dashon) AU kind of mysterious fic where HG converses with a young Tom Riddle and its like a Benjamin Button situation......

Hmm thought I would have more but they are either incomplete, I forgot to favourite them or LV is not the main main character.

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

  Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr was not someone that anyone wanted to get close to or trust. He was known for being cold and ruthless and unyielding. That is until he meets one untamed and unafraid witch who enjoys watching his temper as she says anything she likes to him. Savior or Destroyer...he was not sure but he was determined to find out.
