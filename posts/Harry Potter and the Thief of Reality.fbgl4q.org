Hey guys so I made my very first fanfic recently and wanted some feedback. I know the first chapter is short but this is the summary and link:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13512299/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Thief-of-Reality]]

Harry Potter is enjoying the Quidditch World Cup before the start of his fourth year at Hogwarts when he notices a boy his age stealing something suspicious from Lucius Malfoy. How will his future change now that a sketchy thief he does not trust begins attending Hogwarts. The thief seems to have bad blood with Dumbledore as well causing problems where he can.
