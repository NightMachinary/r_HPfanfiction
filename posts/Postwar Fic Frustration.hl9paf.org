I've been reading a bunch of HPFF the last few days and while I'm overall learning and loving the various takes on postwar life for the characters in HP, one thing is becoming common and a bit frustrating.

Of the fics (and I've purposely focused on postwar because I just finished DH again and wanted to keep the story alive) I've realized alot of authors make the Golden Trio /extra/ weepy postwar. Maybe its just an interpretation thing but I read one where Hermione is literally crying everytime she's in scene. Another where the entire Weasley family takes turn having a bawl, another where everyone is on the cusp of weeping/just finished weeping/or headed to weep.

As I said, its all interpretation but I never thought of the Golden Trio after everything they've gone through, to process the weight of everything by bawling their eyes out every other day. Harry, imo, would be best at keeping it reigned in while still feeling the things he needs to feel. Ron would lean on his family as he always does though he is never described in canon as a crier. Hermione would definitely cry at times but I never saw her as an emotional wreck of a person. In fact, I always thought she processed death and the horrible things they went through the best considering she (like Harry) didn't have her own family or a reserve group of friends to lean on.

Idk, maybe I'm being hyper critical. Im currently reading "The First Day" and I'm a dozen or so chapters in. I like it but it doesn't have much momentum. "The Sum of their Parts" was the first fic I read to start this marathon off and it was legit fantastic. The ending left a bit to be desired but still a great read.

Any suggestions on a solid postwar fic where everyone isn't a weepy mess?


** "The Sum of Their Parts" is one of my top favorites too.

Other postwar fics in which nobody is a weeping mess:

[[https://wwwfanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052$: Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. Voldemort is still around, but gets derailed by "that fucker".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. They meet a good Tom Riddle and new villains.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the Battle, a Hermione from another dimension asks for help. The Trio and Ginny once more enter the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Head Auror Harry Potter uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492): Neville disagrees with his friends's aggressive reform agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry, who was raised by Sirius and never went to Hogwarts, hires Ginny to accompany on some postwar adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Ultimate takedown of the atrocious marriage law trope. You will like it too if you like "The Sums". Ron is the true hero of this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628): My own one shot for the Battle's 20 year anniversary. Harry speaks from a position of confidence and strength.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595): Dudley has a witch daughter and asks Harry for help.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): My favorite canon compliant postwar fic, part of a massive 85+ story series. This one depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Beautiful Harry/Hermione one shot 19 years later, set in Alaska.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Still the only non crossover “Wizards in space” story. Lots of problems, but still worth reading imho.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]], linkffn(4356667): Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia' in Magical Britain. Narrated by Lucius Malfoy and very ironic.

*** Most of these I haven't even heard of. Thanks for the suggestions!

Strangers at Drakeshaugh was the next on my list. I've heard nothing but good things.

Children's Crusade was pretty good. I liked the H/G connection and how the 2 main couples had healthy well rounded relationships years after the BoH. The ending felt a bit rushed though. The magical item at the center of the story got a little too deus ex machina for my taste.

I wonder what you thought of Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution? I couldn't get into it because the plot seemed too farfetched. Kingsley as a former Auror and OooP member, is the person who decides to enact Rape Law rather than focus all his energies on rebuilding Wizarding society? Threw me way off

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** Eh, some people cry a lot when dealing with trauma. There's a point to where it's just an unrealistic response to trauma in general, sure, but I'd argue those authors would still write unrealistic responses even if you swapped in drinking or sex or whatever for crying. But it's also not unheard of to find yourself crying more often in the aftermath of a traumatic experience - and to be mystified by the fact that it's happening too.

*** I agree. I wouldn't want to read a fic about postwar where /no one/ is outwardly emotional. Thats unrealistic. I think the setting of stories postwar is just ripe fruit for authors who want to delve into the emotional and mental traumas the characters have gone and continue to go through. I appreciate it for what it is. After a few though I feel like I need a new take on postwar. Something a little grittier and unexpected.
