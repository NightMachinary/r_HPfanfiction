so i have tried writing fics but theyve been scrapped and ive come up with an idea that i really like and would like to know what you think concept: so people say hogwarts is sentient or like a living being write? so it would be about hogwarts creating a charater that she (hogwarts is a she, like boats, it just sounds right) raises and keeps away from the staff and is essentially a secret until harrys first year where adventures happen. i dont havr any concrete stuff for whatll happen after that but yea its the basic premise, so lemme know what u think about it and what could happen with it


** So long as you work /really/ hard on your spelling compared to that post (no offense)... yeah! Sounds like a great idea!
