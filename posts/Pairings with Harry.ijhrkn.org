What are your least favourite Harry X _____ pairing? Not counting slash btw

Edit: it's least favourite


** It mostly depends on how they are written.

For example, I strongly dislike Harry with Ice Queen Daphne, but there are a few exceptions I enjoy very much.

I was first turned off by Harry/Bellatrix, but "Delenda Est" changed my mind.

While I do like Harry/Ginny the best, there are so many garbage fics with that pairing that it's very very disappointing.

But I find Harry/Susan fics to be the most disappointing, because most (if not all) of them use her aunt Amelia as a plot device to solve things the easy way.

*** Love Harry/Ginny, but I agree that there are too many bad fics about them. Disappointing, really

** Least favourite is controversial. I can't handle Harry/Hermione.

That said, Harry/Bellatrix is also bad, but more widely accepted as such. These fics are easy to avoid, though, so they don't bother me. But Harry/Hermione fics are everywhere, and I find it super annoying

**** It is always the same story. Harry meets Daphne who is kinda a dick but she eventually becomes nicer and they fall in love.

The associated tropes are also not that great:

- Child politicians

- Ancient and Noble Houses/Wizard customs

- "House Greengrass has always been neutral, other that that one uncle we don't talk about"

- Marriage Contracts

** Harry/fleur is my favorite but I also enjoy harry/susan bones and harry/daphne. And anything with girls that arent major players usually. Su Li Lisa Turpin and the like. Harry/pansy is also fun depending on how its written

**** Su li is hard to find outside of harem but White knight Grey queen by jeconais is probably one of the best harry/pansy

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/]]

Linkao3(maybe they did know what they were doing) is also really good but incomplete currently

** I usually dislike most of the "pedo ship" (Tonk, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Amelia . . .), but there are pretty good stories with these ships (and time travel is a good way to get ride of the age difference).

Still, I think Harmony is the ship I dislike the most. I know I'm missing some excellent stories but I just can't stand Hermione anymore.

** Honks, ten years or so difference is just too much, and most of those stories are plot-free. (The same goes for Harry/Fleur)

Of course, I completely ignore the paedophilie/nonsensical ones (Harrymort, Bellatrix, Narcissa, etc.).

I don't care much about the less frequent ones (Daphne G., Susan Bones ... I still believe it could be written well, I have just never found one).

I have to say Harmony slides down and down in my preferences. I don't think it is a bad idea as such, but the bashing is just draining and plot is usually horrible.

So, I have to admit that lately I am returning back to Hinny and appreciate it most. There are many stories which are just interesting, well written, with good plot. And the other ones can be skipped.

** Ginny.... Looking at you, JK...

That's the main one at least. Some slash pairing ones I don't like. Tonks is another one. Not as a high as Ginny but up there. Any woman over xx years paired with Harry.
