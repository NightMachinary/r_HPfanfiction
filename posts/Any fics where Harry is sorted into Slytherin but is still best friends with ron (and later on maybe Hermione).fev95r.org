  HPDM slash. Draco wants to know what would have happened if Harry had been Sorted into Slytherin. He wants to know more than may be quite good for him.

And you need to remember how he was raised. Imagine if you were an 11 year old and told that the guy you were friends with was a nazi. Would you stick around.

It doesn't matter if he was a Slytherin or not. And Ron is not as prejudice as Draco lmao. He wasn't raised to believe that all Slytherins are bad and there is literally no proof from the book that he even thought they all were. All we know is that he hated Malfoy and his "friends" because they literally bullied him for being poor and a "blood traitor".
