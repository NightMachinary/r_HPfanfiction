** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

It's hard to explain without spoiling anything. But while fic isn't at all focused on Harry making a Horcrux(s)...Harry makes a horcrux in the final battle right before losing to Voldemort and survives because of that.He still does.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
