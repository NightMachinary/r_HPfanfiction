I'm looking for fic That has an OC or maybe Harry Ron Hermione or even Sirius maybe Ted Tonks any character really that is part of the UK aristocracy and uses it against the pure life. Blue blood vs Blueblood. An OC character that is part of the noblility or royal family of the UK of the muggle worldthat gets a Hogwarts letter, and they take on the pure bloods. Basically a fanfic about a Muggleborn aristocrat that goes to Hogwarts.


** I bet someone has filled in the details about Justin Finch-Fletchley, the canon muggleborn aristocrat Hogwarts student.

I have P.G. Wodehouse-style aristocrats, which may or may not be what you're looking for, in my fic:

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

***** If you have been having a problem with source material or time period drug manufacturing there is an interesting series from the bbc about pharmacies and how the drug industry kind of developed in the United Kingdom in the Edwardian era so between like 1902 to 1934 I think .

** It's not really going against pure life, but Royal Ward by Catsftaff on Ao3 is super good, though harry hasn't made it to hogwarts yet.
