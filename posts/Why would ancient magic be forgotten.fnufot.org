Inspired by this post that prompts stories based on this - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fnsy86/harry_spends_his_summer_studying_ancient_magic/]]

We get a lot of 'SuperPowerfulHarry, Second Merlin and Newest Dumbledore, Grand Magus of all Forgotten Knowledge and preserver of Ancient Tomes left down the back of the sofa' fics with Harry learning incredibly powerful ancient magic that, for reasons not often explained, is not taught in modern Magical Schools despite being more powerful and/or effective.

It's usually used because it's an easy in-world-sounding way to boost Harry up to 'SuperHarry, Merlin, Dumbledore, Sofa, etc' status and the reasons for those old magics being forgotten are rarely explained. But... those reasons could be pretty interesting stuff to make a story out of.

So, what might those reasons be? Why would old magic be forgotten or disposed of, despite being more powerful? They can be good reasons or bad reasons, logical and rational or emotive and feeling based, whatever works. I'm just curious what rationale y'all can come up with.

Any fics that deal with that are welcome to be recc'ed too - as always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** I can think of a few that are on the more plausible side, and you could even combine them.

1. Magical society as we know it developed during a time period where Christianity was rife and magic would be seen as satanic and blasphemous. It's not hard for me to imagine that a lot of things may have been lost in clashes between Muggles and Wizards, or that certain things might have been hidden away for safekeeping. You also have to consider that there was a lot of violence and things like the Black Plague that also could contribute to the loss of magical knowledge.
2. Wizarding society would have been very spread out and communication limited. Various secrets and forms of magic wouldn't have been widespread as it is, and I don't think a lot of wizards and witches would have up for sharing 'trade' secrets so to speak. You'd want to pass it down to your children or apprentices. Not some rando off the street.\\
3. I find entirely plausible the Ministry collected, destroyed, or suppressed much of it in order to cement it's own power. Could be how the Unspeakables got started in an AU fic.
4. Purebloods could have hoarded it for centuries and guarded it jealousy. Ancient magic is a source of power and I don't see a family like the Blacks or Mafloys giving that up.
5. If you really wanted to spice things up. Perhaps much of what is considered 'dark magic' is just really exceptionally powerful magic that could threaten the Ministry or make one wizard too powerful. It'd make a powerful incentive to make it vanish. Could tie into reason 3.

** In Merlin's case... I would follow the general idea that Merlin had one pupil who either killed him or petrified him and then went to live in a lake. Anything Merlin specifically knew is therefore a dead end.

With the Peverells... two of them died pretty quickly and the third seems to have actively hidden the knowledge. Or they actually did meet Death.

So... that leaves the Founders, basically.

I subscribe to a theory that the Founders alone could actually use the magic, I came up with this idea to reconcile how Nurmengard worked: even if Hermione etc. could figure out how it was made, they're not Grindelwald, Voldemort or Dumbledore so there's not much hope of actually succeeding in using the spellwork. It's a bit like how everyone is impressed by Harry's patronus: teenage wizards ought not be able to succeed with the charm.

There's no particular need to explain why there's sometimes very powerful wizards and why there isn't. Hell, it might be a roughly 1000 year cycle given that Grindelwald, Dumbledore and Voldemort are all roughly contemporaries.

Other explanations include:

- deliberately not sharing the knowledge (I mean, do Dumbledore or Voldemort ever really share their ideas? nope)
- magic is kind of alive and acts to preserve chaos so not everything can be learnt but must instead be constantly (re)discovered
- it's no longer useful magic and certain kinds of modern magic would get the same reaction in the past (i.e. seem very powerful but not helpful)

*** Within Britain, I think Merlin and the Founders would have some of their own magics that have been lost over time - and that, should someone get access to their 'notes' or some other connection, it could be possible to get some info. (Eg, Merlin might have had just Viviane as a student, but presumably there'd still be some notes, journal, or creation that could be researched - for the Founders, Slytherin has his chamber, and the others could either have similar ones, or just have their artifacts/enchantments studied to figure out their spellwork, even if it took /ages/).

There's also the option of taking a non-British wizard - Flamel, for instance, is French and has his own secrets. That could be taken in Europe or outside of it for other options from where we could draw knowledge or inspiration from.

**** Well, yes. But I think the bigger limiting factor is, for the want of a better term, lack of personal power to imitate Merlin etc.

Which, of course, wouldn't mean an inability to understand what they were doing and, perhaps, a capacity to draw different but still useful results from those notes were they to be discovered.

This is basically the way I've explained Azkaban's reforms in my own fic. They're trying to recreate Nurmengard but Grindelwald didn't leave any notes so they've tried reverse engineering it. And even then power is a limiting factor.

I do like the idea of reverse-engineering things and not quite being able to manage it - though I think canonically Azkaban was pre-Grindelwald, I'm not sure about it specifically.

(Yes, there is a bit more... I just haven't written and/or typed the bits that go between what I've been working on and what's online. Might do that now, actually.)

In terms of canon... the concept is that they had to buff Azkaban's security after getting rid of the Dementors so they turned to the only other known wizarding prison in Europe, i.e. Nurmengard.

** I like to imagine it's the same reason microwave food is so popular.

Someone came up with a version of a spell that was easier to do, but at the sacrifice of lasting power, or perhaps strength. It caught on as a convenience, or perhaps it was easier to hide from muggles. It grew over time to where no one was interested in the longer\harder\more tiring versions and so they faded with time.

Perhaps the reason the patronus can't be cast by most adults is simply because no one is willing to put in the effort required, unlike the DA for instance who were all highly motivated and mostly successful.

** I've always liked the idea of Old Magic being more druidic or something then the wave and mutter modern spell casting is.

Say for example a group of villagers and a wizard preform a ritual to Magic or Gaia for a harvest blessing or for protection from raiders. In turn for a sacrifice of faith and (maybe blood) said village could get a more plentiful harvest or maybe the predators of the nearby woods leave the village alone only to instead set there sights on any would be trouble makers.

** There's a lot of ways to handle it - and it depends on the angle you're coming at it from. For instance, there's a major trope in fantasy of magic dying out, getting weaker - and we see that reflected in the HP fandom, with a good number of fics using that as some background.

Often in that trope, it's almost a property of magic for that to be the case - or it's just assumed that we've been falling from a golden age of magic steadily. In those, I don't think there really /needs/ to be an explanation as to why magic is going down - because it's kind of necessary for the ambiance/feel.

If going for another approach, there are some ways that magic could get lost over time.

*Culture* - we know from canon that different cultures will have different ways of using magic - eg, that wand magic is not ubitiquous around the world, and they might not all use the same methods. That tells me that Europe would not have been immune to that - and that pre-wand, or pre-unification of magical theory/thought, there would have been a wider variation of magic available, much of which would have been discarded or just not been useful for many people. Powerful magic in this view might have gotten lost in the scuffle, because it would require learning an entirely different discipline of magic. (Think of how few people seem to use alchemy, despite how powerful it could be).

*Ease of use + Flexibility* - Wand magic seems to be quick and convenient - what you'd want in magic, usually. The average person would value that consistency and ease - but older magic could be much more different. Think of things like rituals - they might need to be performed at a specific time, part of the day/year, use seemingly weird/random elements, days or weeks of preparation, etc. The boost in power - theoretical as it might be - could be outdone by the difficulty of use and amount of time it takes to perform.

*Danger* - danger to the user is another easy take. Extremely powerful magic - but with a heavy downside - is something that could easily have fallen into disuse. For instance, a ritual that might make you as powerful as Dumbledore... or leave you dead 99/100 times. That one probably wouldn't see much use, despite the potential power! Older magic might corrupt the mind, cause you to have to sacrifice parts of yourself, or require other terrible losses.

*Families* - some magic could be tied to secrets held by specific families, or magics - like in the Chamber of Secrets, only people who could speak parseltongue can enter. If Slytherin - a brilliant wizard - had stored all the discoveries he'd made in there and never taught anyone directly, that knowledge would easily be lost. Families could hoard magic and rituals as power, and then let them slowly fall into disuse for other reasons above.

Two fics that I think handled it in interesting ways are linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), which I think I've mentioned to you before - in that one, the ancient magic in question is blood rituals/runes, and the cost is danger to the self (most wizards in the past died in the process), danger to the mind (Harry is... somewhat unhinged when in the throes of the rituals), being generally illegal, and lack of flexibility (once performed, the specifics can't change).

The second interesting look that comes to my mind is in the linkffn(Denarian Renegade) series - it's a crossover with the Dresden Files (which I haven't read), but in the later parts of the fic it shows off Dumbledore's knowledge of magic - and one such forgotten magic is tied to words and beliefs - and by forcing themselves into some other state, to some lost race or creature or such, a wizard can /temporarily/ make themselves able to utter a word of power that has a large impact - it's effectively like casting a spell from a completely different technique, species, and background. The reason it's mostly forgotten is, well - it's almost impossible to do, to put yourself in the mind of the other being. It comes in a bit later, though - and I think part of the interest/theory likely stems from the crossover nature meaning the author had to describe the peculiarities of magic.

If, rather than simply isolating, they'd invented new stuff and revolutionised their society all to enable them to hide. A wand might make some small spells less flashy and be unable to cast the bigger stuff.
