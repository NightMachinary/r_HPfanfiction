Looking for the best fics wherein the Golden Trio are in a relationship together. Just the three of them, no other partners. Preferably where each of the three is romantically involved with the other and not where two of the three are competing for the other. Thanks. Also preferably longer fics as opposed to shorter ones.

But the main plot is about fighting against zombie battleship BismarckMort, with the help of recalled HMS Hood.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
