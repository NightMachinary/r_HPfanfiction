ok i really want to read a good slow burn fic that's not too long cus i don't have a lot of free time (or multiple, idk), but i feel like i've read all the decent ones. pls assist, im desperate for some recommendations.


** Linkffn(in spite of obstinate men) and its sequel Linkffn(in spite of appearances) Are both really good. One of if bit the best harry/fleur I've ever read. Sadly the author has yet to complete in spite of appearances but hes known to come back to a fic after a long time to complete it.
