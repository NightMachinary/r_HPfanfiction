If fanfiction is to be believed, all the purebloods, with the exception of the Weasleys and the Gaunts, live in manors. Which I find kind of uninspired, not to mention unrealistic, because everyone (or even most wizards) cannot be as rich as the Malfoys.

I wish there was more variety in fics. Structures that defy gravity? Ordinary houses that are much bigger on the inside? Towers and walking or even flying houses?

How do you imagine different wizarding homes and what fics have the most imaginative ideas?


** The Malfoys only have a manor because one of their ancestors cronied up to a Muggle king and was ennobled as a reward. The Malfoys are at the top end of wealth in wizarding society. Voldemort chose to use their house as a bed and breakfast because it was the nicest out of all of his followers', and had plenty of space, including a dungeon.

I think it's more realistic for purebloods to have inherited a comfy normal-sized house and garden that is 200-500 years old, has a few extension charms on the inside, and a bunch of magical knickknacks collected over the years. Similar to the Black Family's Grimmauld Place house, but on the edge of a small village and not in the middle of a Muggle city. Grimmauld Place (in its heyday) seems like a better example of an upper-average wizarding home, although the only other ones that are described in the books are the Burrow and the Lovegoods' tower.

*** Yes, you are right about the Malfoys. Probably only a couple of families have properties that big.

I've always liked the idea of the Lovegoods' tower and I wish more fics had something like that. Granted, the Lovegoods are one of the more eccentric families, but between them and the Weaslety, unusual houses are probably not that unusual in mostly-wizarding villages. My headcanon is that the Diggory's house looks sort of like a hobbit mound.

There was also another piece of shit (more or less literally) where she said that wizards didn't use toilets till the 18th century, they just pooped where they were standing and used vanishing spells...

Oh, and wiz Britain's population is 3000. You know, because a society that's the equivalent of a tiny, tiny village absolutely needs a Ministry with super specialised departments. Each Quidditch team in the league has just an average of 200 fans according to this nonsense.

As for the Malfoys, look, one single favour with a King carrying them through several centuries is...It's never going to happen. One of my ancestors a few generations back (in the early 19th century) was supposedly "a man of great value" to our Kings, but that wealth and favour dried out long before my father was born (in the middle of the 20th century). Wealth never lasts, not unless the family actively does their best in creating more wealth.

I think you need to read up on the Norman conquest of England. Lucius didn't just do a "favour" for any old King. He assisted William the Conqueror in his conquest of England and was rewarded with land. The aristocracy created by William did indeed last centuries and is the root of the current English aristocracy. William basically redistributed the entirety of England's land to his barons following the invasion, and said barons became enormously wealthy as a result.

With respect to your ancestor, their achievement does not sound at all comparable to being a feudal lord who owns an entire swathe of a country. That is the kind of wealth that self-perpetuates itself (and generates a huge income).

My ancestors were already minor feudal lords on both sides of my family, and this particular one was a minister in the kingdom - they were quite prosperous and were quite wealthy, but all it takes for all that to go away is an uncontrollable drinking problem, or a gambling one. Or both. Wealth is quite possibly the easiest thing to lose.

I dunno, depends on how literally you take it. I doubt she meant they would just squat in the middle of a conversation. Rather it's more likely that if they were alone and capable of the vanishing spell, they would do so.

All they kept from the king was a manor. She didn't say the Malfoys have all their gold from that king. Why do you think the Malfoys never made more gold on their own?

Fair enough on the population stuff. She's always been shit with numbers and math. All in all, there's not that many things she's been stupid about. Not saying she hasn't said silly and even ridiculous things, but much of it is years old and is just one of a few examples.

You said that the Malfoys were wealthy only because of the favour from the English King in your first comment.

The initial gold would have helped them establish themselves, but they would never have been as wealthy as they are in canon without members of their family adding to that wealth. I mean, Lucius buys 7 top-of-the-line racing brooms (ones that international players used before the Firebolt is released) to get his son on a school team.

That kind of wealth is immense.

From what we know, TMR was the only one to access the Chamber. And when he does open the Chamber, the entrance is exactly where it is in 1993 - inside a bathroom.

Slytherin's earlier descendants, the Gaunts, are exactly the kind of people who'd open the Chamber and unleash the basilisk if they'd found it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is a rather bizarre thing to wonder.

Albus is an academician, he published his earlier discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood which he worked with the Flamels for. He's also published several other papers in /Transfiguration Today/, starting from his school days. Why wouldn't he publish a modification to an already existing charm?

Besides, there's the fact that Voldemort expects Snape to deliver on his role as a spy. Just names of Order members and their details won't cut it for too long. Voldemort is also not someone who would ever shy away from more magical knowledge, especially something as useful as the communication modification.

Also, here's some more pure-hearted retcon BS about the Patronus.

#+begin_quote
  Illyius cast the Patronus Charm when his village was being attacked by the Dark wizard Raczidian and his army of Dementors. Despite the mouse's diminutive size, it shone with a brilliant light, bringing the Dementors to a halt as it nimbly moved through the ranks of fleeing villagers. Enraged, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself, and tried to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent, but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell. Maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his entire body. The villagers hailed Illyius as a hero.

The Patronus charm is now like the Flying Nimbus lmao.

#+end_quote

Sorry, my bad. But what do you mean they didn't say that? This is the statement : "The Malfoys only have a manor because one of their ancestors cronied up to a Muggle king and was ennobled as a reward."

That statement pretty much suggests that their wealth and property is only from the ennoblement - that they didn't build a new one, but instead kept living in their original house for roughly 900 years.

Dumbledore didn't invent trans-species transfiguration. He wrote a paper on it. That's literally all. And he wrote it while he was still a student at Hogwarts. So not only was he not a leader in a war at the time, not only were there no Death Eaters at the time, but it was just a paper on an already existing branch of magic.

** You have to reconcile that with the idea that the Weasleys aren't wealthy, but apparently own quite a bit of land. Their house is shabby, but is held together by magic. So, clearly, they have access to enough property that it implies that wizarding residential areas are underpopulated and open, despite being within a short distance of a Muggle town. Space isn't at a premium, so 'bigger on the inside' houses aren't especially necessary (and the fact that the Weasleys borrowed the tent that's larger on the inside from someone who apparently took camping seriously implies that that charm isn't cheap or easy to reproduce).

The Burrow does defy gravity, a bit. On the other hand, almost everything you're describing would be the affair of the wealthy. People like the Malfoys tend to prefer a more stoic, dignified manor to a walking house (which, I imagine, would have to stay in certain areas anyway because it could be seen by Muggles).

We see in Hogwarts that non-Euclidian architecture is unusual and noteworthy. The Ministry has elevators that move horizontally and vertically.

I think Baba Yaga is confirmed canon by way of Chocolate Frog cards? She had a walking house. I seem to recall a couple fics where Durmstrang's ship and the Beauxbaton carriage have expanded housing inside them, and both of them clearly travel. Extravagant ships would be the most canon-fitting way to have a magical abode without Muggles noticing, I feel.

So, I guess the most interesting magical home would be a sort of mega-luxury cruiseliner. Perhaps Muggles see a ghost ship, when it's in fact a mobile community. Perhaps call it 'Atlantis II', after the first one sank in antiquity (giving Muggles who overheard the survivors talking about it a very strange idea of what was happening).

** Apparently, per a similar discussion in another forum on the same topic, manors are very common in Britain. Apparently most of them are hold overs from when they were the home of the local lord, or land owner, and quite a few of them are fairly small affairs. The concept of the massive manor is more the extreme case than the rule.

** I don't think you really need a 'magic' house, in fact its probably more trouble than its worth as magic can fail or have unpredictable reactions.

Having said that, with magic it should be very easy for wizards to have a fairly nice mundane home. Like it is for kids to make a fort in the woods.

Step 1: Find some land, it doesn't have to be good land or well located as wizards have near instant travel and muggles have plenty for the taking.

Step 2: Transfigure rocks and trees into cut stone and lumber. Then assembles the pieces using magic, levitation charms are probably very useful.

Step 3: Furnish your house. Furniture can be transfigured as can most appliances, those that cannot can easily be replicated with some charms.

***** Well, yes, that's my point, but fandom likes to come up with all those Potter/Black/Greengrass/Prince manors.

** Yeah, that makes no sense. I mean, look at the Black family - a pureblood family just like the Malfoys, but they lived in an ordinary house in London - just one that was concealed from Muggles by magic.

I personally believe Grimmauld Place is a better indicator of how the majority of wizarding families live than Malfoy Manor. I mean, the Malfoys are stated to be abnormally wealthy in the wizarding community. The closest comparison I can make off the top of my head is the Koch family in the United States. They are in all likelihood the */only/* wizarding family with that kind of wealth and resources.

I mean, to use another example, James Potter inherited a pretty sizable fortune but there's no indication that he and his family lived in any kind of mansion. Rather, it seemed like it was a normal-sized single-family home.

Wow, I didn't know this was a thing, and now I'm probably going down the Pinterest rabbit hole for the next hour :)

I imagine Durmstrang as a castle on a fjord, definitely in Scandinavia and not in Eastern Europe, so I really dislike the movie version. It's also funny when people place it in Bulgaria because of Krum and have the temperature be subzero all the time. I read a fic once where Durmstrang was rebuilt in XX century in Bauhaus style, and it worked for the story, but also sucked the magic out of it a bit.

***** Yeah, the castle was destroyed by Grindelwald forces, and was rebuilt like that, basically. I think it was Albus/Scorpius fic, and Scorpius was transferred there. There was a lot of angst and a cold utilitarian box fitted the mood, but I'm happy to forget all about that fic.

Death, Taxes, and Magic is an interesting take on Durmstrang! And the author certainly did their research :)
