So, I vaguely remember a time travel fanfic where Harry travels back in time. I don't remember anything outside the ending, so spoilers kinda...Help finding it is appreciated!

Basically, theres a great battle at Hogwarts, featuring Death Eaters + DE allies like trolls invading the grounds. The Forbidden Forest residents helps the Hogwart-ians -- Centaurs and spiders alike. For protection or maybe healing, Harrys relatives are in the Hospital Wing. All those stucked in the wing help against the invasion by throwing items (bed pins...beds...) out the window (Dudley's idea, I think...) . When all is over, Harry goes missing. Harrys ends up recuperating with vampires and, a few weeks/monthers later, meets up with Remus and Sirius in disguise to tell them he's alive. There was a sequel, featuring slash between Harry and a vampire, but that was discontinued.

** Anyone? I think there is a scene where Harry talks to Sirius and/or Remus in the Room of Requirement if that helps; and I think it was about Harry's mental health if I am not mistaken. Also, was definitely on fanfiction.net.
