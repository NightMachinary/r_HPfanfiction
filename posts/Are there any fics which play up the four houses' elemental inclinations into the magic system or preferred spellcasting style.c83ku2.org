That is, how in canon & certain supporting material Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw & Hufflepuff are implicitly and/or explicitly associated with fire, water, air and earth respectively.


** The Firebird Trilogy explicitly ties the four houses to the four elements, though it's more of a personality thing and there are extremely extensive AU elements at play. It's the deconstruction of harem fics no one was asking for.

Prince of Slytherin mentions the elements in the martial arts chapter.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]
