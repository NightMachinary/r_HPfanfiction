:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fanfic where harry goes back in time and takes himself from his aunt doorstep. I remember he becomes a famous spellcrafter/enchanter that has a business called patter industries or something. He ends up using a spell to change his looks and pretends to be James' bastard half brother I believe. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** You seem to be thinking of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6573724/][Beyond the Breaking Point]]. The name of his business was "Porter Enchantments". Sadly it's a dead fic that looked to have a lot of promise but never got much farther than the set-up part of the plot.

  Certain that he'd been about to die, Harry is mystified to find himself alive and healthy, and somehow in 1981. Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.
