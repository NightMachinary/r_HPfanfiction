Please beware that this fic linkao3(19381933) features torture, rape and paedophilia and if you feel perturbed by these deeds, you will be better off not reading this fanfic.

The Premise

In canon, Ginerva Molly Weasley is a teenager who loved her family and Harry Potter, and who in her sixth year had led Dumbledore's Army when Hogwarts was terrorized by the Carrows. But it is also canon that in her first year, Ginny Weasley trusted a certain Tom Riddle who possessed her, the Diary horcrux having the compulsion charm to make nearby persons write in it. What if the diary's spells outlast its destruction? What if Ginny Weasley still loved Tom Riddle? This fanfic explored this theme and like most of fanfiction, it is a rewrite of books 5,6 and 7. Books 3 and 4 are canon-compliant save from Ginny's perspective.

The Plot

The main theme of this story is Ginny's gradual downward spiral to insanity that is caused by the diary horcrux. This fic can be thought of as an example of butterfly effect, the diary's lingering spell being the proverbial butterfly that flapped its wings.

In Ginny's second year, she struggled to come to terms with her feelings for Tom Riddle, inspite of knowing his true identity as Lord Voldemort, and she indulges in self-harm as she couldn't stop loving Voldemort. Her family tried to comfort her, yet she couldn't help but feel distant from the rest of them. However, sometime in her second year, at the tender age of twelve, she commits herself to serve Lord Voldemort, and having kept that in mind; she asks her brothers for help to sneak in the Restricted Section to learn the Dark Arts,and she practiced duelling with one of her friends.

Meanwhile, her family tried their best to cheer them up, by talking to her and also by offering to play chess with her (It was Ron) . Ron even offered her a ride in Harry's firebolt ( as Ginny loved Quidditch ), though Ginny deeply loathed Harry for depriving her of the Diary's company, notwithstanding the fact that the said diary had intended to drain her life off. There's also an interlude or two where Molly and Arthur worry about their daughter and in a particularly poignant scene, Molly hoped that Ginny would knit jumpers for her children too ( just like Molly did).

In her third year, Ginny Weasley carried on with her practice of Dark Arts and was discovered by a seventh year who blackmailed her into becoming his personal sex slave, though Ginny ultimately gets her revenge within the same year. Ginny carried on with her conflicted feelings regarding her family and Voldemort until Barty polyjuiced as Moody recognizes her boggart and secures her an audience with babymort ( Voldemort in that shrivelled mutilated foetus body) who tasked her with being his spy. It follows canon more or less till Voldemort's resurrection.

In her fourth year, she has been tasked to kidnap Harry Potter and in the process of kidnapping, she killed her SO ( Significant Other), her second murder. The traitor amongst the Death Eaters was soon rooted out and punished by Voldemort. Ginny eventually enters into a relationship with a senior Death Eater who loudly proclaimed their loyalty to the Dark Lord for all to hear in their trial. ( I am not mentioning the gender to avoid giving spoilers)

After failing to kidnap Harry, she earns the Dark Mark by killing Percy and Hermione's parents. What follows next is a lot of Weasleycide thought the Weasleys' perspective is also adequately represented making us empthasize with Ron, George, Arthur, Molly, etc. Harry is also quite shaken up by Ginny's defection.

Ginny eventually becomes Voldemort's most favoured Death Eater by eliminating an important member of the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort eventually took over Magical Britain while the Death Eaters searched for Harry Potter. Ginny ended up killing almost all of her brothers, and her parents in her career as a Death-Eater though it's all for naught ultimately and Ginny spends the rest of her life missing her loved ones ( including those that she killed in line of duty).

The Writing

It's quite well written and unlike the author's Dark Harry fic linkffn(12867536), there are very few grammatical errors in this fic, though in chapter 43, the author typed confronting instead of comforting (the scene being Molly comforting a five year old Ginny who had a nightmare).

Unlike his other fanfics, there's a bit of humor in this work ( at least I found it funny). The main one being Ginny calling Bill Weasley a " FUCKING TRAITOR BASTARD" for not dating a human girl and choosing Fleur Delacour ( it's unclear whether Bill and Fleur have actually married in this fic) which I found quite amusing as it is quite evident who is the real traitor. There's also an interlude wherein Molly hoped that Ginny keeps the family tradition of knitting jumpers for offspring alive, which is quite ironic given that in this fic, Ginny would never have children.

The Characterization

Everybody is properly characterized in this fic including the Order and the Weasleys who are portrayed as fully-fleshed human beings with their own personalities instead of being mere targets for Ginny to take down, and this fic successfully portrays the PoV of both sides of the War without Dumbledore, Weasley and Order bashing, and the Death Eaters are portrayed as the criminals that they are, with no hint of romanticizing the Dark Lord's cause at all in this fic.

Hence, inspite of Ginny being the protagonist, I felt sorry for the rest of the Weasley family as she purged it brother by brother. Naturally, the Weasleys disowned her not unlike Sirius' disownment by his parents.

Unlike his Dark Harry fic, Dumbledore is shown to be a capable and a worthy adversary to Voldemort and the Order won significant victories under his leadership, victories that threatened Tom Riddle's immortality and the reviewer did not know who won until the very end of this fanfic.

The reviewer also empathized with Colin Creevey who served as Ginny's human guinea-pig for Dark Arts and who was ultimately killed by Ginny.

The characters' inner thoughts Albus, Harry, Sirius, Ginny, Voldemort, Ron, Hermione, etc. are extremely well-written and they are very similar to their canon characterizations. Draco Malfoy was also there in all his pompous glory though he quickly loses his ego when Voldemort gifts him to Ginny.

Final Thoughts

The reviewer thoroughly enjoyed this fic and hopes that it is not the only fic set in the Black Ink, Red Rose universe. My only criticism is that the fic got over too soon and that the surviving Weasleys' ( excluding Ginny) is not shown in the epilogue.


** Bolshevik writes really good stuff. He has good combat (love the silent casting though I think spells could be cast more often), good characterization (Dumbledore's especially), and great stories. They can tend to be depressing though, with his tendencies to corrupt good characters and just kill of characters in general. I really hope he returns to Phoenix Insurgent now.

*** Firstly, a Death Eater Weasley killing her own parents and most of her family is quite dark, even by his standards. Harry killing Sirius isn't that unsettling for he barely knew him whereas Ginny grew up with her family who loved her.

Secondly, different people have different sensitivities. For example, I puked out my breakfast after reading a Hagrid Dobby smut fic linkffn(1634396) while I am fine with reading about spells conjuring ants that eat people alive, to peel the skin, etc.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
