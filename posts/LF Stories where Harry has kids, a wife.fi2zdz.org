Could be during or after Hogwarts, could be a crossover for all I care. Just looking for stories where Harry gets a family. Just read Blood of the Phoenix by midnightjen and its sequels and I loved the interactions between Harry, Ally and their daughter. Same with Something wicked this way comes by The Mad Mad Reviewer. Any help would be appreciated.

If you are looking for an older Harry with teenage children, check out Fate is a four letter word by Philo on ao3. It has lots of interaction with Harry and his (almost) grown-up children. It is really good as a "who dun it" and as a "find the evil bastard(s) behind everything" story, but the pairing is not everybody's cup of tea. Try overlooking if it weirds you out, bc the story is absolutely worth it (and skip the graphic sex scenes if they squick you).

You could also try searching this sub for "next gen" stories.
