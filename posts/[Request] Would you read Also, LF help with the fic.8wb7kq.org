I am planning to write my first fanfiction, and I would like to know if anyone would be interested.

The story will follow the life of an OC and his experiences in Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I will use a lot of new magical creatures not seen in the canon as well as some new forms of magic. I will assume a lot of things regarding Ilvermorny, many of which might be wrong, but it comes with the setting of the story since not much has been said about the wizarding school. I don't want to say much more about the plot since it might spoil it, but the original story will have some significance, can't know how much as it all depends on if the connection will not appear as a forced one.

Since this is my first fiction, I would also appreciate if someone were to be kind of a beta in the sense that I want to run ideas through that someone and I need him/her to tell me if they're honestly crap. I would also like for that person to help me by reading the chapters and giving me honest feedback. I would credit him/her at the begging of each chapter.


** I wouldn't read it. I, along with several other people aren't big fans of what JKR has said and done since she finished the seventh books. That's not to say it's objectively bad just I dislike most of it and your story is going to be exclusively it. You honestly might as well try a piece of original fiction, not because your ideas are bad but because there doesn't seem to be as much Harry Potter in your story.

If you're basically using a school that might as well be original, creatures that are original etc then people who want more Harry Potter won't read your story on principle.

** I got this idea just recently, but I could also make a completely different wizarding school since America is pretty large. In that case I wouldn't have to deal with a lot of the nuances of creating a story in a school which would be completely different from what JKR ends up creating.

** Since I have just started writing my own fic, I will give you what advice I can, based on some time in the fandom. You can take it or leave it, but I do hope that it helps you.

- Plan things out extensively. Look up everything you can find on Illvermory School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including their "houses," the history, the lore, and their system. Depending on how long you want to make the fic (one year, seven years), you need to develop an overall plotline first. Many a story has fizzled out because writers have written themselves into a corner.
- Develop your character profiles beforehand. You need to define your characters as people before you throw them into your world, so their actions make sense.
- Regarding the new magical creatures and types of magic, I will say this: make sure there is a good reason why nobody in canon mentions it. Don't invent anything that makes the world break, like thunderbird song can destroy a horcrux or there is magical armor. With magic, keep things grounded. Divination is a real magic, but its limited. Arithmancy does not allow you to make spells. And avoid using native american magic unless there is a good reason why no one has used it anywhere else, such as it requires sacrifice or its terribly inefficient.
- Have some kind of an antagonist. Voldemort or the Ministry worked in Harry Potter, but you need some greater thing going on in the background. Often the best way you can do this is with just bits of information slipping into the narrative, like someone mentions "the February Seige of 1934" or the "Wampus Cat Reservation in Kansas." More often than not, less is more.

I hope this helps.

*** Sound advice, but I have to say, it's not advice for everyone. Plotting and planning everything out first, then writing, works for plenty of writers. I think George RR Martin writes this way, and obviously, that's worked out for him. But for many other writers, including Stephen King, this is how to kill a story. I don't recall King's exact quote, but I believe he said something about plotting draining the life from a story. Both methods, according to Brandon Sanderson, have their advantages and disadvantages. Plotters (Martin's group and yours) do tend to create a plot with better twists and turns. Pantsers (King's group) are usually able to create more realistic and well-rounded characters, because the process of a Pantsers' writing allows them to get to know their characters through their actions and decisions within the story.
