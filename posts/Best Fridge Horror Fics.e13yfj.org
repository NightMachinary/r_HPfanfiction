Something that seems fine until you think about it for more than a second. The HP universe has a lot of potential for this with everything like Unforgivable Vows, the Imperio curse & time turners.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/131956][An extract from "The Witch's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth, and Baby Care", by Alarica Rosier. Chapter Nine: What if my Baby is a Squib?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Nineveh_uk/pseuds/Nineveh_uk][Nineveh_uk]]) - The magical word's view of squibs is really messed up and with this cheerful guide to dealing with a squib child, implications get worse the more you think about it.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/781256][A Study of Muggle Terminology by H. Weasley]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Kahvi/pseuds/Kahvi][Kahvi]]) - The wizarding world is very traditional. Including with attitudes towards, love, dating, and marriage.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864670/1/Mandragora][Mandragora]] by NothingPretentious) - Just. Mandrake roots. Enough said.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554][The Years of the Rat]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/kaydeefalls/pseuds/kaydeefalls][kaydeefalls]]) - Peter Pettigrew grew up with the other marauders.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]]) - Ginny was dying on the chamber floor. Also the implication that you could go to an in between place when you're dying and choose is not necessarily comforting.

*** For me Mandragora goes too far in humanising mandrakes. It makes it hard to believe no one notices that they have some degree of sapience when they make pants for themselves or hunt for worms with spears. It would be more horrifying for me if it was portrayed as if they were a species that never got to a stage where they could show enough sapience and were chopped to bits as babies/children.

*** The Pettigrew one is dynamite. Makes him a far more interesting character and totally canon compliant, as far as I remember

**** I bookmarked it a quarter of the way through. Absolutely great character study, and probably my new head canon.

** I've actually wondered about the Unbreakable Vow. All we're told (as far as I know) is that you make a promise with a certain spell, incantation, and a witness, and if you break that vow you die. But what caught my attention is that we're never told about /how/ the person who broke the vow dies, and what happens in the case of vague instructions? Gives fic writers a lot of opportunities. I have a small idea right now that plays with that very topic. It's not up yet, I've only thought of it recently.
