** I doubt Lucy Malfoy would be that interested in Muggle politics, but I actually wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5oaujt/lf_malcontent_muggles/dci2gx0/][a Prompt]] about a Muggleborn Dark Lord (Hermione) trying to take over the world. Trump was an integral part of her plan.

** Malfoy work with muggles? Nope, he'd probaly rather AK himself :(

As for Lockhart: He's a ponce, but I don't think he wants to go into politics (he never tried to run for minister as far as we know and really, he had a pretty good thing going (for someone as incompetent as him) with mind-fucking (well, wiping, but I think I can make a decent case that this is mind-fuck/rape/violation of the highest order because if you delete enough you can change someone's personality (we are but the sum of our biological traits and experiences after all!) and/or make someone helpless (!) wipe someone's memory of how to speak/read/comprehend their language? Bam instant helpless person!) people and writing about their deeds and taking the credit (and making a killing doing so!))
