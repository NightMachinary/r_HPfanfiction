** No, I actually find them interesting. It's rare to find civil debates with well-thought out points amongst controversial things like pairings and whatnot in fanfiction.

I think these debates are great for the community!

*** Indeed, debating stuff civilly (even if you at the end only agree to disagree) is GREAT (debates in general are great IMHO!)

** I like reading about the different opinions people hold towards characters. I think learning these opinions makes fics that are based on similar opinions easier to read.

 

I do think that debates on plot probably aren't a great fit for a fan fiction sub. (Only because there's so much variety once you escape cannon. Harry and friends can have their genders flipped or grow up as goblins. Anything is possible and there aren't really any conclusions without going back to cannon.)

 

I apologize if I come off as harsh. Just trying to explain my opinion.

Plot based one's probably won't come up much, I want it to be as fanfiction-related as possible rather than just Harry Potter in general, although there will naturally be some overlap.

**** I understand, a lot of those look fun. Can't wait to see what people have to say.

 

"HPMOR fans vs. HPMOR haters" Heh, that would be funny.

***** If you're picking fanfics for the debate topic, you definitely need to get both the contestants to consent. I personally couldn't stomach to do anything more than skim the first 10 or so chapters of MOR.

** I like that it has more things to the subreddit. Just LF and Rec threads gets kinda stale, and Discussions are few and far between. It makes for more community interaction, and I like seeing how other people's tastes compare to mine on lots of the topics.

** As the person doing the posting i'm really sorry if anyone feels that way. I am trying to be mindful of that, hence why i'm deleting every post after I make a new one and linking to the old one in the new one if anyone wants to read it.

Also i've been pming a few people back and forth about making it run more smoothly and i'm going to /try/ and have the rest of round 1 over the weekend with matches running simultaneously to speed things up.

Again though, I really love this community, its why i'm running this cause I thought people would enjoy it. If it's annoying i'll of course stop.

** Yup. The debates might be mildly entertaining, but i much prefer to see ideas "fought" out in good stories. I mean a good fic ought to be able to make any idea work.
