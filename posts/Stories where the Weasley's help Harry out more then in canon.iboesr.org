Maybe they raise him, maybe give him more food, or maybe one of the older Weasley brothers raise him, or anything like that.

So no Weasley Bashing please

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Would rather it be completed but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][/Like a Red Headed Stepchild/]] has Harry with red hair like his mom instead of black like his dad. Because shenanigans, he basically ends up adopted by the Weasleys.

** Claustrophobia by Celebony is really good. After Fred and George lock Harry in a cupboard, Harry has a severe panic attack attack and it is discovered that he is extremely claustrophobic. The Weasleys try to find out why and help him overcome it. Also at the same time, there are two aurors that are “training” Harry but really are just torturing him and Weasleys intervene with that as well.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
