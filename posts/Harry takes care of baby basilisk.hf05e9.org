I've just finished A new place to stay and one thing I really liked about it was that Harry finds a basilisk egg in the chamber and takes care of the baby. this was in his fifth or sixth year, when he came back for a fang to destroy horcruxes, but it would be cute too if Harry found an egg while in second year after he kills the big one.

let's all just forget that basilisks are hatched from chicken eggs... for the plot.

I just wonder if there are more stories where this happens. there are some fics where he has a pet snake and it makes so much sense, him being a parslemouth and all. too bad he didn't get a pet snake in canon. (because lets be real, if you were a parslemouth, you would get a snake just to talk to it). and there are some fics where he didn't kill the adult basilisk, talked him out of the evilz and all that. but I want a baby basilisk.

I've read another one where he named the basilisk Salazar. but have no idea what that fic was about otherwise so if someone remembers that one? it could however be one of the fics where he gets a normal snake and calls him Salazar, so not so sure about that.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.
