I am in need my friends and I ask for aid.

I don't mind any au or crossovers, dark or grey harry fics. My only requirement is that they are either finished, on the verge of being finished or are being regularly updated.

I do have a weakness for some good old manipulative/dark dumbledore (and in some fics, the Weasleys are dark as well) so that would be pretty nice. But again I am desperate for anything so give a poor beggar his gold.


** Tbh I would repost on hp slash fanfiction because although I love a good slash fic not an awful lot of fanfic readers hear would recommend slash.

** Both of these are time travel and while the first one is bordering on grey, neither one really qualifies.

Of A Linear Circle - linkao3(11284494) - A big long series that's been updating regularly for nearly three years (and part 8 has three weeks left to go). You can skip part V as it appears to be on hiatus (but isn't really part of the main story anyway).

Gelosaþ in Écnesse - linkao3(2352896) - Very sweet, this one is more focused on the relationship than the first one.

And then a crossover...

Of Wizards and Heroes - linkao3(4148136) - MCU. I don't remember much about this one beyond the fact that I liked it tbh. It is a highly regarded fic tho?

... I'd link you more but I don't read much slash :x

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires.

A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
