So, I am looking for an old fic I skimmed through, and I remember one specific scene / set up :

Harry is being raised / trained by the Flamels, and meet the Delacour family around 12-14 year old. Of course at this age, girls are stupid and useless. Especially Fleur Delacour.

But at the same time, it's simply obvious something is starting there :)

**** It's way longer than it needs to be, filled with a metric shitton of purple prose. 360k words for year 1 and 2 is way too much. Also, has some plot with locked memories or some nonsense that shouldn't be in the story at all. Very jarring. But still a decent story overall, just tedious.

****** It was run through the DLP WBA, but fanfic writers are a stubborn bunch. We write what we like, and since none of us are getting paid to write or give feedback, whatever the end result is tends to be a bit immutable. No one likes chopping thousands of words away from a fic they spent days/weeks working on, even if it would unanimously make the fic better.
