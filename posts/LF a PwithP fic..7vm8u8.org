#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I have a fic. This is self promotion, but it's sitting on 60,000+ words and it's porn with plot. Like 60,000 words of plot, with a smattering of lemons, then porn and plot. It's BDSM, incomplete, mainly featuring a (pretty much non-slash) grouping of Snape, Hermione and Lucius and if you want to read it, let me know?
