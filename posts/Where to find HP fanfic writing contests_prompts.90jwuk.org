I always see these "winner of the ___ competition" or "written for the winter mash up prompt"

I'm wondering where I go to find such prompts? I feel so out of the loop..


** We're now running quarterly competitions at DLP. We're on round 3.

*** HP/vampires (however done, uninspiring as they are for my muse) is the active prompt.

Come play if you like.

** Smaller sites often run them to keep participation up. I take part in contests on SIYE, a h/g site, and Mugglenet, which is essentially dead now but still has some interesting contests now and then. There is also an active fanfic community on Tumblr that sets challenges:)

** I don't know about competitions, but there are plenty of communities on LiveJournal and Dreamwidth that release prompts or host fests regularly. Like HP Creatures, KinkFest, HP Drizzle, NextGen fest, Weasleyjumpers, HP Darkarts, hoggywartyxmas, HP goldenage. Then there are also the pairing specific comms that host fests (Drarry, wolfstar, Dramione, Snarry etc.) - the list goes on. Seriously, there's a lot. Let me know if you want to check any of these out and need a link, LJ can be difficult to navigate.
