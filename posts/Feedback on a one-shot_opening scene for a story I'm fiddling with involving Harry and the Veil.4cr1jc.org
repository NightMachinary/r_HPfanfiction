It's not very long, and it's unbeta'd, but I wanted to know people's thoughts on it. I'm already planning on fleshing the scenario out some more and then continuing from where it leaves off, but I'm not sure on how well what I already have is written, or how far before and after this section I need to expand for it to be functional.

I'm also a little unsure if this is the place to post this, so if not, I'll remove it with no complaints!

--------------

There was an instant where Harry's mind seemed to stop, along with the beating of his heart and the turning of the Earth. He could see, clearly, the shock on Sirius' face, the Veil half obscuring it as he fell back into its depths. His mind trembled, and everything else fell away; there was nothing but his godfather's face, and the soft thrumming of the Veil as it consumed, and the thunderous realization that he was about to be left alone, yet again.

He couldn't bear such a thing.

Couldn't allow it.

Harry didn't think as his limbs shifted away from the fight and instead threw him towards his vanishing godfather. Didn't pause as others cried out after him, trying to stop him but unable to tear themselves away from the conflict. He leapt as far as his waning strength and magic could carry him towards the device at the room's center, one that meant certain death for those thrust into its mysteries.

He did not think, and more, he did not care. His wand dropped forgotten from his hand, and instead caught the edge of a shabby robe. Sirius' face looks back at him, expression undefinable, before it was swallowed along with the rest of him by the magic of the Veil. And then Harry was falling too, and his grip tightens before it is torn away in a tempest of unfathomable strength, and then he was lost in the folds of eternity lying far beyond the Veil's reach.

Harry Potter was gone.

The fight wore on in the belly of the Department of Mysteries, and in it's shadow, the Veil thrummed on.

--------------

I know canon Harry is fairly impulsive, and he even attempted to leap after Sirius in the original. My idea was that this time he actually succeeds in following after instead of being waylaid by Remus (I'm unsure if this is only in the films or not since my memories of the later books is a tad fuzzy). From there I have a crossover planned since the Veil provides a fairly good juming off point as a plot device. Or I could just have it stand as a oneshot. Not entirely sure.

But thoughts or ideas on how to improve it beyond where it is at current would be appreciated!


** I'm a huge fan of crossovers, especially ones where he can't return since the ones where he does, he ends up somehow a god of magic in a mortal form with no consquences to his actions.

If you want a prompt, he and Sirius are now trapped in the novel (or movie version) of the Never-Ending Story.

*** I've only ever seen the movie once, when I was very young, but I do remember the movie being very intense and full of wonder! A good choice for a crossover I think.

For this, I was thinking more of a universe jumper deal, where Harry is barred from his orginal world due to some plot mechanism, so he has to realm hop to both try and return home, but also find Sirius, who landed in another realm since Harry lost his grip when they both fell.

I think the reason he wouldn't be able to return would likely be because the Veil is part of a pair of portals; one goes in the other out of the universe, and the Veil can only go out. Each world portal has a set location to another realm, and the return portal to the previous world might not be there. So Harry has to hop from realm to realm to find the one that leads back home. And along the way there's an important sidequest of finding Sirius if he can.

Each realm follows its own set of universal laws, so in realms where magic doesnt exist harry loses his magic, or in realms where it follows other rules, his magic changes to match. SO that means powers dont carry over, and if Harry ever DID manage to return to his own world, he'd be the same as he was when he left, except with perhaps more memories and life experiences backing him.

** I like it. The concept is well constructed. My only criticism right off the bat is you use a lot of commas, many of them unnecessary. Just look through it and remember you don't need a comma before every "and" you use. Some are good but think of it is that every comma is a pause in the sentence.

*** I do know I have a problem with pauses in my writing. I tend to try and cram scentences together with commas so I don't have a bunch of small five word sentences hanging around, but it doesn't really fix the problem. I'll be sure to work on it and see if I can find a beta to help me pick them out.

Do you have any critiques/suggestions pertaining to the idea per chance? I like where I'm going with it, but I don't want to fall into any overused or bad tropes I might not be aware of if I can help it.

**** I understand where you are coming from. Sentence variation is very important and do like a lot of how you structure, it is literally just that there are more commas than necessary. A beta will definitely help you with that ðŸ™‚

I very much like this idea. You are right, Harry is very impulsive and this is a believable move on his part. I am curious what crossover you are thinking of if you would do that? I do like the idea of it being a one shot, but if you have a solid multichap I would say go for it.

***** It's been awhile since I've written creatively (most of my work recently has been academic papers), so getting the hang of sentence structure that's more usable in terms of reader immersion and enjoyment is still coming back to me. I'll definitely be looking for a beta some time soon if I go forward with this, and it's looking more and more like I will.

I'd actually thought to have it as a HTTYD crossover, though this scene has changed a lot since I first had the idea and the crossover wouldn't be viable as it is currently. Now I'm looking more at possibly Norse Mythology influences, or possibly completely unique worlds. Maybe a series of alternate fandoms Harry and his story happen to align with in some way. Not entirely sure what direction it's going to go in now that it's broken ties with the original plot idea, but it seems like it will be interesting regardless. :)

There's a chance i'll just clean this section up and put it out as a one shot, and then use a less detailed or slightly variant version to kick off a longer multi-chapter story. This does work pretty well as a one shot, but i also like how open it leaves possibilities for continuing with it.

****** I like it! The crossover with HTTYD intrigues me but I also like the multi-fandom. Kinda gives it a Quantum Leap feel.

Well if you get around to it and need a beta, feel free to drop me a line. Obviously you don't have to, but I would be willing to do that for you. I usually have more time to beta than write so it would be nice to jump in againðŸ˜Š

******* Yep. I made the connection that a night fury is a creature of lightning and death, and Harry is in a way, so dropping him in the HTTYD verse would probably result in te universe laughing and turning him into one or connecting him to one in some way. Which, while that's still a story I'd like to write, wouldn't mesh well with the tone of this scene I think.

I'll be sure to keep you bookmarked if I need a beta in the future for this! :)

******** Sweet! Yeah the two tones are a little different, but another option is to write this one as a one shot and then write a secind story of what happens to him after he follows Sirius through for the HTTYD. That way you can do both in different story tones

********* I was thinking of doing a spin-off of the idea where Harry is taken in to the ministry for questioning after the chamber of secrets incident (strictly questioning; none of that azkaban!harry nonsense here!), and he gets freaked out so he runs off from the aurors and hides in the department of mysteries. Harry is really resourceful when he feels threatened, and so he'd likely hide from the aurors and unspeakables long enough to accidentally tumblr through the veil in a panic. Then THAT leads to the HTTYD crossover.

I'll probably put this out as a oneshot once I edit it a little more and get it beta'd, and then write a longer story afterwords using the world hopping idea. So three stories spawing from this I guess haha.
