Recently I noticed that a lot of fics, in spite of the fact that the HP universe is intrinsically magical, tend to gloss over the actual magic of it all. So I was wondering if I could get some recommendations on stories that delve deep into the intricacies of magical theory and how it applies to combat situations ( stuff like the final battle in Jamie Evans and Fate's fool), can anyone help?


** Here are some that I believe to be quite interesting magically speaking. Sadly, not all are finished or update regularly, with some having some quite long update schedules or could be considered on hiatus.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

** Honestly, if you want good, interesting, nuanced magic you are going to want to look at works out of DLP (I blame Taure for this).

This includes stuff like:

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure): Harry Potter ends up with all of Dumbledore's memories from the first ones through beating Grindelwald

linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure): Taure's vastly superior re-work of his fem!Harry story Alexandra Potter. Starts with first year, about to begin on second year. Apparently this fic is going to go through third year, and then move to one fic per year.

Basically everything by enembee, especially my favorite of his works: Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone.

For a darker take, dive into Scott Press's linkffn(Lesser Evils) and the WiP sequel linkffn(Ascended Vices). Spends more time focused on the mindset of a Dark Wizard than the nuances of dark magic itself.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar): The Lord of the Rings crossover (and not just in the Harry Potter context). Read it if you haven't. Read it again if you had.

​

And, of course, Newcomb's AU linkffn(What You Leave Behind), and AU where Harry is a year older and is building up to Harry being Dumbledore/Voldemort level of damn good wizard.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I am going to do some shameless self-promotion here and say it's the plot of my fic, Mysteries of Magic. Harry gains the ability of "seeing" magic after an accident in his first year, with all the good and bad things that come with it.

It begins in the fourth year. The highlights until now are how Harry tries to put his name in the Goblet of Fire and his show of Transfiguration and Animation to McGonagall and Flitwick.

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.
