** I went through the typical Dark!Harry, Dumbledore-is-the-devil-incarnate phase like most people. I even wrote a stereotypical wrong-BWL fic and got a few chapters in.

I still maintain a little bit of pride in that by making it at least /slightly/ unique (in that the Potters were bad, and Harry realised this and got along with his sibling), but it was a dark time all the same.

** linkffn(3150414) Parallels by Bobmin356.

When I first discovered fan fiction, I started favouriting just about everything that was actually readable. Bobmin can undoubtedly write, but the plot for this one is pretty bad. And the clichÃ©s! For instance, in the first chapter, "I am Lord Harry James Black-Potter, Chief Warlock of the Order of the Phoenix and Battle Commander, three time winner of the Order of Merlin, first class, a Founders Heir". Again, when I first started, I obviously didn't know any of the clichÃ©s. I even left this one a nice review...

I'm sure if I go through my favourites list there'll be some real garbage on it.

** Given that I've been reading fanfic for over a decade, there's a lot of them. I was not a terribly discerning reader at age 11.

I don't remember most of them. Certainly all of the fics I read when I was going through a badboy!Draco phase were completely awful. That characterization of him is just inherently pretty bad, and often written by teens trying to be edgy. A more canon based Draco is a significantly more interesting character (although I guess I cannot really blame pre-HBP fics for butchering his character so badly).

Some fics haven't aged well not because they were poorly written, however, but merely because they were written before canon was done and as a result didn't really get the characterizations correct. It's very distracting to read about Snape as a pureblood heir raised in luxury, because it's just so off from what he's supposed to be. There's only a few older fics I'm really all that fond of as a result.

I still read some fics that are trash. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for fluff or stupid situations. I don't consider those fics good even when I read them, however, merely fun.

** I admit that at first I liked "fix fics" where, you guessed right, Harry or one of his friends fixes everything wrong with everything using some simple tool (veritaserum, magical oaths) that apparently no one else in the history of the wizarding world thought of using before. I also liked "wizards are stupid" type fics that mock everything about wizard culture and glorify muggle "logic", before I realized that they vastly rely on shitty fanon to bash wizards, oversimplify things in the most immature way, and ruin everything that felt truly magical and exciting about the Harry Potter books. I completely detest both types of fics now.

** I'm not sure if I would say it was trash so much as my tastes changed, but long ago, when I first got into HP fanfic, I was an HG/SS shipper. I really liked 'A Choice of Roads' and 'The Phantom of Hogwarts.' They were both WIP, and for whatever reason, I got out of the habit of checking for updates from them. Skip ahead a few years, after I've quit shipping HG/SS, and I couldn't read more than a few chapters of each before I had to leave.

Again, I don't know if that really reflects on the quality of the fics, just on me and my changing preferences, but it was the first thing that popped into my head when I thought about reading and liking, then rereading and not liking.... I can't remember if I've ever read and enjoyed something that I later thought was actual trash. If it was that bad, I probably forgot about it shortly after reading it, or it fell in the 'so bad, it's good' category.

Another one I've soured on over time is linkffn(Unspeakable Things) for similar reasons. This was one of my favorite fics back in the day. I still think it is readable, but I don't particularly care for it. Same for Kurinoone's linkffn(The Darkness Within).

** We all go through phases. One of the first things I did after starting to get into the community was write an "Overall Top 20" thing and share it with people. I still stand by most of them these days, but I have a few on there that I can categorically say are nowhere close to actually being "the upper echelon of fanfiction".

Examples:

The Merging - linkffn(9720211)

Was a really, really refreshing change of pace from other fics in that it took its time developing Harry, had Harry go through multiple relationships and it just felt like he was actually at school with all its trials and tribulations. Later on, it kind of groans under the weight of its own plot points, and the writing just isn't... quite... amazing enough. Still enjoy it, but would definitely axe it from the Top 20 if I ever decided to revise it.

Delenda Est - linkffn(5511855)

Almost literally the same reasoning. I think overall the writing is a bit better, but what I took for well-paced character growth was actually just... dullness, I think. I like Bellatrix, and I /want/ to like Harry, and I like the idea of the back, then forward time jumps, but yeah, plot kind of got away from the author here. Another "isn't actually bad, but nowhere near as good as I remembered" thing.

Quick hits, because this is already getting long - Sixth Year, Steps Toward the End - some really really great scenes but cliches kind of stand out on re-read, and the writing isn't quite as good as I remembered. Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, would probably bump down for reasons others have mentioned. I think the actual writing is very very solid in this piece, it's just that on a second read, I don't like what was written as much.

So I've heard. Trouble is, the earlier chapters aren't just unreadable, they're un-skimmable as well, so it matters little even if the later chapters have the best writing in the world. I should know; I've tried both reading and skimming. Neither works.

** One of the first stories I ever read was Aspirations by MegaMatt09. I loved it when I first got into fanfiction (2013) but right now I think it's rubbish.

*** Eh, I can see where you are coming from but I will always like that story solely because of the whole "masked vigilante" arc. That was a type of kickass HP/comic book superhero vibe I've never seen anywhere else.

** I wouldn't say that the Dangerverse is trash, but if I stumbled across the first few chapters of "Living with Danger" today, I probably would not enjoy them. Danger alone would probably strike me as too much of a Mary Sue (weird prophetic dreams and werewolf taming abilities. The second lead to her and Remus having a special mental link. - Really?) Additionally the writing really is not very good at the beginning.

** The Refiner's Fire and it's sequel.

A lot of the Indy Harry stories whose names escape me now.

** I used to enjoy reading long shipping fics now I can only enjoy shipping in one-shots.

There are some stories I vaguely remember reading during the long summer but I'd be hard pressed to find them so I can't reread them to change my opinion on them.
