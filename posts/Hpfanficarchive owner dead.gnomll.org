So... sad news today. I stumbled upon the news that Chad Peterson, who is the one that keeps the lights on at Hpfanficarchive has suddenly died. You can see it if you click the Support button and go his gofundme.

I can't seem to get onto the site homepage, but the link below gets you onto the site if you have some fics you want to get before the site goes down. They say they will pass it into someone else if you want to reach out.

** Sad day. My sympathies to his family and loved ones.

A lot of the stories i read were from hpfanficarchive.

If no one takes over his servers any idea if the folks over at Archive Of Our Own (AO3) might import all the stories like they have done in the past when other fan sites have shut down?

*** Thanks for pointing this group out. I've sent them a message via their webforum, so hopefully they can collect all the stories from the site.

** Oh, how sad :(. I've read so many fanfics on that site. Thanks for the notice, cause I downloaded close to twenty stories from that site! I still feel as if I've missed some of my favorites too!

** Oh wow that gofundme was set up last year to help with his surgery but mainly to keep the servers. So sad that it is now for his funeral. :(

** Very sad to hear about this. I had interacted with him a bit on his old forum site and he was always such a great guy.

My sympathies to his family.
