Hello this is my first post on reddit!!

So I was reading a fanfic that took a dark turn that was apparently too much for fanfiction.net. It was called Poisoned but I can't remember the author.

Summary(I am bad at these): Basically Harry marries Ginny but on wedding night instead of sleeping Ginny poisons Harry and then proceeds to kill him(via multiple stabbings) with the help of half the Weasley family and Draco. Since he is the master of death though he has the choice to die or get sent back since he can live however long he wants to. He chooses to return to slightly before first year and starts getting his revenge. After nearly killing Ginny at the train station He finds that Daphne Greengrass saw him laughing about the whole thing and confronts him and it turns out she found a way to get sent back as well and tells him what happened after his death (sort of). Then she tells him some long string of dialogue about her love for him or whatever. She tells him she is here to help him and the reason she is able to come back in time was that she killed her self in a experimental time turner they were creating in the department of mysteries and it worked. (She is really insane in this fic btw which imo is hilarious)

I think all that happens in the first chapter but if anyone has a way to find it or at least the authors name I would greatly appreciate it.


** I remember someone mentioning this over at DLP - your OP rang a bell, so I did a quick search.

On [[http://www.wattpad.com/89052632-poisoned-prologue-ch1][Wattpad]]

On [[http://www.quotev.com/story/5791757/Poisoned/][Quotev]]

The author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5499201/potterheadcharles][potterheadcharles]], mentions being targeted by a group he dubs the 'Guardians of Fanfiction' who reported the story. He sounded pretty cut up about it.

**** They're supposedly a shadowy organisation of FF zealots who seek out, threaten and reprimand authors of stories which infringe the rules of the site... or something like that.

You'd think people would have better things to do with their time, like reading fics that they actually like, but such is life.

  If you do not follow their rules, they report you in mass numbers. Again and again. Week after week. Until the admins get frustrated and delete your story.

It sounds like they have their own rules which they attempt to do. I just really want to know what those rules are.

****** It is rather intriguing... kinda wishing he outright named them. I suppose I could write some fic-bait, lol.
