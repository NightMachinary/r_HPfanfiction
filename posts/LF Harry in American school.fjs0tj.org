:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Searching for an old fic (maybe over 10 years?) where Harry goes to a school in America sometime around year 5.

What I remember:

- he took the plane to sneak past wizards

- he was in contact with the Headmistress of the school before leaving and she gets him from the airport

- the new school does have something equivalent to Hogwarts houses

- the Headmistress has a relationship (can't remember if friend or rival) with Dumbledore, but sides with Harry

- there is a trial that he has to get back to at some point

- DADA at the new school has some classes with environmental combat (a bit similar to Ender's Game battle school)

- he gets a girlfriend that was kicked out of her home for magic thinking she was a muggleborn, but when Harry takes a trip to their house he discovers that her dad was actually a squib and resented her for having magic (maybe after he was kicked out of his house as a child)

​

I remember it being pretty long but can't say how long. It was on FFN

Thank you to anyone who can provide help


** Sounds like A Brave New World by Bellerophon30. Seems to have been pulled from everywhere but I found this link:

*** Thank you, this is the one. It seems to be purged from there as well, but with the title and some google fu: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/835fy9/lf_the_brave_new_world_by_bellerophon30_in_epub/]]

Sad to see this happen. Another one of my old favorites had this happen to it while it was in progress: Knowledge is Power. Guy (or girl) deleted their account and it took me 5ish years to stumble across a copy
