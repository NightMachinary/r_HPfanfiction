Been thinking of looking into this ship but unsure where to start. So anyone want to list off some of the most well liked/reviewed Hermione/Fleur LF's for me please? Think Id like ones set during goblet of fire the best but will take whatever else you have too. Side note if you're really into this pairing what is it about the dynamic between Hermione and Fleur that you like? Also do you prefer fics where the author drops Fleur's accent or do you like the J.K Rowling way of having missing H's from her dialogue and stuff? Thanks in adavance.

  Hermione Granger fled Britain seven years ago after the Battle of Hogwarts, still battling against the horror she endured. She's finally content in her quiet life where no one knows her as the Golden Girl until unexpected post from Hogwarts offers her the chance she had once dreamed of. Now, she returns to the castle to find her dreams, her family and her life; she might also find a certain beautiful French witch along the way.

  Fleur's life is a sham. She comes to Hermione for help with something important and Hermione accepts to lend a hand. Throughout their journey, many things will change and they will find out what true love really is.

  Fleur is not an expert in the ways of love, but in Hermione's final year with time running out, the learning curve is steep. Written, with permission, as a companion piece to Dreiser's "No Defense for You" in Fleur's POV. Please note: a slightly more updated version (less typos) lives on AO3. Any chance of a sequel will be posted there as well.
