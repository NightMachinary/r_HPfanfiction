So, in most of the Manipulative!Dumbledore stories I read, Voldmort is mostly a non-issue. Look at RobSt for examples. Anyone know of one where they're both powerful, and evil, and Harry gets caught in the middle, trying to beat both of them?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: At least 'Harry' sees both of them as dangerous competitions and thus the need to eliminate them.

This type of 'Harry' makes imho the best kind of "Third Faction" fics while he's still at Hogwarts. There would be no more ridiculous teenager Harry power wank and progression here, and it will be interesting to see how our canon good kids perform under his leadership.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] features an adult Harry in a convincing third (actually there are a lot more) faction. He is brilliant, brutal, and powerful. Voldemort is playing the long con game and has placed himself in excellent strategic position. Dumbledore is clearly outmatched by those two despite his manipulative nature, and can't even control rogue elements within his Order.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] is a super bash fic that has Harry pretty much operating alone. He and Ginny have a "Bonnie & Clyde" feeling here. This fic suffers from a dichotomy of great scenes and ridiculous moments.

** The Cry of Freedom series is going that way. Voldemort isn't really there yet, but Harry is caught between Dumbledore and the corrupt Ministry who are in Lucius Malfoy's pockets, and is fighting free of both by creating his own side.

** Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987 has an interesting mix of Dumbledore views, we mostly get Harry, but we also get several 3rd Person views that make disparities interesting.
