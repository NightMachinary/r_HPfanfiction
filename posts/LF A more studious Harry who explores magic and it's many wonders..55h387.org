** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - Nailfic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] - Non-BWL Harry who specialises in transfiguration. I like some of things it does with magic, don't like some others, but all in all it's interesting read and update often.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ww8zey6s8igoghx/AAAW0Cgm8AGQl2amQOwRat_5a?dl=0&preview=Alexandra+Potter+Original+(Revised][Alexandra Potter]].html) - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned.

Those were already mentioned, but consider it +1 to the recommendation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. And another dead fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still very good read. And of course it's dead.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.
