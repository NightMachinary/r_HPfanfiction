An age line can be drawn with any age in mind, but what criteria does it count age as as well as what unit of measurement does it work with.


** Hah, I would totally read a marauder era oneshot with Sirius trying to trick the age line into thinking he's old enough by crossing it in dog form. I bet hilarity would ensue. The name that comes out of the goblet is... PADFOOT! Sirius gets chosen but the caveat is that he has to compete in dog form to keep his secret and abide by the "rules" of the goblet. All of Hogwarts (save 3 giggling in a corner) are left wondering why the Hogwarts champion is a giant black dog.

*** The large, black dog trotted into the arena, a stick clutched in its mouth.

"Awwww," cooed Lily, up in the stands. "He wants to play fetch with the dragon-"

A bright fuschia spell flew from the wand, striking the Dragon in the eye. It reared back, and roared, but the only sound that came out was that of a sheep.

'/Baaaaaaaaaa?/'

The dog barked and shot another spell into the beast's open mouth. It began coughing violently, spewing massive slugs all over the arena.

The dog quickly ran into the nest and conjured rope, which it tied around the golden egg. It grabbed the other end of the rope and dragged it out of the increasingly slug-infested arena.

Lily blinked. "Oh. That works too."

*===[YULE BALL]===*

James stared disbelievingly at the shaggy black dog in the tuxedo. "Padfoot, tell me you didn't?"

The dog nodded. James glanced at the girl in question, then looked back.

"And... she said /yes/?"

The dog barked smugly.

"/Damn/, that girl has got to be /kinky/."

James could tell that Sirius would /never/ shut up about the time he bagged a Veela in his dog form.

*===[SECOND TASK]===*

Lily was wondering why James, Remus, and Peter broke into hysterics when they saw her banner. It said '/Go Padfoot/', there was nothing comical about supporting her school champion, was there?

When the horn blared, the dog swallowed a mass of rubbery plant matter, before turning into some sort of dog-dolphin hybrid. It gave a chattering sort of bark before diving into the lake.

"Well," said Potter after about 15 minutes. "This is boring."

"Oh, dear Merlin," muttered Lily. Alice looked at her questioningly.

"Potter is bored."

Alice paled dramatically. "Merlin save us-"

She was interruped by the roar of a... motorcycle? A horse-sized, black shape soared from the water, and began to /fly/ back to the platform. The... /Padfoot/ was /Driving it?/.

The motorcycle skidded to a stop on the platform, and the dog leapt off. It began barking furiously at the judges table.

"Now, now, Padfoot," said Headmaster Dumbledore. "It was spelled to resist the water. It'll be fine."

*===[THIRD TASK]===*

It was interesting, mused Lily, how one could easily tell what path their Champion was taking through the maze. This was not due to some sort of foresight on the parts of the Tournament Officials, but because there was a clear path of oddly colored flames and conjured birds impaled on the hedges.

There was a distant screech, and a bright pink Acromantula soared in a perfect arc over the maze.

James put another tick mark on the massive blackboard he'd brought out.

"Hold on, James," said Remus. "Did you put that one under '/Color Changing/' or '/Banishing Charm/'?"

James cursed. "I knew we should have figured out how to make a 45-way Venn Diagram!"

The distinctive roar of a Sphinx echoed across the maze. "BEGONE, YOU PERVERTED DOG!"

There was the sound of glass breaking, then silence.

James scrawled a note in a corner of the board. "Bonus points for creative application of the Defenestration Curse."

** I challenge all your assumptions: that the Age line could be set to any age, that it uses the person's mind to detect it or that it can be tricked at all.

I'd say the age line used by Dumbledore was easy enough to set, since it depended on the person being an adult (17 or older). Basically, it's just a Trace detector.

That said, I would think that spells in general use star positions to determine date and time, since they can't be 'forged'. Detecting when a person was born might be the trickiest part.

*** I agree, its always incredibly annoying when people try to out smart magic in this way. As if a spell uses the same logic.

** In my opinion, it probably works with the person's innate awareness of their age. So, say, if you had a character who for some reason got adopted by people who did not know their age and thought the kid a year older than in reality, and if the kid did not know either and thus got raised in belief that he or she really is older, it would result in them being able to cross the line (Dumbledore's one, with 17 as the cut-off age) at 16 because they'd have the unbreakable belief, that innate awareness, that “yeah, they're really 17” even if it happened to not be true.

** I mean, it probably just depends overall, but it doesn't make much sense to me that such a spell would be so easily tricked unless it were designed and cast by a complete amateur.

If that's not the case, maybe you could make the argument that it'd work if they were /currently/ a dog. Or /maybe/ an untransformed animagus, or a werewolf. But that feels a bit of a stretch.

*** One possibility is that - given that it's referred to as though everyone knows what an Age Line is - it's actually pretty simple magic and not that hard to circumvent, since it's childproofing magic, used to keep children from getting into the biscuit tin or drowning in the garden pond, and as such is simple enough for frazzled parents/nannies to set and maintain. So it probably has all kinds of weaknesses that don't matter because the worst it has to deal with is the circumvention efforts of 10-year-olds. It's less effective, but still useable, to keep 14-year-olds away from the drinks cabinet.

Dumbledore, who doesn't have children of his own, thinks it's adequate security, and that the kids who are smart enough to bypass it are smart enough not to enter.

**** for all we know, the only thing needed to get past it may as well simply involve convincing yourself you are an eighty-three year old bartender named Herman.
