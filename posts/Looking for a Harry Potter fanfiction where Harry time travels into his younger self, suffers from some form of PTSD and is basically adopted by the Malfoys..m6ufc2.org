:END:
I am looking for a harry potter fanfiction which I read on fanfiction .net where Harry time travel back to the past (to first year I think). I don't remember how, why and when he travels from but he does it. He suffers from some form of PTSD and flashbacks and I think he meets the Malfoys at the train station at the start of the year. He somehow ends up at Malfoy Manor, I think he is invited for Christmas or something, where he gets having a nightmare and is comforted by Narcissa and Lucius (and Snape I think) who find it sad/'shocking that he is suffering so much at a young age. There is a scene at Hogwarts where he ends up in the forbidden forest and the centaurs know that he time traveled (I think that he is the MOD and they know that). Things happen and the creatures of the forbidden forest do a ritual and it ends up helping â€˜lessen' Harry's PTSD at least he finds some peace.

I know it is vague but I hope someone can help me find it. Thank you in advance.
