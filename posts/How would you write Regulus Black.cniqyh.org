I'm currently 16k into writing Regulus Black's life story through snapshots and I was wondering how other people would approach his character.

Personally, I've gone for a more sympathetic angle than what is probably realistic because I intend to follow it up with a reincarnation fic. He's mostly quiet and Does As He's Told but doesn't really go out of his way to be cruel.

We barely hear anything about him in canon from anyone outside of Sirius' mention. There's a lot of passing mention about various characters (some which only have first names) that went to school with the marauders and little anecdotes about what they got up to in school yet nothing really about Regulus, I've found. Despite the fact he would have been in the year below and was a Black and Sirius' brother. So I chose to make him a bit of a wall flower, explaining why he was more on people's peripheral.

But how would you write a Regulus Black? Would you see him as bratty? Spoilt? Secretly the good guy? I'm curious

Edit: thought I'd add something to explain a bit more of my interpretation. Sirius takes after his mother: loud, confident and passionate in what /he/ believes. Regulus takes after his Father (my interpretation anyway): quieter, more passive and observing those around him rather than interfering


** What we know is that he was his mother's favourite, he joined the Death Eaters and was seeker for Slytherin. He was almost certainly raised to believe in in both the superiority of the Black family and of purebloods in general. Being seeker on his house team likely added to that, Bellatrix being such a powerful witch would also have pointed towards the Blacks being strong. He was also young and therefore almost certainly an arrogant little shit. He was a teenager raised on an ideology of bigotry who willingly joined a murder cult and started to discover the real world wasn't quite what his mother made out and then his house-elf was tortured. I would imagine Malfoy but instead of going to his father he dealt with his own problems.

*** To piggyback here, he had no issues with Voldemort in principle, he took offence from Kreachers treatment. He is like Snape in that regard, if his catalytic event does not happen, he'd happily continue being a Death Eater.

While that is true to some degree I think we can give Regulus the benefit of the doubt (for lack of having definitive knowledge), while on the other hand for Snape we cannot. For example we can imagine Regulus being conflicted when he found himself on the other side of his brother, while Snape put himself purposely on the side of those who want to eradicate people like Lily.

** I think he thinks of himself as a good guy who follows the rules and does what he's told, like people are supposed to. Then he finally realizes the orders he's been following are wrong, but it's too late to get out alive, so he does what he can to make up for his past mistakes.

*** I don't think it's even so much as he realized the orders were wrong, just that an exception should've been made for HIM. Is there any indication he cared about any other elf, or just Kreacher? He's a lot like Snape in that, until Voldemort turned on HIS, he was a happy go lucky Death Eater.

**** That's one interpretation, but he may not have actually cared about Kreacher that much. He may have been horrified that a wizard who was supposedly leading the right side sullied himself by making a horcrux.

** I write a /lot/ about Regulus!

I have a similar interpretation to you: that he took after Orion while Sirius was a lot like Walburga (and Bellatrix).

My Regulus was a quiet, intelligent, and gentle child. He longed for affection and attention from his parents. As an extrovert, Sirius got attention by acting out - but as an introvert, Regulus did his best to live up to his parents' expectations of him.

No doubt he accepted what he was told about pureblood supremacy (how could he not, when he would almost certainly have never interacted with a muggle-born let alone a muggle before Hogwarts?) but was quite insecure about his place among the 'Noble' Blacks as the youngest, quietest and most desperate to please member of the family. I imagine Black family gatherings as a host of elderly aunts and uncles muttering about the shortcomings of the youths, and while his three cousins were old enough and Sirius bold enough to shake off their comments, Regulus probably struggled quite a lot.

Of course, a big turning point was when Sirius went to Hogwarts. Regulus was alone with his parents for the first time, and no doubt there were a lot of fights about Sirius's placement in Gryffindor, and then when he came home Regulus would have to listen to his stories about his new mate James. I'm sure Regulus felt a lot of anger and resentment towards James as he imagined him stealing his brother away from him.

As for joining the Death Eaters, I don't believe at all that it was about blood supremacy (I like to think he would have understood how ridiculous that was when he was at school and saw the brilliance, even in Slytherin, of students who weren't pureblood) but more a combination of peer pressure and family expectations. His parents never joined, but Bellatrix and Lucius would have been extolling the Dark Lord's virtues and I imagine Walburga thinking it an excellent way to toughen her sensitive boy up. And I always picture Bellatrix taking control of Regulus's Death Eater training before he reached 17, to his horror.

I imagine his later years at Hogwarts being full of anxiety about where his life was headed, frustration at the adults in his life either taking control and making decisions for him (Walburga, Bellatrix) or failing to help him at all (Orion, perhaps even Dumbledore?) and worry about what Sirius was getting into and whether they would end up facing each other on the battlefield.

I think, ultimately, he just wants to be accepted and liked/loved for who he is, not who his parents push him to be or his brother wants him to be or his peers expect him to be. I think Voldemort's abuse of Kreacher was the last straw that made him snap, and I fully believe that he knew he would not walk out of that cave alive.

He's a tragic character with amazing potential, and I wish JKR had written more about him, but I have a lot of fun trying to fill in the gaps!

** I think that, like his parents he was likely one of those “Not in my neighbourhood” types of racists, who was blood-purist but just wasn't on board for the lynch mobs. Joined the Death eaters out of a mixture of teen rebellion (his parents were supporters of the dark lord's politics, but disagreed with his methods) and good old fashioned radicalisation, then realised what was actually involved.

** I don't think of Regulus as a good or bad guy but as a kid who passively accepted his parents' beliefs without much questioning until he joined Death Eaters and had his "sixth-year Draco 'I'm-In-Deep-Shit' Malfoy" moment. I still think he believed in pureblood supremacy until the day he died, but he wasn't cruel and didn't want to personally hurt people.

His childhood must have been very lonely. He probably held a lot of resentment towards Sirius and felt that his older brother had abandoned him for his Gryffindor friends. Walburga and Orion are implied to be abusive, though probably in a different way to Regulus than to Sirius. His cousins are all too old to hang out with them. So the closest person in the family for him was Kreacher, who probably showed him more love than both of his parents together.

One time I wrote him, I wrote him as a hopeless romantic, a gentle soul who would however do some daring and ridiculous things for the object of his affections, but it was for a comedy fic.

*** I think he could have been thinking like I know I am superior is that not enough why all the violence and killing.

Regulus was railroaded grew up in a family with them beliefs, and then get sorted into a house that is just soaking with those beliefs,

I think Regulus had a kindness to him and while he was already feeling disillusioned after leaving school and joining the war, Kreachers treatment was the last step, Regulus must also be decently well read as he knew what a horcrux was, so I Imagine before he went to the cave he did some research and then decided to end his life trying to make voldemort mortal.

Regulus was still super young when he died and I have a feeling if he lived he would Join the order in the second war.

I can picture regulus being heart broken about turning against voldemort and then ''discovering'' his older brother had Joined Voldemort and betrayed the Potters

** I would write him like a more talented Draco Malfoy as a child and preteen. As a teenager...definitely passive and observant, but not necessarily quite. A mama's boy all his life for sure who allows himself to be swayed by his overbearing mother and outrageously violent cousin. He envies his brother's courage a bit.

*** Yeah I like this interpretation, gives me vibes of Dumbledore and Aberforth's dynamic, one feels like they are in the shadow of the other. Possibly both even, Sirius always feeling second to his family and Regulus feeling second in everywhere else.

** I've always imagined him as a whiny momma's boy. Who gets a swift kick up the ass, just not in time to fix his life.

He's basically had his whole life on a silver spoon, always been the indulged child, probably never felt actual consequences for his actions. And at school lived in his brothers shadow.

Especially based on book 7, I've felt that he was that irresponsible teenager who when the real world kicked them in the ass in adulthood. Went oh crap I screwed everything up and trying frantically to fix it before the whole life goes down the toilet.

I think he definitely learned humility in Voldemort's death eaters and found his humanity and selflessness towards the end.

** Regulus could be written into really excellent character, but you have two obstacles to make:

1. Write convincing Death Eater. He must be really nasty, racist without any reservations (not all those Snapes who look like teddy-bears in denial), and yet you must explain convincingly why anybody would be such person, so that normal readers (with normal ethical etc. sensibilities) are able to accept it as a possible (even though unacceptable).
2. Write convincing turning around. Again, not all those cheesy Snapes “Oh, loving, not hating! That's what I was missing.”, but really somebody who is sick from himself and founds a way out of it. Why? What happened?

The end itself could be probably classical Racine-like: sacrificing himself for the welfare of community (or is it Corneille?).
