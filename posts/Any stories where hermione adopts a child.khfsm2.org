Basically any stories where she adopts a child- cannot be her own. Preferably no crossovers. Must be complete. She can have a partner although no Romione. It can also be more than one child. Thank you so much.


** This is one of my favourites, I don't know if you're okay with it, but the endgame is Harmony and Hermione fosters and then adopts more than one child.

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione

**** Most canon plot points have been resolved. There really isn't much left to be said. Fic could be complete within 2 or 3 chapters. Why Harry wouldn't check up on his younger self is a mystery. For more Little!Harry fluff: linkao3(The secret language of plants). For a realistic abused child recovery fic: linkffn(Always in Your Shadow:Calista Snape Volume I).

***** I get what you're saying, but I still kind of wish they could still have seen (or is it saw? My grammar is failing me,) it through. A definitive ending. Maybe some sort of war cleanup and such. Even just some more fluffy stuff lol.

I really liked how original it was, I've never seen another quite like it.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

  "Hermione Jean Granger made her way towards the basement where she knew the child was being kept. She mentally cursed herself for not rushing over here as soon as she had found out. She had been such a coward, putting her own fears and feelings above an innocent child's safety." Or: A rewrite of The Cursed Child.
