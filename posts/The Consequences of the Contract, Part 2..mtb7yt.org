Due to popular demand, I'm following up on this little post [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mqgdwu/the_consequences_of_the_contract/][here]]

--------------

  Harry entered the great hall, where the rest of the students were still sitting, waiting for the faculty to rejoin them, and some few still grazing on the dessert platters. The murmured conversation stopped as the door seemed unnaturally loud when he closed it behind him. The conversations resumed after a moment, as nothing short of a professor on a warpath could silence gossip for more than a few seconds, though Harry could feel every eye in the Great Hall on him as he made is way back to the Gryffindor table.\\
   It was a bit of an unusual scene he saw as he walked back. The Slytherins were either pointedly indifferent, or glaring at the Gryffindor table, which was hardly unusual. What /was/ unusual was the Hufflepuff table, who kept shooting hostile glares at the Gryffindors, Harry especially.\\
   Normally, that only happened after the twins had pulled particularly mean prank on them, but they hadn't been pulling any pranks since the goblet was presented. They had been concentrating on finagling their way past the Age Line, with nothing to show for it except for successively longer beards for each attempt. Their hair was still white from their last attempt, though they were again clean shaven. Lee kept dangling his fingers from his chin and laughing at them.\\
   Finally he arrived at his spot, where Hermione and Ron was sitting, with Ron somehow taking up twice the usual space. "Oi, budge up," Harry said to him.\\
   Ron simply grunted and remained in place, refusing to allow Harry to sit.\\
  Hermione rolled her eyes and moved over to make space for Harry on the other side, "So what happened? Are you going to compete? What were you thinking? This tournament could get you killed you know! It was-" she rattled off question after question, barely pausing for breath.\\
   "Hermione-" Harry started, but she kept speaking as if he hadn't said a word.\\
   "-incredibly irresponsible for you to join a tournament meant for adults! How could you? Don't you know-"\\
   "HERMIONE!" Harry shouted, cutting her off. Another awkward moment ensued as he somehow managed to time his shout with another lull in the conversation. Harry just hadn't noticed the conversation went quiet as the Great Hall watched the byplay between them.\\
   Hermione, for her part, cut off her rambling questions interspersed with admonishments.\\
   "Hermione," Harry continued in a more conversational tone. "I don't know how I was picked by the Goblet, but it wasn't anything I did. I'm not going to compete. I forfeit-"\\
   "You WHAT" Ron and Hermione both shouted at the same time.\\
   "The prize money!" said Ron.\\
   "Your magic!" said Hermione.\\
   "The glory!"\\
  "They'll expel you without magic!"\\
  They were now speaking at the same time about all the things he was losing because he forfeited.\\
   Harry sat and stared at them until they ran out of steam. "One at a time please."\\
   "What about the eternal glory? The prize money?" asked Ron, the desserts on his plate mostly forgotten.\\
  "Eternal glory? Do you know who won the last Triwizard Tournament?" Harry asked in response.\\
   "Umm.. No," muttered Ron.\\
   "Does anyone here at this table know the name of the last winner of the Triwizard Tournament?" Harry asked, then added, "Besides Hermione?" when it looked like she would interject. "Hermione," he muttered, "you've read /Hogwarts, A History/ cover to cover. Three times. In the last two months."\\
   Everyone else said no, except for one, that Harry hadn't interacted with before, but looked about the same age as the twins, who nodded. "It was my great great great great great great great grand uncle, Dauid McLaggen. He was the champion to survive the last tournament with the fewest injuries. He wasn't able to father any children as a result though, so the family was carried on by his brother."\\
   "Has anyone else ever heard of Dauid McLaggen before this conversation?" Harry asked.\\
  Everyone else muttered no, except for Hermione, who was looking a little mutinous at this point.\\
  "Right. So much for eternal glory," Harry said.\\
   McLaggen glared at him.\\
   "What about the money?" Ron persisted.\\
   "Ron, do you really think I stood a chance at winning the tournament meant for fully trained adult wizards, including Viktor Krum?"\\
   Ron's face was an open book, and every page full of warring ideas. Ultimately he shook his head. "I guess not."\\
   "Now," Harry said to Hermione, who was glaring at him by this point, "You had something to say?"\\
   "How could you forfeit the tournament? Your name coming out of the Goblet represents a magically binding contract!" she said, anger giving way to worry. Ron's face went pale at this announcement.\\
   "I forfeited because-"\\
   "Do you know the consequences of breaking a magically binding contract?" Hermione asked, her voice rising.\\
   "Hermione!" Harry said, a bit louder, cutting her off before she could build steam again. "Do /you/ know the consequences of breaking a magically binding contract?"\\
   "Well, it depends on the terms of the contract, but it can be anything all the way up to losing your magic. I don't know what it is for the Triwizard Tournament, /Hogwarts, A History/ didn't say, but-"\\
  "The consequences for breaking the the contract with the Goblet are loss of magic-" Harry started, and all hell broke loose among everyone listening. Hermione shrieked, Ron, if anything, went even more pale. Angelina and Alicia both looked shaken. Katie looked like she was about to rip something apart with her bare hands. The twins looked like they were planning on tracking someone down and humiliating them utterly, only moreso than usual. Neville looked about ready to faint dead away, but was holding onto consciousness. Ginny looked heartbroken. Even McLaggen looked a little worried on Harry's behalf.\\
   Harry tried to speak several times, but was drowned out by the noise. He waved to the twins and mimed at the ceiling. Fred nodded and waved his wand and a loud bang and puff of smoke issued from his wand, and the table lapsed into shocked silence.\\
   "Twenty points from Gryffindor!" Snape's voice floated through the door into the Great Hall. Everyone was a little puzzled as gems trickled into the counter as fast as they poured out, and the levels remained unchanged.\\
   "As I was saying, the consequences were the loss of your magic, or a 5 galleon fine," Harry finally finished.\\
The twins were first, George exploding into laughter, while Fred looked shocked for a moment, only to join his brother. Eventually the laughter spread out through the entire table, though for some, like Hermione, it was somewhat tinged with hysteria.\\
   "Merlin, Potter," McLaggen muttered. "You couldn't have said that part /first/?"


** The fallout with the rest of the school would be hilarious, especially the snowballing from the Hufflepuffs and Slytherins.

...Oh jeeze, Harry being stalked by Hufflepuffs, thinking he's either up to something or that it was "so brave to give up the chance of being a Triwizard Champion", while Harry is running away from the crazy witches.
