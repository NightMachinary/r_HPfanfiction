I have seen this in many fics and I am always curious why this would be so. I can understand that from our, or non-magical, perspective learning magic would be amazing, but for children from magical households magic is something pretty common, such as television or phones for us. Magic for them is an everyday thing. Most children are not really excited about learning about things like physics, circuits, softwares etc. when using objects like laptops and phones is just as exciting and magical if you don't know how they work. Just curious if this is a me thing or is it a common point in fanfics


** I think the initial excitment likely comes from finally being allowed/able to do the things that their parents and (if they have any) older siblings can do. Though that would very quickly fade as the dull reality of modern schooling sets in.

*** Yeah that would be the case I guess. Can be compared to getting a phone or a new device I think, excited at first but becomes part of life after some time

** Little kiddies are usually super excited about going to school and learning how to read and do the stuff the adult do. My niece definitely was and her little sister can't wait to learn all the stuff her big sister can do. And I think the car analogy the others have brought up works - you drive a car every day, but the first time you get to do it yourself is pretty cool.

** Maybe I'm just odd and nerdy, but I was excited for some classes in school, even as late as high school. I enjoyed learning how computers worked and how to do more things with them, even though computers were fairly commonplace by that time. I loved most of my science classes and even read ahead in the books. Days we got to do labs were my favorite. Even now I enjoy learning things about history or about science.

Something doesn't have to be out of the ordinary to be enjoyable.

** I think people are conflating doing and learning. Or rather practical vs written.

Muggle teenagers are excited to sit behind the car and drive. I don't know any who were excited to sit with that booklet and learn the laws. In that same vein magical children are happy to get their wands and say incantations, but not to sit down and pour over their books.

** Muggle children are excited to learn how to drive, even though driving is very common and not really all that interesting in reality.

*** Yeah but I compare driving more to broomsticks. Magic is does not have a sole purpose (travelling) and is probably more commonly used for everyday things such as cooking, chores etc. But your analogy makes sense ig

**** Some children are excited to cook and do chores. For example, my kid loves to vacuum the house.

*** Shit don't remind me. I was so excited when i got my license that i begged my dad to let me drive him everywhere. He travels a lot. I must have spent a full 25% of my time during summer 2019 behind the wheel.

** Magic is a big grown up thing and being allowed to do it means you are all grown up. It is a sort of right of passage into society. Also I assume that magic is used so much in the magical world that not being able to do it is a real disadvantage. They don't want to have to ask a parent or sibling every time they want to reach the high shelf, or do the washing up quickly or clean the stains on their clothes so they don't get told off. Finally it is not just about the magic. I assume that they had been told stories of other people's Hogwarts experiences their entire lives and want to create their own. For many it also seems to be the first time they have met other children outside their own family.

*** Yes but I considered driving compared to broomsticks, exciting but not multi purpose like magic. Though it does make sense to be excited about doing something for the first time.

** Why are high schoolers excited about learning to drive? Or young adults about reaching drinking age? It's cool because you weren't allowed to do it (yet).

** Tell me you wouldn't be excited to finally learn how to drive or have your first drink, for example? It's a thing magical kids are denied until they reach of age and absolutely cannot practice until 11.
