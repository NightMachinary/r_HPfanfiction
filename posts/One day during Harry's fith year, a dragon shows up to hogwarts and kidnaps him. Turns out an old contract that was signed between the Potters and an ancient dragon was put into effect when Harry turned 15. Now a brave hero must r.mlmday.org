*** "Harry! Harry, where are ye?"

"Hagrid!" Harry craned his neck to look down the jagged mountainside. The claws gripping his abdomen stiffened and a low growl emanated from the uncomfortably close maw of his captor. "Hagrid, I'm up here! Help!"

"Harry?" The burly half-giant emerged from between the sharp rocks and scanned the peak of the mountain. "Oh there ye are! I been tracking you halfway 'cross the country I have!"

Harry beamed, secure in the knowledge that Hagrid would rescue him from this predicament. "Alright, I think you caught it off guard, so if we move quickly we should be able to get out of here before it gets its bearings. My wand's over there, can you-"

"Jus' one second Harry." Hagrid strolled over and placed a hand on the still-open maw. "Well hello there, aren't ye a marvel! And a lovely nest! Wha' is that, three, four eggs? Very healthy-like," he crooned as he patted the dragon's snout.

Harry stared at him for a few moments. Then he hung his head.

"...Hagrid, why are you here?"

"Te meet yer friend o'course! Now tell me, have ye seen any others? What was her flight patttern like?" Hagrid's eyes lit up. "Has she breathed fire yet?"

Harry sighed and looked back down the mountain. They were what, a kilometer up? Surely Ron and Hermione were close behind, right?

...Right?

  Fearing for his life, Harry Potter foolishly attempts a ritual meant to give him power and protection against a dragon. "Why is the story called Draconian Mishap, Husband?" "Ehm, I don't know, Wife. It's that stupid author, who thinks he's smart." A certified crack-fic with a dragon wife and a human husband. Enjoy!
