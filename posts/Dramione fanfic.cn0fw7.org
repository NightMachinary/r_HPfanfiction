Hi everyone, I can't remember the title of a specific dramione fanfiction that I loved. It's one word I think and the author I believe starts with a B with several X's at the end. Hermione goes back to Hogwarts and has to room with Draco because he's hiding from Voldemort. If you need more info about the beginning, I remember chunks, but it's a longer, more well-known one. Help would be appreciated! Thank you!

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.
