The idea is that many were bummed he didn't come into power. Rowling even says on pottermore

"Draco was raised in an atmosphere of regret that the Dark Lord had not succeeded in taking command of the wizarding community, although he was prudently reminded that such sentiments ought not to be expressed outside the small circle of the family and their close friends ‘or Daddy might get into trouble."

But anytime you see a Death Eater's reaction to his return its not a happy one. Unless said death eater is highly unstable like Bellatrix.

By all accounts they are much more stressed now that he is back. Even they have less freedom. And theres no indication that his behavior used to be much different.

So why the hell did they want the guy back? Sure ok his view points lined up with theirs. But why wouldn't they put their money behind another bigot who they were less intimidated by after Voldemort dissappeared? They had almost 14 years.


** Most of the Death Eaters we see in canon are veterans of the last conflict. They were young then and far more willing to bleed for a cause. The ones who escaped Azkaban then spent fourteen years enjoying wealth and, to one extent or another, power. Its not that unrealistic that a bunch of people who followed a lunatic in their youth, and who enjoyed the concept of having him back when it was just a concept, would be less than thrilled by the reality of it. They got older, slower and less willing to suffer for their cause. The ones in Azkaban remained exactly the same as they were mentally because their limited experiences gave them little to no room to change even beyond their insanity.

​

Just imagine a bunch of "rebels" who caused shit in their teens and twenties, then went on to experience no consequences for their actions and even lived lives of luxury reacting to their old leader trying to get the band back together in their thirties and forties.

** Simple. They don't want another War, they want to /win/. They wish Lord Voldemort would just /win/ already and take over the world with them as the new aristocracy, and they want him back for this purpose. But that doesn't mean they like the whole "cold war where we're his disposable mooks" prelude to the Great Victory one bit. They just grin and bear it as best they can for the sake of the brave new world they hope he'll build. Hence, when you ask them, "do you wish Voldemort would get another shot at taking over the world?", they're all for it, but when urgently faced with the prospect of Voldemort being back for them right here right now, they're not quite as giddy.

The reason they couldn't put their money behind some other bloke is that there is no other bloke available. Lord Voldemort was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of an /absurdly/ powerful and intelligent sorcerer willing to further their ideals. There are other magic-prodigies, and there are other bigots, but there's not a lot of crossover between these two categories because the Wizarding population is too small for that to happen. If they'd tried to elect Malfoy the new Dark Lord or something, he'd have been beaten in an afternoon by the Auror corps, even if he'd had access to all the resources of Lord Voldemort, because he's just not personally good enough at magic. They could maybe have gotten /somewhere/ by hiring someone of slightly lesser, but still impressive skill, like, say, Bellatrix, but sooner or later Dumbledore would have shown up and swatted them away.

*** I don't buy that.

I dare say the Death Eaters, especially Rookwood, Rosier (standing in for the first gen Death Eaters), and Malfoy (who ought to be intelligent enough if you ignore the movies), had to have known that Voldemort was never going to share anything with them at any point in time. There would never be a 'happily ever after' with a Voldemort-type person because for someone like him, there's always the anticipation of the next enemy. Riddle was afraid and spiteful, that's his entire persona.

That type of person is wholly incapable of building lasting peace of any sort, and one of the major logical shortcomings of Riddle as a character is that anyone intelligent ought to have seen that. Worse, Voldemort isn't even shown to be particularly good at planning or, let's face it, leading.I don't deny that people could still follow a sufficiently charismatic (or powerful, since that is an aspect that doesn't translate well to the real world) person, but a sadistic sociopath like Voldemort would always passively nauseate even his staunchest supporters. This is also why the comparison of Voldemort and real fascist leaders falls short; they at least -- their megalomaniac and dilusional tendencies notwithstanding -- could show real empathy, even love for their subjects at times. That's why people followed them. It's easy to subject to another if you feel like that person shares something with you in return. The only thing Voldemort ever shared was his mark. All right, I admit people might still think that was a great honour, but by all accounts, it freaking hurt for the most part. But why did it? Because of its magic? Maybe. But it also fits perfectly with how Voldemort appeared thoroughly incapable of positive emotions at some point.Voldemort never really did anything to endear his subjects to him. That's why I propose that, in the real world, his Death Eaters would've abandoned him long before the end.

I also don't buy into your other argument. The state of the British political system made it abundantly clear that a few determined, wealthy people could basically get away with murder. Malfoy alone is so ridiculously influential throughout the majority of the books even though his only office is a token post that you get the feeling that with a few people at his back, he could've easily made Fudge into even more of a puppet.

People put too much emphasis on the entire Dark Lord nonsense.If Malfoy and the others really desired a conservative shift in society, they would have considered working for that after the Dark Lord's fall. They didn't though. They did, at most, push back a bit or flaunt their wealth and influence.

I think it all falls apart a bit too quickly with Voldemort out of the picture. If his regime was winning, why did it make such a big difference when he was out of the picture? The only conceivable answer would be that he was holding it all together, that they, indeed, were all his faithful Death Eaters, an army of thugish, mediocre yes-men and sadists.I like the irony in that, but I also feel some amount of doubt that people like that could've conquered a somewhat established government. You can't have both: either they're mindless drones, or they're influential elites (or a mix). But the way they act seems to suggest that they happily switch between both states at Rowling's convenience.

Tl;dr: I think the Death Eaters and Voldemort were mostly plot elements for Rowling, no matter how much she tries to fix this retrospecively, and their movement doesn't seem like much more than a bastardised, hollow echo of historical personality cults.

Rowling's first two books were basically fairy tales. Their take on morality and plot design are fairly basic. That's not a bad thing or a shortcoming, but people really should stop overanalysing what few lines we have about such topics.

Except that time he planned a kidnapping so well he fooled Dumbledore. And that time he lured Harry to the Ministry. Him being outsmarted by Dumbledore for the most part doesn't mean he didn't plan well.

And died for it. They can't beat Voldemort collectively or alone and, as we see, he knows how to track people down.

I don't disagree, though, but it wouldn't be because he didn't endear himself. It would be because they'd realize he was for self and not for the cause, which is pretty much how Regulus' story ended and what Lucius was truly loyal to.

They weren't all wealthy, despite what fanon wants us to believe and they didn't get away with it because of money. They got away with it because they told a lie no one could prove. The imperius curse ends only if it's thrown off or if the caster dies.

Who says they didn't try? By all appearances Bagnold delegated a lot of power to Crouch Sr and Dumbledore had far more power and influence than Malfoy with OOTP being the lone exception.

I dispute both sentiments. Like you see with organised criminality, when the incentive (and risk) to stay a criminal are lesser than those of switching sides, many people will consider it. I doubt Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to hide a few defectors, and fighting the war entailed the very real chance of dying (to either a homocidally mad Dark Lord or Aurors, Order members). He offered it to Draco, who -- by any modern understanding of law -- was undoubtedly guilty of attempted murder among other things. Furthermore, we saw three competent people battling Voldemort, at least for a while (near the end). Yes, he overpowered them, but would he have overpowered five? Seven? Ten? Doesn't seem like a foregone conclusion. They could, at the very least, have destroyed his body. They didn't exactly know about the Horcruxes after all, which in my mind should've pushed them to betray him even more.

The first I'm aware of, and I didn't try to indicate otherwise. But look at how Lucius, with a few threats and some public standing and influence manages to sack Dumbledore and chuck Hagrid in prison through Fudge. When push comes to shove, the institutional resilience of Britain seems very weak. I suppose Rowling wanted it to be a nod towards the Weimar Republic, but that only gives further credence to my opinion that determined and ruthless men could've exploited the system far worse and far earlier than OotP.

I agree with this at least. Dumbledore had a lot more pull with the government than any one person should've had. But that doesn't exactly contradict my claim. It's only a second side playing corruptionist, even if their justification is undoubtedly more humane.

Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.

There are only a few notable Death Eaters: Rosier, Snape, Dolohov, Bella, Rookwood, and BCJ. Bella and BCJ aren't turning on him. I can't say much about Dolohov as we don't know anything about him, but I'm inclined to believe he was just as insane as Bella and BCJ. So that leaves Rosier, Snape, and Rookwood. 3 very Death Eaters who, depending on their age, are about equal to McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn (who Voldemort toyed with) and a slew of above average to mediocre ones.

I mean, these are the same group of Death Eaters who tried to run when Dumbledore showed up in the DoM despite having all 3 aurors down and Sirius dead.

** All the free death-eaters spend the last ten years getting settled into a comfortable life. The might regret that the Dark Lord had failed but they also know that they got of easy the last time. They know that round 2 of the war will once again come with a lot of sacrifices and effort, they are once again subjected to the torturous whims of unstable villain, they now know that their Dark Lord had already been defeated once and might be again, and they know that if they lose in round 2, then there is no way they can escape easily again.

So I think it's quite understandable that most of his followers are a lot more resigned now than they were before. Its also quite possible that they heavily romanticised serving him, forgetting the torture and humiliation and focussing on their dreams of domination. It's a general human phenomenon to romanticise one's past.

And they didn't support another dark lord because there was none. Wizards like Grindelwald, Riddle or Dumbledore are only a few in each generation. They would need a wizard of absolute top tier who was willing to subscribe to blood-purism and was ambitious enough to take on the world. That's a /very/ strict filter.

** In addition to the other reasons mentioned above, I also think that they are more stressed by his return because suddenly any Death Eater who was anything less than 100% loyal is under close scrutiny and could be turned on by Voldemort at any moment.

If you go back to his return speech in GoF, you'll notice that he starts off by mentioning "a stench of guilt", scolds the Death Eaters for the fact that hardly anybody tried to find him, and then uses the Cruciatus curse on the first person who begs forgiveness. Later on, certain Death Eaters would have seen how angry Voldemort became after learning that Lucius inadvertently threw away one of his Horcruxes.

So I think most Death Eaters are initially pleased at the prospect of having him back, but when he actually is back, there's reason for concern because the realization sets in that nobody is safe, not even among themselves.
