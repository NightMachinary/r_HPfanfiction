From canon, we know what can block a killing curse.

1. Physical objects
2. Living creatures
3. A spell from a brother wand
4. Harry Potter (loving sacrifices)

My question for discussion is what would happen if two wizards fired a killing curse at each other (without brother wands). Could the spells intercept each other or would they just pass right through each other?

*** If you cut them up into pieces first, each puff could stop multiple curses.

**** Nah. You enchant their clothes to keep them upright after death so they can absorb more curses. They'll huff and they'll puff but they'll never break down our corpse wall.

***** There's a great abandoned fanfic, linkffn(8096183), that helps Harry who to determine is who is a main character and who is secondary by counting the number of adjectives that describe them.

  "Ha ha! I knew it. Make sure to stay on your toes these next few days. The early days are key---everything anyone says is going to be a clue to events that will come up later. In fact, make a list. Here," Milo said, passing Harry a sheet of parchment and a quill from his belt. "write down everyone you've met who could be described with more than two adjectives, everything anyone said in a quiet voice that was cut off before they could finish, and every named character you've been introduced to, okay? It will be relevant. There may be an exam on it later, and it will probably be pass-or-die. Have you started gathering your party together yet?"

  More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening --

Yep, it's blockable with another spell. I wouldn't rely on it though.

** I saw someone speculating it may be possible to intercept it, but because of its great speed it would be like shooting at a fired bullet.

*** I'm trying to think if it would be possible to create a killing shield. Like a shield based on the killing curse that kills anything that touches it.

**** Wellp, the killing curse as we know it needs to be cast at someone/thing alive and with sufficient hatred/wish to kill, right? So in order to create a shield you're describing it would both need a different emotional requirement as well as a different 'anchor' (open space or another spell as opposed to a being).. If you're writing a story, you could probably make some hand-wavy explanation how one becomes the other, otherwise it just sounds like a wholly new and different spell. But yeah, if we assume such a spell could be created, there's no reason it couldn't have been based on the killing curse.

Does remind me of a fanon shield I came across, though! In The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter on ffn there's a so called "depulso shield", which is a red barrier that disintegrates anything that comes into contact with it save for the person who cast it IIRC. It's never stopped the killing curse, but there's some charmed piece of jewellery that does, in the same series.
