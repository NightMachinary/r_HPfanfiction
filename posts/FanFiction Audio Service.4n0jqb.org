Hello, everyone, as I once mentioned under a different account (AkihhikoKayaba). I am going to create a FanFiction Audio Service. I've compiled a google document listing the fics I'm doing and voice actors who will be voicing the various characters. This document will grow as I get more people for Voice Acting. First, I will be doing Not From Others, written by our very own FloreatCastellum. I will take requests in to be added to the list. You can find the document here.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MAhsGXqf9eskoXce96pRwSSBbgaNVv7S81oxSDvaXjk/edit#]]

If anyone from the community would like to voice a character, leave a comment here or on the document telling me the character you would like to voice and I will add you to the list.


** I can't say I have the stuff to be a vice actor, but having stories be taken into an audial context would be amazing. I use a Fanfiction app to narrate stories I download, but it isn't perfect by any stretch and is downright cumbersome at times.

I think this is amazing and look forward to seeing it reach fruition.

*** Just curious, what's the app that you use?

**** Readup - Pro Overall I love the app, but it does have it's shortcomings.

It's ffn only, the update process can take a while if you have a loy of stories and the narration feature requires the app to be open or it randomly closes the app and stops narrating and will lose your place.

On the other hand, the library is fairly efficient with several sorting methods as well as filtering and customizable tags, it's convenient and can favorite/follow stories in app or review in the internal browser. You can add by story id or by browsing/searching. Overall the interface is fairly user-friendly.

I actually paid to get the premium version which doesn't add any features besides being ad-free.

** What are you looking for exactly? People with english accents only? English spoken with little to no accent? While it would be fun to participate, my accent is very audibly german and would probably break immersion in serious situations.

*** If you could fake an English accent, it would be great, it would also be nice (although not required) to have some experience in Drama.

** I would definitely like to get in on the action. I can do voices for females, or I can do narration. I don't have a specific character in mind, though.

** I could practice an English accent, I've always wanted to be able to speak with an accent. I'll do that, and you can decide if I actually sound decent enough.
