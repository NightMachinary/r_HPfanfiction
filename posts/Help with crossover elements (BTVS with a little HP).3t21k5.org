I'm writing a story [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][Blood and Chaos: The Story of a [BTVS SI] Turned Vampire]] over on the spacebattles forums. It's set in the BTVS world, but because I want to write a sequel / parallel story that handles the main character's soul winding up as Diary!Tom's roommate in the diary horcrux... I have Jack occasionally get stray thoughts and memories from a 16 year old tom riddle.

Can anyone think of amusing tidbits or one line 'WTF was that?' ideas?

It has also been pointed out to me in the forums that an amusing 'ending' would be if the BTVS crew tried to re-ensoul Jack and wound up summoning Voldemort. So any thoughts on how an /Evil/ HP wizard would react to the magic system of BTVS would also be appreciated.
