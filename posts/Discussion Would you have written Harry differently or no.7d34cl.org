I often hear complaints again Harry's character, and I was curious; if you were the writer of the series would you have written him differently?

And if you would write him differently how differently? Would there be any aspects of Harry in the series that were in the series written in your version of Harry? Would he be completely and 100% different?

Thoughts? And note this isn't to bash anyone's ideas.


** Harry in Canon is rather dull. He has his moments. He is prone to teenage angst, crushes and stubbornness. He is a bit of a slacker, and was a bit clueless as a leader; he was forced into leading DA(which he did pretty good), but never restarted it. He didn't have a plan to defeat voldemort when the horcruxes were done; he never even prepared for the confrontation.

But that's the whole point of Harry. Harry always wanted himself to be just another kid on the block, and he was written as such. He was no magical prodigy(he was quite good, but lacked motivation to actually master his magical arsenal). He was hardworking when required, but not always. And all these characteristics can be associated with a normal teenager.

Harry is not Neo from Matrix or Anakin Skywalker. Harry is Frodo or even Luke Skywalker to an extent. He's a normal teenager who was marked by chance and completed his task by a combination of luck and perseverance. Neville would have been more of a leader than Harry, if Neville was the chosen one. Because Harry did not care about being the leader, more often than not. All he wanted was to finish off the voldemort menance and live a peaceful life.

Some fanfictions have often made Harry this impeccably perfect character, sometimes people forget that JK Rowling intended Harry to perceive himself as normal, and that's how she wrote it. And I'm completely fine with it.

*** But that's not realistic at all. Even people who are otherwise normal, when they see their impending end, do something about it. For the most part, Harry doesn't. And when he does, he doesn't put nearly as much effort as he should---as a normal person would.

**** In my headcannon, because of Dursleys, he -in a subconscious level- believes himself to be a worthless freak and a piece of shit. He doesn't values himself. He is actually quite suicidal or at least doesn't really cares about himself. He's there for all others but he is not in peace with himself. He fights Voldemort not because he wants a better future for himself but for his friends. He blames himself to be the guilty one whether he is truly guilty or not because he is programmed like this. People who doesn't like themselves tend to act like this so I believe Harry was such a person. So in the end, I believe Harry didn't care about his death. He didn't actively tried to kill himself but he didn't shy away from situations which would end his life because he saw himself as a worthless person.

***** Took words from my mouth. This is what I felt too. He wasn't suicidal, but he definitely didn't value his life much.

Harry had nothing to live for. Yes, he had his friends, but he eventually believed that his life is a small exchange for taking out voldemort for the wizarding world. He gladly walked to Voldemort because of the same.

I believe he wasn't suicidal because even after being given an option to move on, he chose to come back. Yes, it's more so that he could finish off voldemort for good, but he returned to live, nevertheless.

However I remember my first time reading the books, and I could never put them down til i finished. A smarter harry, more hardworking harry, overly even focused on voldemort's Destruction harry might not have sucked me in as well. I love redo fix it fics and so on, and jkr isn't free from criticism, but her characters are nothing short of brilliant. Movies sometimes didn't portray them how i'd expect but so what... the books are genius. I think fan fiction does the job of rewriting harry well enough

** I think people most often take issue with Harry's apparent lack of dedication once it is clear Voldemort is around and very much wants Harry dead. Exactly what they want I doubt they know but they just want to see more.

On a more personal note, my personality and canon Harry's are rather different. Things that I couldn't and to an extent still can't wrap my head around are for example Harry's tendency to share. This is very apparent in the first book when he makes friends with Ron, Harry having been deprived of so many things during his childhood instantly chooses to share. It wins him a friend yes, it might have been awkward to have the snacks while Ron picked at his corned beef but to me it would have made more sense for Harry to keep it to himself given the knowledge Dudley used to take anything nice he had. Out of habit alone he might have held some back. Other things include my dislike for Hermione. I find her irritating, she's not a bad person but I don't like her and her behavior she would have irritated me too much to stay friends with her, as such if I were to rewrite it Hermione would be relegated to a minor character simply because I wouldn't have Harry care enough one way or the other. No bashing no basking. Another thing that I would have done differently is Harry's actions following watching Snape's memories, namely there is no way I would have named a child after him, nor would I have done anything to clear his name. The man was an arse of the highest order who bullied children out of bitterness and spite. Not a legacy I would wish to preserve in any child.

In the Books, Harry obviously didn't enjoy her company that much. But Harry could look beyond her character flaws and see her true value, unlike you who will deny a great friendship and reject an ally just because some superficial personality flaws.

People couldn't be friends with Harry because they'd have to be around Hermione.

Call me utilitarian, but a friendship should also be about helping each other and making themselves useful to each other. Especially when you are in life and death situations, you can trust that one at your side.

Friendship is /far more/ than about just having a good time with each other. Your best drinking buddy or party friend might /betray/ you the first chance he/she gets to save his/her own ass.

Hermione was definitely not Harry's party friend, but he /trusted/ her to be with him when the going gets tough. That is for me TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

***** I agree she's not on Dumbledore, Grindelwald or Voldemort's level. She was a good witch but she wasn't amazing. It's only Remus Lupin that said she was smart, and while he was a cool wizard he wasn't a titan like Dumbledore lol.

She only had knowledge (and not a lot if you count the Dark arts), whereas the three here I've listed had knowledge and power. Like for real a 15 year old Tom Riddle would wipe the floor with a fully grown Hermione.

Owl wise you even get people like Barty Crouch Jr so she isn't exactly top tier. Fuck even Bill and Percy managed to get 12 Owls. Hermione ditched 2 (in her third year) so she could lighten her work load, so why did these 3 wizards manage to do just fine? (At a higher level also considering 3rd year work is easier than 5th year work) I'll tell you why, because Hermione is hard working, not a genius (I don't care what JK Rowling says).

People even in real life do pass courses with near 100% without studying, they just turn up at the class, listen, do the required homework and don't even think about the class outside of class time. I can't imagine someone like Tom Riddle worrying about a test lol. (Dumbledore also said Tom was the most gifted student Hogwarts ever had)

Hermione has average to above average intelligence (Not genius) and merely studies harder than everyone else in her year. Percy is probably the same. Bill I don't know much about, he could just be gifted. Percy strikes me as the Hermione type though (Studies a lot to make sure she passes with a high mark, as opposed to inherent talent)

What impresses me most about Hermione is her drive to learn. She's a Muggle-Born and she knows she has something to prove in this new world of hers, but she never seems to waver in the trove of understanding she could gain which pushes her above her peers at Hogwarts. She's tenacious, a bad-ass, and a completely loyal friend to Harry (who didn't seem to enjoy her friendship as much as he did with Ron).

Also Tenacity can easily flip to Stubbornness, which she often is and her reputation as a know-it-all is well deserved (look at how she acts several times in class). She seems like she could be a good friend to those who can put up with these traits, but the books only show us snapshots of her. Being around her every day would drive me crazy, as she is the type of person who I would not like to be around too much.

Also I completely understand Harry enjoying Ron's friendship more, they're more alike than he is with Hermione. Both play the same sport, appear to play the same game, neither of them are overachievers like Hermione, and their personalities are pretty similar. Ron has his faults just like Harry and Hermione, but it's not really a stretch to see that out of the three Ron and Harry are the best friends.

** The first thing I would change is to remake Voldemort. I don't care for that typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain that has been done ad nauseam these days. I would make him a complex person with some great personal virtues, but unfortunately found himself on the wrong side of history.

The next thing I would change is Dumbledore. He should no longer be that dumbed down plot device who only showed up in last chapter to sort out things. He would be that machiavellian puppet master who fought on the right side of history, and he would do lots of heavy lifting and maneuvering himself.

I would also get rid of the entire Roald-Dahlesque Dursley scheme. It made no sense to dump the hope of your nation into an abusive home, and the chance of getting your next deranged dark lord was just too high. Buying reader sympathy by letting heroes growing up in abusive household is way overused IMO.

Harry only cares about his parents when it's important to the story. When it would merely color in the story better, provide more background, or it wouldn't matter at all, he hasn't done anything to learn about them. It's an extreme example of plot-driven writing.

After living a live of abuse by the Dursley, there is absolutely no way that he could be such a gentle person, (like Tom) and also I wouldn't have make him befriend Hermione. I mean, look how he describe her at first. He uses the term (not exactly those, I translated from my first language) "annoying" "bossing tone" "pompous". You don't suddenly befriend someone just because you saved him. And I would make him leave the Dursley after the first year. I mean, he asked Dumbledore if he could leave who answered no and he obeyed him. Why? Dumbledore has no authority on what Harry does during his vacation. He could rent a chamber at the Leaky Cauldron during the whole summer, he does have the gold for it.

*** He does have the gold for it but Dumbledore enchanted his childhood home with the Dursley's (his only remaining blood-related family) with an ancient magic that protected him from outer evils, like Voldemort. There is no such thing at the Leaky Cauldron and he would have been vulnerable to attacks, even if Voldemort wasn't yet at full power.

I definitely agree about studying harder after realizing how pertinent the threat is. For that matter, I've always felt that if I were given the opportunity to study at a wizarding school, I would be busting my ass to learn and grow. Similar to Hermione's character but less pompous about it. I also wish she would have gone into more detail with some of the spells and how they work. I would have found it interesting to learn more about the magical subjects they were studying and what exactly they were learning rather than generally addressing the names of classes and talking about the extreme amounts of homework they had to accomplish.

**** I would have tried my luck outside. Still better than getting abused by the Dursley. Besides, at the time, Harry didn't know that the house was magically protected, he just obeyed stupidly Dumbledore, and this bother me. If my Headmaster (or rather old Headmaster, because I'm not in school anymore) asked me to live somewhere, I would have told him to back off and not to meddle with my private life.

I guess it's because Harry is isolated from everybody who isn't at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is the highest authority there.

****** Yeah, from Harry's point of view, Dumbledore is The Knowledge. He's the highest authority in the wizarding world that Harry knows of. Of course he would ask someone who knows so much. There's also the fact that Harry does not think he himself has any authority. A lot of kids are taught this. We have to ask for a hall pass to go to the bathroom, we don't have the authority to give ourselves permission. Ask to do this, ask to do that. That's part of the transition into adulthood, is realizing you have authority over yourself and learning how to wield it. Maybe some kids learned this early, but I certainly wasn't one. Harry with his oppression at the Durselys wasn't one either.

**** I agree about the class stuff, but I think mainstream readers wouldn't be too interested in how magic actually works in-universe, but that's totally my jam. I would be happy to read a rehash of the normal storyline with just a really in-depth magic explaination and more creative use of spellwork. My favorite part about fanfics are when there is an in depth explaination about magical theory, spellcraft, etc. and seeing how the characters use them in creative ways.

Sidenote: if anyone knows any fics that do a good job with magical theory, spellcraft, or even just explaining how characters are casting and utilizing spells in an interesting/creative/rational way please pass them on 😬.

*** I think more accurately, Harry should have started out by pitying Hermione following the Troll in the Bathroom scene. He'd invite her to join him and Ron because he feels bad for her. And then the way the friendship develops could go in one of either three ways. Perhaps somewhere along the way, they find something that makes the friendship click. Or another way is that they ease into a friendship, especially as she tries to tone her bossiness down over time. Or a third way could be that Ron and Harry find out about Flamel, and while they're discussing it, Hermione overhears. Then she might want to repay them or prove herself or something, and this gets her dragged into their adventures, which makes her end up as a friend.

The problem is that I Love cannon Harry Potter series because Rowling wrote it in such a way as to be entertaining, engrossing, and reread able. To make any changes to how Harry would act in cannon would probably harm the whole series.

** The biggest change I would make is that Harry,s feats of powerful magic would not peak at the end of Third year. After the Patronus that drives off over a hundred dementors at the end of third years harry's never does any magic that even comes close to surpassing it.

Edit: also no Prophecy or at least change the wording harry was in no way Voldemort equal which is what leads a lot of fans to become angry at harry for not living up to the Hype.

** I think that the very presence of fan fiction is testament to readers displeasure with aspects of the books. However, as much as I would love to have characters and plot points that are different, I am deeply grateful for the books as they are. I grew up with the Harry Potter books, and they were exactly what I needed as I aged. For that, I love them completely as they are. As an adult, I would have written the books to have more moral grey areas. Life is not black and white, and that is something I explore in every fan fiction I write. I personally like Harry just the way he is. He doesn't follow a standard. He isn't the smartest, the most dedicated, the strongest, or the most emotionally stable character, but that makes him human. He acts as a teenager would- angsty, lost, distrustful, reluctant, and dramatic. There a good many points in the books where I wanted to scream at him and say, "what are you doing?!" but then I remember that my mother wanted to scream that same sentence at me many times during my childhood, and I didn't have an insane Dark Lord after my head. My biggest issue, is the epilogue. (Don't get me started on Cursed Child- I refuse to accept is as a "Harry Potter book".) No offense to any children who may have been named Albus Severus after the release of Deathly Hallows, but the name is cringe-worthy. I understand James and Lily- honoring dead parents. But there is no need for Albus Severus- it's a baby name that is a pleasant thought, but one you move on from to more normal names. Also, I was never a fan of Harry's relationship with Ginny because: first, the jealously stunt she pulled in their sixth year, and second, it is way too Freudian. Ginny already has an obsession with him from her childhood, and that never sat right with me, but I can live with it after he saved her from the Chamber. However, Harry is told that Ginny looks like a mini-Lily, and he doesn't find it the least bit odd that he's attracted to the person everyone says looks like his mother. Overall, I love Harry and the books just the way they are. If I were to change Harry to this ideal character in my mind, he would cease to be Harry Potter and all of the magnificence that holds.

It was Hermione's idea that Ginny should take other boyfriends to raise her own status and make Harry jealous. Hermione later put her own advice into practice by inviting McClaggen to Slughorn's party.

*** I have problems with the epilogue as well but for different reasons. The Albus Severus namesake is more along the lines of why would Harry or Ginny want to name their kid after a man that hated their father. Sure he died at the hands of the dark lord while being undercover and helped Harry many times but I don't believe that could have endeared them to his memory that much after all the open hostility the man showed Harry.

And the Ginny/Harry relationship isn't clicking. I'm not saying they could never marry but the epilogue felt like too much of a quick tying up ends on kids and marriage. I would've liked to know how we got there.

** Yes, Harry would probably be a mix of Tom Riddle (New Harry 2.0 wants power in order to protect himself and others and to hurt those that hurt him), Hermione (Harry 2.0 loves to learn, especially magic because that does literally increase his power!) and probably myself (So new Harry 2.0 is curious as hell, asks tons of questions and has a sense of wounder! He also ignores rules he thinks are stupid (curfew for example!))

I really hate that canon Harry is so lazy...how can you be this way when you have somebody trying to kill you and when the adults have shown they CAN'T HANDLE THAT GUY? (The adults in HP buggered up the last war, especially Dumbledore with his preaching about forgiving the DEs and taking them alive and they didn't even lock all of them up after baby-Harry ended that war for them!)
