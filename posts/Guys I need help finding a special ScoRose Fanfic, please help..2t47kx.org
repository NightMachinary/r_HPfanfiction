I am searching for a wonderful fanfic I read awhile back... It is ScoRose as stated in the intro and is novel length. The main plot is that they go from enemies-to-lovers as usual, but with a twist. There is some kind of magical object..I think it was a necklace or a ring that Rose found in the burnt down RoR and put on, wich she later on finds out is a Malfoy Heirloom and it has made her like Scorpius. It is a smutfic, but not PwoP.
