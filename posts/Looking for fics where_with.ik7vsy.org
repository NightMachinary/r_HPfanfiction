1) Luna's mother is alive\\
2) Frank and/or Alice Longbottom escaped Bellatrix aNd are mentally sound

3) Bill/Hermione, not a Marriage Law fic

Not all in the same story, of course


** I don't really have many novel suggestions for these (as in stories you likely haven't seen before), but some Robst stories have 1 and 2. Let me know if you want to know which ones.

For 1, there's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] by Rorschach's Blot

For 2, I have one or two suggestions if you expand it to "have the parents healed from the mental damage": Sinyk's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons]["Harry Potter and the Daft Morons"]] and his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep]["Harry Potter - Three to Backstep"]] have this as major plotpoints. Sadly I don't know of story where they either escape or recover and then play a major role other than as Neville sometimes interacts with his parents.

However, for 3, it's pretty easy to go find some yourself :) , since most stories tag relationships. So you can order by favorites/kudos, maybe filter by complete, and find some totally new stories not suggested here on this reddit.

- On ffn you can filter stories with bill and hermione as characters, sadly pairings aren't always marked as such: [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/?search%5Bauthor%5D=&search%5Bchapters_lower%5D=&search%5Bchapters_upper%5D=&search%5Bcharacter_required%5D%5B%5D=756&search%5Bcharacter_required%5D%5B%5D=3&search%5Bfandoms%5D%5B%5D=224&search%5Bfavorites_lower%5D=&search%5Bfavorites_upper%5D=&search%5Blanguage%5D=english&search%5Border_by%5D=desc&search%5Bpublished_after%5D=&search%5Bpublished_before%5D=&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=k&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=kplus&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=t&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=m&search%5Bsort_by%5D=meta.favs&search%5Bstatus%5D=complete&search%5Bsummary%5D=&search%5Btitle%5D=&search%5Bupdated_after%5D=&search%5Bupdated_before%5D=&search%5Bwordcount_lower%5D=&search%5Bwordcount_upper%5D=][Here's a template]] search you can use on Scryer, which is really nice for ffn searching.
- On AO3 you can even easily actually filter the relationship, since relationships are much more consistently tagged: [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger*s*Bill%20Weasley/works][here's a template]]

*** For 3:

Here's a story you might not see if you don't have an AO3 account:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4303557/chapters/9753669]] : I Am Strong by floatsdelicately. 6200 words. The description: "Ron leaves his home, his family and his fianc√©, what will happen when he comes back 10 years later? What could have changed?"
- Here's a story that previous one inspired: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14172021/chapters/32666532]] . Still Strong by DietCokeofEvil. 38k words "Ron left a month before the wedding. How does Hermione put the pieces of her life back together?"

Both stories are complete, but I've only skimmed the first one which was interesting.
