** I find it hilarious and awesome - the level of depth, nuance and complexity in the plot is quite incredible - but I don't relate to any of the characters (even though a lot of them are quite realistic) and didn't get terribly emotionally invested in it (the recent big development didn't draw that strong of a reaction from me). That depth doesn't transfer to all areas of story telling though. The author is a bit overly dramatic at times and has annoying phrases like "he gazed abstractly."

Harry is totally unrealistic as a character, but I think that has a good reason that will eventually be revealed. He has some flaws that might not seem like flaws because they resemble traits that poor author avatars/Mary Sues have, but is subverted when those actions have actual consequences (see Harry's first interaction with Snape, where he "wins). Hermione and Draco both seem to be realistic, possibly a little stretched in Hermione's case. McGonagall is probably the most frustrating character in how lame the author makes her.

As for soapboxing, yea. He does it. But not all the time. I can't remember exactly where, but there was one conversation between Harry and Dumbledore that had half the fans agreeing with Dumbledore and half agreeing with Harry. (the number that seems to be coming to mind is chapter 77?)

The Stanford Prison Experiment plot line was annoying because there is pretty much no reason for Harry to do such an insanely risky thing. He doesn't even know /why/ Quirrell wants to do it. Harry's risk seeking personality makes him incredibly unrelatable to me.

I wish he had written in an original world rather than abusing the HP verse so much. I think the story would be much more suitable if the characters were at /least/ 16 years old.

That said, the plot is magnificent (other than TSPE).

** I found it intensely boring, clinical, and unbelievable from the get go. It feels very much as if the author hasn't ever work with children or has any experiences with gifted children/people.

However, what irks me most is that the characters are so bland in a sort of intelligence > personality way, and are used as mouth pieces for the author, mixed into that those who don't display a certain type of intelligence or ambition are written as lesser beings.

My main issue was that it went on for a LONG time, without resolving anything. I loved the experiments, and the analysis of the supremely weird Potterverse.

I don't remember my specific objections, although I wrote some other reddit comment a while back, but it was basically "here is a list of over a dozen mysteries and plot points that haven't been resolved, yet still more are being introduced and it's not even Christmas yet!"

** I enjoyed it - yes the focus is split between story and ideology in a way. But that's because here ideological motivations are the primary driving force behind all the major characters - which is frankly a fresh take on a fandom where the poorly described hormonal reactions and a rather stale conflict was the established norm for character development.

The strength of the story is how cathartic it is for people like myself - I despise poorly developed magic/rule systems and this aspect of HP world has always annoyed me even as others drew me in. HPMOR does a grand job of poking fun at trying to live in a world that makes no sense in its first chapters.

It also helps that there are a lot of shout-outs and fandom inserts from other popular fantasy and sci-fi works which warm the heart of geeks like me. For people who haven't spent 20 years reading those genres, a lot of that is going to fall flat.

The ages used are a major problem - perhaps it's just that I personally don't know any child prodigies. Than again - Hermione was believable to me. She is much more advanced compared to canon, but the story got there naturally for her character based on the fact that other main characters provided a stimulating environment for her. Draco and Harry are entirely OC but if I can believe that a 12 year old Herminone can behave/think/talk like that if she was properly challenged, than I can believe in 2 more genius kids. My biggest problem is the amount of books Harry supposedly read and the sciences he studied by 11. The author screwed up in this respect - it would have been more believable if all of this learning was still going on rather than being established at the beginning.

Frankly, the biggest problem for me is the soapbox against bullying that overshadowed Terry Goodkind in its anvil dropping. It quickly made me want to cheer on the "bullies", just because of how the author pushed his spiel on the topic. That and the author has clearly made them the underdog.

The sad part is that the author has split himself up so much and lost steam on the story. For me, the magic of that story has withered and died. I remember I once seriously considered doing cartwheels at news of an update. Now... "meh, a few crumbs don't make a meal".

EDIT: Crap I was wrong - I am still seriously obsessed with this story. I just read a few paragraphs of the chapter 87 and am already in that obsessive zone...

I think it's the immersion factor for people. I mean I read a scene from this story like this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione," Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into the red-velvet pouch again, "don't punish yourself when a bright idea doesn't work out. You've got to go through a lot of flawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you send your brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by your brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won't think of any ideas at all." Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside the book. "Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one from earlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating a good candidate strategy."
#+end_quote

And to me that's hilarious. To another person, that might be just a flat joke - similar to petting someone on the head to lightly make fun of them. But to me - I know that this particular Harry actually does think like that. He is not joking when giving her the chocolate. And when I imagine all the potential hilarity of a boy who actually thinks like that trying to go through puberty and relate to a girl - that "potential" is just as hilarious to me as the ridiculous but entirely pragmatic scene that generated these thoughts.

For me, that's what makes this story great.

**** About for gifted kids - Harry is not set up as simply "gifted" in this story. I view Harry in this story as someone from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_child_prodigies][the prodigy list]]. HPMOR made me look that up somewhere around the 30th chapter. This fictional too-adult Harry Potter, wouldn't actually stand out on that list of real people like Gabriel See. That helped me get over my misgivings about these kids being too-adult. If HP in this story is a prodigy by the standards of our world, which I know is actually possible as there have been many kids like him, than it would make sense that gifted kids who have to interact with a prodigy would profit from constantly engaging with him. Because kids do that. So the characters don't come off as too adult for me, giving the premise of the story (being centred around a prodigy)

about the edit: In this particular situation he does not come off as patronizing. Anyone else probably would, but he clearly explains the basis for his advice. It rather left me with an impression that if he was the one to first jump on that theory, he too would have given himself a chocolate.

As for Hermione's reaction - she actually handled it with greater maturity. It is one thing if there was an obvious hole in his reasoning (perhaps there is, but I haven't seen it so to me it is reasonable). Since I, as the reader can't find the fault in his reasoning, it becomes acceptable to me that Hermione can't do so on the spot. Questioning just to contradict is just plain petty. Unless you see a very obvious error in what Harry has said. Avoiding him - that would be even worse. First it would be cowardly - she can't "measure up" at this point in time so she should run away? Second, it would hurt his feelings, and it would be rather selfish of her to do that just so she can deal with her supposed inferiority complex better.

***** Yeah, having worked with 'prodigy' and more often gifted children. They don't act like adults, they act like very smart kids, and this is usually because they are gifted in a particular field. They often have very little social skills (cant understand why someone would forget something or not understand something they find simple) and get angry and massively frustrated, and devote a lot of their time one subject, learning all of it and moving on.

They rarely plan what they learn, and are primarily motivated by whimsy and obsession. But again, socially and emotionally, very underdeveloped. I would suggest that being isolated is part of this. However, Harry isnt like this at all, he's an adult in a child's body and its very frustrating to read.

** It's been ages since I followed this story, but my memory matches the OP's take on things. It's basically an /Atlas Shrugged/-esque pill for delivering the author's philosophical drug of choice, and while the writing is not bad (he can string together grammatically correct sentences and his humor /is/ occasionally delivered well), it's also not particularly good, with inconsistent characterization and tone as well as a sense of disdain for HP canon, often appearing to treat the source material as if it were beneath him. Granted, it's fanfiction, so I don't exactly expect Hemingway, though one might wish that the purportedly most popular fanfiction story in the fandom were put together a bit better.

To be honest, much of my dislike for MOR stems from the distasteful antics of the author, whose checkered past includes several bouts of trolling fanfiction discussion sites, review whoring and hostage taking, a thin skin with respect to criticism (witness the various wiki wars in which he's participated), and a thousand and one different schemes to try to make a pile of money off what will always remain a derivative work. Even if the story were without flaw, I doubt I would be able to enjoy it because my feelings for the author would bleed through. I have the same problem reading Bret Easton Ellis.

He stated that HPMOR is for adults, while JKR wrote children's books and writing for children is more difficult. He never threatened to stop releasing chapters.

**** I found many parts of it to be quite funny. For example the behavior of Harry as a General, and certain descriptions of situations or reactions. A lot of them made me laugh because I thought they were written in an interesting and strange way.

I like the idea of a hyper intellegent Harry, and I identify with a lot of the feelings the character has of not being able to fit in because of being more intellegent than my peers as a child. I think that in HPMOR Harry was made too unrealistically gifted, but I enjoyed it in the early chapters, before I got tired of it.

I love the idea of a Battle Magic class and am very interested in what becomes of Quirrel's character (I've only read up to the part with the Azkaban business, maybe a bit after). I want to know what's going on with him. I really liked reading about the characters and their battles, although the schemes I think we're a bit too complex for first years. But I think it's an awesome concept. Battle Magic. I just sounds so... metal. :)

Also, I think that the author describes scenes and people in an interesting and compelling way. I really liked all of the parts that didn't directly involve Harry doing things that I thought were silly or not reasonable or just plain boring to me (his transfiguration breakthroughs, the entire Azkaban plot line, the patronus...). I found most other parts to be pretty enjoyable. I guess if it was just about an exceptionally smart Harry experiencing the absurdity of the wizarding world and trying to rationalize it with science, while strutting about the school all strange and quirky and trying to change Draco and doing Battle Magic, I'd have no complaints.

Not a single plot point was resolved in 83 chapters and considering the author intends to finish the whole series in one work, I dunno man.

As to the unrealisticness, that's not a huge issue. I mean I'm reading a story where Harry has five wives at the tender age of 16. That's damn ridiculous, and I know it. However it's amusing and engaging so it trumps clinical writing any day, you know?

**** As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing to come from HPMOR was this following quote. "You're giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEPING DISORDER!"

** Hm, I quite like HPMOR. It's not by any means as good as the original Harry Potter, but I still find it fun. I can certainly sympathize with people finding the preachier bits annoying though. I didn't know too much cognitive psychology going in so I found the "lessons" interesting sometimes, but I can see why they'd be a pain if you weren't interested or just wanted to get on with the story already. There was only one part that really ground on me (the part in which Harry argued with Dumbledore about the exitence of the soul), but I can sort of justify to myself why this would be of plot relevance in a story about Horcruxes.

I think the main thing I enjoy about the story is the way the author sets up "impossible" challenges for his characters and then resolves them without resorting to Deus Ex Machina tactics. I find the main character fairly deep and sympathetic (at least after about chapter 10 or so, when he begins to become aware of how obnoxious he's been and starts trying to change himself); he is obviously not, however, a realistic psychological exploration of an eleven-year-old mind.

One thing I don't like about the story is how the author tends to change canon at random (e.g., putting Lucius Malfoy on the Wizengamot instead of on the Board of Governors, inventing new spells and having them used very frequently) and his tendency to mix in elements from Dungeons and Dragons (which is a much sillier world than Harry Potter, not a more rational one).

The complaints about pacing are not wholly wrong. The bully-fighting arc in particular is a bit pointless and unnecessary (I think the author himself has admitted this) but since then the pace has picked up again and the story does seem finally to be heading towards a conclusion.

** I found it to be an egotistical use of the Potterverse to attempt to show how immaturely clever the author was.

*** Granted, he is objectively intelligent as long as he does know about all these things that he's writing about, and not just like... copying off a wiki page of whatever.

** I think that the author of HPMOR has failed to recognize that he has failed to make an engrossing plot in his work.

The appeal of HPMOR is its humor and its philosophy. I think that the author could have made HPMOR with an engrossing plot, but he would have had to give up most of the humor (he's not good enough for all 3, and he wouldn't give up the philosophy).

** To be completely honest, before I joined this subreddit a few days ago I had never even heard of the story.
