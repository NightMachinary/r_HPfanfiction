And what's the fic that will convince me of it's awesomeness?

Expand my horizons! Novel or Novella length, well written completed fics will make my day

(My favorite cliche is Hermione travelling back through time and having adventure and romance with a Maurader. Not picky about which Maurader. Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie is a favorite: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time]]

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** Deconstructions, and stories that have deconstruction in the background but are more serious. Like in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), there's some explicit deconstruction, and that's fun. In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), the deconstruction is woven throughout, and when it sort of vanishes into the background, it's great.

Time travel with significant changes. What's the point in time travel if you're going to visit all the stations of canon? Even if you've accidentally twenty years ago. Even if there are prohibitions against changing the past. I can't see myself not trying.

** I love time travel, but well-written time travel is rare. I'm also fond of (good) fix fics, which are often time travel anyway.

Aside from that I actually like Lordship fics, just that a lot of them are rather poorly written. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) is a very good one, although it doesn't involve Harry himself doing Lordship-related things.

** I think my favourite trope is time travel, but when character actually manages to change the timeline, that includes Hermione back in time, but I'm not fond of fics that focus too much on romance. My second favourite is Harry in Slytherin, bonus is if he befriends Draco, no slash. I like also dimensional travel, but it's pretty similar to time travel I guess. I also quite like girlHarry fics, but there are not many good of those. Few more are: Sirius raises Harry, anything that involves Regulus, or Noble and Most Ancient House of Black ;) For Hermione time travel I would recommend One Hundred and Sixty Nine, it's really popular linkffn(8581093), and Silver, this one is not so famous but I really enjoy it linkffn(10515765) ; for time travel+dimensional traveling Harry see A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story linkffn(6671596) ; for girlHarry traveling time and dimensions see Potter vs Paradox linkffn(11488906) ; for time travelng Draco I would strongly recommend Hogwarts: Marauding the Timeline linkffn(11377120) ; for Harry in Slytherin see Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) and Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection series linkffn(8666085). Fair fortune is promising but it's only 7 chapters for now (it's also Hermione back in time) linkffn(11376508).

*** I get so annoyed about time travel when the timeline doesn't change.

It's forgivable if they're trying to change the timeline, but everything happened because of the time travel or in spite of it. But I vastly prefer when the time traveler stays and we see the "present" with Harry and his giant happy loving family who weren't all killed by Voldie.

I love 169, but haven't read the others, thanks!

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Hmm ... well, my favourite trope would probably be Harry (or any other male main character I happen to like, really) getting gender-swapped (or whatever you'd call it).

That said, I will not post any links to stories that could potentially convince you that it's a great plot device, because when it boils down to it there's nothing oh-so-great about it and it's just a matter of personal preference: for one, it's a big change that can force Harry---who is very much a reactive character---to act without making him completely out-of-character, and for two it's simply easier for me to identify with female characters.

Also, there's not a lot of stuff with that scenario that are even readable, let alone great, so that's that as far as recommendations go. I could try to find ... something, if you really want it, but honestly I stand by my stance that this is something that's about personal preference rather than for everyone.

**** That is actually a fairly good question. It took me some time to think up what the possible answers could be, because though I do very much like this trope I am well aware that there is a dearth of even decent stories centred on it---in at least a part because so many stories seemingly centred on it really are centred on some pairing and the trope is only in effect because the author wants the pairing to be either hetero- or homosexual and that's basically it---and as such I devoured things that were decent and maybe good but not great just because they had this trope in them and I was aware that to look for great stories with it would probably be a waste of time.

Then there is also the issue with incomplete fics: while I do not hold anything against stories just because they are not yet complete, it is one thing to like a story and another to call it a “favourite” before we know where exactly it will go and how that journey will look; case in point, at one point of time I rather liked “A Switched Chance”, and then it went ... somewhere, and I kind of stopped caring about it. In a similar vein, quite a few fics that I could nominate to being favourites happen to be abandoned, which on one hand means that they are to be taken as-is because they will not go in any weird direction, but on the other hand there's the issue of them just stopping at some point and leaving you wanting more when there's no more to be had. And finally, do crossovers of any sort actually count or are they automatically out?

Case in point, I very much enjoyed “Monster Lord” by Lord Mendasuit; it's most likely abandoned and dead and it's a crossover of some kind. Likewise for Araceil's “Way of the Warrior” series, also a crossover and also most likely abandoned and dead. “A Long Journey Home” by Rakeesh is neither a crossover nor dead, but it's being updated quite slowly and it's being updated at all which means that I might or might not find it as enjoyable in the future as it is now, and to add to that it is highly AU which I did like but you may not. The Mad Mad Reviewer's “Jamie Evans and the Fate's Bitch/Fool” (had a name change because it once got deleted for inappropriate words in the title) is by no means perfect but it is both finished and AU enough that whatever ...weird things are in it can be chalked up to that, and it is at least a decent story and maybe even a good one. silencia20's various fics contain a female Harry and I find them enjoyable overall, but they are crossovers that actually put Harry on the other side of whatever it is being crossed with so you may or may not want to count the character as actually being Harry, and to add to that I find most of that stuff enjoyable because it is in some way silly so that might or might not make it count as “guilty pleasures”. Darklooshkin has a short story of a metamorphmagus Harry that goes that way in the 18th chapter of his “The random craziness file”, but it does add some random shite and it's an overall short story so even if you like it it may not ... sate you, yes. And then there's the one [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]] linked already, but that one is highly AU in itself with a lot of original characters which some people simply don't like.

Honestly, I'll say if you are up to experimenting you may want to try some of those. Probably none of them are /great/ (you can argue about the one [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]] posted, but I'll just say I see it as good and maybe or maybe not better and leave it at that), but all are at least /decent/ (meaning: it's not the usual crap that 90+% of stories are) and some even are /good/ (meaning: they actually can hold on their own power even if you are not reading just because they happen to have an element you want to read about and don't have anything better)

** I have a few I love, so it is hard to just pick one. A current one that I am looking for is CC-compliant stuff that is albus/scorpius. The only one I have read and liked so far are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. But I wish they were more graphic in ANY of the relationships (H/G or A/S) and although I love the family dynamic in those fics, I would love to read a more "us against the world" albus/scorpius.

Another troupe I love (but is done poorly a lot) are non-permenant forced bonding fics (like a potions accident gone wrong where you cant go more than a few feet away from each other, or an accidental magical marriage) where at first the characters hate each other but then are secretly sad when it is over. There are tons of great Drarry fics with this troupe, but recently I read a hermione/snape fic that I loved with this too called [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose by Abby]].

** Fics that explore Ginny and Luna's friendship are my favorites, well, mostly because I like Luna, and I do not like shipping fics.

On that note, the best Ginny-Luna platonic friendship story was /Faith and Understanding/ but it has been taken down. For reasons I do not know.

To summarize:

Ginny and Luna meet on the Hogwarts Express. Luna's reading The Quibbler and mentions that above all else, she values honesty. They study together and sit next to each other in class. Ginny sticks up for Luna when she's bullied. Luna spends time at the Burrow one summer. The girls learn and laugh and argue and drive each other crazy. Ginny actually coins the term "Loony" but turns it around and uses it as an affectionate nickname.

And the tone...it just worked. Ginny and Luna train for Dumbledore's Army together in one scene, with Ginny admiring Luna's Patronus, and then in the next scene, they sprawl barefoot in the grass to watch the clouds.

Sadly, it is no more.

To mention a fic that is still intact, /A Night Without Stars/ is fairly solid.

There's also /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ This is the Holy Grail of Luna fanfics. You wanted novel-length, right? Luna's point-of-view of Order of the Phoenix. Considering it was written before Half-Blood Prince was even published, it holds up very well. While it's Luna-centric, her friendship with Ginny is an important sub-plot, the idea of friendship itself is foreign to Luna.

Edit: Oh, I remember now. It's too out there for my tastes. Not saying it isn't well-written though. I have read a fair bit of it.

**** It was certainly well-written, and "bittersweet" is an appropriate adjective.

I'm not sure whether or not I liked it though--I'm a sucker for reconciliation, though I did enjoy Rolf Scamander's general bewilderment to who Harry Potter was.

I'm not much for slash-fics, in general. With regards to Luna, I actually have a hard time seeing her as anything other than the little, inquisitive Ravenclaw we meet in the book, so I almost never read any Romance fic, slash or otherwise, with Luna in it.

** I am soulbond and Veela Draco trash unfortunately. Also a huge fan of /well-written/ creature fics, which are rare beasts indeed.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can provide a good fic example of veela-souldbond Draco, since it's sparsely written in recent years and most are poorly written or poorly beta'd. I realize most are garbage, but they're guilty pleasure garbage in my case.

As for creature fics, linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate) is a favorite. It's well written for the most part, of a decent length, a partial Avengers crossover in later sections, doesn't include romance for 40+ chapters in any important fashion, and has some of my favorite OC/side-cast of any fic I've read to date. It's probably riddled with other cliches I've overlooked as well, but eh. Another case of a guilty pleasure fic I suppose!

I think linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB) might also count as a creature fic? Be warned; most tend to agree its a pretty damn sad fic. Some slightly less depressing endings can be found in a WIP fic on the author's page.

** I like Ron bashing(but am also perfectly fine with stories where he is a great/ok friend). I enjoy manipulative Dumbledore, because honestly you have three ways of looking at it:\\
1. It was a childrens book at the start so ignore it\\
2. Dumbledore made a ton of weird mistakes\\
3. Dumbledore is manipulative\\
I am fine with different levels of manipulative Ex: egineering him to be abused/raised badly by the Dursleys to just making the ps chambers a test.

I am fond of Luna having a magical ability, like being a seer, can tell emotions, or some other thing.

I enjoy Harry befriending Draco (but not Drarry) and then possibly convincing him Muggles aren't entirely terrible ( I still can't see him enjoying it too much tho).

I also enjoy Harry being sorted into Slytherin/Ravenclaw.\\
I also enjoy political Harry stories, doesn't have to be where he goes into the wizengamot, but might just be making friends with the heirs/heiress's of different Houses.
