** Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) has something like that. Jamie (Harry turned fem!Harry via being reborn in an alt dimension) goes up against a Grindelwald/Dumbledore hybrid and the two battle it out with tanks, created monsters, and war machines. There's a godzilla too.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** The final battle of linkffn(Return of the Marauders) is something like the Battle of Helms Deep, with Voldemort's hordes of Inferi charging the defenders, before going Battle of the Pelinor Fields with the reinforcements.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
