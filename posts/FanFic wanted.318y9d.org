Hi all i am looking for some good post war fanfics, but before the epilogue. Something showing what happend to harry and the rest just after the war leading up to the 19 years later


** Read anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. They both have a bunch of canon stories that are excellent.

*** Those are both excellent, though I can't read little0bird's stuff twice. The angst is just too much, and she has /horrible/ antagonists in the later stories.

**** Haha, I don't care for the second gen stuff. But the early stuff is good, especially "The First Day". There is a lot of angst, though, I agree.

***** It was the story about Albus' birth. (I can't remember the name of it exactly and I'm too lazy to go look.) But basically Harry got all worked up over some person he'd failed to catch, caused some super unnecessary drama, and everyone else made a big deal over this person too, and then it turned out to be...Rita Skeeter. It was a great drama/mystery, and otherwise well written but the ending made the rest of the story feel absolutely stupid.

** I don't usually peg my own stuff, but I haven't read a lot of epilogue compliant stuff. This is my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7605733/1/Spectra-of-Grey][Spectra of Grey]]. It's a non-romantic interaction between Harry and Draco. Not my best work, but I saw you weren't getting many suggestions.
