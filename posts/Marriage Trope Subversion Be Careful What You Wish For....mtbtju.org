Unfortunately, Harry is betrothed to Daphne Greengrass: there's no way around it, no loophole to exploit, and no way of escaping it. It's as ironclad as Malfoy's hair-style in rain.

The Greengrasses were ecstatic, as is Daphne, who full-heartedly agreed with the plan: the wealth and prestige for their family for marrying Harry Potter would be immense. She'd be wealthy, have influence, an amazing husband, and have a horde of kids.

The wedding is a grand affair, mostly paid by the bride's family -- but as soon as the church begins filling, people quickly realize something is up: out of all the guests turning up, 90% of them are invitees of the Greengrasses/the bride's family. Harry is apathetic and uncaring, his responses flat. He's noncommittal with responses, and looks genuinely bored and uninterested.

Aside from a few of Harry's close friends to support him, he asked no-one else turn up. His literal response was "just go out and drink a few bottles of firewhiskey at the Burrow, or something".

He and Daphne tie the knot. It's a surprisingly lackluster affair, at the altar.

The wedding night she'd been looking forward to, on their honeymoon? Literally a five minute encounter ("pump and dump") just to satisfy the contract's requirements -- the potion she took for fertility? Counteracted by the one he took to prevent unwanted pregnancies, so it was a 50/50 shot of their having kids. He rolled over and went to sleep after, or maybe went down into the muggle casino to blow his ("their") money.

Mercifully, fortune favoured on Harry, and Daphne was left disappointed and not-knocked up.

Daphne believed there would be time to try again, more encounters since they're, you know, husband and wife.

There weren't any.

Harry spurned her advances in bed, no matter what she tried, and life pretty much returned to normal for him (bar being married).

Her mother insisted that time will wear him down, and that'd he'd accept it eventually: the stipulations of the marriage prevented infidelity on both sides, after all.

Yeah, no. Years pass, and it became apparent that Harry's dislike of her was only increasing, not waning.

He didn't show to the fancy parties her parents threw, even as a "guest of honour", leaving them humiliated. He went off and does his own thing all the time, such as spending holidays at the Burrow or having the weekly Sunday dinners with the Weasleys. Every time she tagged along, she was met with either dismissal to passive hostility from everyone there. Harry paid no mind to when she left early, not even noticing that she'd gone half the time. Harry shows up to functions alone or, when she's invited too, spends not a moment of time with her.

There were even rumours he's having an ongoing an emotional affair with a female friend of his!

Despite her attempts at being a "good wife", she's ignored. Iced out.

To say this was backfiring on her and her family is an understatement. People were talking. The power, wealth, reputation, and influence they were hoping to gain from this union? It's actually being detrimental to them.

The breaking point was their fifth wedding anniversary: she prepared a lovely candle-lit dinner, wore some lingerie she thought he'd find attractive, and generally dolled herself up, waiting for him to come home at the usual time.

He arrives home hours later than he normally did, took one dismissive look at her still sitting in place, and then went in the bath.

It finally dawned on her that her husband actually hated her. His feelings towards her weren't fading or waning but actually growing or were cemented in place.

She would never be a wife in his eyes. She would never be a mother to a small horde of green-eyed, blonde-haired children. She'd never have the respect that people would view her with as being "Mrs Potter". His friends and family looked on her as nothing but a parasite.

Now, what was she to do?


** I remember a one shot that begins with a Potter-Greengrass proposal, to which Harry says: "Ok, but after we marry she'll live alone in an island for the rest of her life"

The Greengrasses backed off rather quickly.

I find your idea to be better, though I find it only works as a one shot.

** This kinda feels...mean. Other than subverting the trope, nothing is really going to happen in the story itself unless Harry 'breaks' in some way at some point. It could work as a oneshot for Marriage Contract! readers who are sick of the trope and want a good laugh, but nothing longer form, I don't think. At least, I can't think of a longer form story for this without making Harry completely unsympathetic.

Personally, I see no problem in Daphne giving up on Harry a year in and going on to fulfil every other thing the marriage promised her (prestige, reputation, etc.) and making a fabulous life for herself as a socialite. You would be surprised how what has been described in the prompt is the general life and lifestyles of many a married couple.

As for a lack of kids, she could adopt a muggleborn or even a muggle orphan. It could be one of her tricks to get Harry's attention, but when even that backfires (which I find hard to imagine, Harry may hate her, but the child has done nothing wrong), the child could be a melting point, or just a 'pet project' to keep Daphne busy through the years. *shrug*

Or she could get a dog or cat. And icing on the cake is that Harry shows more love and affection to the pet than he ever shows her. This was actually a legit plot point in a Korean drama I recently finished watching that included an elderly married couple (Drama was Love ft. (Marriage and Divorce) on Netflix, in case anyone's curious).

*** I agree. If Harry never breaks, there's no story at all. It's just a pointless bashing fic. It's not even using bashing as some sort of commentary on how you disagree with something in the books, because Daphne literally does not exist beyond a name. We don't know what she looks like, we don't how what she thought about things, we don't know if she loved muggles or was a genderswapped Draco, or any of the million things between those two extremes.

You're not even saying, "hey, look at how awful Molly was to Sirius in canon, isn't it terrible, this is how I think that would have more realistically gone." It's just a sockpuppet. You're punching a straw man fabricated by the fanfiction community. Daphne Greengrass isn't even real.

Regarding your question at the end of the prompt: If I were Daphne, from now on I would only take care of myself, I wouldn't care about Harry anymore. If possible: divorce. Otherwise looking for a lover. And if that doesn't work either (because of magic or something), kill Harry and hopefully do it wisely so that I don't get arrested. And then piss on his grave.

** A funny twist would be coupling this with the "Harry can only die by Voldemort's hand" idea and have an endless Groundhog's Day like stream of Harry trying to die in new and inventive ways weekly to get out of the marriage, but since he can only die by Voldemort's hand, he just gets hurt and healed and is almost always in St Mungo's. Daphne is a doting wife being there everytime he wakes up after an attempt telling him that it won't work and to accept it. He never does, remaining apathetic to her and vowing to try something else again.

** Considering the way Daphne is portrayed in most of the fanfics, she would be a infamous ice princess facing a icy husband. Solution: be even more icy! She wouldn't spend most of her life being a socialite either, she would actually do her own thing as well.

Also both parties are intelligent enough to check the contract and spot out even the tiniest loophole - and highly competitive.

Eg. After the fail first night, Daphne immediately calls up Tracey Davis to her house and starts tongue kissing to show her husband how to be a good lover. Not to be deterred, Harry guilts Ron into being his arm candy, kissing him as well.

After that, they continue escalating until one of them gives up.

** I remember reading something similar to this in a fanfic. The Greengrass family found a contract for Harry after the war. I remember Harry threatening to force Daphne to live alone and maybe 1 house elf and show up just to check on the house elf. He mentioned Daphne would be Lady Potter in name only. Daphne wouldn't even have access to the floo. I remember Harry threatening to paint her and her family in a bad picture and his friends would know the truth. Might have threatened to use his new connections to spread the news.

I think they mentioned using the multiple lordship trope to make Ginny or who ever was the main love interest Lady Black. Harry would take her to any social gatherings and the like. I just wish I could remember the fanfiction as it was a one shot I read years ago.

** The real question is why she has gone for this. Maybe it wasn't for the fame, if marriage contracts exist then there's a possibility she's on board for marrying Harry because she knows he won't hurt her and he's around her age.

I can see that having an appeal if your parents are going to sell you off anyway. He's not stopping her from doing things she enjoys. He just doesn't want to be with her.

Personally I'd have her as liking that and working on her own projects. Maybe just dedicating herself to something she enjoys and throwing herself fully into it knowing Harry won't stop her. Maybe she starts breeding Pegasi or competing in competitions with them.

For her the marriage became about safety and freedom, even if she's trapped in a loveless marriage she can still follow her passions (which etiquette may have dictated she stop when married but Harry doesn't care what his wife does)

**** Because it's rare for someone to be a completely terrible human being. Plus with the era the wizarding world is set in I absolutely think entailment would be common, so marrying well is important for women, not just in terms of wealth but in terms of finding someone to look after you and not just see you as a brood mare.

So personally I can see her going along with it because she's been raised to marry someone after all and Harry is safe. As for not working I just picture her needing to keep busy if Harry isn't going to love her to occupy herself. Not working but still working in a sense.

Everyone having different ideas is what makes the fanfic community fun!

***** I strongly disagree that women are an oppressed class in JKR's wizarding society. This is mostly because the wand is a great equaliser, a witch can cast lethal or wonderful spells just as any wizard can. In m headcanon, isolated purebloods who've never interacted with/ had extremely limited interaction with the muggle world wouldn't even know what sexism or misogyny are.

****** Well in this case in a world with marriage contracts I would argue strongly that it's very likely that women would be being sold off. Or 'the spare' is. In a world where something like that exists society puts a lot of focus on having children from the marriage to continue the line and therefore daughters to 'sell off.'

Ofc this is just my thoughts based on the prompt and the era that the series appears to be set in for the wizarding world. Securing the line does seem like something that would be important to the pureblood rhetoric so marrying your daughter to someone of importance/having pure enough blood would be seen as a win. Even if that means that they may end up in a terrible marriage.

I think it comes down to whether you think that the wand equalises that or not. I don't think it does so I would imagine Sexism is still alive and well.

******* But 'selling a daughter off' wouldn't secure your line after all. It would secure the line of whatever family she was married into... If the Greengrasses have only two daughters and no male cousins in the daughters' generation, then the Greengrass name will die off no matter whom their daughters marry.

Also, in your example, the young wizards and witches are equally 'sellable' on the market. It sounds like a lose-lose situation for all kids involved, regardless of gender.

Interesting, why do you think the wand is not an equaliser? I'm curious.

******** The name might not die off if they agree that the name will continue with a second/third child of a marriage. Or Daphne and her children keep her surname if the other family is 'lesser' and wants that prestige, or just agrees to that.

In general the trend globally is the same there in that daughters are less valued so I don't see why this would be any different in the wizarding world. If only due to influence from muggles I would see it being present, pre statute of secrecy the societies would have been mixed. The attitude could have been present from then and sensibilities set. Even if it's just because it's how it's always been done.

Honestly on the equalising? Because we've seen how easy it is to disarm someone. We've seen fists come into play too and that beating someone with a wand. If you rely on a tool so much you're useless or near useless without it then whoever has other tools at their disposal will win. So if we say whoever has the better reflexes wins then that would still usually be the man.

If you're both disarmed at the same time the person with more strength would likely win, that would also be the man.

********* I dunno, I don't agree that it's /that/ easy to disarm someone. /Expelliarmus/ was sort of established as Harry's pet favourite spell in canon. But, to me, any witch or wizard who feels even a hint of danger can apparate away in a second and be on the other side of the country even if he/she loses her wand in a bad situation, which adds another layer to things. But really, in my reading of canon, there was never even a hint of sexism in the wizarding world.

Perhaps in a marriage contract fanfiction world, an author can bring misogyny and sexism in because the author controls that world and can do as he/she pleases.

But in JKR's world, I find it hard to believe that magical society has those problems (they have other problems for sure). We've seen too many women in positions of power in JKR's world for it to be otherwise (Amelia Bones, Umbridge, Bagnold, Bellatrix, Tonks, and even in the Newt Scamander era, the President of MACUSA was a black woman and there was nothing surprising about a woman being an auror way back then either).

** It would be nice to see this prompt turn into a loveless, toxic marriage. Daphne is eventually shun off by her parents as well for bringing about shame to the family so she thinks that she gets Harry to love her and give her a baby, things will be back to normal. However the more she tries, the more Harry pushes back. Gradually the whole thing turns into an emotionally abusive relationship. Her parents giving her the cold shoulder, her school friends keeping a low profile for being associated with Death Eater activity, the society as a whole rejecting her because she came from the same house as Voldemort, the only person she can turn to is Astoria. But Astoria has baby Scorpius and she no longer has time for Daphne's troubles. Feeling alone and stuck in a loveless marriage she decides that the best she can set herself and Harry free is by drinking that glass of poison.

********* The fact that they "don't do much" implies they are among the most genuinely clever people in the broader plot. They avoided Dumbledore, they avoided Voldemort, their family survived two massive wars that purged their society. They were old and wealthy purebloods that never allowed themselves to get drawn into any of the bullshit that got everyone else kidnapped, raped, murdered, or branded. None of their family ever took the mark, their family wealth never funded the Death Eaters or their regime. No Greengrass wand was ever raised under the banner of the Order or beneath the Dark Mark. They dodged everything and came out into the postwar society intact, stable, with all of their children alive and unmarked, and without having made enemies for life out of anybody.

You can imply that was sheer dumb luck all you want, which is what you're doing when you call them a bunch of cowardly idiots, but the simpler and more reasonable explanation is that it was skill and subtlety.

If what */little/* we know of the Greengrasses is taken into consideration, which is that they avoided the conflict entirely and made it out unscathed two wars in a row, they're the pureblood equivalent of Switzerland, and invoking a marriage contract with Harry is essentially them admitting that he's the undisputed future of wizarding Britain and that they want in on the ground floor.

You can twist that into pretzels all you like, but don't just pull shit out of a fucking hat and declare it true. Your list is less possible because it's based on utter nonsense.

********** Skill and subtlety are vanishingly rare commodities, especially in Magical Britain. We have no reason to believe they were old and wealthy purebloods, that's another assumption. For all we know, they're clinging on to the edge of respectability and hoping to hell no one finds out that great grandmother Edna was a muggle. We don't even know they weren't marked, maybe they were and ran away as soon as the going got rough. We don't know all the children got away unscathed, for all we know there was an elder son who got on the wrong end of Bill Weasley's wand at the Battle of Hogwarts.

My list is pulled out of a hat but so is yours- the difference is, I know it. Why do you care so much? They're fictional, you think they were admirable on no more grounds than I suggest they're tossers and act like I'm defaming real people.

Someone suggested a forced marriage scenario, with only one side being forced - as far as I'm concerned that makes the side doing the forcing tossers.

  Except you have no evidence
#+end_quote

You've had the evidence explained to you several times, by several different people. You're just either too dense to understand or willfully blind to it. They survived two civil wars that tore their society apart without being forced to commit to either side. None of their children were marked. They avoided becoming Voldemort's enemies while giving him nothing of value and not getting drawn into Dumbledore's fight either. They have all of their wealth, all of their children, and all of their possessions intact at the end when Harry wins.

Everyone with any sense takes that to mean they must have some amount of skill at playing the political game. You're the only one here insisting that they just got lucky, over and over and over again, and somehow bumblefucked their way through it.

What evidence do you have of THAT? Zero. It's all imaginary. You made it up. We don't even know what Daphne looks like, or what her hair and eye-color are: she's such a non-entity that none of the wikis even have a piece of art to put on her page, she gets a silhouette. The only thing we know about the Greengrasses is that they avoided being involved in either war, that's it, we have nothing else. And you've somehow extrapolated that to mean they're a bunch of lazy, stupid, */impossibly/* lucky cowards. You have no evidence to support this save your own delusions.

If you're too stupid to understand the difference between a reasonable assumption (Charlie and Bill must be poor because the Weasley family is poor and they would share their money if they could) and wild leaps of logic (nobody ever said there wasn't a house sized polka dot elephant on the fifth floor of Hogwarts), then I can't help you.

I note, you're not actually providing any evidence to support your contention, you just want to disagree. Which is fine, I do it all the time, but don't kid yourself you're being the rational one here.

Harry doesn't try to learn too much about them, but he doesn't do that with anything he doesn't have an active interest in. Harry only goes to school supply stores and Quidditch stores. He doesn't know anyone in the Wizengamot and nearly no one in the Ministry(Fudge, Tonks,Umbridge, Perkins, Percy, Arthur).
