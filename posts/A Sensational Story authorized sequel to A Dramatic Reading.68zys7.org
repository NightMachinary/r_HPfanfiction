Since I introduced my own story here: /A Dramatic Reading/, linkffn(12324284), I thought I should also announce that there is now an authorized sequel, written by Srikanth1808, continuing the reading of the canon with /Chamber of Secrets/.

/A Sensational Story/: linkffn(12473842).

/A Dramatic Reading/ was my attempt at a read-the-books fic that was actually /readable/ (and wouldn't annoy the mods), and it has been pretty successful, but I wasn't inspired to continue beyond Book 1. But now, a volunteer has emerged. I've been working with Srikanth to make sure the sequel is up to the same standard, and I'm optimistic about it so far.

** My god, I loved this story! It was possibly my favourite book-reading shindig ever.

I couldn't find it anymore, and anyway I'm happy that it's being continued!

** Hey, that's pretty awesome! I liked Dramatic Reading quite a lot, so hopefully this is pretty great too.

I was a little disappointed, though, that nothing came out of the tiny subplot where Dumbledore thought that [[/spoiler][Voldemort may have written the books.]]
