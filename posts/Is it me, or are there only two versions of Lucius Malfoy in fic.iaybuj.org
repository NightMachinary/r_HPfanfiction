He either seems to be a horrible, irredeemable asshat (closer to canon but crucially without the loves-his-son saving grace the books gave him) or some kind of epic lothario who is "so much nicer now he hasn't got to pretend to be loyal to the Dark Lord", usually explained when Harry or Hermione are letting him bend them over the nearest convenient flat surface to the consternation of their friends.

Also, is mis-typing his name as Luscious/Lucious a fanon choice? Or do we all just secretly have the hots for Jason Isaacs as a blonde Elf reject?


** I mean, in canon, I'd argue he's irredeemable, but he is a loving father/husband.

Shame we don't get that in fanfiction.

Jason Isaac's is one my favorite actor from other movies/shows. He was hilarious in death of Stalin.

*** Lots of worst Nazi war criminals were loving fathers and decent family men. Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuehrer of the SS and the chief implementer of the Holocaust, was such an example. After the war, his daughter [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudrun_Burwitz][Gundrun]] continued to support her father's cause.

--------------

Another monster, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot][Pol Pot]], the leader of Khmer Rouge, is supposed to have a really nice personality:

#+begin_quote
  Pol Pot displayed what Chandler called a "genteel charisma",[436] and what Short described as a "magnetic personality".[344] As a child, his brother characterized him as having been sweet tempered and equable, while fellow school pupils recalled that Pol Pot was mediocre but pleasant.[436] As a teacher, he was characterized by his pupils as having been calm, honest and persuasive,[436] having an "evident good nature and an attractive personality".[103] Chandler noted that he had the "common touch" when interacting with people;[437] according to Short, Pol Pot's varied and eclectic upbringing meant that he was "able to communicate naturally with people of all sorts and conditions, establishing an instinctive rapport that invariably made them want to like him".[438] Many observers commented on his distinctive smile.[438] When speaking to audiences he usually carried a fan, which in Cambodian culture was traditionally associated with monkhood.[256]

  Pol Pot was softly spoken.[439] During speeches he was serene and calm, even in the midst of using violent rhetoric.[440] Chandler noted that when meeting with people, Pol Pot displayed an "apparent warmth" and was known for his "slowly uttered words".[441] Kong Duong, who worked with Pol Pot in the 1980s, said that *he was "very likeable, a really nice person. He was friendly, and everything he said seemed very sensible. He would never blame you or scold you to your face."*[439]
#+end_quote

But his deeds show something completely different:

#+begin_quote
  Pol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an agrarian socialist society that he believed would evolve into a communist society, Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on collective farms. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. *These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the Cambodian genocide.*
#+end_quote

Cambodian [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields][Killing Fields]] have to be one of the darkest chapters in human history (beware reading that article!). Also, *Khmer Rouge is the only real world regime after ancient times, that attempted to create something like a marriage law*.

**** That was a very nice history lesson. Seriously. Saved for future quotes.

I'm not trying to justify his Malfoy's behavior in canon. By all means, he's literally one of the worst people in canon. Him living/not being imprisoned post book 7 is literally one of the worst pieces of canon ever. The man literally attempted to kill schoolchildren. Comparing him to Heinrich Himmler is pretty apt.

But from a pure storytelling perspective, yes, making him into this caricature of his canon self makes him rather dull to read. Also Draco as well. Despite committing war crimes, him getting off without jail time after the war makes sense. He's young, low-level, reluctant, kind of remorseful, and actually seems to have not killed anyone. But his character arc could have been improved by having him in conflict to his father.

Of course, one of the weirdest things I've read in fanfiction is a Lupin who seems reluctant to kill.

***** (Fanfic) authors could use villains like Pol Pot a lot more. Too many think that evil people must act like totally rude jerks or monolithically evil sadistic serial killers, but our real world actually offers much more interesting examples.

****** I'm put off by the ragey, murder-and-torture-happy Voldemort that is often portrayed by fanon. The dude is basically leading a cult. It feels, to me, that a person wouldn't become fanatically loyal to a man who tortures them with the worst imaginable pain for failing once. I honestly, in my personal headcanon, expect him to be nearly paternal. Like, "forgive me my Lord, I have failed you!" And Voldemort responds with "no no, my friend, you have merely fallen at an obstacle. I have faith in your capacity to complete your mission. After all, even I fell once. Rise to your feet, and eat with me at my table." That's a much, much scarier dude than a "YOu FaiLeD mE, CRUCIO" psychopath

**** It's scary dictators and the people around them are like that. This is why they still have supporters even if there is glaring evidence of their crimes. I saw a movie called "The Kingmaker" before. It was about the First Lady of a real life dictator and how she worked the strings behind her husbands reign. It's chilling to know that people like these exist in real life.

***** Beware of those who promise salvation and seek absolute power. This is a recurring theme throughout history.

But what makes Death Eaters especially bad is that Voldemort's premise right from the beginning was based on murder, torture, and tyranny. Therefore, those who supported him were absolutely the worst scum, magnitudes worse than even the Nazis and Khmer Rouges.

LMAO. I find very little redeemable in Lucius beyond his commitment to family. And even that I find questionable due to the risk he put his family in. Nevertheless, Jasons Isaacs is hot in any format, so I can see why some people push so hard for him.

You're right though, those are the only two types of stories for him. Nothing's worse than the ones where he's suddenly a good guy, that wanted to be that way all along, but couldn't... because of reasons.

** Luscious by Lucius: For All Hair Troubles and Improvements, Available at a Frankly Ridiculous Price and Much Better Than Nivea.

But in all seriousness, Lucius Malfoy is one of fanfictions great problems. Writers are often unable to recognize that people can be multifaceted. I mean JKR is hardly the queen of character development, but at least she understands that people aren't pieces of cardboard or muppets.
