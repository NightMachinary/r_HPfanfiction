...As these obtuse, mindless drones who worship Dumbledore and see the world in a strong, black/white way, neither understanding nor wanting to understand any shade of gray in-between. Does anyone else feel like it's a bit against how common sense say a family like the Weasleys /would/ be? Arthur's mother was both a Black and a Slytherin. Prewett family (Molly's) is also mentioned to be related to the Blacks, but I'm not sure to which extent. Ron's grandma is literally a Slytherin, but every time I open a fic he seems to be one step away from proposing death camps in which to put all the members of that house.

Why is this trope of the Weasleys hating anything non-Gryffindor so popular? They seem to be in some kind of long time feud with the Malfoys, sure, but why is this always extended to such large extents?


** Basically, a lot of people /(who seem to have only seen the movies without reading the books strangely enough)/ decided that stupid, betraying Ron was in the way between their perfect love story between Hermione and Harry, or Hermione and Draco (because remember kids, having a row with your friends is less forgiveable than trying to kill people you hate because of their blood).

So rather than just making Ron . . . not there, or giving him a noble death, these people decided that they would rather make a bad parody of Movie Ron (as if this one was not already a bad Parody of Book Ron) so the sweethearts were justified to just throw him away.\\
So yeah, an author made a Ron hating "Slimy Snakes", probably for Dramione fic, and has often with fanfics, it's been copied enough to become a trope.

For the rest of the Family, it's some kind of mix between a Halo Effect (if Ron is bad, his whole family must be bad, except the Twins, they are cool), Manipulative Dumbledore trope (they have been paid to befriend Harry), and the need to put Ginny out of the Picture (same way Ron needed) so Harry can date Hermione or any Girls he would wish (especially you, Daphne Greengrass/ Ice Queen of Slytherin/ Anything you want really she just have a name in Canon).

*** Honestly, I feel like in canon(movie) the way Ron treats Slytherins is kind of key to it it to. I know their year isn't the best for an example, but even then there are times where it seems he just thinks all Slytherins are bad.

**** in his defense, from what we see at best Slytherin's are neutral.

Which is not exactly a good stance when purebloods are actively trying to murder muggle-borns and tortures them for fun.

Imagine if someone went "Ehhh. I am neutral on the whole terrorism thing. I don't really mind what they do, but I am not gonna join them."

***** Well, I may speak more about book canons than movie canon by saying this, but arent most people (like 80/90% of the population) "neutral in the Blood War?

It may be harsh to judge them on this (especially when you learn in HBP that "An amazing number of people can't even cast a Shield Charm), but most of the population of the country seem to not have done anything for or against Voldemort for the duration of the book.

If anything, this is the heros that are not normal, between Harry "The Chosen One" (and Undesirable Number 1), Hermione the Mudblood and Ron "Pureblood but family is deep down in a Vigilant Organization" (not to mention both Ron and Hermione are best friend with the Undersirable Number 1), all of them are really too involved in the affair when compared to the rest of the population.

A good indicator of the lack of participation of people is the Battle of Hogwarts. How many people took part in it? 200? 300? I think that even with a general estimation, there were 500 hundred people at best, and this include Snatchers and Imperiused people for Voldemort side, 500 hundreds for a battle decided the futur of a country of around 10 000 people (I think?). Also, Slytherins took part in this battle, apparently Slughorn lead a charge of them from the gate of the school and took some Death Eaters from behind (well the whole leading attack thing is Potterverse so not always considered canon, but Slughorn supposed to have escorted the kid to Hogsmead yet was there to duel Voldemort at the end so . . .)

***** Well, I mean this seems realistic, sadly. If you live in Oregon, and someone in Florida does of a bombing, you'll remark about it and say about how bad it is, and move on. I just feel like Slytherins were just made out to be the bad guys even if half of them weren't even mentioned. For example, Daphne Greengrass could be labeled a blood-purist because she is both pure blood and in Slytherin. However, the book never gives us more than her year and name so this is just a theory. What could've actually been is she was neutral, meaning she didn't agree but felt it was up to the government. I mean normally when people don't agree with a terrorist organization, they expect government to do something. Or they join the force that deals with situations like that (e.x. USMC, Army, Air Force, Navy, etc.). Point is, there just isn't enough information to tell what their individual opinions are.

Then you are still against it and voices that.

You know what the average Slytherin reply would be, according to the books, if muggles were killed or muggleborns?\\
It would vary from "Eh. It's just muggles/muggleborns. Not a huge loss." to "HA! Filthy mudbloods deserves it!"

** I mean, in a fandom of fifteen years and a million fics, I doubt you'll find a trope that hasn't been popular at one point or another. Especially given how young some people are when they start writing (meaning they're often quite influenced by the 'jumping on the meme-challenge-bandwagon' effect).

Chances are, a few people found something in canon to justify their idea, wrote their fics, then some more people read those fics and thought they were cool/integrated into their headcanon to justify a ship or idea and so wrote their own. Rinse and repeat ad-nauseam until the fandom gets bored and moves onto something else.

** As much as I love them, the movies did no favours towards the Weasleys. The movies portray Ron as a selfish egotistical brat, when in the books he acted more like a teen.

One fix which imo creates a common like tone for the Weasleys is:

*** Yeah, this. The movies to some extent character assassinate Ron and Ginny. Hermione gets some of Ron's all-time best moments and lines, and Ron in turn gets all of Hagrid's judgmental lines about Slytherin. Ginny in the movies is just a completely different character, to the point where Bonnie Wright played a better Ginny in /The Philosophers/ than she did in any Harry Potter movie.

** It's inevitable for a fandom as big and robust as this one (to say nothing of the sizable child presence within it, which means a chunk of the fandom sees the canon through a less nuanced lens) to develop increasingly weird fanon and simplify characters down into digestible tropes that can be easily reproduced in fanfiction.

It's hard for a person to consider a character's many facets and ultimately find a human with complicated thoughts and feelings about things, and it's even harder to take all those facets and reproduce them on paper for your own story. It's simpler to squish characters down into one or two dimensions and then write your story that way, and not everyone is aware that that's what they're doing.

*** Canon book yeah but movie massacred the boy and gave him judgemental lines from other characters like the "All the wizards who went bad were from Slytherin" who was said by Hagrid in the books.\\
At the same time, Hermione got the Princess treatment like explaining Wizarding trivia to Harry (supposed to be Ron's thing, he explains cultural things and Hermione explains books things), or having no problem saying Voldemort in CoS when Hermione only say it (difficultly) in OotP.

**** To make Harry like Slytherin, you have to rewrite all seven books and as for Hermione, her dislike for Slytherin can be explained by one word: Malfoy. To be fair though, I think that Dramione or Drarry can only happen many years after the war ( if it ever happens).

** I mean, the Weasleys (like many) /do/ borderline worship Dumbledore in the books, that's not a movie thing. Everyone up and accepted Harry being left alone and told nothing about the Order entirely on Dumbledore's say-so (Hermione, Ron & Sirius being the only ones not hot on the idea, apparently). He has them all accepting being left in the dark about the prophecy. It makes some sense, but no one seems to especially care about the details of what the prophecy says outside of Harry (Sirius even intimates it contains knowledge of how to destroy Harry, lol)? Heck, the entire staff of Hogwarts participates in hiding a powerful magical object behind enchantments just because it was Dumbledore's friend's (I doubt this was government approved...).

Snape at least was compelled by duty for owing Dumbledore for, um, trying to save Lily anyway, but everyone else mostly just appears to accept it because he says it's a good idea to do something a certain way.

** I think part of it spawns of of the manipulation! Dumbledore-trope and the massive change in the Harry/Hermione interactions in book 5&6 (and I'm still convinced that book 5&7 are either written by a ghostwriter(+JKR's plotnotes) or gotten a Massive editorial makeover by the publisher 😝) well that and the seemingly callous attitude with love potions (aka wizarding daterape drugs) that the Weasleys seem to have.

** You're aware Ron's grandmother was a "blood traitor" right? She was kicked out of the family, so I don't think Ron's little mind would ever think of her as a snake. Anyway, all this background is relatively recent, while the fanon Weasley became a cliché a long time ago.

In fact, if one wanted to be a cynic, it would be easy to see all this new canon as JKR trying to dismiss the fanon theories that had made so much sense.

** They're pretty white/black, we see since the begining that Ron is against Slytherin, so clearly that's something he learned at home. Molly is very strict and judgmental with some thing, like her relationship with Sirius or how she is portrayed in OOTP. So this is why I can understand that some people sees them like this

But I don't think is fair to assume that the weasleys would turn their back to Harry like, I can see that probably Ron and Harry wouldn't be best friends if Harry went to Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, but I can't believe that Ron would left Harry in OOTP or HBP because Harry starts reading on dark magic or something like (I don't like dark Harry tho), but Ron would be right by his side, I even can believe that Hermione would be harder to convince, Ron is very judgmental at the beginning, but he grows out, and he would be with Harry and encourage him

*** Thing is, Ron *is not against Slytherin*. This is 100% a movie thing (and even there not convinced). In the book, Ron is the member of the Trio who has the most relaxed attitude against the house, and direct all his anger against Malfoy and his cronies (which is totaly justified when you see how Malfoy act). If you want to see someone Anti Slytherin, look at Harry.

As for Molly, while she is a bit judgmental (thinking Fleur is only with Bill for shallows reasons, or trusting Rita Skeeter articles), the reason she has problem with Sirius is because she is with the "Harry is still a kid and should not take part in the War" side while Sirius is in the "He is already part of it and deserve to know more about it" side (that and the fact that until recently she thought he was a dangerous Death Eater out to kill Harry, who still spend 13 years in hell on earth).

Because Weasley bashers can't write an original story to save their lives. It's all the same low-quality shit repeated thousands of times and unfortunately, that's what is popular. The movies don't help either, and most people either watched the movies before the books or only watched the movies (but claimed to read the books).
