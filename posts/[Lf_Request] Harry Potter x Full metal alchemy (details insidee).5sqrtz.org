I really enjoy harry potter fanfics where harry goes into alchemy. Unfortunately there is not a lot out there that have a decent length and are not crossovers. I saw Full metal alchemy (Never heard of this before) and thought to give it a go. Now redditors, anyone know of this crossover with harry as the main character and he isn't buddy buddy with Ron and Hermione? Thanks redditors.
