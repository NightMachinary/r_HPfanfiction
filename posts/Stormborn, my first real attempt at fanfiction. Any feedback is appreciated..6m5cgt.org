*** Well - if I had to give it some "tags" I would say that it plays on dark!harry, lord!Harry tropes, while being cognizant of the common faults of these types of stories (I've certainly read a lot - so no God!Harry). I'm trying to really depend on solid history for the AU I'm building - built both on real history and my own creative interventions. I'm considering many different ships - including some of the more common ships for Dark!Harry, a slash pairing, or even no pairing at all. There will be no smut - regardless of the pairing [[/spoiler][and no mpreg, for those wondering]]. It is not really a romance but it does have elements of a drama - so I think a romantic element would be a good asset. There will be lots of politics, conflict but no grand-battles, and I am going to try and work in a system of inventive/interesting magic that is not totally outlandish and unbelievable. I'm really going for world-building, and innovation to enrich my plot.

I'm also trying to rely on some OC's - most notably Arcturus Black, who I have pulled loosely from fannon to be Sirius' grandfather. [[/spoiler][Though my Harry also refers to Arcturus as his grandfather]]

It also might be reminiscent of some "BWL!Twin" stories as they have inspired me greatly - however Voldemort is not a character in this story so there is no BWL to begin with.

** Read the first 7 chapters, I enjoyed the surmise and the twist of Sirius's departure. While your probably going to get some flak for your Dumbledore I applaud you on doubling down on the trope making the evil Dumbledore a staple in the plot instead of a weak trope for a god Harry setup.

I was a bit confused about the whole naming thing, I thought Artucus was going to name the child Sirius and let Sirius choose the middie name but instead it went to the whole naming ceremony thing, much less of a issue more of a gripe tbh.

I'm not really into slash but I enjoy your political scenes but I get the feeling there's going to be some untimely deaths soon, so I may stay for the ride.

Overall I thinks it's a great premise though

*** Certainly won't be a weak Dumbledore that enables a God!Harry. While it can be entertaining if done right - it is terribly overdone and drab.

You make a fair point on the naming thing. I'm going to go comb back over it to see if I can fix anything to make it less confusing.

Glad to hear you like the political scenes - I am new to writing and was unsure about them. Feel free to contact me with any feedback, as you get it! I always welcome constructive criticism.

** Interesting take on the various tropes. Nice to see some of the rarer characters as well.
