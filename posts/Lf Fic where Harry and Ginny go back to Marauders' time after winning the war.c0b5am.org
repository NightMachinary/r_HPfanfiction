Hi, I read a great fic a while ago where Harry and Ginny go back in time after winning the war to meet the Marauders, specially Lily. Harry is the DADA teacher and Ginny is the nurse. Ring a bell ? :-)


** The closest things that comes to my mind is linkffn(Putting the 'M' in Mystery by missy mee). It fits all of the above criteria except Ginny is not specifically a nurse.

Not actually too poorly written, but it does have its issues. Of course, it /was/ written in 2006.

  When an eighteen year old green eyed black haired teacher shows up in 1977 with a snake and flirty redhead in tow, there's sure to be complications. HG. Formally 'Meet Professor Son - I mean - Potter'

***** In the one I'm looking for, Harry was a professional Quidditch player training for the World Cup just before going back in time. And he had a silver strand of hair I remember.

  Harry is reborn as the eldest son of the Black family and Sirius's older brother while Ginny is reborn as a muggleborn witch. Harry makes it his mission to make sure Sirius and his friends grow up in a better world. Continuation from Harry potter and the Lightning Curse. Good Wormtail and Bellatrix, Dumbledore bashing.
