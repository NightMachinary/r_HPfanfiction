I came across [[http://lordddorian.tumblr.com/post/132276464879/hogwarts-school-uniform][this post]] on Tumblr earlier today that talks about the Hogwarts uniform (I recommend you read it, it's quite excellent) and it bothers me, as I'm sure it does others, how many writers of Harry Potter fanfiction don't know what robes are worn at Hogwarts.

Thoughts?


** When it comes to fanfiction, I find if they are going to use the movie-type of uniform, it's fine. It makes more sense to me because I can actually picture it. But as long as they don't also have problems dressing in the muggle world. You can only have problems dressing in the muggle world if you are using the book version with just robes. But I do think the "dressing funny to muggles" bit from the book was used as a device to separate the worlds and scream /magic/. If it was a real world and not a book story, wizards and witches would probably have fashion similar to muggles with only a few differences rather than the completely different fashion they have in the books. I've always pictured Hogwarts uniforms with a school robe, slacks underneath, and a white colored shirt with a house tie. So... movie uniform. Students wear the robes to classes but when lounging about the common room they would probably just be in their trousers and collared shirt with their tie loosened. Or even just wearing sweatshirts/jackets, particularly in the regular books' era (1990's). It makes the character seem more connectable, and that always comforting to a reader.

Regarding hats, I find the "pointed black hat" to be another device to scream /witches/ and /wizards/. In reality, I never even pictured them wearing them as I read and I don't picture students wearing them in fanfiction. Again, it goes to the ability of the reader to connect with the character. I feel like the pointed hats is the stereotypical magic thing that she put in the books in the beginning and then just kind of rolled with it. Funny enough, I can picture Professor McGonagall wearing one, but not really the students (I think that's because of the movies though).

But this is really a fanon vs canon argument. While canon is incredibly important, fanon is probably the most important. Telling a story is all about perception to the reader/listener. If the reader sees it one way despite you constantly telling them otherwise, it doesn't matter. The story that you have passed to them is now how they imagined it. My personal fanon is that the uniforms are a bit more "normal" which makes it easier for me to picture the characters as I read/write.

** Ah, who made that theme? Does it really seem like a good idea to have grey text in a thin sans serif font on a black background?

Design grumblings aside, there's still the ever present question of what students wear underneath their robes. I've heard a few different things about this, both in and out of fanfic. The most unique one I've heard was a fanfic that described people as wearing tunics and leggings underneath their robes.

*** The author's point about Snape's underwear being on display when he's turned upsidown still stands though. If he's wearing anything not-skirt-like underneath his robes, it would hide his underwear.

**** I like the idea that the uniform changed slightly at some point, due to too many Snape-type displays and the general agreements that it was time to bring the costume into the 19 century or something. Probably brought about by various muggle-born board members who have never quite gotten used to wearing glorified dresses with only undies under

*** The theme... it's a nuisance, yeah, but you can copypaste it onto a text document with the font of your liking and read it there if it bothers you too much.

Wizarding underthings: it mentions Snape in the Tumblr post.

#+begin_quote
  For an even more undeniable piece of evidence that supports the idea of having a closed front, look no further than Snape's worst memory in OotP. When he gets levicorpused by James, we see his underwear. He's not wearing trousers.
#+end_quote

So either they wear nothing but underwear, or it's optional. OR Snape is just gross.

**** I think it's an interesting question - well, as interesting as underwear can be in this context. I've actually read a theory that proposed that while people didn't wear muggle jeans like they showed in the movies, muggleborns and halfbloods and "blood traitors" would wear something underneath their robes, while going commando would be something only purebloods would do. As far as Snape was concerned, the war was picking up steam, and he was a half-blood in Slytherin interested in the Dark Arts - of course he wouldn't wear anything underneath his robes. I thought that was pretty interesting.

** I've always been more or less ok with the film robes, if only because at least they're better than the Muggle clothes that take over after film 2, but this is a good post. I think it's basically an accurate/reasonable reading of the text.

Also I love the ideas re: robe customization, I'm sure there are a bunch of little shits losing points for being a bit too wacky with their house pride.

** This post is really awesome, and totally matches my headcanons about clothing construction in the books, thanks for posting it.

Another thing to remember is that wizards might have different ideas of what "underwear" means than modern muggles - for instance, if there's a full robe with nothing underneath but a pair of muggle-style boxers, as potentially implied in the Snape scene, that's not really practical for winter wear. I've imagined that the wizard style of underwear was some sort of Victorian-esque [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Men's-Union-Suit.jpg][long johns]], and then they would switch to shorter things like [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/de/d4/62/ded4626f8bc985ca90696d3d74d36c99.jpg][this]] in the summer under their robes.

It's very possible that it would go something like this for most wizards not wearing muggle clothes - long johns (maybe leggings as a modern adaption?), then a full-bodied robe that's not meant to be opened in the front (with whatever sort of shoes you want them to wear, plus muggleborns like Harry will wear sneakers), then a cloak that's more like the movie robe and meant to be work as outerwear.

** I actually like the movie version better, plain black robes and hats? Boring. And there is no mention of decorative pins or scarves in the books (I might be mistaken on scarves, but if they are mentioned, JK doesn't bring up colours).

It makes more sense to me, Wizards and even traditionalists might not like Muggle fashion and not even understand it most of the time but trousers have been around since the late Roman Empire, and shirts are even older. Ties and skirts might be a stretch though, I highly doubt the highly conservative Wizarding world would allow skirts that are knee length or shorter, ankle length seems more likely.

In my headcanon the boys uniform is a black robe that can be worn open or fastened fully, trousers and a white shirt, not muggle suit shirt with collars but a turtle neck type thing. With a badge and coloured trim on the robes to signify house.

Girls uniform is similar but with an ankle length skirt and perhaps a more frilly shirt.

** i always prefer to imagine the robes where like university robes, and everyone wears whatever they want under them. so snape probably wore fitting robes under the school ones, or james was just going to pull his trousers down with them. i guess i was imagining an old fashioned version of a lab coat; work robes to stop you getting splashed with potions.

generally i think anything medieval is probably right. there might not even be a uniform; just, wizard fashion in black, with hat.

** As an addition to the house pride part: prefect and head boy/girl badges are in house colors in the books. (alhtough in book 3 this was only changed to be so in later editions I think)

** I remembered hearing that the kids at Hogwarts didn't wear uniforms, and after a bit of searching I found the source: "Funnily enough, J.K. Rowling said that the kids did not wear uniforms." Judianna Makovsky, costume designer for HP and the Philosophers' Stone in Creating the world of Harry Potter part one (the first of the documentaries about the making of Harry Potter that were in the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_Wizard's_Collection][Wizards Collection]]). The only reason that the kids wear uniforms in the films is that it looked messy to have all the kids in regular clothes (though I don't know why they didn't use black robes as described in the books).

That said, I like the ideas in this post. Basic black robes with customizations to show your house and style sound great. It's not really a uniform in my opinion if everyone customizes it (but I know nothing about school uniforms), but apparently they aren't supposed to be a uniform, just a dress code.

*** To be fair, though, with most of the students being either purebloods or halfbloods raised by wizards or witches rather than by muggles---if we go with the words of J.K.Rowling that all “muggleborns” are really descended from squibs, words which make it fairly clear that there wouldn't be too many muggleborns because what are the chances for descendants of squibs to get together and have a kid---it's fairly easy to see that the kids would think of what the books treat as a uniform, as just the kind of clothing that is being worn, and thus for them it wouldn't be as much a uniform as just clothes.

And the letter itself does not actually mention the robes as uniform either, just as stuff to be worn. Which is probably there for the benefit of the parents of young witches and wizards to let them know that they can just pack normal clothes for the kid instead of having to get some special robes.

** Interesting post.

I wonder if the movie's uniforms were in this style simply to cut corners, or make the differences between Houses more visually apparent.

*** I think it relates to one of Rowling's interviews before the movies came out (don't ask me to link which one, I'm not sure), but in it, she refers to Hogwarts as being the magical equivalent of a boarding school. And what do most boarding schools have? Uniforms like the ones seen in the movies.
