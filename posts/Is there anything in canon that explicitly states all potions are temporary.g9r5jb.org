Got a rude review on my fic complaining that the premise is stupid because potions aren't permanent (my mc is the victim of a potions accident). Is this actually said anywhere in canon? I did basic research before writing and didn't see anything, and I don't really care if I have to say the fic is AU where potions can be permanent or whatever, it's just annoying to be called out for violating canon rules when I'm not aware those rules are actually real.


** Sometimes writers treat Potions as temporary and Alchemy as permanent, but that may be as much a hold-over from RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons rather than anything written in the books. Most potions in the books aren't permanent, but some are; Skele-grow is good example of a permanent potion, as is Hermione's accidental journey into being a cat-girl from putting cat hair in Polyjuice. They couldn't reverse it or wait it out; they had to slowly transform her back over weeks.

*** Skele-gro could be argued to be a temporary potion - its effect is in growing the bone back, which is temporary (the bone itself is not temporary, but the potion doesn't continually re-grow it, if that makes sense). That's a matter of opinion of course.

I think a potion mishap could be more permanent - like the one you mention for Hermione, or one that has a potion induce a physical change that then remains.

From a quick look at the wiki's list of potions, I think there are only 2 that I would classify as the potion themselves being permanent - the Draught of Living Death (which seems to last until the antidote is given) and the very vague 'Everlasting Elixirs', which strike me as a type of potion (a category, and not a specific potion in and of itself). By contrast, most potions seem to need continual intake to be maintained in effect (eg - the Lycanthropy potions, the potion that maintained Voldemort's temporary body, the Elixir of Life, Polyjuice, etc).

But it's not super clearcut, particularly for the OP saying it's an accident. It's a good catch, though, of a rule of thumb distinction that you mention - it would help explain why alchemy is different and useful.

** I think you're caught in that space between whether a potion is temporary or permanent and/or whether the effects of the potion are temporary or permanent.

As like the examples given consider the blood replenishing potion. You take it and it replaces/restores a specific amount of your blood. Now the blood created is "permanent" unless you're still injured enough to continue bleeding or you injure yourself at a later date.

However, if you do injure yourself at a later date you would need another blood replenishing as it is no longer working in your system.

So in this instance, you would say that most healing potions are temporary as they only interact for a short time but the effects of those potions are permanent (would be a pain if a month later bad cuts healed by Essence of Dittany all suddenly reappear and reopen).

Most potions are probably on the order of a temporary potion with permanent effects with only a few potions that are permanent with permanent effects.

If a potion needs a second potion to counter its effects you could most likely consider it a permanent potion. The exception would be potions that have a timed effect that has a counter potion to eliminate the effects prior to time expiring. Eg Veritserum

So I don't see a problem with your fic having potions with permanent effects as canon is filled with them.

This I think is the main point. Potions are ingested, and as such the active ingredients are flushed out of the body over time. The components of your blood constantly die and are replaced (or not) by the body, so in that sense a potion is not permanent. (Head canon says draught of living death works the way it does because it stops the body's processes and thus is not flushed out.)

Depending on how a particular potion is designed, the effects can be permanent. If a potion was to, for example, remove cataracts, then they should not just reappear when the potion wears off. If a potion is for clearning the sinuses, then that clearly is not permanent because the body continues to react to environmental factors and would generate more mucus in the presence of allergens.

**** It's more or less the same with mundane medicine. Painkillers are temporary, but the effect of chemotherapy - killing tumours - can be lasting.

** Some potions are poisonous, and death is permanent, so no.

** I think that anyone who insists on strictly following canon in fanfiction shouldn't be reading it. I've seen and read a ton of fics involving potions accidents with permanent (unless a solution is found) side effects, and I think you're in the clear. Also, the nature of a potions accident can easily alter things to the extent that it would affect the character differently. In the end, it's your story, and if a reader is going to be such a hard ass about 'canon', then they should write their own story. You're doing this for free and it can be whatever you want it to be.

** Taking into account the polyjuice incident in book 2 which required treatment to remedy, I would suggest that potions can be permanent or temporary, depending on the potion. Therefore the whole point is moot, and you can peacefully go back to writing your fic.

** I think it might depend on the potion, since each are different, and used for different reasons.
