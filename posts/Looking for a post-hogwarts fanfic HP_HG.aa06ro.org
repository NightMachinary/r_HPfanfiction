All I remember from this fic that I read ages ago is that Hermione is currently teaching at Hogwarts. Harry's just disappeared. And Teddy and Victorie (I think it is Victorie, or Gabrielle, can't really remeber) stumble upon Harry during a hiking trip. Harry's got a panther/jaguar animagus form, gives victorie a portkey to give to hermione, hermione visits. Harry's basically making a haven for magical creatures, agrees to return. Fic ends with him joining the Hogwarts staff as 'James Evans'. Victorie recognizes him but somehow can't utter his name.

Any clue about this fic?.?
