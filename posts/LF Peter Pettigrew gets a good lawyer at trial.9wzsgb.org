I don't think this has actually ever been done before in the history of Harry Potter fanfiction. All the stories I've ever seen that have Wormtail put on trial have him being pumped full of Veritaserum to confess or having to defend himself or whatever, and inevitably being found guilty.

Does anyone know a fic where Peter Pettigrew's defence at trial is actually well-presented by a competent lawyer? One who makes a strong enough argument to actually get Peter off?

(Also, did anyone else find the evidence of Peter's being-a-bad-guy in canon kind of weak? The confrontation in book 3 is entirely he said/she said without any proof either way, and Peter's not the one intending to commit murder in that scene.)

** I don't have a good recommendation for this, and I apologise, but this just gave me a great fic idea, where Sirius get a good defense lawyer and hopefully escapes trial from Azkaban but still has to live with a shit reputation amongst the wizarding community.

I'd love to write the story (and yours, if there indeed isn't a rec) but legal jargon gives me a migraine lol.

*********** IMHO Dumbledore 'won' that trial entirely because of his respect and authority (and maybe invoking a bit of fear).

I get really aggravated when fanfics have Harry defend himself alone with some kind of brilliant legal argument and for some reason everyone starts to act rationally and listens to logic.

I can't really blame Dumbledore for making this political. The whole trial was political. It had nothing to do with whether Harry was guilty of any crime or not.

All he had to do was prove that Harry had acted within that "reasonable underage magic" law and willing to submit to Veritasserum questioning. Case closed.

He can't disclose the Order safehouse, he can't disclose anything which would further harm Dumbledore (and Fudge was involved in the Sirius Black mess just as much, so he would not ask questions there).

Yeah sure, but that kind of evidence would have only been allowed because "Dumbledore". He might as well just have said "I declare that Harry Potter is under my protection" and just left with him. Would probably worked just as well. Fudge & Co don't care a bit about evidence.

If Harry on his own had requested Veritasserum, Fudge would just have claimed that Harry is delusional and therefore Veritasserum cannot be relied on. Though he'd never gotten that far before they tossed him out and broken his wand. Fudge has already proven that he considers himself completely above the law (impromptu execution of Crouch Jr.)

Fudge is trying to protect is career and political legacy. He can only be stopped in this situation by making the cost greater than the gain.

** What's he said/she said about the climax of book 3? There doesn't seem to be a factual dispute at all. Peter doesn't deny that he was the secret keeper. He doesn't deny that he passed information to Voldemort before he became secret keeper. He doesn't deny that he handed the Potters to Voldemort. He doesn't deny that he cut off his own finger to frame Sirius for his death and the Potters'. He doesn't deny that he blew up the street and killed everyone nearby. His defense is not "I didn't do it" but "Voldemort would have killed me." And, as Lupin says, it doesn't make much sense for an innocent man to live his life as a rat since prior to Sirius there was no history of anyone escaping Azkaban. I have sympathy for his perfectly reasonable fear, but fear isn't much of a defense once you've committed mass murder to cover up the results of your fear-induced betrayal. So you're not only asking for a talented lawyer, but one who convinces Peter to lie against Peter's own inclination, which lawyers aren't supposed to do.

The wizarding world doesn't seem to be big on lawyers or any kind of due process. Sirius didn't get a trial at all. Barty Crouch Jr. got a trial just so his father could publicly disown him. None of the adults in Harry's life suggested formal legal representation for him, although Dumbledore did behave like a lawyer.

I have always wished we knew more about Peter, though. What did his friends find so appealing about him in school? (All the flashback told us was that James liked praise wherever it came from, and Pottermore seems to imply that Remus felt sorry for him and brought him to James/Sirius' attention.) What was his family of origin like? There has to be SOMETHING about him that's more complex Judas-figure and less whiny cartoon, right?

*** You could argue that it wasn't techincally illegal for him to betray the Potters. I don't think there's actually a law against revealing the secret of a Fidelius and even if there was you could argue he was under duress. As for killing all those nearby muggles maybe the lawyer could argue manslaughter and claim they were unintended casualties in self defence against Sirius who was attempting to murder him.

And maybe with a little artistic license you could say that muggle manslaughter was decriminalized at the time due to voldemort's reign (Since the ministry probably wouldn't pull itself together in under 24 hours since his death)

As for "Framing" Sirius...well it's not his fault that Sirius is terrible at communicating and the Wizengamot didn't give him a trial. He never explained himself to anyone. And he has every right to cut off his own finger, who are we to +police+ auror what people do with their own bodies.

***** But he probably had a lot of death eaters in positions of power or a lot of high ranking officials blackmailed and under duress to pass some anti muggle legislation here and there.

Though TBH I wouldn't be surprised if it was already legal to manslaughter muggles before Voldemort since stuff like Muggle Protection Act didn't pass until the 90's (but that only pertains to artefacts as far as we know)

Alternatively maybe have some kind of statute of limitations on manslaughter. There isn't one in Britain afaik but maybe wizarding Britain is different in regards to muggles.

*** Actually, the only things Peter says to confirm anything are that Voldemort forced him to reveal the Secret, and that he would have been killed otherwise.\\
Considering that by the end of book 7, we know that if a Secret Keeper is killed, everyone who knew the secret becomes able to tell, and he believed (or alleged) that Sirius was a traitor, Peter has a pretty good point there.

As for hiding in his animagus form, he wasn't just hiding from Sirius, but also from the Death Eaters, who might've held him as responsible as baby Harry Potter for Voldemort's downfall, and possibly from the Ministry, who as you pointed out, might have been perfectly willing to chuck him in Azkaban without trial if they knew he survived and /might/ have caused the explosion/been the Secret Keeper.

The rest...doesn't come up at all. He never confirms that he was a willing spy (and with love potions and false memory charms and legilmency and Imperius abounding, the Death Eaters hardly needed a spy in the Order), he never confirms blowing up the street (see previous about Death Eaters being after him, also, why assume that he cut off his finger on purpose, instead of splinching himself when Disapparating?), and he never hurt the Weasleys, or Harry, for the duration of acting as their pet rat.

**** But if any of those facts are in question, why doesn't he say so? The kids were inclined to side with him. He'd spent years around Hermione; he knew she'd want to hear all of the facts. He doesn't explicitly confirm most of the facts as stated by Sirius, but he doesn't deny them either.

I also think it's hard to read that scene as Peter believing that Sirius was a traitor. Sirius/Lupin suspected each other because information was leaking. Peter didn't have reason to suspect anyone because he knew he was the one doing the leaking (though yes, likely coerced and threatened to do so).

Yes, he was really hiding from the Death Eaters, not Sirius-- because he was guilty of doing the things of which he was accused. So that doesn't help his hypothetical lawyer.

As for the finger, it's not /my/ assumption that he cut it off. It's what Lupin concludes happened when Sirius shows him the photo that proved to him that Peter was at Hogwarts. Sirius then confirms it explicitly, that he did it "just before he blew up the street." I think it's more of a reach to say that Lupin concluded wrongly and Sirius lied than that Peter did it by accident and it just coincidentally made his planned frame job even more perfect.

It's not he said/she said. It's Sirius says one thing that fits the evidence perfectly, and Peter not denying anything in any rational way.

As for not hurting the Weasleys or Harry, the argument made by Lupin/Sirius in the scene is pretty strong: he couldn't be bothered to do it for a wreck of a wizard who'd lost his powers, because he wanted to be on the side of the biggest bully on the playground. No one's arguing that Peter was a Death Eater because he believed in pureblood supremacy. They're arguing that he was willing to side with whichever side was winning because he didn't want to risk dying.

***** ~reads it again~

Hmm...actually, Peter does deny everything. Repeatedly. Even when Sirius keeps talking over him.\\
And I mentioned before, there /isn't/ actually any evidence; the only things known are that Peter was the Secret Keeper, he was at the street when it blew up, and he went into hiding as a rat to evade the Death Eaters. Sirius alleges that Peter willingly revealed the Secret and was a spy all along and caused the explosion, Peter claims that he only revealed the Secret under duress and was never a spy (the street never comes up), and there's no proof of either course of events.

****** Well, yes, technically there are vague denials early on while he grows pale, sweats, and looks at the door. A general "lunacy" is not the same as a specific "no, Sirius says I cut off my finger before I blew up the street, but actually I splinched myself after he blew up the street."

The meat of the conversation though, has this damning exchange:

"You had been passing information to him for over a year before Lily and James died. You were his spy." "He was taking over everywhere. What was there to be gained by refusing him?" Not "I wasn't the spy" but "I didn't see the point of resisting him" which is a REALLY rich thing to say in front of two men who did risk their lives to resist (one of whose mothers should have been exterminated per Voldemort), a kid who was orphaned because his parents resisted (and whose mother should have been exterminated per Voldemort), a kid whose two uncles died because they resisted, and a kid who Voldemort would have killed on sight because she's Muggle born.

No, there's no hard evidence, which is of course the plot device that canonically keeps Sirius on the run until his death. But literally all of the specific testimony and logic swings toward Sirius' version of events. Every time Peter tries to deny something specifically, there's a hole in the story wide enough for Remus to drive the logic-bus through. And he does, because the scene is meant to establish Sirius' innocence and Peter's guilt, and does a pretty decent job of it.

**** What's to stop Peter from spending the rest of his life as a rat in some obscure corner of South Africa? I highly doubt Voldemort would spend that much manpower looking for a rather useless former spy once someone (eventually) resurrected him.

Peter willingly goes to go find him when his life is really not in that much danger anymore than it was for the past 12 years- the testimony of an escaped convict who is still believed guilty by everyone in the wizarding world except 5 people is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I mean Sirius doesn't even go looking for him in GoF! Clearly they all gave him up as a lost cause.

Peter didn't really have to play any more of a part in the conflict if he didn't want to. He could've escaped on a cruise ship to Barbados and lived the rest of his life sipping daiquiris in hotel resorts working on his tan. In fact Voldemort really has a lot to repay Peter for - not that he ever does (or should).
