Near every fic that I read that contains dueling, Harry dodges around like a squirrel on crack. I want, to borrow an RPG term 'tank' Harry. Someone who can shrug off hits like they are nothing or put up hugely powerfully shields. Any fics like would be greatly appreciated. Just no slash please Thanks


** And considering the ridiculous pain tolerance he has in canon this fits him well. And I mean for both physical and mental pain.

You just broke your arm. Would you like to make a dexterity and check to catch the snitch?

The deadliest venom in the world is coursing through your veins. Would you like to make constitution check to pull the fang out and stab the source of your enemy?

A hundred dementors are approaching and you are caught in the aura of despair. Would you like make a willpower check to push through the memories of your parents deaths?

You have pushed through the aura of despair. Would you like to make a morale check to cast a patronus?

You are drowning and being clawed at by over a dozen grindylows. Would you like to make a constitution, dexterity and willpower check to cast the revulsion jinx?

You are under the imperius curse and told to bow. Would you like to make a willpower check to stop yourself from bowing?

You have been hit by the cruciatus curse. Would you like to make a willpower and constitution check to stand back up?

You are locked in a battle of wills. Make a willpower check to make your enemy's wand submit.

And so on.

** Ahh, dodging. Every edgelords greatest weapon, never mind that average joe can and will trip over air while doing something as mundane as walking over a miraculously even patch of asphalt.

*** Also the fact that a large number of spells have no visible beam of light to dodge,just instantaneous effect based on intent. Its especially egregious when edgy super Harry is the first to point out that most wizards are stupid and just stand still when dueling and don't know how to dodge.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane]]. This story has a Harry that fights off incredible pain to keep fighting. It also favors shields over dodging in combat which I prefer because it's honestly a little ridiculous. Spells move fast and I wouldn't be surprised if their paths curve (as they do in the fic) canonically based on a user's intent. At the very least, spells can leave one's wand following a path that's not parallel to the wand on all planes. It's very unlikely that when casting a spell, wizards have to ensure that when their wands are perpendicular to the target on all planes.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
