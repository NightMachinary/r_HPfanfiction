As the title suggests, I am in search of any fics that has a harry that is a fish or aquatic creature in some way. He should preferably live under water but it is not required.


** linkffn(13167664) : Saw this a while ago and didn't read past the first few chapters. I don't think it's particularly well written, but it's probably as close as you will get with a request like that. lol

If you want Harry to be an animal more literally I can send you a link to a newly made and popular fic where Harry is literally a dragon.

  Sweet Summer Sora's The Tide Beckons Response: Harry's always been fascinated with water: to him, it's like a whole other world filled with wonder, mystery and magic. He has no idea how right he is: batten down the hatches: the tide is rising and a maelstrom's coming. Grey Super/OP Haphne: slow burn; Good Dumbledore

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I think I once read a fic where he was a selkie, a creature similar to mermaids in the way that they are magical creatures who can shed their aquatic skin and become beautiful women. Can't remember the title though. I suppose you could just google: Harry Potter is a selkie or something like that along the line.

** "Glug Glug", said Harry, his Emerald Green Orbs and Raven Black Hair, contrasting greatly with his face--that of a deformed goldfish.
