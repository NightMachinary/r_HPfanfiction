Hi,

Recently a fanfic has been popping in my head and I can't seem to find it. I was wondering if anyone could help.

The few details I remember are that Harry takes up his seat in the Wizengamot, he gets tailored robes and makes a comment about the dress code, gets mentored by some of his grandfathers allies, there's a rule book and a payment for either attending a session or the amount of seats owned.

I believe it was on fanfiction.net


** I think the payment for attending sessions thing is pretty specific to the story.
