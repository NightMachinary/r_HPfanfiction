  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** There's a story by femmedefoi on ffn (and ao3 I think) called All Was Well about this! It's a one-shot, so not super long, but it basically gives Harry a happy, fulfilling job at Hogwarts teaching DADA and goes into how he engages with students. Super wholesome.

  The war is over, so where are Harry and Ginny now? Harry's finally settled into a position that's made for him, and Ginny is thriving as a chaser. Life is normal. Life is good. All is well. A one (maybe two) shot on where Harry and Ginny are post-war, inspired by a tumblr post and its responses.

I second [[/u/TimeTurner394]]'s rec, also! Blackboards and Broomsticks is pretty good!

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
