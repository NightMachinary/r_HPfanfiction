I read this one awhile ago and I'm trying to find it again, however I'm not a hufflepuff and am quite lazy, so I'm hoping for some help. Basically Harry/Daphne many years after the war figure out how to go back in time and go back way before their hogwarts time and establish themselves as bounty hunters so they can provide security for the TWT in fourth year. While there they meddle in their younger selves lives to bring them together sooner. I'm fairly certain the title was Harry's new fake name which I think may have been Django, now that I'm writing this I just remembered it of course.

** I've never read this (or even encountered it), but that description makes it sound awesome. Going on the To Read list. Just hope it's not a letdown.
