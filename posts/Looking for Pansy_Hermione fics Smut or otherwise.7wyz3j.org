Something about the pairing just works really well for me. But it can hard to find them sometimes!


** This isn't a fic rec in particular, but all of these at least contain Pansy/Hermione. I can't guarantee it's the main pairing in all of them though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger*s*Pansy%20Parkinson/works][AO3 Relationship Tag]]

** Title: How Soon Is Now? Rating: NC-17 Pairing: Pansy/Hermione Summary: Though the job was never easy, Hermione has never minded being an Unspeakable. However, when Pansy has a problem with a unique magical device invented by her great-great-grandfather, Hermione is sent to investigate. Given their history, Hermione is less than thrilled with the assignment. But when she gets there, nothing is exactly as she expected it: not the Time Spinner, not Pansy, and not even Hermione herself. Warnings: Just in case the pairing and rating didn't clue you in, this fic contains girlsex. Featuring real fictional girls. There are also character deaths that took place before the story began.
