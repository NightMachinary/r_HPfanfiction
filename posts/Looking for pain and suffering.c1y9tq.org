I recently re-watched OOTP, and the scene where Harry's friends see him possessed after the battle really struck me. I'm looking for fics where his friends see him suffer (or die) horribly due to the horcrux connection. Especially their reactions to it. Being tortured with the Cruciatus is also acceptable, so long as his friends are helpless witnesses. I'm particularly interested if it goes into the mental and physical ramifications on Harry and his friends as a result.


** from just reading the headline... your life sounds fun. Everything alright?

** There's a few really good ones I know of, but they're not really what you're looking for.

linkffn(Session Transcripts) is about a Harry that is mentally damaged due to his stay with the Dursleys

linkffn(The Hundred Acre Wood) is about a Harry that is raised abused, mistreated, and brainwashed. Tugs the heartstrings real good, but it's so very beautifully written.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
