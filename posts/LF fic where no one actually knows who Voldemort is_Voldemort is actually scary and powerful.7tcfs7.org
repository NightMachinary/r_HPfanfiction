  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7070526/1/All-Good-Things][All Good Things]] nobody has ever heard of him. We (the readers) don't even know whether he's Riddle or not. There's only one scene with him towards the end. The fic is dead but it's still a really fun read.

** These are ones where voldemort has double identities. One as voldemort and another as a professional under the name of Riddle:

Death of Today;

Dreams and Darkness Collide;

Consuming shadows
