I started reading fanfic a couple years ago and I've gotten to the point where I seem to have read everything of quality. I'm re-reading stuff now and I'm beginning to get bored. What I am looking for are some old stories, maybe that aren't as easily findable as the usual fare on the more popular fanfic sites. I haven't had much luck on my own finding older stuff, so any help would be appreciated. My preferred ships are Remus/Sirius, Remus/Hermione and Sirius/Hermione, but I'm really pretty much ok with anything as long as the ship isn't Snape centric. Thanks very much.


** Well, I don't think I've read a single "quality" story with any of those pairings involved in it, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP 5-Starred and Featured Authors C2]] takes the most highly rated stories (and sometimes other stories from authors with a known habit for producing quality) from a very discerning community and lumps them all together in one location.

Once you've gotten through all of the stories in the C2 and if you find your tastes to be similar to what's in there, check out the Dark Lord Potter forums for all of the stories that didn't quite make a 5 star rating but ended up in the library. Some of them are still excellent.

Once you finish with THAT, the typical progression seems to be writing your own story, or moving on to the Naruto and Dresden Files fandoms - but fair warning, you can devour those in their entirety within a good couple of months. Once again, the Dark Lord Potter forums has links to the best of the best in those fandoms.

*** Yes, I have. I seem to be in the minority of people that didn't enjoy it.

**** Not so small a minority, to be honest. (It's hard to enjoy a story when one finds the author and his antics to be so offputting.)

***** This story was actually painful to read. I never finished it because I read to relax, not think about stuff. I remember it being too complex to be relaxing.

***** There are 100+ page threads devoted to why this story is shitty and why the author is a narcissistic cunt.

Remus/Sirius is in the background in SamStoryteller's excellent tale, [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]].

** Hmm. I dunno about chapter stories but Laurielove on ff.net has a few Sirius/Hermione and Remus/Hermione (mostly kinda smutty). She does mostly Lucius/Hermione and Snape/Hermione so you'll have to sort through that.
