I read a while ago my first Fem!Harry fic (it was Fem!Harry/Hermione) and imagined, what it would be if the Canon happened. So Hermione is with Ron, but shares a very close Bond with her Friend. And during a occasional visit, they catch Fem!Harry with her Lover right in the Act (in my imagination, they open up the Masterbedroom of Grimauld, so what do they expect?! Stupid idea, but also hot). Well, in my Mind, Harry would be rather shy so the whole Situation would leave especially her embarrassed. Rons Reaction would be priceless. Maybe hermione would be attracted/aroused by this....i mean, watching her Friend making Love. Anyway, is there a Fic like this?


** Which fic did you read? The series starting with Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize?
