:END:
Looking for a fic where it's very pureblood.

Female james potter is being courted (I forget by whom but pretty sure it's a slytherin) she is on a date in a cafe when Lily comes in and speaks to her with over familiarity and so does Sirius black... I think?

I know that Lily tries to bond with sirius but it doesn't take as she was not 'pure' (she gave herself to snape)

I thought it might be by Ellory but I still can't find it. Dx
