I've read some where he breaks out a few years early, and fics where he goes on the run with Harry right after J/L's death.

However, I can't remember reading any fics where Sirius breaks out of Azkaban as in canon, and then encounters Harry /before/ he actually starts school.

For example:

- Sirius goes directly to Privet Drive after breaking out that summer and meets Harry.

- Sirius shows up in dog form after Harry leaves his aunt and uncle's house, Harry sees Sirius, Harry falls backwards and sticks out his left arm rather than his right arm, no knight bus arrives, Sirius approaches Harry.

To be honest, I would even take a fic where they met on Halloween night in PoA, or when Sirius broke into the dormitory.

There must be at least a few fics with this premise, right?

  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.

** It's not the main plot of the fic, but that happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power][Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power]]. It also has Slytherin!Harry, HarryxOC, Harry with the Elder Wand and he has elemental powers, but I liked it a lot.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] is the first one you mentioned. God but it really goes off the rails by the sequel. Also it's slash if you aren't a fan of that.
