  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  The Power Paradox; the skills most important to obtaining power and leading effectively are the very skills that deteriorate once we have power.Harry's first encounter with a dementor reveals something about him no one knew, especially not Harry. These new revelations test Harry on his path to find who he is and his role in the world. AU,eventual Slash.

** Forgive my ignorance but why? What will this change? Sirius already tries to act (the best he can) as a responsible adult figure in his life. Did you have in mind him not going to Azkaban? Furthermore what would cause Lily to cheat on James and what aftermath do you want to see?

Sorry for the questioning, but I find this request to be somewhat vague and I'm not sure what you are trying to find from it.

*** I suppose it could do for some worthwhile drama, if you are into that sort of thing. Harry in canon gladly accepts Sirius's fatherly attentions, because he knows there's nothing sinister about them (save perhaps the "James-clone" issue), but how would he react if he learned that Sirius is /actually/ his father --- meaning he betrayed James's trust all the same, meaning Lily cheated on his father? How would he /take/ that? Would he still want anything to do with Sirius if Sirius had kept this from him?

*** It can be done without cheating: Maybe they were in a polyamorous relationship and didn't care who was the biological father.

Or it the many clashes between Snape and Potter, a spell left James impotent and asked Sirius to help produce a child.
