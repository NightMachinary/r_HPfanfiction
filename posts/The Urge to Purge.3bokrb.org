Does it ever happen to you?

You're reading a fic that dissolves into a puddle of angst or common trope and it pushes you over the edge. A seed of cognitive dissonance whispers in your ear: this particular story is stupid, fanfiction is stupid. "No!", you whimper, "I've put to much time into this, I won't accept that it is stupid!". You try to recall the good fics to ward off the dissonance but all the stories have melded into one in your mind. Disgusted with yourself for reading so many terrible 100K+ word stories, you disavow fanfiction. It is dead to you. . . . A week later your rage is quelled and you pick it up again. You start slowly. You stick to oneshots by reliable authors to control your level of disappointment (at least it only took 10 minutes to read). A few good stories heal your wound, but who knows when it could happen again. It's hard to trust now.

So, does that ever happen to you?

Explanation: I read Linkff(Hail Odysseus by Brennus) recently and it sent me into a fanfiction hating spiral. I realize this post of mine, written about being upset over angst stories, is angsty in of itself.


** At this point I just assume I've read every good hp fanfic out there, that way when I stumble across an amazing one I haven't read it's a pleasant surprise. Plus I don't get as disappointed when I start up a new story and it turns out not that great because that's about what I expected it to be.

** Sorry, linkffn(Hail Odysseus by Brennus). I haven't had time to implement linkffn for OP yet, it only works in the comments for now.

Additionally, read the docs at the end of a bot reply - it's linkff*/n/*, not linkff, and there are a few neat tricks you can pull (such as multiple sites, increasing search accuracy results, etc).

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Ugh. I was reading a multi pairing fic. it has like 40+ chapters and over 100k words. I got to around 20 and had to stop..

It just got so awful. I got tired of reading about Harry pleasing his two wives and showing up Dumbledore every damn chapter. Jesus ENOUGH already urggghh.

** Yes. At that point, I write. My writing is pretty terrible -- I'd probably only qualify at 90th percentile of fan fiction -- but I at least avoid the problems I most hate.

** I'm always so dissappointed in fan fiction that I've just written my own. Everyone once in a while, I'll think "hm, wouldn't it be nice to read something without the effort of writing it myself?" but I'm always disappointed. I've found a couple authors I like, but that's it. Good Harry Potter fan fiction is near impossible to find.

So true. My problem is that I can't write. I tried it a couple of times as a teen, but it was awful and that was in my native language. In English I have no chance.

**** This is only a personal experience, but I know for a fact that while my writing is probably terrible in my native language, in english, if I may so myself, I'm at least bearable :D So give it a try. My problem with writing fanfics is mainly that I write down like 5k or a bit more and then my steam runs out. And while I know exactly what I want to write, it just doesn't come out for some reason. It's pretty damn annoying to be honest :)

***** Probably I'll give it a try. I don't want to publish it, but it would be a good exercise. A couple of comments here on reddit nowhere near enough to improve my English, so I need to write something, why not fanfiction?

** Yes, it happens and it happens often.

Its the curse that comes with not having an editor.

I knew what I'm getting into when I started, so disappointment was never an issue. I just deleted the bookmark and carried on.

** All the time. I have just two favorites and sometimes I try to find something interesting, but I can't. They are so unbelievably bad, that after a couple of hours of searching, I usually give up. Stupid storylines aside, why like so many people gratuitous violence?
