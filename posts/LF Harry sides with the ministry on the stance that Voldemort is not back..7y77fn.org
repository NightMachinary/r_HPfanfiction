Looking for any fics were Harry figures that the people can be sheep when not presented with the whole truth and he doesn't want to try and be a failing shepherd. Hopefully he realizes that people will eventually figure out Voldemort has returned so in the mean time he keeps quiet or sides with Fudge to gain influence and possibly gets himself training. Let me know if any such fics exist. Thanks!


** I do kinda get it. From an outsiders perspective, yeah, it's hard to believe Harry.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** This would be an interesting idea! What if Harry himself goes into denial, because he's just a normal kid who wants a normal life, so he starts freaking out and lying to himself about how it wasn't real, or a trick, or something, and then there could be this amazing Dumbledore friendship plot where he tries to get Harry to accept the truth and tells him about his past and they get closer?!

** The Thorny Rose Trilogy, since Voldemort's resurrection was prevented. He convinces almost everyone that he killed Voldemort for good in the battle at the Ministry, letting them finish off the Horcruxes in peace.
