Im looking for fics where harry seeks asylum in another country for whatever reason (Before trial for underage magic, because of voldemort etc) bonus if he drags sirius with him. No slash for MC please


** "The Great Escape" by blakekeane had this, but it seems to have been deleted. There's a copy to be found here:

[[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=175472]]

But it's more about the "getting the fuck out of Britain" part.

There's also this, where he wants to start his own island:

and in a similar vein:

**** Absolutely. Stuff like this really takes the narrative far away from canon, which can be bad, yet I'm always disappointed when characters learn about magic but then are satisfied with Wingardium Leviosa and household charms. It's fucking magic goddamnit, show some imagination! I want my own planet please!

I think that's why I like the protagonist of HPMOR because he immediately goes like "WHOA! This is insane. How can I use this to break reality as I understand it right now and do the impossible?"

***** Is that HP and the Methods of Rationality fic? I think I started it years ago, but don't remember much. I do like when characters poke and prod and bend and break the supposed laws of magic, because it's magic..

  A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.

** Are you fine with it being unofficial? Like Harry escaping to another country and staying there without going through any "official" channels?

Because in that case my story "Dawn of Darkness" might be something to you. The Ministry, seeing its continued existence threatened, decides to step up security, Harry ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, Tonks breaks him out and they escape to the mainland.

** linkffn(World Enough and Time) - Krum helps Harry (and Sirius!) attain political asylum in Bulgaria during GoF. It's listed as a slash fic but honestly romance plays no part in it until the epilogue.

** Working on it, first I have to read through them a bit to see if they're any good. Do you have anything against the usual Manipulative Dumbledore, Good Goblins, tropes? so far there's 1 with and 1 without.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/11/Common-Sense]] This one is a one-shot, Harry goes to America after the dementor attack*Edit, it's not quite a one-shot, it's 4 chapters, 11-14 are the chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10884026/2/Broken-Wand-Broken-Chains]] this one has the manipulative!dumbledore, Harry is Super Rich Heir of Ancient and Noble House, the works.

I've found a few more, one where Harry's seeking asylum due to Marriage Law, but also a few where he and Sirius run away, but haven't started reading them yet, so no idea what the tropes/clich√©s are in them.
