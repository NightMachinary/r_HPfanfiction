I read a surprisingly good fix that had harry and Cedric becoming lovers through the trauma of the tournament. They both knew it wasn't healthy, but were so scared of dying they needed the comfort to make it through. Does anyone know the one I'm talking about? I can't remember the name


** I can think of a couple that fit that. Just to help me narrow it down, what site did you read it on, and do you remember anything specific from the fic? Even a scene or two would help.

*** In the first task, Fleur was nearly killed and Krum was badly burned. Harry survived through sheer luck and Moody manipulating things. I can't remember which site, I think it was archive of our own, not sure. I'll take any recommendations even if they aren't the story I'm looking for

**** I went through the first seven pages on ao3 (cedric/harry tag, sorted by word count) basically doing page searches for that scene but couldn't find one with it. I'll try again a little later and report back if someone doesn't find it by then. Have some conciliatory fics instead. Hopefully some will be new to you!
