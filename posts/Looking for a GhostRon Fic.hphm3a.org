:END:
Ron dies in the Battle of Hogwarts. He might have joined Harry in the forest. I think Percy was dead, too, and they argue a lot.

No one can see Ron - he can only influence people through dreams. He tries to get Harry to ask Ginny out, but Harry gets confused and starts dating another redheaded girl instead.

The story was on FFN.

  After helping defeat Voldemort, Ron finds himself not only dead, but a ghost. Worse, his brother Percy had died unbeknownst to the family a year earlier. Worse still, they've been sentenced to spend the next century together. Will they survive?
