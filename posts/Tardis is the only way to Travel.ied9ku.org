I just found out that TardisistheonlywaytoTravel seems to have deleted his fics and profile on both AO3 and FF.

Some will remember him as the author of stories such as the Uncrowned Lord of Azkaban and This is Not the Chosen One You're Looking For.

My request : Does anybody have copies of his work saved and would they be willing to send them


** That's a shame. According to a thread on [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]], their last author's note said:

“Author Note: Greetings, readers! Please do not link to or review my fanfic on Goodreads! I didn't think it needed to be said, but apparently it does. I am really, really serious about this! When I write fanfic I expect it to stay in the fanfic sphere - if this keeps happening I may reconsider posting fanfic at all, that is how seriously I take this. So please stop”

So that might have something to do with it.

Here's a link to their account from the Way Back Machine but it doesn't seem like it works for all of their fics.

** This isn't really what you asked for, but it's near enough. [[https://archive.org/details/AO3_story_dump_continuing][Here]] is a backup of the entire archive, as of march 2019. It's around 300gb(only a 3gb download though) of plaintext files, but you could just download the database file, search for the stories that you want, and then download the zip file that they are in.
