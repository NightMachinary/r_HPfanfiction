I really liked the concept but after a few chapters I couldn't put up with how pretentious it felt and how seriously it took itself. However, I really enjoyed the logical/scientific aspect.

Is there something similar but a bit more, um, light-hearted ?

Edit: I still think HPMOR is great, it's just not for me!

***** I agree! I felt like it had potential, but everything spiralled into "Hermione is an unmatched genius and everyone /adores/ her even though she's terrible to them." Her emotional responses are so shallow, and the character is so fixated on "common sense"/"logical" choices that it starts to verge on psychopathy (imo). I've more-or-less kept up with it (I'm in this deep, might as well finish), and lately [[/spoiler][she's an appallingly horrible girlfriend on top of her usual lack of empathy---she insists on making choices she decides are objectively best rather than accounting for anyone's feelings on the matter, even hers, and she's clearly out of touch with her own emotions (or lacks depth of emotion altogether)]]. She also spends the series weirdly aware of her own age, like "I'm only 15 so I'll defer to my parents" or "I'm 17 and too young to decide whether I'm in love with my boyfriend of several years." It's... creepy. Teenagers just /don't act like that/, regardless of smarts or relative maturity.

I actually don't mind godlike problem-solving in fics---I often even enjoy it when characters are made talented enough to fix all the problems of canon and live happily ever after. But Hermione in this fic is just... so inhuman.

It deals a lot with the frustrations of not being taken seriously because "you're just a child" but then overcompensating into arrogance and one dimensional thinking.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) followed by its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel) is probably what you're looking for.

This story is about Hermione instead of Harry but it basically shows her as a mathematical prodigy, which translates into a master arithmancer (basically spellcrafter) when she gets into Hogwarts. On the whole, it goes through her seven years in where she is even cleverer and more logical than she is in canon. She uses her mathematical and scientific skills to explore many elements of magic (mostly spellcrafting) similar to HPMOR.

For example, she creates spells out of scientific knowledge like curses to [[/spoiler][cause heart attack]], she explores with atom rearrangement to [[/spoiler][turn carbon into diamond]], she uses a lot of arithmancy to [[/spoiler][work out Gamp's sixth law]], and much more. The way many elements of magic work are also shown. For example the logic behind the way the trace works, or how wands are made. The theory behind other subjects like ancient runes or alchemy are also shown.

Overall, it's pretty light-hearted. I would say it is quite similar to canon in how it starts off for kids but slowly gets darker as the series progresses. Honestly one of my favorites stories I've ever read.

p.s I swear I've seen the author on this subreddit before, but I can't really remember.

I think there's a difference between a scientific/logical fic and a fic featuring a scientist or a logical person. The Arithmancer is great, but it's pretty conventional in terms of story telling and not exceptionally scientific or logical. Is The Big Bang Theory scientific/logical?

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

** linkffn(8484470) - Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy.

Magnificent world-building, the author's prose is - from both story-telling and purely technical points of view - amazing, and it manages the exremely rare feat of writing convincingly clever characters. (Most 'clever' characters are just the author's idea of what a smart person is like, a phenomenon Stephen Fry has been exploiting for /years/.)

It also makes entire sense of horcruxes, the prophecy, the Mother's-Love-Protection, the Manipulative Dumbledore trope, the Lapis Philosophorum, wandlore, British Wizarding Society, time travel vice time-turning, legilimency, pensieves, House Elf 'enslavement', spell-crafting, the Fifth Exception To Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and many, many other things.

It also implicitly blames the rise of Voldemort on the Daily Mail, which got an honest-to-goodness belly-laugh out of me.
