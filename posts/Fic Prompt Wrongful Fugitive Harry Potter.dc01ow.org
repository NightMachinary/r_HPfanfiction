For this prompt, I imagine it to embody a twist on the cliche Azkaban!Harry fics, in which after defeating Voldemort (or before hand in Twin!BWL circumstances) Harry is wrongfully put in Azkaban. For a Fugitive!Harry, I've been yearning for an ''innocent'''(or not guilty of the crime assigned to him) Harry Potter who finds out about his upcoming arrest and incarceration, and decides to flee to the muggle world or flee to the back alleys of Knockturn under a hidden identity to work his way up from peanuts. This could be a homeless!Harry Potter fic, in the beginning, before he manages, through blood, sweat, tears and effort, to climb up to having a somewhat stable income and abode, experiencing character growth and perhaps magical growth (e.g. starvation!magic for when he's homeless, or a development of rudimentary wandless magic throughout the need via lacking a wand, or being unable to use the wand due to the trace being used to find him in order to bring him 'home'). It would be interesting to have an unexpected character orchestrate this, instead of Hermione&Ron!bashing or evil Slytherins, maybe someone unexpected drawn into a new light; I've yet to see too much exploration into the idea of a dark!Seamus&Dean or a dark!Luna, at least not well written. For example, murkybluematter from Pureblood Pretence used an unexpected antagonist to bring mystery to a genre in which most readers already know all of the primary antagonists, such as>! Lee Jordan!< as one of the first villainous characters, instead of say Quirrel or Dumbledore. But, that's simply an example, for those who might be stuck! Of course, if you've thought of a better antagonist, go full throttle.

If a fic like this already exists, I'd be chuffed if you'd link it, and if you decide to write it, by all means link it here as well.


** I'd definitely read this. Doesn't even have to be Harry for me though. Could be any character, or even an OC
