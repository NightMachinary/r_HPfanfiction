hello.

i'm writing a hp history textbook, and would like eyes on the work and interested collaborators.

[[https://write.as/cuthbert-binns/]]

written from the perspective of binns and hermione granger (who is the obvious pick for social justice oriented academic), this textbook seeks to explore hp problems that have always bothered me.
