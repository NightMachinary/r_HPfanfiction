  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

** Nightmares of Futures Past starts with Harry having just killed Voldemort, and then wandering through the empty ruins of Hogwarts; practically everyone and everything else is already dead by that point. You can't get it from FFN anymore, though; the most complete version I know of is the PDF/eBook on [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Github]].

linkffn(The Imposter Complex) starts with the Diary having just been created and snarking at the original.

And [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] starts by talking about how the ancients collected magic in places like Stonehenge, whose function has been largely forgotten, until Harry, while visiting one, "was set stumbling toward a fateful meeting with a decidedly ancient piece of stone very much harder than his head" and turned into a large and absurdly overpowered dragon.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** I have a bit of a soft spot for linkffn(Harry Potter and the Proof of Concept). It's nothing groundbreaking, it mostly just recaps the intro to Philosopher's Stone, but I really like how it handles it: it focuses on the points where the story diverges from canon while briefly summarising the things that are broadly the same. In fairness, that's probably a fairly common approach, but I can't remember ever actually seeing it anywhere else, and I like where the story seems like it was going.

  The Dursleys resolved to have as little involvement, positive or negative, in Harry's life as possible, and when he finally receives his Hogwarts letter, Harry isn't what people were expecting: intelligent, calculating, and proud, Harry is set to take the wizarding world by storm, starting by building a group of worthwhile friends.

** Will promote my own fledgling fic, I suppose. linkao3(Harry Potter, Grandson of God)

The premise is that Lily is the daughter of God, so Harry is God's grandson, and by the way a whole bunch of mythology is "true" for a given value of it. To set the tone of the fic, Lily parallels the seven words of Jesus on the cross.

I would appreciate comments on whether this first chapter is sufficiently engaging by these standards.

  Harry Potter was raised to be a “Christian”, but the Dursleys don't practice what they preach. When his Hogwarts letter comes, he is thrust into a wizarding world where angels, demons, and pagan gods fight in the shadows for influence over the world. A lighthearted, irreverent romp through a world where all myths are true, Hermione Granger met her first demon at six years old, and Ronald Weasley really wishes his brothers would stop showing off.
