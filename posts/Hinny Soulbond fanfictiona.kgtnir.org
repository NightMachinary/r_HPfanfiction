Hey, I wanna find some Hinny Soulbond fanfics, anyone have any good one I should try out?


** The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs is the best I've ever read, but be warned: it's good for the first 15-20 chapters or so. After that, it takes a sharp nosedive in quality.

Sadly, that's not unusual.

*** I second this story, although I think it's a fantastic story all around. I reread it at least 2 times a year, though, so I may be biased lol

**** It lost me when they started hitting thirteen-fourteen... I won't say why exactly because of spoilers, but I think you might be able to guess why.

​

I'm not a fan of those particular tropes, because I don't think they usually get written well...

However, glad you enjoyed it! Different strokes for different folks!

***** Oh no, I totally understand. The story isn't meant for everyone. I just like it ‘cause it's one of those few stories that can make me cry, but then again everything else I've read by Darth Marrs does that as well lol!

** If you haven't already read it, linksiye([[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833&textsize=0&chapter=1][https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833&chapter=1]]) does a good job of writing all the Weasleys as fleshed-out individuals, with realistic reactions to Ginny suddenly sharing all her thoughts and feelings with a boy they've only just met. There's both merit and mistakes in each of their approaches.
