**** I think the OG Harry/Tonks fic(series) had them the same age. Look up the R-series if you want a complete 7-books fanfic series.

Quite a few of the more popular ones decrese the age gap, which IMO is poor taste since it usually leads to romance too early to be believable. I can buy Harry and Tonks getting together in HBP, but GoF feels too early unless you make her Fleur's age or younger (and even that is a stretch).

**** Age changes can get annoying though. I really hate it when fics put Bellatrix and James in the same year when she was 9 years older and therefore finished Hogwarts before he even started. Narcissa had two years overlap, Andromeda could if she was the older twin of Narcissa (it is never stated when she was born, only that she is the middle sister).

So, okay, fair.

Let me addendum that to “Especially given, in the magical world, you ‘can' reasonably live to be 140; unless you die in a war.”

That's a nice rule of thumb for who would be too young, in school kid ages. But it falls flat when you get to particularly high numbers. Of course, if everyone is a consenting adult, what does it matter?

**** Or why such relationships would be doomed to fail.

I mean sure, in 9/10 cases it would not last and it ~7/10 it would not be a healthy relationship, but you can write about the tenth case as long as you acknowledge the issues which come with such an age difference (and magic, especially apparation, make LDS very easy).

**** It's a lot more common for young women to go for men who are older that themselves. Besides, a 17 year old Fleur is mature and of age. She's not a child. A young woman would usually not be interested in boys younger than themselves, as boys are slower to mature than girls. That's why Fleur/Harry and Tonks/Harry doesn't make sense to me
