  It is said that convictions are more dangerous foes of truths than lies. What if the tale of the wizarding world wasn't the truth, but merely an interpretation of it? What if a single spark, instigated a man to do what was right, than what was easy? Starts at the end of fifth year. AU. [Elements from Fate/ Stay night] [Rated for Dark, mature themes]

*** This is an... interesting recommendation.

I kinda thought that part of the fun of libriomancy was pulling recognizable things from real-world books. Harry starts off this way, but then the fic takes a deep dive into made-up fantasy/ gamer porn books and magazines. Not only do we lose the connection to anything he pulls out of these, but then we have 11 year old Harry and Hermione banging constantly which is not very realistic and not really something I like having mentioned all the time in a fic.

It also kinda ignores all of the rules that it breaks. He resurrects his parents, but doesn't think to resurrect anyone else. He seems desperate to use the lolliblade to de age people, and yet has easier access to pure shapeshifting which can accomplish the same ends with ways fewer downsides.

Anyway, I gave it a shot and it was entertaining for a while, but I don't think it's for me.
