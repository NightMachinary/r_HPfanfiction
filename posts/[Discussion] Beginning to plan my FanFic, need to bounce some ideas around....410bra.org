So over the past few days I've been thinking about writing some fanfic from the Harry Potter universe. I want to follow as much of the real canon as possible, and I've been plunging into the wiki and such. The real issue I am running into is making my character for the stories unique. The character is already going to have some quirks that make them stand out, mainly dealing with some unintended consequences of spacial/dimensional magic (better to explain that via story.) But past that, I am trying to determine the following:

1) Is a half-breed/quarter-breed/etc too overdone? I know there are a few examples in the books (flitwik, fleur, Lorcan D'eath) but as far as tropes, is it overused? And if it is/isnt, what are the most overused or underused of it? This of course would be an intelligent being mixed with a human.

2)Stumbling blocks with a wand/magic/etc. I don't want some overpowered wand, and while the character will have some sort of 'destiny' or goal/problem/whatever later, Outside of being quite intelligent (for reasons to later be described, they aren't a hermione copypasta) they're pretty clueless as far as magic is concerned. I was going to go with a Unicorn Hair core, but what wood would work?

3) Using the canon characters. I wanna have them involved lightly, save for teachers who of course have to be there. Otherwise, do you think keeping them sort of to the backdrop like the original star wars characters in the new movie were is a good idea?

And lastly for now, what is the consensus as far as similarities between our world and the harry potter world? I figure relations between muggles might be different as there is a wizarding community behind the scenes, but as far as pop culture, references, etc, would they be similar or the same?


** 1. Yes, way too overdone. AFAIK we know that Filius has some goblin ancestry and that Fleur's grandmother was a veela. We don't know enough to infer the rest of what you've assumed to be true. [If JKR has spoken ex cathedra on this, someone please chime in.]

2. I trust your central conflict is more well defined than a 'goal/problem/whatever.' Use whatever wood you like. Native woods might be more lore friendly, but you could also try something foreign for a bit more flavour.

3. It could be. But be careful about trying to run the Stations of The Canon. It can turn off readers.

4. Most wizards are wholly ignorant of Muggle culture, so wouldn't understand many references. One of their foremost experts can't pronounce electricity and doesn't understand what a rubber duck is for. Unless you want to break canon lore, you'd probably be best steering clear of Muggle pop culture references.

To elaborate on [[/u/MacsenWledig]] 's point, if you do plan on having canon events go off on schedule... it might be best to simply gloss over it. AKA... the 'troll incident' could be handled by the person next to your main character at breakfast the next day asking him/her if they heard about it... don't feel the need to have the OC *be there/be involved* More to establish time-frame than a major plot point.

** There is an entire [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][Pottermore article]] about wand woods and another about [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-cores][Wand Core]]. You can use the wood and core that matches the closest with your character.

As for pop culture, Wizards and Muggles have different pop culture. The books briefly mention Wizarding comics, singers and fairy tales. Pure-bloods would only get Wizarding pop culture, Muggleborns would only get Muggle pop culture and half bloods would know a bit of both.

Also do remember that the books take place in 1990s United Kingdom, so if a Muggleborn makes a Muggle pop culture reference make sure it makes sense with the setting. So no American Football reference, for example, because no one outside of the US gives a shit about that sport.

** I won't go as far to say pop culture references shouldn't be used at all, because that's an utterly daft assertion, but if you do use references, they should only be used by muggleborn or muggle-raised characters. And if they use them in front of purebloods or wizard-raised halfbloods, they should be met with confusion, because the muggle world and the magical world are entirely different. For example: if we're talking about the trio, only Harry or Hermione should make reference to whatever it is you're making reference to, and Ron shouldn't understand what they're talking about, unless your fic features a Ron who has spent a significant amount of time in the muggle world.

I suppose the rule is inverted if you want to include wizarding pop culture, but there's not a lot mentioned in canon, so you'd mostly have to make it up as you go along.

As for using canon characters, it depends on your priorities: If you aren't concerned with low readership, then you probably don't need any canon characters at all. But it's very rare for a fic that doesn't feature any notable character from canon in some capacity, to get widespread recognition.

As long as you don't make a wand super unique sounding, you're fine. Remember, Harry's wand is actually pretty normal and is only special in context of its brother wand and the specific phoenix who donated its feather core, not because of some super-OP core material. Once you start using manticore scales and some bullshit Merlin-blessed wood or something or another, that's when you run into problems with OP wands.

Being a half-breed isn't a problem unless it makes things too convenient for the protagonist (Veela Harry and suddenly being able to seduce every woman he ever meets), or becomes an endless, exhausting source of angst (Werewolf/Vampire protagonist who spends every other paragraph complaining about how cold and empty his/her life is).

That's all I've got, hope I've helped some.

** 1) I agree with an earlier poster. Unless you have a skill you need you character to have (vampire speed, etc), or unless you want to explore the restricted rights or others troubles a part human would have in the pureblood dominated wizarding world, avoid the half breed stuff. Do it for a reason, not just for kicks and giggles or to make your character unique.

2) Any wand wood is fine. Stick to a type mentioned in the books, and describe it by color later, then ignore. The wand is a tool, and if you don't want it to be a super wand, don't take time describing it in depth. Olivanders description and then a "wow cool I have a wand" scene would be plenty. If it's a longer series you could have him reminisce after a few years about all he has gone through with his wand, and the nicks and scratches that have accumulated.

3) The golden trio were pretty isolated in the books. Mention the events they deal with f your character is around for them. (Basilisk fear, joining the DA, etc) , but don't bother going in depth unless your character has a part to play in it. That said, if he isn't a part of the HP Canon plots, it may decrease your readership if it's during the same timeframe. Unless you have a solid plotline for your OC to be involved in.

4) Muggleborns make references early, but pureblood don't get them. They stop early on so they don't get made fun of. In a muggleborn heavy group/gathering Muggle pop culture may come back in in the first few years, but by year 5-7 they won't be up on Muggle pop culture, and will be so far removed from it they won't make many, if any, references to it.

** 1. Not overdone in my experience, but something you have to be careful with. There are a ton of crappy vampire Harry fics out there, but not many half-creatures.

2. The wood only has a significance if you state one. Just use any kind of wood...and don't use Yggdrasil. So damn overused.

3. So this is going to be a story of mostly OCs? Those are rarely done well. Not saying you won't be able to, just saying it will likely be much more difficult. Also, a HP fanfic without many HP characters will likely diminish interest if that matters to you.

4. Pop culture references are just another thing that can be done well or poorly. I'd use them sparingly at best.

** 1. Pop culture has no place in HP. None.

2. Part-Humans isn't something I've really seen a lot. I'd say go for it if that is what you want to explore, don't do it if you're just trying to be different.

3. Super unique wands is a horrible cliche. Unicorn hair in birch/oak or something is fine and normal, there shouldn't be a big focus on the wand. One of the things DH is hated most for is making a more powerful wand. A wand should be a wand, all that matters is that it's properly matched.

Edit: If you'd like to workshop ideas you should join us on the IRC it works well for this.

I disagree... sort of..? I think it's not *"NO!"* but rather *"Do your bloody research, and then use it sparingly"*

I think there's *some* room for some 90's nostalgia references /while in the muggle world or interacting with muggleborn/

But, mostly, I think that wizarding kids are going to have their own pop culture references that would come up instead. The Weird Sisters comes to mind, as does the local quiditch match.

What has no place in a HP fanfiction is what we often see done instead where a reference to *current* pop culture or American stuff is used instead of an appropriate 90's British reference.

  Do not make your first HP fanfiction OC-heavy -- it will almost certainly not end well.
#+end_quote

I think it's a bit more complicated than that... A fic centered on an OC will have a different set of stumbling blocks than one centered on the canon cast.

Specifically, it's a lot harder to make readers give a crap about your OC. You have to be careful not to make them too good at <thing>, and other common pitfalls... But on the upshot, you can have them act however you want because we have no expectations of them.

On the other hand, running the canon cast gives you all sorts of characterization baggage that people will probably get cranky over if you get wrong (AKA Act Out of Character). But that's also the good news: You have a lot of the heavy lifting done for you characterization design-wise.

It comes down to what the author feels they need the biggest assist on. If they feel like matching canon characterization is going to be their biggest struggle vs. if they feel like making an interesting protagonist from scratch would be harder for them.

*I agree with you however that I think for /most/ people, designing a good cast of OCs is going to be the harder option.* For a first timer, it might be easiest to try writing a short oneshot that involves a canon character or two and a minor OC and see whats easier to write?
