Looking for fics with self harm - ideally Harry or Hermione - with a mentor, ideally Snape but I'm open to anything well written. I've read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones][Digging for the Bones]] and very much liked both for the portrayal of self-harm/suicidality and the hurt/comfort element associated with it (the former more because Snape is rather more in character). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7397234/1/Caught][Caught]] is also a good example, though incomplete.

Does anyone know of any other fics like this?

Many thanks in advance!

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE

** I've read several but am completely blanking on the titles.

However not to be totally useless, Potions & Snitches has a Self-Harm warning tag for their stories. Potion and Snitches is a Snape & Harry Gen archive (no HP/SS slash) that features stories where Snape is Harry's mentor, guardian or parent, to name a few. You could browse through the stories there to see if anything sounds interesting.

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=class&type_id=2&classid=34][Link for completed stories with the Self-Harm warning.]]
