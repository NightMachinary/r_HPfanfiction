I used to be pretty into SSHG and realized recently that I don't like it anymore. However, I really enjoyed the first half of When A Lioness Fights, before the romantic part starts. In this fic Hermione takes over as the Order's spy in the Death Eaters and Hermione receives behind-the-scenes assistance from Snape. I like the dynamic of Snape and Hermione being intellectual equals where she is able to learn deception or other skills from him, and he comes to respect her. I was wondering if there are fics that explore this dynamic that do not turn romantic or sexual*. I have read Applied Cultural Anthropology so please don't rec this.

*I am okay with this ONLY if they are >10 years out of school, but would prefer no romance at all.


** Linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) has a great mentor!Snape, but it hasn't been updated for a while and might be abandoned. My fic, linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) also has mentor!Snape. It's fairly old (for me) so the writing isn't quite up to my current standards.

To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione.

** There's some of this, though it's not the focus, in Blindness, which was removed from the book club.
