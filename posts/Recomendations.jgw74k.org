I'm looking for some fanfictions where harry learns magic from D&D and other RPGs.I have already read Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts, as well as Harry Potter, the ArchMagus.


** have you searched these keywords in the sub? I feel like this gets asked a lot so you might have more luck that way

**** huh. weird. I'm on an iPhone, so maybe that's the difference but when I click on the search bar it has â€˜r/HPfanfiction' within the bar, and it searches within the sub.

Maybe if you type that in first? I'm a bit of a newb, so sorry I can't be more helpful

**** When you use the search bar there should be an option after you press enter to search inside the HPfanfiction subreddit.

I think you have to be on the HPfanfiction side to get that option.
