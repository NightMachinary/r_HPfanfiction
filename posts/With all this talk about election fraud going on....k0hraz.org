How difficult do you think it would be for a small, well organized group of wizards to change the outcome of a major muggle election in the HP-verse?

Assuming that it's a known problem that both the magical and the magic aware parts of the muggle government are actively working on preventing, it could be a not completely trivial.

Both the magical government and the meddlers would run into serious issues with scale, there's soooo many more muggles than wizards it becomes impossible to keep an eye on / mess with all polling places.

Electronic voting machines could make it significantly easier to alter a large number of votes if compromised, but they would also be harder to manipulate magically than simple paper. If the attackers had the required tech know how, an invisible usb thumb drive with malware could do the trick.

With paper ballots there'd be centuries worth of spells available and it'd be way easier to subtly manipulate one, but scaling it up to millions of modified ballots with a small available workforce while also staying undetected could be challenging.

Messing with muggle politics could be an interesting thing to do especially in time travel fics with alternate history elements.


** Step 1: Imperius the head of the Murdoch empire.

Step 2: Complete.

*** But there are ways to counteract imperius curse like the thieves downfall. Who is to say Ministry of Magic does not have a similar thing?

In my opinion it would be much harder to rig an election in the wizarding world since they are not a true democracy but an Oligarchy. A military coup is more likely to happen and sucseed easily due to smaller population.

**** They probably do, but given that the Minister of Magic visited the Prime Minister once, and only in exigent circumstances afterwards, I doubt they're passing muggle leaders through it. Magical leaders of course, are a different story.

** Why rig the vote when you can just imperious the candidate you dislike to sabotage his own campaign, maybe dose him up with love potion when he goes to meet some children.

Waste of time of course, it's much easier to just seize control of whoever wins.

** I'm not sure why they'd really want to, when a simple imperius would suffice to render the outcome meaningless.

I think electronic voting machines would be incredibly vulnerable, given that a simple confundment charm would suffice, but I hardly think this is the step of the process to target.

Vote counting data from counties is usually integrated (in the US at least) at a state level, I'd simply confund the data being processed. Confunding/imperiusing any election oversight should smooth over any issues that result. I'm sure people would eventually have questions, but bipartisan elections are usually close (as naturally follows given the winner take all system in the US), and any deviation from polls and expected results can usually be chalked up to sampling uncertainty, some last minute event, shifting demographics, etc.

Alternatively, you could just imperius the required people to simply ignore the vote counting process and get an official result declared.

** Honestly is difficult. Wizards need the think they have more disadvantage on... Numbers. Elections are one of those things were the power of the sheer number of things is hard to overturn.

So, unless we are talking about an election on a small country, doing significant impact by attacking in individual vote stations (where theirs skills are easier to go undetected) is not going to work.

They need to attack the sum, not the individual ballots. And even that is difficult now days. They would need to have powerful connections and timing to alter sum of locations before being noticed. Especially with the internet... People might have already seen results before the wizards modify them... It would be easy for some side to claim irregularities and... The problem of attacking the election high in the counting chain is that their plan falls apart in recounts unless they pull the same thing all over again.

So US as an example. They cannot make a significant impact by attacking individual polls or stations... There was a 6 million votes difference there. And, if they attack up, let's say they try to modify the vote totals of Pennsylvania... Dude the amount of observe es and workers they need to obliviate...

*** Just attack the candidates themselves, far more cost efficent, unless you have a witch or wizard in each state that can target the major voting centers.

Targeting the top is where magic is the most effective and why a wizard muggle war would always go to the wizards, they can control the narrative to a tea. Imperio, Polyjuice etc are exellent for guerilla tactics

*** Now consider that any highly important site (like the Philadelphia ballot counting place which flipped PA) would probably be guarded by MACUSA aurors too. It'd definitely be a tough challenge.

Maybe invisibly break into Facebook, get the right people to give up passwords and forget about it afterwards, and somehow get someone to modify the algorithm to promote certain political beliefs? That could have a noticeable effect on a global scale.

**** Efforts would certainly be more effective focused in communication pre election. On effective votes the easiest thing they could do would be to infiltrate the post office ... But yeah, unsure if they could get the man power to modify enough votes.

** According to what we saw in Canon, it would be difficult. While powerfull, Magic is rather limited in scope, and it is doubtfull that the impact of one wizard would go beyond one polling station (which is pretty laughable when trying to influence one country).

For a country such as the USA, which has some pretty specific rules for its elections, it "may" be possible to influence the result of an election by only targeting strategic places (such as Major voting pole of Swinging States). But even there, the task seem very difficult, especially if both the Muggle and Magical authorities know about the risk of fraud and are trying to prevent it. Not to mention that it would need an amazing level of cooperations from the wizards (with tens, if not hundreds of them in the plot).

I think it would be a lot easier for the Magicals to influence that campaign rather than the elections. A confundus Charm right before a meeting so one candidat makes a fool of himself in front of cameras, a Memory charm before a debate so he doesn't know what to say . . . Wizards have a lot of way to "ruin" a campaign, and while this method is more risky that election (their guy could still loose), it can be used by a very limited team of wizard (technically, the plan could even be carried out be someone alone).

*** i mean, you could just imperio the candidates during important events and the deal is done, you make the winner who you choose, but even then it gets meaningless because a wizard or witch could just imperio the leader.

It isn't hard for a group of focused mages to choose who leads a country, as long as pepole with the same powerset opposes them.
