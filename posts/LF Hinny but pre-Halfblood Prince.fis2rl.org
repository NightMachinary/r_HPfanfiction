Written or taking place before the events of Halfblood Prince. Most Hinny stories happen during book 6, DH, or post Hogwarts. I'd really like to read a story where they get together before all that, like a an AU or Canon Divergence. Preferably with no Romione pairing but I can tolerate it if it's more in the background/off to the side kind of thing. Also not anything rated M. Anyone have anything like that for me?


** Unfortunately, most of them are soul-bond stories and most of them fail the first basic test of the fanfiction reader ... “Is the author channelling his hidden paedophilia?”. Otherwise, I have just commented on them on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/esfdz4/lf_resist_being_chosen_as_mate/fkjy0xl/]]

*** Oh ok. Thanks for letting me know. I may have to write one myself then. Hmm...
