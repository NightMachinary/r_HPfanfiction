So yeah, I don't think she ever personally met the dursleys throughout the books. Considering the amount of effort she went into stopping Skeeter from making articles about Harry, I think she'd at least do something to get him out of Little Whinging. Bonus points if she's as brutal to them as she was to Umbridge, Marietta and Skeeter.


** I think there's a chapter dedicated to it in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388837/1/Adorable-Violence]]).

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

Be warned of two things: rampant comedic insanity; and more to the point that Harry is merely a supporting character. He's not particularly more prominent in this story than Ron, Neville, or, indeed, Dumbledore past a certain point.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?
