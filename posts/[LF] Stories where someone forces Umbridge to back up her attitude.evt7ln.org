I recently reread linkffn ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side]])

And really want to see another story where someone makes Umbridge realize that she can't really back up pretty much any of her beliefs..


** I have a lot of problems with linkffn(8490518) (not least, it it unfinished almost in the middle of sentence), but it is the only portrayal of Umbridge which makes some sense to me.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
