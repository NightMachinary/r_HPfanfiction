Can be pureblood or halfblood with knowledge of muggles. Or a muggleborn who does the logical thing and researches wizarding customs when they enter the Wizarding World. Their main goal is to improve the reputation of Slytherins, so they befriend other houses and keep Malfoy in check. Can be in a position of power within Slytherin house but doesn't have to be. Mostly, I'm just looking for someone with a Slytherin mentality that adds logic to the Wizarding World. Encourages Hufflepuffs to seek power as well as kindness and justice to earn respect. Convinces Gryffindors that bravery without intelligence is reckless stupidity. Convinces Ravenclaw that it's okay to be unintelligent, as everyone has their own strengths. And convinces Slytherins that there's more to life than power, politics, and bloodlines. They would decide to make money off of bets on Harry's infamous luck, which is how they meet Harry to begin with. They do what Malfoy should have done, and introduce Harry to the Wizarding World, rather than what Malfoy actually did, and tried to get power off of being associated with the boy-who-lived. In Philosopher's Stone, they make sure 11 year olds aren't going up against a full grown adult, or at the very least make sure that they're prepared or figures out Harry's protection. In Chamber of Secrets, they research it's original opening and deduce that Tom Riddle is the heir of Slytherin, as well as the fact that the monster is a Basilisk. In Prisoner of Azkaban, they question why Harry's godfather never got a trial. In Goblet of Fire, they deduce that the infamous Potter luck will make Harry a TriWizard Champion and helps him prepare early assuming there are no loopholes so he doesn't have to compete. They also might deduce that at this point in time every defense teacher has tried to kill or otherwise incapacitate Harry, either purposefully or accidentally. In Order of the Phoenix, they figure out a way to arrest Umbridge and convince the public that Harry isn't lying. And so on.


** Honestly, this sounds a bit Mary-sueish. I still like the idea though.

** You might enjoy one of the Harry's in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/]]) it's Harry, and so not completely an OFC, but she is pissed off about Slytherins not being cunning, and I really enjoy how hard she takes it.

Newblood by Artemis girl also has Hermione conning Slytherin so she doesn't get murdered in Slytherin.

#+begin_quote
  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

** Or maybe something that looks at the series based on what would happen if JKR had included Mafalda Weasley: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mafalda]]
