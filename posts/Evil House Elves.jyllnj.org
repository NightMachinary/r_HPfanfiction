What if the hidden history of house elves, is that the good ones made a bargain? Maybe they can't make human goods, but wanted access? Maybe they feed on their family's magic, like a parasite? Or they just got tired of fighting with the wizards. So when Hermione finds a way to break the bargain, all hell breaks loose.

Elf/Fairy lore has a lot of evil fairies, & a few good, or at least indifferent to people. They kill, maim, mischief, & otherwise make a nuisance of themselves towards humans. Most of the myths about brownies/house fairies have them working for a family, but they freaked out if you broke their rules.

*/Disaster Averted/*

"And with thirty-one to twenty-five, the Ayes have it. The House-Elf Legal Protections, Exchanges, and Regulations Act is now law of the land," the Chief Warlock pronounced.

That night, at an informal SPEW reunion to celebrate the HELPER Act, it was Neville who broached the question.

"Why no emancipation?"

"Emancipation?" asked Ron.

"I mean, the law gives house-elves an unalienable right to change masters, but not to be freed. 'Exchange' could be 'Emancipation'. Why not?"

Hermione hesitated.

"You didn't have the votes?"

"No, that's not quite it." She shook her head. "It's rather embarrassing after all these years...

"Anyway, back in---I think---'96, I did some research on whether house-elves had any non-house relatives. What I found was rather disturbing. Apparently---and all my research confirmed this---house-elves once were---still are, biologically---imps, driven to create chaos and destruction. Back when it happened, binding them was a humane alternative to genocide."

The table was silent, perhaps less surprised the revelation than by Hermione's willingness to state it so starkly.

She continued. "It's true. Harry, remember what Dobby did to you in second year? He had the best intentions, but, acting on his own initiative, he went about them in the most destructive ways possible. They can't help it.

"I estimate that a free house-elf will generally be bound by their cultural conditioning for one, perhaps two generations. Eventually, they, or their children, will revert to their base instincts. That's why I stopped leaving clothes out for them."

"Why didn't you tell us?" asked Harry.

"I... I guess back then, I didn't want to admit that I almost caused a disaster. And later, I decided that if more people knew, they'd take it as a license to abuse their elves, and we'd have even tougher time getting a law like the HELPER Act on the books.

"I couldn't give them freedom without causing disaster. I tried to give them the next best thing."
