Dec 26, 1991:

Harry: "Today's the best day ever!"

Ron: "Didn't you get an invisibility cloak yesterday?"

Harry, dancing: "SOVIET UNION IS GONE"

--------------

Pomfrey: "You're going to need Skele-Gro. This will be pretty painful."

Harry: "Can you please tell me how much you're charging for this service in advance so that I can compare it with the competition and get the best price?"

Pomfrey: "Don't worry, this won't cost anything."

Harry: Faints.

--------------

Draco: "Why does he get to have a Firebolt? It's not fair!"

Harry: "There's nothing wrong with someone voluntarily exchanging their hard earned money for a product and then gifting it to me."

--------------

"Are you telling me that the food I'm eating is funded by /taxes/?"

/Same reaction as Hermione finding out about elves cooking it/

--------------

"The 2nd paragraph of the 1685 treaty clearly states that our right to use wands shall not be infringed! These 'Reasonable Restrictions on underage sorcery' are trampling on our right to defend ourselves! The only thing that stops a dark wizard with a wand is a good wizard with a wand!"

--------------

Umbridge: Announces at the 5th year welcoming feast that the Ministry will start involving itself at Hogwarts.

Harry: Pukes.

--------------

During the Battle of the DoM:

Harry: "Everyone, use blasting curses!"

Hermione: "Good idea! They're moving too fast to hit directly."

Harry: "That too, but really because fuck this place. Can we wreck the tax department next?"

--------------

"Lord Voldemort! You are in violation of the non-aggression principle!"

"The what?"

"After thorough consideration I have decided to declare a boycott of you and your associates."

--------------

Edit:

Voldemort and a few of his Death Eaters meet in a forest. Suddenly a bunch of ExpressOwl owls appear and deliver a massive package. Voldemort opens it and sees a screen showing Harry's face.

"Okay Voldie, enough is enough. Here's a little gift to you. Was bloody expensive, but worth it."

The screen turns off, and Voldemort stares at the device in confusion.

"What does I'm loving it mean?"

Then the entire area turns into a fireball in an instant.

In a Libertarian government, lobbying is pointless, because the government doesn't have the power to regulate whatever you are lobbying for.

****** Not according to the pedo libertarians. “What if the child consents tho” isn't just a meme, it's a genuine problem with the concept of the NAP- it's inherently subjective and doesn't have any use as a governing principle. It's like saying you want your government to follow the be-good-don't-be-bad act.

******* Science has proven that children's brains are undeveloped and can't understand the total ramifications of their choices. This is why they can't consent. Not because of laws that are different in various regions of the world. They are as scientifically unable to make logical choices as a drunk person, therefore neither are capable of giving consent, and neither are capable of refusing emergency medical treatment.

****** If pedophilia violated the NAP there would be less people that subscribe to that ideology that are pedos not MORE.

Also, if you belive on the NAP taxation is theft. Making government immoral. As such there would be no government to enforce any rules.

Any billionaire with their own private militia could easily make his disgusting pedophilia unenforceable despite what other people might think.

Theres a reason so many lib-right and auth-right are pedophiles.

******* You can't just go and apply a piece of an idea where it fits your interpretation and discarding it when it doesn't.

NAP has to apply to everyone or it's pointless to bring up, and when it does a billionaire cannot use a private army for his personal violations of NAP just as I cannot take a gun and go shoot someone.

"(All) Taxation is theft" is a meme. Sure, in perfect libertarian (ancap) utopia there would be no need for taxes, but it's unattainable since you can't force everyone to obey the NAP, thus the necessary concession of minimal tax to create an impartial overseeing body of authority to enforce it. You've gotta be realistic about your ideas.

And that last part is uncalled for. Did some bad libertarian touch you when you were little? /s

******** I have often found in my conversations with all the man babies that follow the flawed and oxymoronic(capitalism needs a strong state to enforce property rights) ideology of right-wing libertarianism that they are quick to condemn their legions of pedophiles, yet when pressed turn into one themselves. At the very least they defend the logical underpinnings those pedophiles cling to in order to justify their beliefs.

What if the child consents? Is not a meme, it's a real argument that these people make, and if you truly belive in the NAP then it does stand.

And somone in some comment above explained perfectly that a child isn't capable of giving informed consent, just like a blackout drunk isn't.

Obviously it's something that needs consideration, but the argument against children being free, autonomous individuals is strong and reasonable - and only free and autonomous individuals get to make uninhibited, free choices.

#+begin_quote
  (capitalism needs a strong state to enforce property rights)
#+end_quote

And where do libertarians argue for a weak state? The argument is for a SMALL(er) state. Not weak one. You don't need China-level oversight, control and beaurocracy to enforce basic rights, you don't need a massive army taking trips to bomb kids all around the world, you don't need a massive IRS that's more scary than the police for many people...

You're purposefully misconstruing and misunderstanding the goals and arguments to build a strawman to argue against. And then add some ad-hominem because why the hell not.

******* Whatever you're describing is not something the vast majority of libertarians would agree with. It's a really obvious strawman argument and it's hard to imagine you actually believe most libertarians think this way. Obviously rape is agression. Libertarians do support taxation (maybe you are thinking of some form of anarchism??). Maybe you're a bot or fake commenter and I'm dumb for responding oO
