A while go I read a fic called To Live Again about harry traveling into an alternate universe where he takes over the body of hi counterpart who was evil. His family was very careful with him at first and his oldest sister hated him, he had blood red hair and had planned to have his family killed. If anyone has a copy please let me know. I'm desperate


** I know which fic your talking about. I went looking for it too but had no luck. Hopefully someone else can find a link.
