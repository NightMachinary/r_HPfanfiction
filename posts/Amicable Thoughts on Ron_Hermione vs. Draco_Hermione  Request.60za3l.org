** I hardly think it's still a childish grudge when you literally went to war against the ideology and person in question. And really, it was a mild jab, not a bone deep personal feud. If anything, Ron shows remarkable restraint. This is the man who's family tortured his wife and friends, who was allies to the man responsible for the death of Ron's loved ones and put him through literal hell. Ron, if anything, is being magnanimous.

I personally don't think Hermione could ever be around a canon Draco and especially could not be in a relationship with him. She was literally tortured in Draco's house, and saw friends and family cut down by Draco's allies. It would be the equivalent of a Jew marrying a Nazi party official after WW II. Sure, the party official may deeply regret his role and may even grow from it and become a better person, but that still doesn't mean that they would ever be comfortable around one another.

I can see a lot of other ships making sense, but shipping any Death Eater or Death Eater family with any of the main trio or their allies just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It wasn't a school feud you can grow up and get over. They tried to kill each other, and in some cases they even succeeded. Any relationships would be at the very least, fraught with tension and mistrust.

*** Eh, I wouldn't have a problem with coming from a DE family if it is someone who didn't actively help them. Such as if Draco went to Dumbledore in the sixth book instead of help murderous terrorists into a school. So...basically if Draco was like Sirius, and rebelled against the family instead of embraced it.

** I'll preface this by noting that Ron is my favorite character, and R/Hr my favorite ship, so you are aware that I am coming at this from what is very likely a biased angle, but I will try to set my prejudices aside.

#+begin_quote
  Case in point: he still holds a childish grudge against Malfoy 19 years after the war and makes semi-prejudiced comments on how Rose's granddad would never forgive her for marrying a pureblood.
#+end_quote

[[/u/iamspambot]] said it very well, to be quite honest. I don't think there was any malice behind that comment at all, and so I'm hesitant to mark it as some sort of deep-seated hatred or grudge.

You mention that we should not judge a character entirely on their childhood, and I absolutely agree. It's for that reason that I believe that Ron would also mature. As Ron grows, we see someone who is deeply flawed, yet deeply loyal. We get a window into his insecurities from the beginning, as he tells Harry about his family on that first train ride. Those are further expanded upon (and often cause some problems) throughout the series, culminating in the famous locket scene.

The reason I believe that Ron would grow is that, because of his participation in the war, I'd wager he'd finally feel like he was cutting his own path. In addition, he was able to overcome his insecurities regarding Harry and Hermione, feeling like he was the ever-insufficient third wheel. I don't think he'd ever truly beat those flaws and those insecurities, but I do think he'd gradually become better at controlling them.

Draco is a really intriguing character. All we get of him in the epilogue is a curt nod and a shot of him, his wife, and his son, Scorpius. Beyond that, nada.

In the 19 years from May 2, 1998, to September 1, 2017, we know nothing of the changes that may have occurred in Draco's life, beyond the evident, and this makes things slightly more difficult.

I would imagine that the Malfoy family would be heavily affected by the result of the war - after all, they hosted what very well may have been the entirety of the evil's commanding force at some point or another, and I cannot imagine that would go unpunished.

I believe that how this was handled by Draco would be the catalyst for his change, or cause him to burrow deeper into the prejudice and hate that Voldemort and co. loved so much. Because of the way he is described, I'm more inclined to agree with you, in the sense that he has come to some sense of maturity and acknowledgement of his prior prejudices.

Draco and Hermione, to me, draw many parallels with Lily Evans and Severus Snape, less the friendship the latter pair had pre-school and during their early years at Hogwarts. I find myself stuck on the moment when Draco calls Hermione a Mudblood. I'll reiterate that I don't think we should judge Draco on this incident, but I also think it's a rather damning moment, in the sense that that's not something someone is wont to forget. In addition, we have the moments in Malfoy Manor and, later, in the Room of Requirement, where Hermione is either tortured heavily (while Draco merely watches), and the battle preceding the Fiendfyre and destruction of the diadem. Both of these, to me, would be pretty hard to move past if I were in Hermione's position.

In addition, we know Hermione is an advocate for the least and the lowest, if SPEW is any indication. As much as Draco could reform, I'd imagine that there would be some long-held prejudices that would be very difficult for him to let go of. We know that Dobby was mistreated rather terribly, and if other house-elfs are any indication, the Malfoys were pretty cruel even by those standards. While this cannot be pinned on Draco, certainly, it does raise some questions, I think.

#+begin_quote
  A person's sense of self is not inherent though. It's grown and developed by the circumstances surrounding that person and I believe Malfoy's experiences has shaped him into a better person.
#+end_quote

Would it not be that his sense of self is heavily influenced by his parents? By Bellatrix? By the many Death Eaters who passed through that manor?

We can excuse the actions of a child, but that does not mean that what is learned then does not stay with a person.

Ron was raised by very accepting wizards, taught to value people because of who they are as people rather than their blood. He has inherent prejudices, yes - against the Slytherins, most notably, I'd say, but also against house-elves and other "lesser" creatures (though not to the extent of the Malfoy family). Despite this, we also see that he moves past these, and most notably, holds no ill will against people purely on blood status.

Draco was raised in a household that certainly seemed distant every time we interacted with them. We know that he was told things, mostly negative, about families like the Weasleys, given the first interaction between Harry, Ron, and Draco on that first train ride. We're given first-hand accounts of his prejudices in action multiple times.

I'm sorry this got so long-winded - I have a lot of thoughts on this subject, and I do apologize if I ever come off as harsh during this pseudo-rant - not my intent whatsoever, and I do think you've brought up some really intriguing points to consider.

To conclude, rather simply, while I see the merit of what you've been saying, I don't necessarily think that it would be very practical. I think that both men grow post-Hogwarts, but at the end of the day, if we do turn to character examinations, the flaws that rest in Draco Malfoy's persona are far more contradictory than those of Ron Weasley with regard to Hermione Granger and a potential relationship therein.

*/TL;DR/ tbh they're both pretty fucked up, but i think [[/r/hr][r/hr]] is a better catalyst for growth for both characters, and there are some deep-seated issues that make me think d/hr is extremely unlikely - also, i need to get more concise*

*** I think this discussion brings up all the parallels of their characters, which is what I think JKR meant to show. Both pureblood. Both with their own wizarding prejudices. But one in a more loving family without the ill views on Muggles and so, ended up looking past other prejudices easier. That's why I like Ron with Hermione in the books. I really hope I didn't come off as Ron bashing because as I said, that's something I don't like when talking about Hermione pairings. I like their dynamic in the books and believe it can work. I also initially read his comment on purebloods as a joke until I reread the epilogue after the Cursed Child and thought about how it could run deeper than that. As I mentioned in my other reply, there are consequences to that mentality when raising children. My only point is that these are instances that can show why they may not work out in the very end. But they could also very well work through all of those problems.

And yes, just because Ron and Hermione may not work out, it doesn't mean she would have a better relationship with Draco. I only made the point that she could given his growth and how the fic is written. I'm not shipping her with Draco over Ron. I'm arguing that there is possibility to the pairing. I personally only like reading Dramione more because of the creativity in how the writer can believably construct their relationship. I already know how it can with Ron, so I'm not particularly interested in their pairing beyond the books. (Weirdly, I do like reading Harry and Ginny fics though.)

I also don't think Hermione would be the type to hold Malfoy's past against him. But again, she could be. Malfoy kept using Mudblood because that's what he was taught, but I think seeing his aunt carve that word in Hermione would make him rethink ever using it again. Had he stopped Bellatrix, he would have gotten both her and him killed. Hermione also did not know the impact of that word when she first heard it; Ron had to explain. She was never greatly affected by it but she was still frustrated that Malfoy used a term like that. She was never shown to hold a grudge even prior to his faltering allegiance. While she stuck up for herself around Malfoy, she chastised Harry and Ron for talking down on him. She made sure he got to the hospital after Buckbeak and noticed his failing health during HBP. I don't think she ever hated him as the boys did. Yes, she didn't like him but she never showed resentment. If he demonstrates he has truly grown as a person, she could possibly like him. Slowly.

** Hr/D is a joke kept afloat by the fact that the actor is pretty and this weird belief people have that risque, passionate sex can only be had with a 'bad boy' like Malfoy.

That said, a v. good author can still make it work, as long as they don't ignore the profound tensions inherent in the pairing, or handwave the conflict away somehow.

Ron/Hr is canon, but honestly, not that plausible. For me, the ideal post-book 7 (minus epilogue) Ron would be shagging his way through the years. But, unfortunately, ff authors find it difficult to write those sort of relationships without utilizing 'true love' or 'harem' tropes.

She never said it should've been Harry/Hermione. Rowling is very clear that H/G and R/Hr make the most sense, and she is right. Just reading the series makes it abundantly clear that H/G is a much better relationship and H/Hr would simply not work because they are not very compatible (in fact, reading through the series, the two don't even come across as people who'd be friends if not for the war and Ron being around).

That is a joke making fun of pureblood prejudices. I've made similar jokes making fun of racial prejudices. For example, back when I was in high school, I would cross the street when white people were walking towards me, or locked my car doors as they were walking by my car. Me as a white dude doing that is equivalent to Ron making that joke as a Pureblood. Its just taking prejudiced attitudes and resulting behaviors and directing them back at those who hold them as a joke.

Whether he should have said it to a child is another question. I'm sure Hermione would have been more amused by it had he made a similar joke to her instead of in front of and to their child.

I don't really have anything to add to the main discussion really. I don't like R/Hr as a central pairing (as in, I like them together, but I don't want to read a story that is about the two of them) but I don't like D/Hr as any sort of pairing. I agree its definitely better if it happens after the Battle of Hogwarts, though.

**** Cursed Child is essentially a fanfiction, and one I have no interest in reading because it takes the use of time turners from being that of a fixed timeline and then allowed them to be used to change the past. Then they changed the past in stupid ways.

I don't think that joke was childish, if anything it falls into dad joke territory. But I don't think it was wise to say to his daughter.

I don't think there is anything wrong with mocking prejudice. I don't do the same kind of stuff that I mentioned anymore, but I will make jokes making funny of racism. Because I think it is something that deserves to be made fun of. But I keep those jokes generic and only say them with like-minded friends. With those who hold racist views, I confront them. You can present the same absurdities in argument form, and people are more likely to get defensive if you are making fun of them, even as indirectly as a generic joke may be.

Which is why I think that the only problem with Ron's joke was the time and the place.

** Hmm just some thoughts on the Ron/Hermione ship. I actually do think Ron helps to ground Hermione like OP said, and he has a more laidback type of personality to counter her more driven one, though he does have leadership qualities he's more of a passive type of character. I do like how in canon, Ron ends up being the one who is more of the nurturing figure at home than Hermione, who is the working parent. But that being said, I don't think the complement each other very well because Hermione seems to overwhelm Ron's own growth as a person. He's stunted in that sense when she's around because he's comfortable around her. She's happy to push him around, and he's happy to let her since it often benefits him on the surface level. He's not dependent on her in that he cannot live without her, but she becomes a somewhat convenient crutch for him.

With regards to Draco, I do think he and Hermione could work in theory; they are both intellectually on par with each other, and would definitely be able to sound off ideas on one another. But in reality, I do think that it's difficult for the two to ever be more than acquaintances or great working partners. They are both insanely competitive and ambitious, stubborn and have a mean streak that would definitely result in spectacular fights.The good thing is that both of them are okay with conflict, similar to RonxHermione (and opposite to Harry's dynamic with her, as he is more conflict avoidant. The bad thing is that meither of them are going to give way easily in an argument about something that really matters to them. It will be a hard road to compromise, something that is key in a relationship.

Romantically, Hermione probably needs someone like Draco AND Ron to be most ideal. It doesn't bode well for a relationship when both parties are as volatile as Hermione and Draco, and it's probably hard to have a home life if both are career minded. He also doesn't ground her, and she'd definitely be less emotionally stable than with Ron, and she could also become overly high strung? All of this is my postulation though.

Yes. I think Ron's problem is that he married his mother, in the sense that he gravitated from one pushy woman to another. Don't get me wrong - I quite like Hermione.

I think that Hermione channeled these traits into social justice. Both women chose supportive partners who were ok with being subordinate. (Consider the dynamic between Arthur and Molly re: his muggle gadgets, the car, etc.) Yes, Hermione and Ron choose to relate through bickering - though it's this history of carping on each other that always made me question the feasibility of them working out in the long run.

And I don't see the carping on each other as a huge deal. Most couples have arguments, the bickering doesn't even seem to bother them; it certainly bothered Harry, and he even asked them to stop fighting and I think they seemed pretty confused as to what he was even referring to. Bear in mind that we're seeing the whole story in Harry's perspective too, who hasn't had a healthy representation of a normal husband and wife relationship growing up with his aunt and uncle, so these flaws we see in their relationship could also be a byproduct of Harry's own perception towards the way ron and hermione interact.

Let me stop you right there. Why do you love the pairing? In all honesty, why do you like a half-baked pairing with almost no development? The most common arguments I hear for this pairing is, "Oh, Ron was just being mean because he liked her. It's common knowledge that if a boy picks on you, he likes you." No, that isn't how it works in the real world, people are mean because they're mean, because they are annoyed by a specific person or their actions, that's like saying the common excuse for bullying, "Boys will be boys", when it is simply untrue. Then you get events in the fourth book, that show Ron is a person who enjoys being in control in a relationship, having say, deciding when/what to do. Meanwhile, Hermione is that exact same person, only less lazy, and more willing to be active. So you have two polar opposites, that are somehow supposed to attract from their emotional disagreement and moral disagreement of each other?

#+begin_quote
  The reason Hermione finally kissed him during the war is because she believed he showed growth past his prejudices (against werewolves, giants, trolls, house-elves throughout the years) when he mentioned saving the Hogwarts elves;
#+end_quote

Hmm, if she liked someone based on their lack of prejudices, then why didn't Hermione just go with Harry from the beginning? He literally freed a house-elf, was friends with a half-giant and didn't even care when he found out, his uncle was a werewolf that almost killed him yet he still held no prejudice against werewolves, etc... Not to mention the amount of 'tender' moments they had together, with the "You're a great wizard, you know", to the multiple long hugs whenever they met for the first time.

As for Draco, the argument for him is even thinner. He was essentially an ugly coward that couldn't stand up for himself, he was in the most well-guarded building in Magical Britain, yet didn't think to ask Dumbledore to protect his family by having them all held in Hogwarts. So we are left with what? The fact that he endangered the lives of school children who were too young to understand who the Death Eaters were? The fact that he got the last hope of the wizarding world, killed?

Your evidence for his change is based on the fanfiction that is Cursed Child, and a singular scene from the Epilogue. Also, who says that both of them do hold any liking for each other? Draco has a list of Pureblood girls that he can wed, who are likely ten times better looking than Hermione, with the same temperament as himself. With someone as superficial as Draco, I doubt he would care much about Hermione, nor her views on things.

*** I chose to discuss these two pairings since Ron is the canon pairing and Draco is the pairing I like reading. I could have chosen to talk about others.

I make the argument that I don't ship her with Draco over Ron, but that given how the fic is written and the instances of growth he has shown, it is possible that Hermione could slowly like him. Because she would have grown and he would have grown, both possibly to a point that complements each other. A good writer would address all of these issues. My thoughts mainly come from Rowling's writings on Pottermore. Not Cursed Child. But given that I said I like post-Hogwarts fics, there will be a lack of true evidence because there isn't much canon at all for those years. So yes, of course I'd be lacking.

Rowling did develop Ron and Hermione's relationship throughout the books. Hermione had a crush but it was not until Ron came around with his feelings did she act on it. She finally kissed him in that moment, but they were clearly in some sort of relationship during DH. She may have initially like him just because she was young but I do think she found that she enjoyed her banter with him. Hermione could have liked Harry, but I always saw them as siblings. Harry never really showed that he liked her company without Ron around and Hermione didn't have the same push and shove stimulus with Harry than she did with Ron. Harry even blew up at their little bickering. I think she likes the small arguments. I feel like your perception of Harry and Hermione's relationship is distorted by the movies. They don't hug that much. I did think Ron was sometimes callous in making fun of her and why I think it could present problems later on if his insecurities arise. However, I think they would be a good first relationship to learn from one another. You can read more on other threads if you're interested in expanding your outlook on their relationship.

  Hermione had a crush but it was not until Ron came around with his feelings did she act on it.

How could you possibly know that? Lol. It was never stated in the books, you're using pure-headcanon to substitute things that never happened.

Nope, they were pretty distant through most of the story, until Ron came back from abandoning them.

Doubtful, constantly arguing with someone is exhausting, not fun. Especially when it is someone who cannot see from your perspective (Ron).

***** She was devastated when Ron went out with Lavender. How was that not evidence she had a crush on Ron? During the wedding, she danced with Ron and Krum asked Harry if they were together and he responds "sort of." Harry also made observations of how they fell asleep with hands outstretched towards each other and thought they may have fallen asleep holding hands during their camping throughout DH. And I think she saw the arguments stimulating because when Harry told them to stop, both of them were confused. They didn't see it as arguing. Remember, the books are only from Harry's perspective.

***** Actually, she does seem to have a crush on him. Rowling mentions throughout HBP how she gets jealous at Ron and Lavender's relationship in a way that a normal friend doesn't, and was positively ecstatic they broke up. They were pretty close in DH too. In fact, when Krum asks if Ron and Hermione are together at Bill and Fleur's wedding, Harry literally responds "sort of"

"Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cameroles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him" -- DH (before Ron leaves)

Also, "Don't look at me like that!" he snapped at Hermione. "Don't you start on her!" snarled Ron.

Ron is pretty protective over hermione in DH, and whenever Malfoy insults her or something, its Ron (and not so much Harry) who comes to her defence. Throughout DH, there are plenty of moments where Rowling mentions that Hermione and Ron share hugs and Hermione/Ron defend each other whenever Harry gets mad. At each moment of crisis, Hermione seeks out Ron first before she does Harry. They are a lot closer than it seems in the movie.

I think you might need to re-read your book. The movie did a piss poor job at representing Ron and Hermione's friendship, and didn't show much of the conflict between Harry and Hermione either, so it came up pretty imbalanced as a result. Ron does see from Hermione's perspective actually; he complements her quick thinking, and he

****** So Ron defending her automatically means they're meant to be together? I don't understand that rationale.

Also, Ron/Hermione only seems to start being foreshadowed during HPB and so forth. So the whole "it's been in the books since the beginning" point is pretty much moot.

I feel like people use protecting someone like a sister, and calling them smart on occasion, as some kind of calling card for people to automatically get married.

When has Harry ever said anything that wasn't convenient to his plot? Also, I seem to recall Harry defending Hermione to Horace quite fiercely.

******* I think you've mistaken "possible evidence of romantic interest" for "meant to be together."

Either that or your just trying to strawman the argument.

Also, the first hint of R/Hr in the books I can think of is in GOF.
