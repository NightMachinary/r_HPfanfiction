Specifically, the death eater's "I was imperiused" defence worked because the way they'd been distinguishing a /voluntary/ Death Eater and an imperius'd one, was the Dark Mark - so when it disappeared (as per canon - Karkaroff panicked because he saw his Dark Mark returning in GoF) in 1981, they automatically fell into the "looks imperiused" category, and anyone savvy could rush in and get themselves declared officially innocent before it became widespread knowledge that the lack of visible Dark Mark was useless evidence.

That, plus /maybe/ some bribes and the ministry not being willing to admit they're wrong, could seal the deal.

Which to me says it was always at minimum visible.

** Is it actually canon that the Dark Mark had to be taken voluntarily? I always thought that was just a very common fanon idea.

In which case you could have a Dark Mark and still argue you were Imperiused.

*** Because it is a common fanon idea. Or at least as far as I know there is nothing said to that effect in books or any other canon source.

But there is this tidbit about who has Dark Marks.

#+begin_quote
  ‘To hell with the Ministry,' growled Greyback. ‘They'll take the credit, and we won't get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.'

  ‘Will you summon 'im? 'Ere?' said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified.

  ‘No,' snarled Greyback, ‘I haven't got -- they say he's using the Malfoys' place as a base. We'll take the boy there.'

  Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort.

  The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort's inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honour.

** The imperius defence worked because suddenly there was dozens of people coming forward at the same time, seemingly after Voldemort's apparent defeat.

Also, Death Eaters weren't the only people put on trial. Hell, we don't actually know if the Ministry knew of the importance of the mark at that time. We see people like Ludo Bagman get put on trial (and exonerated), despite not having the mark. And we see Sirius get put into Azkaban despite not having a mark. We also don't know what it actually takes to get the mark.

Also, I am dubious that the mark actually disappeared altogether. The Imperius curse dissipating on a large amount of people at the same time is one thing. That's an active spell. The Dark Mark isn't an active spell. That's not to mention that pretty much every character we meet in canon up through book 4 pretty much beleives that Voldemort was simply defeated and in hiding, rebuilding his strength, and not actually killed. It's only when they're faced with the actual possibility of his return that they shift their viewpoint.

The first half of that paragraph is speculation. The rest of your post is reasonable. We aren't given much if any real facts on the imperious defence other than Malfoy claimed it but clearly was not.

  "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back.

So the imperiusing was a widely happening.

  There,' said Snape harshly. ‘There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was, an hour or so ago, when it burnt black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burnt into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing each other, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff's, too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.'
#+end_quote

GoF

So:

1. It may not fully disappear, but it was basically invisible.
2. Clearly, they didn't know about Mark's importance because Snape has to explain it.

*** The Imperious Defense worked because those who used it either had a lot of money for bribes, or were friends of the people with bribe money.

The Dark Mark was more like a scar while Voldemort was without power.
