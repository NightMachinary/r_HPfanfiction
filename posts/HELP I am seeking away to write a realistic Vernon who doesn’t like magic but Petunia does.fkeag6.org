Anyway this fic I'm writing is about the Dursley's having a set of twins, Dudley and a girl. Lily and Petunia are from the Parkinson family. Lily did go to hogwarts but Petunia did not have enough magic to attend. Help I have currently got a scene with the twins and Harry teaming up to get the biscuit tin.


** Does the other twin have magic?

Maybe Petunia was only jealous of Lily. She doesn't hate magic, she just pretended to to hide her jealousy. Then she starts realizing this and takes pity on Harry.

Maybe Petunia hides all this from Vernon until a day when she gathers the strength to confront him. I think Vernon would be angry, irrational, prejudice as usual, and most importantly, hurt.

His hate for magic has always seemed irrational and over the top to me.

Good luck with your story! ðŸ˜Š

*** Thank you. The twin is magic and (because of genetics) looks a lot like her Aunt Lily. I kinda see a bad Darren Stevens type.
