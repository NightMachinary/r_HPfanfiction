** *Victoria Potter* comes really close all-around.

*Latet Anguis in Herba* brings across Hogwarts life better than any fic I've read, but it doesn't focus on the characters. Likewise, *Alexandra Quick* really recreates Rowling's whimsicality, yet is very different in tone and is set completely out of canon.

*Forging the Sword* nails the characterization of the main trio.

All four of these are superb fics with a really high standard of writing and storytelling, and largely avoid tropes and other cliches of fanfiction writing.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** While I've yet to run into fics that are close to Rowling's writing style without heavily quoting canon, the "They Shook Hands" series by Dethryl feels pretty close, and is personally my favourite slytherin!Harry series - also one of the first to ever be written. I don't remember the exact names of the fics, but he posted the rewritten version of the series on FFN under his penname Dethryl.

** It's not /Rowling's/ style per se, but linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay) has a very Roald Dhal-esque sort of whimsy to its narration that IMO invokes many of the same sort of feelings that Rowling's writing does.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
