Harry re-hangs Helga Hufflepuff's portrait, the author mentions the 'nail' of the portrait hook. Inside her rooms there are plants that need gardening. Helga exhorts Harry to find and re-hang the remaining portraits. I believe he finds Rowena, Salazar and then Godric. Ginny at some point enters and hides in Ravenclaw's secret chamber. Harry spends a great deal of time in the Slytherin secret room, distinct from the chamber of secrets, ultimately becoming apprenticed to the portrait of Salazar, against the advice of the other founder portraits and his friends.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

I tried the Google " " method with a variety of keywords but haven't been able to find the fic. Thank you for your time!

** I don't have that exact fic, but I know a couple that involve the portraits. If you are interested I will find and link them for you.

**** Unfortunately the main one I was thinking of seems to have been taken down. It was great and involved Dumbledore hiding the portraits throughout the castle and confining them so they couldn't move, especially Slytherin. Harry reunites them.

But there is another one with mention of Slytherin's portrait helping Harry. Linkffn(raspberry jam by vvc)

I knew a couple others with Slytherin's portrait, but they were quite old and seem to have been deleted as well. Sorry I don't have more!

***** The main one you were thinking of, I think, is the one I was thinking of. Unless they're another one where Dumbledore hides the portraits... Raspberry Jam intrigues me, thank- you for the recommendation, I'm excited to read this!
