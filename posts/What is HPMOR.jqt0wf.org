I see this EVERYWHERE. What exactly is it? No one even says the full name just abbreviations so I can't even look it up and find out myself. Can someone explain it.

Is it a crossover fic? I feel like it might be.

**** If you just read it as a crackfic it's alright. Don't get into the author's ego and all the shit going on with that, and don't take the "science" in there seriously, as not all of it is correct, and it's the same as any other decently-written fic, and better than most other fics that want to include their authors' personal life-changing philosophies.

*** See I really liked the idea behind it. I think it would've been a really interesting idea to apply logic and the scientific method to the magical world. But in doing so you have to respect the rules that the source-material gives. I would love for someone to take Harry Potter and turn it into a hard-magic system. But HPMOR fails by presenting itself as a story that's true to the chracters. I also find that the pacing drags a lot with many moments that really don't need to be there.

I agree that it's okay as a crackfic. But trying to read it as a serious story, as (I imagine) the author intended, is too hard (for me).

************ I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion. He considers his own actions and how he could have done better after seeing his overly rough treatment of Neville via Time Turner, after foolishly helping to break Bellatrix Lestrange out of Azkaban, after losing the first mock battle, after failing to save Hermione from the troll, plus several times when adults pointed out his mistakes and he realised that they were right. Not to mention the final chapter, where he reflects on how he came within a hair's breadth of destroying the planet or handing it to Voldemort on a platter, and was prevented from destroying it by Voldemort's own foresight.

Of course, recognising that he made mistakes is just one step, and actually doing better is much harder. That's just realistic. There's a reason the community the author belongs to is called Less Wrong; learning this stuff doesn't mean you get everything right, it just hopefully means that you can do /something/ better than you otherwise would have. Maybe 999 mistakes instead of a thousand.

** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is divisive for a number of reasons. Personally, I quite enjoyed it, although I don't tend to reread it - but I do tend to remember some of the lessons I learned from it, and refer to bits of it.

Strengths include:

- A long and complex plot, with lots of foreshadowing but also plenty of twists.

- Plenty of humour (though not everyone enjoys the same kinds of jokes, of course).

- Many thought-provoking discussions, on the nature of good and evil, what it means to be a hero, how to reflect on your own beliefs and test them, and a host of other subjects. You may agree or disagree with Harry's point of view (and the author doesn't always agree with him), but either way, you can learn something from it.

- An extremely intelligent, dangerous, and complex villain.

- /Very/ few spelling/grammar errors.

Weaknesses:

- Harry is frequently arrogant and condescending to the people around him, even though he genuinely wants to help the world. Note that the story /does/ punish him for this attitude, but it's not always immediately obvious that that will happen, which can give readers the impression that the author approves of his behavior. Furthermore, even if it does come back to bite him, some people just don't enjoy reading about that kind of protagonist.

- The story was originally published serially, and the flow is sometimes better suited to that week by week release than to a full-length novel.

- The discussions of ethics and philosophy sometimes edge into Author Tract territory. Whether that bothers you will mostly depend on whether you find the subject interesting.

- The characters are frequently less relatable than canon, less likely to get you emotionally invested in them. They're not entirely flat or without personality, but it's not a strong point of the story.

Overall, I recommend giving it a go just so you can make your own decision about whether you like it. If you get as far as chapter 10 and hate it, then you probably won't like the rest.

** Disclosure: I liked MOR and I got into Potter fic through it, but sure, it's not for everyone. Thrawnca [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jqt0wf/what_is_hpmor/gbpmcrl/][below]] gave a really good summary of its strengths and weaknesses.

For all the vitriol it attracts here, it has 27,062 favorites on ff.net, which I think makes it the most popular HP fic on the whole site at the moment.

At a more meta level, I'd say the original Rowling novels and most HP fanfic are in the fantasy genre, while MOR is in the science fiction genre, that has its own set of tropes. The 11yo genius Harry that everyone says is so awful and unrealistic is actually a stock character who would fit right into Heinlein's juvenile SF novels from the 1950s. Look at Clark Fries from /Podkayne of Mars/ or the Stone twins from /The Rolling Stones/ and tell me that they aren't all close relatives if not doppelgangers of MOR Harry. So it's a reasonable guess that the readers who like it are mostly science fiction buffs, while fantasy buffs won't care for it as much. It has no romance and no ships, just brainy adventures and a level of philosophical thoughtfulness all the way through.

Harry is in fact extremely annoying for the first 10 or so chapters of the book, but he does get more sympathetic after that. It's retroactively explained as a plot device but my opinion is that the book's writing simply got better as the author got further into the story and more engaged with it. The book itself also gets less preachy after that beginning part is passed.

I would say the book is way overlong (like by 2x), just like lots of long fanfics I could name that I'd still consider good. It has a number of cringey sections all the way through, and that's not even counting the first few chapters that are pure cringe. But since I liked the book, I'd say the good parts make up for the bad, which is the best you can usually hope for in fanfic.

I'd say if you want to dip into it to see if interests you, you might read chapters 43-46 first (i.e. start [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/43][here]]). That is the sequence where Harry learns the Patronus charm, which has a suspenseful scene with some strong sentiment that some people like. See if you like those chapters, and decide whether to go further from there.

Oh yes, it has its own subreddit, [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]], which is reasonably active and usually friendly.

** A lot of people in this sub seem to not like the fic. As for me, I encountered this fic when I was in my mid-20's and found the first few chapters quite interesting so I followed it and read it in 'real time.'

I got swept in the hype that it got. It had its own website, Facebook page, podcast and tons of fanart and fanfics. It even inspired people to write 'rational' fanfics of other fandoms such as 'Twilight.'

Reading it as the author was writing it recaptured the excitement and anticipation I used to feel from my childhood waiting for the actual Harry Potter books to come out. There were times that the chapters appeared one after the other and times where there were long stretches of time in between chapters. This happened more frequently as the story got closer and closer to its end.

Just like following the actual HP books, I felt a sense of accomplishment at being able to follow HPMOR until its end even though by that time I wasn't really thrilled with the story anymore. How did that happen?

In retrospect, the parts of the story I remember enjoying were the earlier chapters. Those were the ones that were written while the author was on a roll. But my memories of the last few arcs are in a jumble now. Those were the ones written with huge gaps in between chapters so I guess even the author had a hard time trying to tie up the loose ends. This difficulty probably created disruptions in the flow and tone of the story which is something the readers of today can notice more acutely since they can read all the chapters in one go.

Now that I'm older, I look back at HPMOR with some fondness brought about by nostalgia but I probably can't reread the whole thing now. It's just too long.
