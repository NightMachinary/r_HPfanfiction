What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][The Denarian Renegade]]* by /Shezza/. It's a cross-over with Jim Butcher's /The Dresden Files/ but you don't need to have read the series to love this fic! Harry merges with a Fallen Angel, which gives him different powers. I hope you enjoy the old school angels and demons coupled with the Wizarding World.

Hope you enjoy!

** If you want a quick overview of the Dresden Files world:

#+begin_quote
  In the world of The Dresden Files, magic is real, along with vampires, demons, spirits, faeries, werewolves, outsiders, and other monsters. Although the supernatural is still widely discredited, it is practiced by some members of society. Additionally, large portions of the globe (such as much of Central and South America) are mentioned as being largely under the control of supernatural factions. The White Council is an organization of human wizards, noted to wield significant economic power in the world, along with their supernatural power. Each species in the series (humans, faeries, vampires, etc.) has its own political and societal rules and organizations. The human wizards depend on the White Council, while faeries may belong to either of two Faerie Courts, or none at all. Vampires may belong to any of four vampire courts.

*** Speaking of crossover with Dresden Files, canon Hermione is having an adventure there in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32071/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Collocation+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Collocation of Alex Mack]]. She will however not be meeting her counterpart from "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived".

** Huh. I gotta be honest, - I totally thought /Time to put your Galleons Where Your Mouth is/ was an abandoned fic. I think it's because I abandoned reading it. Just read the last few chapters now.

The title alone sort of puts me off. It's one of those 'unnecessarily wizardized sayings' done for the sake of it. The saying uses money, not dollars, pounds, or euros.

Harry was weirdly powered. He should have been basically a god. Yet he didn't quite know if he wanted to just live a normal life, or change the course of everything. Time travelling Hermiones or Harrys, under 30 year old, clean up the whole situation better than a Harry who was literally older than he could remember. Especially given he didn't even like the family he was born into.

*** Harry did explain it...He wanted to be an active and protective older brother for Regulas and Sirius. I'm pretty sure the whole point was Harry never even came close to a time period near his family. He's lived countless lives without being able to see his family, and he gets it for this life. He's a god that now has personal feelings. Sirius was his only real attachment to a dead family while he was Harry Potter, and now he gets to see him, protect him, and basically guide him in life. Family was more important than going off to find and destroy the horcruxs, until Sirius has a hissy fit about it. Harry literally describes why he did what he did.

** I think that the fic is too short, and that the Harry character is pretty unrealistic. It's basically a MoD!Super!Harry that takes on Voldemort and reforming the Black family in like 15 years. Fun read though.

** I didn't like it to be honest. All the characters, especially Harry, were wooden and bland. There was no conflict or a sense that something interesting was going to happen since it was just Turais solving the world's problems. For me, there's not much to enjoy in a story if I don't care for the plot or the characters.

But it's short so it's good for a quick read and a bit of fluff. The technical writing is good. I imagine people who are into OP Harry and wish-fulfillment will like it.

** I think the story is something like this: it's a fic that is more interested in certain tropes (OP, Master of Death, Immortal Harry) than anything you'd normally judge a good piece of writing by--e.g., character development, world building, etc. Which sounds like a bit of an insult, but I don't intend it that way; I think it's a fairly interesting, easily digestible story, and I definitely enjoyed it, particularly the dynamics of Turais' relationship with Sirius and Regulus. But if you're looking for /depth/, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.

** It's a weird fic. I thought it was all right, but I wish Sirius and Regulus were fleshed out more. The story is told from almost a bystander's perspective, and it suffers from it. The author needs to work more on showing, not telling. I wanted to see more interactions between Turais and his brothers throughout their childhood that demonstrated that his little brothers were more than just "Turais' little brothers."

I really liked the premise, the plot was fine for the most part, but ultimately I always felt that the fic could so easily be /just that little bit/ better if the author was slightly better.

The good news is that all the criticisms I have with it are fixable, and if the author chose to rewrite it, I'd eagerly sit down and read the new version.

** This one was a bit of a struggle for me; it took several re-reads before I could get past the first couple of chapters. Even then, I wasn't fully engaged in the story.

The main problem is the same one that I have with most "canon characters reborn as X" fics: the too-quick pace leads to a barely-there sense of connection between Harry and his new family. It reads like an outline to a much longer story, one without any real conflict or sense of urgency.

For a fic set during Voldemort's first war, that's a death sentence for any attention I might've paid it.

** The story was devoid of meaningful conflict or surprises, frankly. It works, after a fashion, largely because it's short and sparse, a handful of select episodes in a preordained Harry curb-stomp, a guilty pleasure, perhaps, far from the pinnacle of what fanfiction might offer.

** It was well written, but the main conflict was...kind of absent? Like Turais just went through the motions of being a person until someone said he should be more proactive, and then he just ganked Voldemort in a couple chapters. They were mostly told from other people's perspectives, even.

He wasn't terribly clever about it either. He didn't predict that he might want to do something about Voldemort. He didn't reason that he could de-fang Voldemort (like taking away his magic, or even the mundane solution of Draught of the Living Death, or removing his eyes and tongue and limbs and having a house-elf keep him alive) and /then/ worry about horcruxes.

The implications of him having experienced many prior lives are pretty much ignored.

He's short on personality.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
