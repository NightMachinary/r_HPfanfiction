  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

**** Ive read this fic for halloween the last few years. I think it takes me about two hours or so but i also lose track of time while reading it. Its enjoyable to sit in with a nice drink and be absorbed by the story. The author has produced some very interesting works and crossovers. I truely wish more were finished. This length one shot is better than many fics ive read which were much longer. Im not a big fan of horror but this was not bad. I would definately suggest this to anyone who hadnt read it yet.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  "A pair of familiar eyes stared widely back at him. And it was at that moment, Harry finally realised, that he had never been free." A dark spin on the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, 'Nineteen Years Later'. One Shot! Complete!

** I really liked linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) though its incomplete.

"Friends" by the psychotic house-elf (formerly Glue and Tar) on ffn is also a pretty scary one.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** Linkffn(7062230) is a creepily and unbelievably written one shot set in the DOM battle in Year 5 that manages to use time travel really well. All his fics are unsettlingly creepy and well written.

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

** Linkffn(12692794)

One of the best horror fics I've ever read, truly haunting.
