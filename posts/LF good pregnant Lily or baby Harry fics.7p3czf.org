I'm reading some J/L fics that end before Lily gets pregnant. Looking for some focused on the pregnancy, mainly.


** I might have some writing to do ...

** No good canon-compliant ones spring immediately to mind, but monroeslittle has some really, really solid J/L AUs that deal heavily with pregnancy. Almost no one writes Lily quite as well as they do, imo.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
