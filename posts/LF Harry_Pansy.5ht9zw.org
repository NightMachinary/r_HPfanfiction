I haven't read a Harry/Pansy story before.


** The one I always recommend:

Linkffn(10100723)

It's smut with a plot, exactly what I feel Harry/Pansy should be. They're not a personality match so there has to be a strong physical element to the relationship.

*** That fic is exactly what the ship is for me. That's probably the only pairing with a fic discribing it with that much perfection.

  Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.

** Provocative Envy does some great ones [[http://provocative-envy.tumblr.com/hansy]]

I love Body Shots, it's completely non-magical AU and it cracks me up. Harry as a hipster.

Sunspots is also great - canon compliant-ish, Pansy went to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts.
