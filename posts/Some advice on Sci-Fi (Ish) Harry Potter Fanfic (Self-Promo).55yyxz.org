I'm trying to do a Sci-Fi (only sort of, more leaning to science fantasy, really, I'll see how it turns out). I'd appreciate some construtive critisism. Thanks.


** It's very interesting so far! I would edit some of the beginning section of logs out and some of the "perhaps" sections in the end of the first chapter. Making it more concise will make it have more impact. I completely missed the important sentence about a thousand year old man being thrown into a child's body because I was focused on the "Perhaps" statements.

*** Thank you very much. It's hard to notice things like that if you're the author and I appreciate pointing that out.

** I can only speak for myself and I may not be the typical reader, but I found the sentence structure difficult. With a bunch of short, choppy sentences my eyes and brain just keep sliding down on the page, looking for something substantial to fix themselves to. I really did try, but I couldn't focus on anything long enough to actually read the story.

**** It's a lot better now! I see how your style is more minimalist and that's still cool. I'd just recommend throwing some medium and long length sentences in there occasionally because they keep the flow unpredictable, thus the reader's brain stays engaged.
