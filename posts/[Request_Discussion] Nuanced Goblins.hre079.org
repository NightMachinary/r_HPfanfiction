Does anyone know of any fics that deal with Goblins as a major aspect but in a nuanced way? Specifically regarding themes of Goblin Ownership and Goblin Oppression.

It seems like Goblins are often flanderized in fics. You either get, Helpful!Goblins that fall over themselves to lick the boots of the first Main Character shaped wizard to remember their name, Bloodthirsty!Goblins who only want wands and representation in government in order to have greater chance of slaughtering wizards, or Proud!Goblins that follow the track of Harry Crow with the same tropey, manufactured culture, King Ragnock, etc.

Canon Goblins are fascinating without being flanderized. Long historically oppressed throughout Europe, denied representation in government at the level of Wizarding Britain as well as the International level. Denied access to wands and wandlore in order to better themselves and their situation. Most uniquely, completely disregarded when it comes to their system of ownership.

In universe, goblin prejudice is so bad that even good people like Bill ("who has goblin friends, or at least goblins that he likes") buys into it.

Goblins believe that ownership of an object belongs to it's creator first and foremost, and that you can never truly purchase something that was created by another's hand. Ownership of purchased items defaulting back to the Goblin that created it upon the death of the purchaser. After all, the purchaser's descendants didn't buy the item, only the purchaser did. Its a different system than we are used too, but it has its own logic and makes sense for them.

Along come wizards though, who just decided that it doesn't work that way. Imposing their own system over the goblins and acting indignant when the Goblins get upset that their items aren't being returned. I'm sure the first century or so of transactions went somewhat smoothly, before both sides realized what was going on. Wizards obviously understand how Goblins view sales, but don't care and consider Goblin's greedy for wanting to operate on the system they have used forever. Goblins view wizards as thieves. A misunderstanding that could have been rectified by a blending of cultures, wizards could pay for an item x generations out if they desired, with the opportunity to extend, prices could be renegotiated down with the understanding that original prices were agreed on under the assumption that the purchase was forever.

Of course that didn't happen and centuries later, Bill, who knows full well how Goblins view ownership has the audacity to claim that the families goblin-/made/ tiara was /paid for/ by wizards. While the trio hems and haws about the sword of Gryffindor, not only because its needed for the horcrux hunt, but because its a historical artifact that they don't really want to give back.

​

It opens up possibility for a lot of dialogue regarding artifact reparations in the modern day. How long do you have to hold onto something you stole before ownership becomes ten tenths of the law and its yours forever. If your great great grandfather entered into a sale transaction under false assumptions, is the family silver really yours. If you bought someones ancestral land for the price of some beads and false promises, do the people living on it 300 years later really own it? If a rich professor went to another country 200 years ago and desecrated a burial in the name of science, do the treasures and remains belong to the museum that bought them.

​

Anyway, long rant aside, Canon Goblins are more interesting than any of the three Fanon types and I'd like to see more. If JK Rowling hadn't waited until book 7 to expound on them more I would have expected to see Hermione just as outraged over their treatment as she was about the house elves rather than just commenting that the rebellions were sometimes justified.


** The only good one I haven't seen linked here is Vaults of Stone. It's very similar to the Realm of Song series - though it's far shorter (chronologically) and abandoned.

*** Ah see to me that sounds like "We can't give the people we've oppressed for centuries the rights we've denied them because they are upset that we've denied them rights for centuries and will just use those rights to destroy us"

All canon aggression shown by Goblins is either a rebellion against a prejudiced and oppressive government, or a violently protective defense against theft. (Gringotts poem threatening would be thieves, Griphooks vicious glee at the idea of a would be thief being trapped in a vault, Goblins going after Bagman for not paying out after losing a bet, Griphook and the other Goblins remarks about the fake sword, Griphooks betrayal of three people who used him to break into Gringotts with the intention of stealing and then not even paying the promised due afterwords.)

If a treaty was signed negotiating some of the stolen Goblin goods back to them as well as a reworking sales agreement for the continued wizarding possession of the rest of the items, along with the rights in government that the Goblins have always wanted they would have no reason to slaughter anyone. They'd have gotten the only things they were even fighting for in the first place. Yes racial prejudice wouldn't just go away, but Goblins have been living among and alongside wizards for centuries without randomly killing them and that's not just because they lack the power to get away with it
