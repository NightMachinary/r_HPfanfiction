I've read something like this and liked it ... basically where Harry is abandoned or neglected but his parents regret it but Harry has a hard time forgiving them.

​

I've read "Rise from dust" "The three black birds" "Deprived"

​

If you have any indication like that, I really appreciate it!

​

(Or it could be one where everyone thinks Harry died, something like that)

​

My reading options are very limited nowadays, I read so many types of fanfics, but I was very interested in these, can you help me?

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I would say so, yes, if only because it puts a slightly unusual spin on the tradition WBWL tropes - Harry is also an obtuse arsehole. He had to get his ungodly obliviousness from somewhere, right? Along with a couple other major things that would be plot spoilers if I mentioned them. :)

But yeah, not a spectacularly life-changing fic by any means, but it has some interestingly novel elements I'd recommend reading.

*** It was never completely finished as a story. It kind of stops once the main ship of the story gets together. After that the authors just gave how the story would've ended.

As for the story in itself, it's ok. It started off pretty well but after a point, it relied on tactics that leave a reader unhappy in general, merely to keep the readers glued to the story.

It's a basic WBWL plot with more focus on romance.

However the humour that's there through the course of the majority of the story is definitely entertaining, particularly the last few lines of each chapter.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

  There is no Boy-Who-Lived; Albus Dumbledore defeated Voldemort and destroyed his Horcruxes. Harry grows up as an ordinary boy---a very ordinary boy, with barely more magic than a Squib. He sets out to prove himself, but in private, because he doesn't want to see the disappointment in everyone's eyes if he fails. And that leads him to a very strange relationship, mediated by stubbornness on both sides, with Severus Snape.
