** I'm interested in this too, simply because this was the quote that popped into my head when I read this request:

"If it's a damned army we need, then a /damned/ army we shall have!"

  Harry is fed up with watching memories about Voldemort in Dumbledores pensieve. Watching movies in holographic quality doesn't help him survive whatever the Dark Lord has planned next. Looking for help, Harry stumbles into the Room of Requirement, finding a mysterious book about summoning rituals... The Zerg are a mighty help indeed, but this help doesn't come cheap. Please R&R.
