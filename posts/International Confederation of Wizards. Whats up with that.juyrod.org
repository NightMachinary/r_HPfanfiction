Isn't it odd that an International Organization which would seem to require a lot of coordination and day to day tasks to monitor the Statue all over the world would only meet at a "Conference" at some unknown intervals of time? Which don't seem to be too constant or long since Dumbledore is never mentioned leaving school to attend (Yeah, we know he goes and has periods of time when we don't know if he is or not in school, but he is believed to be at school for most of the year)

Also, what's with Dumbledore as leader? Yeah, he is known to be powerful by everyone but we have no indication that he was very into the "Keeping the Statue" job. Also, he is reincorporated to the Confederation after Voldemort's public reveal, but one would think he has other more important things to use his time on.

IMO. This organization is better as a fixed thing in one country (like UN) with representatives chosen based on political skills instead of magic power.


** I would think France would be a good host of the Confederation btw. Beauxbatons is there and a renown school. And France was pretty central in 1692, when the confederation was formed.

**** Given that Muggle Switzerland is neutral, that sounds like a good choice.

OR have it rotate every year.

BTW, here's a good international war that touches on the ICW

***** People are losing context here.

Contemporary Switzerland is neutral in the eyes of muggles.

In mid 1600s, when the ICW was founded, Switzerland had probably the highest number of witch executions per capita in Europe (which is saying something).

Doesn't sound like the the best choice, right?

Why don't we say they went fro Netherlands?

****** Point. I forgot Switzerland wasn't always neutral. I still like rotating every year or so.

  Sequel to The Accidental Animagus. Voldemort's back, and this time, he's not alone. Harry and his family are caught in the middle as the wizarding war goes international. Years 5-7.
