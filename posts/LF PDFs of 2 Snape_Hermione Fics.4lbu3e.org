Hello! I'm looking for PDFs (or any file, really--mobi/doc preferred) of "For Someone Special" by Ladyofthemasque & "Somewhere I Have Never Travelled" by Savageland.

Thanks in advance!

Chapters 81 - Epilogue -> [[http://thepotionsmaster.net/whispers/fss_81-end.pdf][Link]]

**** I uploaded the PDFs to my google drive account, set as shared. That should let you download them. Chrome opened the PDFs directly for me without an issue.

[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jV0aHKVGUaY0tJZlB3c3c1azQ/view?usp=sharing][Ch 1-80]]

[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jV0aHKVGUaSG5aSEdvYTUtQnc/view?usp=sharing][ch81-end]]

Let me know if either of those don't let you download. Pretty sure I have it set up correctly :)

*** Thanks for the links, I'm about to read but nervous about the Non-Con trigger warning. Any advice?

**** It's been a very long time since I've read this but I *think* Snape had to non-con Hermione in front of the Death Eaters in order to save her life. Hopefully the author warned in advance so you could skip that part.
