**** In my completely AU worldbuilding that may or may not ever turn into a finished fic, I kept the part where catching the snitch ends the game but made it not award any points. I think it makes the position much more interesting. The seeker isn't off in their own little world. They have to pay close attention to the rest of the game: try to chase the snitch down if they're ahead or keep the other seeker away from it if they're behind. For a high risk, possibly high reward play they can act as a fourth chaser, but they might lose track of the other seeker.

****** Actual text:

And in sports today...

Chairman Hassan Mostafa wrapped up the third day of pre-season hearings by the International Association of Quidditch for consideration of rule changes in the Wizarding World's most popular sport.

Much of the controversy in this year's hearings came from the office of the British Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or rather from the spokeswitch of that Department, Hermione Weasley. Mrs. Weasley's exhaustive rule set and arithmantic proof of 'enhanced entertainment value' for her proposed Millenium Quidditch was reported to count at 1043 feet of scroll.

Thankfully, in anticipation of the proposal's review, Mrs. Weasley has provided us a highlight of the most significant rule changes:

- The three goal hoops are to vary in size and point value. The center hoop is to be made half as large, to be worth 20 points. The left hoop would be enlarged to twice size but worth only 5 points and the right hoop is left at standard size and point value.

- The snitch is to be worth 42 points, making a tie game impossible. It isn't released onto the pitch until ten minutes after quaffle play has commenced. A Protean charm on the snitch closes the hoops of both teams the moment the snitch considers itself caught.

- Brooms are to be shared- that is, everyone brings a broom for the pile, but the team captains pick from those brooms available to equip their players; by doing so, there would be little chance of disparity in the performance of the equipment. Choosing starts with a coin toss, and the captains will be challenged to stay familiar with the capabilities of all official brooms.

Chairman Mostafa today declared that the proposal will require serious consideration, but that Mrs. Weasley's lack of brevity has consigned any decision on its merits to be delayed until next year's pre-season hearing.

Mr. Ragmar Dorkins' proposal to change the value of the snitch to 250 points has once again been heard and denied. Mr. Dorkins, as many readers know, is the Manager for the Chudley Cannons. His analysis that such a change would result in the Cannons being more competetive was met with some sympathy. He was given a plate of cannoli.

**** I would actually do the reverse: keep 150 points but get rid of the "game ending" ability. Have Quidditch matches last a set period of time, and if the snitch isn't caught in that time then hard luck. The Snitch would be correspondingly very hard to catch, only being successfully caught in something like 1/10 games.

There are sides at war, but in the end almost none of what anyone does matters except for Tom and Harry who win or lose the war by their individual actions. This isn't my own idea, I was told it or read it somewhere... but that was a depressingly long time ago now and I forget the source.

When it comes to the Slytherins, the idea of "Slytherins are all evil" isn't something that's presented as a conclusion Harry reaches in the narrative. Rather, it's a conclusion the readers reach after observing the Slytherins' actual behaviour. The things they do and say condemn them, not the conclusions Harry reaches about them.

Also just of thought this while reading in his Wikipedia page, but Voldemort killed his father and he killed father and Lily died to save Harry and his mother died to save him from Azkaban. Granted, she knew she was going to die anyway, but so did Lily when she decided not to step aside. Interesting similarities.

The thought that just came to my head has to do with meals in the Great Hall. I thought to myself, they're making kids who are perfectly able to do magic sit on rows of long hard benches. That doesn't seem right, and certainly not comfortable. So what to do about this?

Make all of the benches stools, and as they get older, when they go to sit down, they transfigure, conjure, or summon their own chairs and/or charm the stools for comfort and posture. Thus, as they get older, they get to practice their magic every day, as well as have a way of expressing their creativity and probably a little friendly competition as well. It would also be something that can be used as a prank and not also be abusive or painful.

I always thought that Harry should have got an O in Charms. He can cast a Patronus, after all, which is a Charm, and his summing charm in GoF was very impressive, summoning an object from over a mile away. Plus his shield charm is extremely strong. I think Harry has quite a bit of talent in Charms. Though he often has to work hard to get the hang of a spell, once he can cast it properly he tends to be very good at it.

Next we have:

  Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.

And similarly:

  Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class.

I feel like these passages beat up on Harry unnecessarily. I don't expect Harry to be as good as Hermione at picking up new magic, but at the same time there's no need to make him seem so bad at it. Him being this average at magic doesn't do anything for the plot, so it's in there for the sole purpose of making Harry seem average.

Personally I prefer a talented Harry. Not prodigious, sure, but still, the guy wants to be an Auror. He should have a grasp of magic consummate with those that enter that profession (a profession so selective that most years they don't accept any new trainees).

It also undermines a lot of what happened in previous books. Harry was able to resist the Imperius curse and defeat Voldemort in priori incantatum, both feats of sheer mental willpower. Then JKR has him struggle with non-verbal magic, which Snape says is a matter of mental power.

Harry teaches the DA in OotP and it seems like he genuinely is leading and teaching them, showcasing that yes, he is talented beyond that of a normal 5th year. Then he enters 6th year and struggles in his best subject, DADA. Apparently the twins were just humouring him throughout OotP, not mentioning once that actually Harry wasn't even at the level of a 6th year.

The upshot of all of this is that Harry relies on Hermione more than ever for magical input, though at times in DH he comes out with magic that you wonder where the hell he learnt, because it sure wasn't covered in HBP and doesn't match how Harry was depicted in 6th year.

*TL;DR*: HBP unnecessarily nerfed Harry's ability with magic for no good reason, and in fact for bad reasons, as it contradicts earlier and later books and makes Harry feel like a passenger in his own story. I would remove those references to Harry struggling and replace them with references to Harry working hard and feeling like he was making progress.

On a related matter, I would make them learn about more than one Charm in HBP. Seriously, they spent all of 6th year learning aguamenti?

*** At the same time though if he is good at the practical and struggles with the theory does that not go a way towards explaining the E? There's only so far that aceing the practical can pull you up surely?

I appreciate though that this is things that you would want to change, was just curious what your thoughts on that as reasoning was.
