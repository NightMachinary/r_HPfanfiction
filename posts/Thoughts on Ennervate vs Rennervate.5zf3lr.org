I heard that at one point, JKR realized that ennervate actually meant something different (to weaken) than what she intended (to wake up), so apparently she/the editors/publishers went back and retroactively changed all occurrences of "Ennervate" to "Rennervate" (is that really true?) in the books. This was a huge shock to me because I've had the physical books for a long time and they all said Ennervate.

What are your thoughts on using ennervate vs rennervate in fics?

I personally will always use and prefer ennervate, no matter what the etymology says; I prefer it.


** Uh. As far as I'm concerned, ennervate is and will always be canon

** I just follow the Harry Potter Wiki and Pottermore, so if Rowling says it's called /Rennervate/ then that's what I write.

In terms of my opinion on its use though, honestly it doesn't matter which is used - every reader should know what is meant by both incantations, so I can't bring myself to care when I see it.

** This is the first I'd heard of it as well.

However, the Lexicon says so; so it must be true...

** I mean, we all get what its intended to mean in the context of HP so... i dont really care what the FF author uses. Its personal choice. Funny info though...
