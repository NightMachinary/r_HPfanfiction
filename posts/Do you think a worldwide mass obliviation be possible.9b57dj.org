Edit: Do you think a worldwide mass obliviation /is/ possible?

I'm not asking if there's anything in canon to support such a thing, but whether or not you believe if it simply could be possible? If the Fidelius Charm can make any and all people forget information, could wizards obliviate something from all muggles worldwide?

Maybe magic is live streamed across the nation by accident. Maybe a wizard unleashes fiendfyre on a city and destroys it, or muggles nuke a city and wizards decide to step in to make them avoid nuclear war and they do so by erasing the existence of the nuked city.

Could it be done?


** That's hard to say, the magic system Rowling has instilled isn't greatly specified at all in terms of shear feats, going off what fantastic beast has shown mass obliviation all at once is possible but at the scale your asking.....maybe if every wizard in tandem cast it.

** Fidelius Charm. There's nothing anywhere that says that it's restricted to a small place or single house.

For anyone thinking otherwise, I'll point something out. Before Fantastic Beasts people would have argued to death that you can't use an Undetectable Extension Charm to put several large open air biomes into a briefcase. Then the movie comes out and we have just that.

****** My interpretation is the secret is stored in the secret keeper's soul. So when the initial secret keeper dies then only those they told know the location and the secret is stored in each of their respective souls and they become secret keepers themselves. When the last secret keeper dies then the secret no longer has a soul to hide in so it the becomes known to anyone who knew before the Fidelis and learnable to anyone else.

******** People were able to find Godric's Hollow before the Secret Keeper died, so I don't think it disproves that. It's possible that the person who casts the Fidelius Charm is able to bring it down, or perhaps the insane magic on Halloween of 1981 unraveled the Fidelius Charm.

**** I wouldn't say that is the problem with the Fidelius Charm in application to Horcruxes or the prophecy. It's a question of ownership. Both are secrets (which meets the first ownership), but the point of the Fidelius is that the person who has the secret they want to hide has to trust someone else with the secret to protect it. So who owns the secret of Horcruxes or the prophecy? Same for an entire city or whatnot.

** Possible? Yes. Almost anything is possible with the magic in the HP universe.

Think about this: Voldemort's jinx on the DADA position. Whatever he did, it literally sets /fate itself/ to arrive at a particular outcome, that the position will only be held for one year. In other words, Voldemort alone was able to make a particular future event occur repeatedly and jinx the /idea/ of something. Millenia ago, I would have had no trouble calling the man a god. Now imagine what the entire world of mages could do.

More to the point though, the existence of such a thing would also explain the timing of the Salem Witch Trials. At the time, people were traveling around faster and longer all over the globe. Scientific innovation was exponentially increasing in the wake of the Renaissance. And now the muggle violence towards their kind was spreading to the newest piece of undiscovered territory, one that had almost infinite boundaries in the minds of many. Who wouldn't be scared of this?

The various magical leaderships (impromptu no doubt) across the world likely were or already had been trying to segregate the magical and muggle worlds. But maybe the greater awareness led to a plan to perform a single, mass spell on a global scale. Instead of wiping simple memories of living minds, they would change the memories of minds that had already died, changing the recorded histories to remove any links to the magical world.

Why only millenia ago? If a being demonstrated the logic and science defying magic of the HP universe to me, I'd have no issue with calling them a god, for lack of a better term.

Of course, then they would explain to me that there's a whole society with people born with such ridiculous powers, which would put it into perspective... a little bit.

But why would I be any less impressed now than millennia ago by a person turning into an actual cat? Actually I'm probably more impressed because I know how insane that is from a biological and physical standpoint. Ancient people believed all kinds of ridiculous stuff, they'd just adjust to now experiencing one of their tales for real.

** Certainly possible, but probably not the kind of spell that can be found on page 32 of the Standard Book of Spells. I imagine such a feat of magic would require special circumstances/ingredients rather than just a wand and incantation.

On the plus side, there's evidence from Fantastic Beasts that you can also obliviate documents. I've always amused myself with the idea of a wizard obliviating the internet, or putting a curse on it.

Ultimately, however, I think such a mass obliviation would be unnecessary, even in the event of a mass exposure of magic. In that situation, I think wizards could simply have Muggle authorities declare it a hoax, and then the "why Muggles prefer not to know" factor will do the rest of the job. Only conspiracy theorists would continue to believe.

** I mean, sure. If we're not going off of canon, you could make it happen if you want to. It's just a matter of how far off canon you're going, and how 'realistically' you can pull it off.

  they do so by erasing the existence of the nuked city.

This is more than just making people forget something though. There's going to be evidence all over the place that this city existed. A /lot/ more cover up work would be needed.

Right, I just meant a general erasement of knowledge regarding the matter. And depending on if you take Fantastic Beasts as canon, this might not be that difficult.

** Well...in the Ilfracombe Incident, a vacationing family of wizards (the Toke family) were able to Memory Charm everyone on the beach to forget the dragon attack. Though, they did miss one ('Dodgy' Dirk), whose lilo floaty thing was punctured by the dragon.\\
And with the incident at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire, Mr Roberts was heavily disoriented afterwards, in part due to the Memory Charm that was placed on him.

So...perhaps the effectiveness of Obliviation depends on the 'strength' put into the spell and the impact of whatever memory is being removed or broken up.\\
A swooping dragon? Surprising and a bit frightening, probably relatively easy to forget with memory charms. Personal property damaged by the aforementioned dragons? A little more oomph might be needed.\\
The attack on Mr. Roberts on the other hand would have been incredibly frightening, gone on for a while, and probably been painful for him too. Such an shocking event might have been incredibly difficult to obliviate away, and doing so still left a (hopefully temporary) impact on his psyche.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
So, I suppose the question of whether a worldwide Obliviation is possible...maybe it'd depend on the magnitude of the incident?\\
If it were something relatively-mild like, say, somebody vandalising the moon (confusion and curiosity and 'how the heck did that happen' inducing, but not emotionally devastating), it'd /probably/ be possible to obliviate most of the population into forgetting it happened. If you could contact every of-age wizard and get them to do their community, that'd probably solve things right there.\\
Something a lot more devastating though, like, say, a global lycanthropy pandemic, might be a lot harder to Obliviate away, especially if it results in a lot of deaths. You'd need specialised Obliviators to handle the shock, possibly employ memory-potion mist, and if it happened on a global scale there might not be enough bodies to Memory-Charm everyone with sufficient power and skill.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
There's also the question of news sites, personal blogs, the Internet as a whole, gossips on the phone, TV broadcasts...I imagine that on a smaller scale, wizards could hack into individual webpages to hide incriminating things from view or maybe insert 'magic text' that Confounds anyone seeing it, keep tabs on major news outlets to Confound/Obliviate them and hide the evidence when necessary...maybe even save up a bunch of EMP bombs (magical or otherwise) and detonate them to fake a solar storm induced disruption of electronics?\\
Aside from that...wizards don't exactly have good future-sight or find-this-thing magic, Seers being pretty rare, so their chances of preventing a major incident are questionable in the first place. And time travel to change events that have already happened can be risky, so...hmm.

Not sure if it'd be needed. HP magic can work on a conceptual level so there might be a way to remove all that without doing that. Maybe make it so the information is on the internet but anytime a muggle looks at it, it just doesn't register. Like there could be wiki pages right now about magic but we just can't comprehend them.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
