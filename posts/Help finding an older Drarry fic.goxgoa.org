:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this fic, Harry went to America for years after the war, and Hogwarts was closed for repairs. Upon it's reopening, Harry is invited back to be a professor, and Draco is a professor too, but they discover that Hogwarts is covered in curse boobytraps. The boobytraps are essentially words written in invisible magic and knotted into intricate sigils. Harry and Draco have to work together to undo these boobytraps and get over their old prejudices. Does anybody know which fic I'm talking about?
