Just finished C'est La Vie and loved it. Any more Hufflepuff Harry fics? Does anyone know if C'est La Vie will be updated?


** Hufflepuff Harry 1 and 2. Take Shikamaru's (from Naruto) personality and stick it in Harry, and you have it.

Updated? Perhaps someday.

Finished? Not a chance. Cywscross is notorious for starting promising stories, updating frequently for first few chapters, then slower updates, then slower yet... and then he or she starts a new story and begins the process anew.

It's dated, but another Hufflepuff Harry story is [[http://ficwad.com/story/167231][Shake Me]] by RoxySnape.

Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/7/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is a (quite good) female-Harry story where she's sorted into Hufflepuff.

Well, maybe not but he basically forced himself in Hufflepuff. Interesting fanfic, though. It is not complete but actively updating so far. Not the best fanfic though, I'm getting desperate for more fanfics, hah.
