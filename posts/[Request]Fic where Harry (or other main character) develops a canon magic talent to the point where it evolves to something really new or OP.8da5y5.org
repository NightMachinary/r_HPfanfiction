** Hmm...there's more than a few fics out there that have Parseltongue tied to Parselmagic, which is naturally fabulous and powerful in any fic it appears in.

And I wrote a cute little snippet once about Neville Longbottom as a dark lord where he filled his garden with all kinds of hilariously evil plants; the fire-absorbing Pharaohsnake, Whacking Willowroot, a Dark Mandragora that animates everything instead of killing it with its voice, and exploding bamboo.

...And I'm pretty sure I saw a potioneer Harry once who 1) accidentally brought a cleaning potion to life and 2) helped Snape brew an Imperius-dispelling potion, before 3) bringing the Imperius-dispelling potion to life just in time for the Battle of Hogwarts.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
