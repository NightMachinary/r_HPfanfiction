As it says in title. Driven more by belief that they have a duty of continuing their pure bloodlines, rather than any particular feelings of love between them or towards children, Bellatrix and Rodolphus have a child. This child can either Nymphadora's school year or Harry's school year.

When the First Wizarding War ends, through Dumbledore's meddling, this child ends up in Tonks' care rather than Malfoys'. Said kid is raised under pretense of being Dora's sibling with Tonks as last name, until they are confronted by someone in Hogwarts (either Malfoy or Longbottom). Consequently adventures and existential crisis of such character, especially when the Second Wizarding War hits.


** How . . . strict are these guidelines? I have kind of written something very similar already.

*** Just a general suggestion. What I described is optimal version of the premise, but something similar in spirit is welcomed.

**** Well, in that case, at the risk of spoilers, I have the "consequently adventures and existential crisis of such character, especially when the Second Wizarding War hits" part down, and Tonks is heavily involved.

If you like it and it ends up being what you were looking for, great, let me know! If not, no worries. It is . . . more of a thriller/adventure fic. It is a WIP, but I've been updating weekly for like a year now. It is a slight variant on your request, but the spirit is there.

#+begin_quote
  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a young metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** linkffn(12079410) has Tonks as Bellatrix's and, supposedly, Rodolphus's (although it's Cygnus's) daughter. Also is Rudolphus Santa Claus's reindeer?

  What if Dora wasn't really Andromeda's daughter after all? What if someone had just dropped her off on the witch's doorstep? That someone is Bellatrix, and she has her reasons, as always.
