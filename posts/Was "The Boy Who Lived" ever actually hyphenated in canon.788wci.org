** 99% sure it's not. [[https://potterwords.livejournal.com/7980.html][Potterwords]] specifically mentions that You Know Who and He Who Must Not Be Named can be hyphenated or have spaces, but doesn't say the same for BWL. They seem fairly reliable on these things.

([[https://potterwords.livejournal.com/9493.html][Index listing]] for all Potterword sections, for anyone interested.)

** Nope! "Boy Who Lived" was never hyphenated in canon. I think fans just confused it with "You-Know-Who," which often is.
