Thanks!


** linkffn(Saving Connor by lightning on the wave) and the rest of the Sacrifices series goes really in depth about goblin relations and house elf freedom, but it's in amid a ton of other stuff that may or may not be your cup of tea.

  In PoA, Harry broke a cardinal rule of time travel. As years passed and the consequences of it rippled out from that point, time grew increasingly unstable until, as Harry realized he was facing death, continuity broke and time unraveled around him. Redo. PTSD.

  This story was originally posted on ff.net under a different pseudonym with a different title. I took it down for revisions (of which there've been a lot) and decided I'd put it up here instead. There is cover art for this fic on my tumbr.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** If you're looking for bashing, linkffn(The Power of Love by Philosophize) has Dumbledore-bashing play a large part as well as some temporary McGonagall-bashing.

And for house-elves? I've been reading linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and the elves in that are great. Sonya especially.
