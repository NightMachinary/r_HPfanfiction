Sometimes when I'm scrolling through the new Harry Potter submissions on the FFnet app, I'll look at the desktop website and notice that the app is cutting out a lot of new stories.

As far as I know, my filters are the same on the app and desktop. I've adjusted the app settings so I can see M-rated stories, so I'm seeing K through M stories on both the app and desktop.

Anyone know why this is, and if there's a fix for it?


** That, I assume, is a server synchronicity issue, not something you can correct on your end.

Edit: Actually, I'm not sure if this is an issue. I checked again and I'm seeing the two showing the same stories. If anything, the app picked up the newest stories first.
