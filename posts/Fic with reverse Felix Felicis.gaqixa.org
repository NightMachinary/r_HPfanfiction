:END:
Read this fic a while ago, can't seem to find it again.\\
From what I remember a couple of chapters focused on Harry being dosed with a reverse Felix Felicis which invoked bad luck. From memory, he lost his homework and nearly got hit by a chandelier.\\
I think Snape eventually figures out what is happening. Ta!


** I know there's one where Dumbledore doses Harry with Malaclaw venom, which is a key component in Felix Felicis, according to that fix. It might be Faery Heroes?

*** Thanks for trying to help, but that doesn't sound similar, I don't think it's that one. ):
