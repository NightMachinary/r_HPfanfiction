Does anybody have a good recommendation for a fanfic that really shows the strength of Harry, Ron and Hermione's or shows how their friendship grows? (No pairings between the three of them) Because I read “Forging the sword” and “Strangers from another century” ( I think that's what it was called) and loved them so I was wondering if there were others like that.


** I think there was on called 'to end in serenity'

** The Sum or Their Parts is post-Hogwarts and the characterization of the trio and their relationship was amazing
