Hi everyone, I haven't been into HP fanfiction since high school ten years ago, when I wrote and beta-edited HP fanfiction. However, I've just read through the series again and am thirsting for something to read.

I'd love to read what you guys are writing right now, but I do have a couple stipulations as to what I personally like to read.

NO AU. Do not mess with canon. Please do not recommend a story that disagrees with JK Rowling's universe. I'm not interested. (That includes Harry/Hermione fics even though I personally shipped them back in the day. It just seems too weird to me now.)

The fic must be FINISHED. The reason for that is that I myself wrote about half of a sequel to OOTP before abandoning it completely, I'm sure plenty of you have abandoned fics, and I want to read something with a satisfying ending, whether it's a one-shot or multi-chapter masterpiece.

Lastly, the fic must be yours. I know Reddit well, if not this particular sub, and I know that self-promotion is generally frowned upon, which makes it hard to advertise oneself! So please, advertise yourself here!

Some additional notes: I really want to read a good Marauder's fic. I do not particularly enjoy erotica, though sparingly and artfully used it can be very effective.

By the way, I found the link to my 2005 mess of a fanfiction, if you're interested let me know and I'll post it even though it's highly embarrassing to me!


** So you basically want finished, canon-compliant fics. I'm not an author myself, but I do have a few favorites in this genre:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is a very good Year 6 fic from Ginny's POV.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is a very good Year 7 fic from Ginny's POV.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257), is a nice story about what happened immediately after the Battle.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/][Hogwarts Houses Divided]], linkffn(3979062), deals with Teddy Lupin's years at Hogwarts.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327), is interesting because it's a dimensional travel and yet Epilogue compliant.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]], linkffn(4152700), is a very emotional one shot about traumatized people after the War.

** Well all mine are complete and either canon compliant or set after canon without contradicting it. None are new. They are mostly Sirius fics, but no Marauders fics I'm afraid and only one has Harry in it at all. Story details are on my profile if you want to see.

** I usually stay with canon unless I'm writing crossovers or fluffy absurdity. I do, however, also tend to write between the lines of canon. So if I deviate from it, it still means that canon works the same way as in the books. I do, however, tend to prefer after the war stories because there's considerably more room to write.

Some of my favorite canon compliant fics that I've written are as follows:
