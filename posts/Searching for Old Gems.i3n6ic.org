Hello,

I'm not sure I'm doing this right ... I'm searching for old fanfiction, written before HBP or even OotP came out. Basically alternative 5-7 year stories at Hogwarts, but without the information given in the latter books. Any recommendation? (I've read /Melindaleo/'s works.)

EDIT 6 Aug.: Pairings aren't that important and I wouldn't even call myself a Harry/Ginny shipper (though absolutely nothing against the 'ship!); I'd read most stories if they're convincing; I'm normally partial to slash.


** Google Rorshachs Blot. His favorite authors list includes lots of first generation fanfic writers. And he himself was popular among them.

** You got it right. Even tagged properly, so kudos to you. :)

I don't have any specific recs that old, I've only been in the fandom for about 8 months, but I have seen a few threads on this in sub searches.

If you don't know how to do that, then there's a search bar in the top right of the screen (on PC, anyway. I don't know what it looks like on mobile) that if you click on, comes up with two tickboxes 'limit my search to HP fanfiction' and 'include NSFW results'. If you tick both of those and type in your search ('old fanfiction' or 'pre-book finished fanfiction' or similar), you should get some results when people have asked that before.

** Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) was started between GoF and OotP and is wildly AU in ways I really enjoy. It features one of my favorite versions of Moody and Nicolas Flamel, a very different take on dueling, and imo the best version of "Power He Knows Not" including canon. It's unfortunately unfinished, but it wraps up its second act very well and is 100% worth the ride.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) isn't really a great story, but it explores some interesting ideas and definitely goes a different direction than canon and I was willing to keep reading all the way to the end. Not a hard recommend like TPatS, but worth giving it a shot if you're bored.

*** Phoenix and the Serpent is hands down one of the best-quality fics ever written. It's so hard to believe it was written in 2002 considering the average quality of fics back then.

Probably singlehandedly set the stage for all the massive AU gen fics that would start popping up around 10 years later.

**** No, not that I've heard of. They're real strict with underage sexual mentions, and aren't too keen on detailed sex scenes either, though I've seen a few. Other than that though, you should be good.
