Are there any good fics where John Constantine becomes the DADA teacher?

** You're looking for Hellblazer: Hogwarts - linkffn(1980013) - in which John does, indeed, become DADA teacher. It is an absolute /tragedy/ that this was abandoned so early, because the author sets out a literary stall that promises a /masterpiece/.

*** Like a goddamn knife in my heart. I didn't check the last update day until I hit the end, I was hoping maybe it wasn't like, dead-dead, but this has been goddamn mummified and buried in the valley of kings dead. So damn good.

**** I know. Ten chapters, barely out of the prologue and into Act 1, and it's nailing John and the horror of there suddenly being terrorism again in wizarding Britain and it's /exactly/ the kind of black comedy you get when the grimdark of Hellblazer meets the whimsy of the Potterverse and it just. Fucking. Stops.

It's the lit'ry equivalent of blue balls.

And now Voldemort is going to be taken down by literal demons, which will then proceed to mess up the world worse than he ever did.

*** Well, more likely, John notices that Voldemort is a threefold sinner* who has drunk unicorn blood, abused hospitality, betrayed his oath-sworn liege-folk, and defied the gods. John just sort of ... draws the attention of various supernatural powers to a man doing the spiritual equivalent of mountaineering in wet copper armour in a thunderstorm.

* One of the oldest magics there is. If you offend against the priestly, warlike and peasant functions of society, your triple death is foretold as your punishment. Voldemort breaks promises, commits murder and foments revolt.
