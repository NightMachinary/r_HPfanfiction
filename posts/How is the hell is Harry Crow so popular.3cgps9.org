It's so horrible, such a op as fuck Harry with side characters one dimensional as fuck. How is this popular where as other stories barely get attention?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]]

Surely, i'm not the only one that thinks something is wrong with this shit?


** Robst has a niche of fans that have followed him forever. They seem to not mind that his characterization is the same in each fic. Even if Harry isn't raised by Goblins, he's still basically that Harry. The same is true for Hermione, Ron and the rest. Maybe that's so you don't have to think too much while reading one. Shrugs. If I read more than two chapters of his, I start to grind my teeth until my jaw hurts, lol. So, I've never been able to finish one of his stories, dental work is expensive.

*** Boggles the mind, I mean it's grammatically well written last when I had read it but after that it's filled with shit. Not to mention it's like so popular which is unfair to some really well written and well thought out fanfiction that just don't get the same popularity as this shit.

  grammatically well written
#+end_quote

Well, maybe that's part of it--low standards on the part of the readership. When I look at the epilogue chapter of that story, the phrase "grammatically well written" does /not/ come to mind--rather, I see a zillion run-on sentences and missing commas, even without knowing a single thing about the plot. On the two or three occasions on which I tried to read this story in the past, I closed the tab in disgust upon seeing the bad English in the very first chapter, because it utterly broke my immersion. People who even /read/ stories with substandard English--/regardless/ of the quality of those stories' plots--are part of the problem!

**** Does anything interesting happen in regard to the goblin society/culture/economics?

If he's got something original going on there, I can see why people would have stuck it out. I probably would have liked it if I'd read it while the books we're still coming out (that is, when I was younger).

** /To actually answer the question/, rather than rant and kvetch, it's a feel-good fic where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average; and there's lots of it, so you can keep reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

Harmony love is instant and constant: Harry's personality is rewritten to be the perfect gentleman and a scholar (and an utter badass, of course), and Hermione's is stripped away so that all her thoughts and actions can properly revolve around Harry. There is no real tension, no real conflict, no sense of danger, except maybe some occasional peril for Hermione, so that Harry could be a proper Knight in Shining Armour for a chapter. This is not an uncommon pattern in romance generally written by male writers from the White Knight / Nice Guy school of relationships, as well as by female writers from the /Twilight/ school of relationships.

It's telling that all of the above also describes his newest long fic, /You're my Density/. The formula works.

** No idea, but sadly I've read all of it just to have something to read.

I say sadly. It's honestly kind of one of those guilty pleasures, like "This is so terrible, objectively speaking. BUT I CAN'T STOP."

I mean, honestly, it's the only reason why I can kind of see why people like Methods of Rationality - either I can't understand their likes, which is fine, different strokes and all... Or they've already invested so much time reading it, or it's just a trainwreck they can't look away from.

And uh...do you have some recommendations for stories that barely get attention? >.> I'm out of new reads at the moment. :D

Edit: Thanks guys~!! These look fantastic, haha.

**** I will admit I did enjoy it at first... But then dropped it for a long, long, long time...then decided to re-read it.

And it was...not good. I guess when I got into it originally, I could disregard the "beating someone over the head with personal philosophy" (I read Ayn Rand and loved the stories, at one point. Then went back and went "WOAH. How did I miss that?!" on another read.) but when I tried again, I noticed it more from the get go (I knew, roughly, what happened in all the chapters I read...so I saw things I didn't the first time around, I guess.)

Either way, I just couldn't do it. X.X

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]] I'm not a fan of comedy fanfics but this is something amazing i tell ya.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/]] Equal and opposite really amazing dark harry fic. Superb.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=14151]] Out of the night is a really good one too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]] Of course the best other boy who lived fanfic ever written I like to think. But everyone knows it no doubt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] Amazingly well done crossover with the star wars universe, the characters in it feel pretty right to me. I love the HK-47 in it, feels right to me anyway.

What I love about these fanfics is that harry is not OP and is not dark like all of a sudden, feels real at least in a fanfic anyway.

There are a couple more I think but these are really the top of the top of all the fanfics i've come across that to me stood really out as something special. They all have pretty low reviews compared the shit that is on top of the sites which to me is appalling, cause they keep reading crap and this amazing stuff get's unnoticed.

The idea that people are only allowed to like things you approve of makes you an elitist shitbag. You're as bad as the people who say nobody should ever read fanfic, and complain that we should just all read novels and grow up, because liking fanfiction at all must mean something is wrong with us. In fact, you're far, far worse, because as a part of the minority community of people who like fanfic at all, you should really know better than to attack other people for having tastes that aren't identical to yours. I could explain to you why I enjoy Robst, but you know what? I don't have to justify what I enjoy to you, or anyone else.
