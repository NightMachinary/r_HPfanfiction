I'm an American and I know alot of people on this sub have talked about how people using Americanism's and slang are frowned upon, but if I don't feel comfortable trying to use British slang or Britishisms is it alright to just stick with my culture? I know I can also try and use what little I know but for the sake of the writing in the story should I just use what I know?


** not so much the slang, you can try to avoid americanism while not necessarily including british slang. what really bothers me is when the plot revolves around very american issues: such as paying for medical/healer care, or school. or when they eat exclusively american foods. it breaks the "suspension of disbelief". i know it's weird, but people eating alfredo pasta bothers me more than owls and broomsticks...

There are some aspects that changed over time, such as gun ownership laws, which were much looser in 1991 than they are today. (That's why Vernon Dursley could get hold of a shotgun.)

The NHS wasn't founded until 1946, after Tom Riddle graduated, so if you're writing about the Grindelwald war, you can write about private insurance.

On the other hand, you also have things that are common between modern UK and modern US that changed over time -- for instance, rationing was in effect in the UK for a decade past the end of WWII.

** The simple fact that you're taking the matter into consideration is promising enough, to be honest.

Beyond that, I wouldn't worry too much. Simply avoiding Americanisms should be your priority, as opposed to replacing them with "Britishisms". Unless you plan on inhaling hundreds of hours worth of TV/radio shows, that particular rabbit hole is too deep and murky to bother.

Case in point:

"You might wanna stop givin' it all that if you ain't lookin' to get bottled, sunshine."

"Ey jam yuh hype, rudeboy! I'm a skeng man, unuh... /(kisses teeth)/"

Both examples derive from the same region and mean more or less the same thing. Vernon Dursley lives about half-an-hour away by train and wouldn't be caught dead saying either (though his adolescent neighbours might).

So as long as your characters aren't eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while jaywalking with their pants sagging, you should be cushty.

** Always happy to help with Brit-picking. I've beta-read for a few different authors and some want to get things perfectly British while others really aren't interested.

Personally, as long as things aren't /too/ glaring I don't mind some Americanisms but when Harry's saying "gee mom", eating waffles for breakfast and talking about what he's going to do in the "Fall" it breaks the feeling of immersion I have with a good story.

Rowling didn't use very much slang in the books so if you keep your characters similar to the way she wrote them you won't go far wrong.

** Yes, it's alright to stick with what you know. Some people here get really elitist about that kind of crap, and if it's what you prefer in your fiction then fine, but "Americanisms" have zero impact on whether or not your fiction is good. It's all about preference.

Now, if you WANT to go the extra 10 miles and research British slang/euphemisms and find a British beta, that's awesome too. But in the end, it really is just personal preference.
