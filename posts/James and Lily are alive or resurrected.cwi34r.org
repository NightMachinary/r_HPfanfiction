Hello! I'm looking for a good fic where James and Lily (or one of the two) are alive or brought back to life.

There's a lot of fics that don't make sense or are just big unfinished messes, I remember finding only one that was decently written and was believable. Unfortunately, I can't remember the title...

Anyway, If someone could suggest to me some good fics, I'd appreciate it very much!


** I liked linkffn(Blood Binding by SphinxScribe).

The beginning of linkffn(A Different Halloween by RobSt) is rather nice and sweet, but unfortunately it suffers problem of many stories which remove some fundamental problem from the original books (early caught Petter Pettigrew stories suffer from the same problem): JKR's plot is ruined and not many authors are that good to create a new one properly. In this story not only Potters survive and Harry/Hermione grew up together, so it is the instant Harmony ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect][Westermarck effect]] notwithstanding), but also Voldemort actually really dies on that Halloween, because he hadn't read the fine print and the horcruxes don't work one day in the year. The result is rather plotless story with heavy (and I mean heavy) Dumbledore bashing, which end in rather ridiculous finale.

Thank you !! I haven't read any of this, but as much as I like Harmony, I'm not a fan of the trope of them growing up together. It seems a bit unlikely! I'll give it a read anyway.

*** *Westermarck effect*

The Westermarck effect, also known as reverse sexual imprinting, is a psychological hypothesis that people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction. This hypothesis was first proposed by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo.

The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support. Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families.

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Where "don't kill Harry, I'll do /anything/" is interpreted slightly differently and Lily gets recruited as Death Eater to keep Snape from rebelling and to raise Harry with different loyalties. Voldemort's little psychology experiment takes some interesting turns as "Elena" becomes more feared than Bellatrix.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Lily eventually comes back thanks to her preparations and some soul magic.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  When Voldemort came to kill Harry, Lily met him with a SIG Sauer pistol she bought at a pawn shop. Seems Dark Lords die as easily as anyone else when you empty two clips into them. Hailed as the savior of the Wizarding world, Lily has a live baby, a dead husband, the personal enmity of most of the Dark Lord's followers, and not the slightest idea how to put her life back together. Phoenixes have it easy. Burn, die, rise from the ashes. For humans it's a bit different. Sort of.

  It feels like a betrayal of her boys to even live on without them, let alone start to build a life of her own. There is a nasty little voice in her head that says, he wouldn't try so hard to move on-- and the thing is, she knows it's true, that if their positions were reversed, he'd dwell on the loss of her, of Hari, to his last breath.But she is not Janardhan, and she cannot function like that, living a shadow of a life, walking in the footsteps of ghosts. So she takes a deep breath, and works to make her worst hell into a world she still wants to live in.
