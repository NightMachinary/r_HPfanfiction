I just want a WBWL fic where Harry and the false BWL or GWL are loving-ish siblings, James and Lilly love both children and do their best, Dumbledore isn't being evil, manipulative and/or incompetent, and above all else Harry does not get shipped off to live with the Dursley's because no one can be bothered to rear this child just because he isn't wizard Jesus.

Bonus points if no one thinks Harry is some anti-christ demon to be dealt with and the other Potter kid isn't some obese trilby-wearing near-squib who reeks and thinks that they are perfect and all should worship them. (Believe it or not, I have seen both in at leadst a half dozen fics and it kinda makes me lose faith in humanity a bit.)

Thanks for the help.

Harry and the twin are loving siblings. Younger siblings are also loving. James and Lily aren't perfect by any means, but you can /kinda/ accept the rift between them and Harry... or at least /I/ can accept that it's plausible even if I personally couldn't stick my head in the sand instead of caring for a dying child. It avoids most of the infuriating tropes, and while I did want to smack the back of Dumbledore's head during the fic, there wasn't really any bashing there either. That being said, I really really liked this fic.

  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.

The one below isn't the wrong BWL, but Harry is a squib so all of Voldie's wrath falls on Neville. It's part 2, and happens after part 1 but you can ignore that, the important bits Harry will explain himself. One of the best fics i've ever read.

Which has got that bashing initially.... and that's what I love about it. Listen I know what you asked for but I've been loving this fic because its been bashing that's changes as they learn about harry. Haven't finished it so don't know if its been completed.

​

Don't know if you have read this but it's one of the most popular fics that seems to hit the notes of what you are after and yet is sooooo damnnn good. Know for a fact that it isn't completed but still such a good read and deserves a follow.

*** Three black birds has sadly been abandoned and adopted by a different author. But the original author still posts outlines of the upcoming years instead of new chapters. The reveal is in the outline but seems to be tastefully done, contrary to the popular clichés. Would recommend this fic especially in this context.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  The overall biggest problem with WBWL is the split between parents and one of the siblings, because no parent would ever do that, especially to a toddler.
#+end_quote

Actually, that kind of child abuse happens in real life. Here are a few of the more high profile cases:

- [[https://www.smh.com.au/world/memories-of-a-family-at-war-20050329-gdl0o8.html][Dave Peltzer]]

- [[https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Parents-allegedly-targeted-boy-13-for-long-term-1816069.php][A 13 year old boy in Houston, Texas]]

- [[https://disinherited.com/probate-litigation/dysfunctional-families-scapegoat-child-sues-parents-wins/][A 20 year old who won a lawsuit over childhood abuse]]

It's a common enough phenomenon that psychologists have a word for it: '[[http://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=co_faculty][scapegoating]]'. In fact, the actions of the Potters in fanfiction are mild compared to the worst cases of parental favoritism/emotional abuse in real life.

***** You bring up some interesting points. I've read a few fanfics which critically examine the fact that the Potters /chose/ to stay and fight rather than put the safety of their child (or children) first. In canon we learn little to nothing about the lives of Lily and James after they graduated Hogwarts, so fanfiction authors often fill in the blanks in whatever way they think will create an interesting story.

Lily and James had an acrimonious relationship during school, and during the war they must have been under immense stress due to fearing for their lives, fearing that friends may have turned on them, and forced into isolation in close quarters, so an author who doesn't want to portray the Potters as a pleasantly loving couple could easily draw analogies with the kinds of marital problems that have lead to scapegoating in real life.

However, it's difficult to portray that sort of abusive relationship dynamic realistically. Most fanfic authors resort to depicting James and Lilly as flat caricatures rather than showing their complex inner lives, i.e. the unhealthy emotions and rationalizations that we'd see in real-life abusers.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
