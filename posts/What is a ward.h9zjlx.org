In canon, the only real instances of wards are the protective enchantments around Hogwarts and the Harry's blood protection. Even then wards are so common in fanfics that it has now become a widely accepted headcanon for most readers.

With that in mind, according to you, what is a ward, how is it cast and what are your headcanons about warding?


** In the fanon, "ward" tends to mean "invisible magic walls with filters programmed into them".

In canon, when a wizard protects a place they have a diverse stable of methods open to them. Replacing all of these interesting and varied effects with "invisible magic walls with filters programmed into them" is, in my opinion, a terrible downgrade from canon.

The Shield Charm is basically the equivalent to the fanon "wards" (including its ability to block different things depending on what the caster wants it to do), which kinda says it all: what in canon is a single spell among a variety of choices, fanon turns into the only choice. In the canonical system, wizards might also:

- Prevent you from finding the location in the first place.

- Prevent you from entering the location by creating physical barriers with magical properties. Consider: instead of having a invisible magical wall, put up a stone wall (which you enchant to be unbreakable), and then add anti-flying and anti-apparition jinxes. This is how Hogwarts keeps people out in canon.

- Allow you to enter the location, but curse you for doing so e.g. Egyptian tombs.

- Allow you to enter the location, but have spells within the location to frustrate your objective e.g. some kind of Cretan labyrinth.

- Place magical traps to harm you within the location e.g. Voldemort's curse on the Slytherin ring.

- Have dangerous creatures/plants either at the entrance or inside the location to harm you.

- Allow you to enter the location, but require certain acts of you to permit you to reach your objective.

A rich variety of protections is, I think, objectively superior as a piece of worldbuilding to uniform deployment of invisible walls. And I think that protections that are rooted in a physical object like a wall will feel more authentically Harry Potter in tone than a dome of invisible magic.

It's not that the dome of invisible magic is impossible (see DH camping spells) but rather that most locations we see that are magically protected in a permanent, long term way tend to integrate those protections into the physical architecture of the place itself (Hogwarts has walls, Egyptian tombs have traps, the HBP cave has a stone wall then a lake then the basin).

One other notable aspect of many canonical protection spells is that they are not cast on a physical space but rather upon an /address/. The Fidelius being the best example here. You can have spells on a location without those spells forming any kind of "barrier effect" with a physical edge/perimeter - rather, the scope of the spell's effect is defined by the legal fiction of the property's boundary - perhaps you cast the spell on the property's deed, rather than on the physical space.

*** Canon also relies a lot on the presence of powerful wizard to keep locations safe.

Like Hogwarts wasn't safe from Voldemort because of some super powerful enchantments, but because its the place where Dumbledore lived and the Order relied on their members to protect the Hall of Prophecy, despite their almost certainly being magical protections in place.

*** All of these are also used as wards in fanfics, I've seen examples them all.

People say wards because they related it to D&D and other media where there's stuff like Hearthstones/Wardstones that are used to "anchor" a protective magic to a place, depending on the fic they apply some other principles.

Canon Enchantments and Spells may give readers a sense of non-permanence, like when people raise those jinxes during combat situations. Since there's no anchor the spell would need to be recast.

So I think the big difference is that wards give a sense of permanence, since they refer to anchor methods too.

*** What's to say that all of the protections you mentioned are simply made more permanent to become "wards"? For instance, I see all of the protections being cast as being temporary where the strength of the caster determines how long they last (kind of how Harry must return to Privet Drive every summer to renew those protections). Whereas those same protections become "wards" when they are "anchored" to something whether it is a "wardstone" or carved runes. Again, the strength of the wards are initially determined by the strength of the caster, but the longer the wards exist around magic the stronger they get.

However, I don't see wards as being impenetrable rather the more they are attacked the weaker they can become. Basically think of the wardstones as very big batteries and the attacks drain power from them. Eventually the attacks drain more magic from the wards then can be replaced by ambient magic and the wards weaken until they shatter on the next attack. (Just like shield charms fail in canon).

Most of the fics that i have read that use wards take this route ie., wards are not these permanent inpenetrable invisible shields.

** A ward is a charm that has been anchored to an area, so it will no longer expire after a duration. The most common types of ward anchors are runestones, but other types of anchors exist.

An excerpt from one of my fics where Flitwick briefly explains warding.

#+begin_quote
  “But...” My mind is still reeling. “The statute still exists, right? I thought charms couldn't be permanent unless they were anchored by something...”

  “Correct again, Mister Potter. The anchoring of charms is the basis of creating wards. Most wards are anchored to runestones, although there are a few that use other methods of anchoring. Have you ever heard of the Fidelius charm?" I shake my head, so he continues his explanation. "The Fidelius charm is a powerful piece of magic used to ward an area, or in rare cases, knowledge. It removes all knowledge of that thing from the minds of everyone in the world, except for a person who is designated as a 'secret keeper'. In this case, the secret keeper serves as the anchor for the charm, or more specifically, the secret keeper's ability to keep that information secret. From that point on, they are the only one who can reveal the existence of that secret to anyone else."

  "So... the Statute of Secrecy is a giant Fidelius charm hiding the existence of magic?"

  "Not quite. The Statute was based on the Fidelius charm, but it is different. After all, if it was a Fidelius, then there would only be a single secret keeper, and therefore, only one person in the whole world would be able to tell muggleborns and their parents about magic, which would be beyond impractical. No, instead, the Statute hides the existence of magic from everyone who does not believe in magic."

  It finally clicks with me. "So, the anchor for the spell that hides the existence of magic from muggles... is muggles' refusal to believe in magic?"

** The word “ward” meaning something like protective enchantments is never used in whole heptalogy (just checked with search through all books; the word is used mostly as a section of hospital or the hospital ward at Hogwarts). Protective enchantments like that are around Hogwarts and 12 Grimmauld Place (I guess 4 Privet Drive is a bit /sui generis/ situation).

The idea of wards everywhere is completely brought from some other fantasy universes (not sure, which ones).

Concerning headcannons: I guess something like that has to exist. Heavily armed people living together (I always see the Wizarding Britain to be somehow similar to the Wild West ... everybody eleven years and older, male or female, is as heavily armed as anybody else) had to spent a lot of time and effort on protecting themselves. However, if you extend this idea too much, it kills any story you can develop, because life turns into an accounting exercise of who has them longer. So, I would tend to limit use of wards by the quality ones being extremely expensive (warding stones from one quarry in the Northern Norway jealously protected by the colony of Norwegian Ridgebacks, specific design for each place, etc.), so for example Weasleys cannot afford one on The Burrow.

** In fanon terms, "Ward" most often means "semi-permanent nebulous forcefield that protects something". Usually the creation of a ward in this sense requires placement/inscription of runes, and almost never does it matter what actually happens when someone tries to grab the warded object or enter the warded location without first being "let in" by whomever has control over the ward.

In a broader sense (and one that I personally prefer), the term "ward" is basically just a shorthand for any long-term magical protection. This definition includes things like the Age Line around the Goblet of Fire, the spells The Trio casts on their campsite during the Horcrux Hunt, the Fidelius Charm, and the movie-verse dome shield the teachers place around Hogwarts before the final battle.

In my headcanon, at some point, "Wards" was a class at Hogwarts that was later divided between DADA and Charms, depending on whether the spell in question had potentially harmful effects or not. Since the semi-official classification of Charms, Jinxes, Hexes and Curses, it's considered archaic to refer to a spell as "Ward".

** It's another word for "Permanent Magical Protections". I use them as - generally layered - defences on a static location, at times anchored by runes/wardstones. In practice, I use them as a series/web of spells, often interlinked. Curse-breakers deal with them and can disable them, but they are vulnerable while doing so - like defusing a bomb. It's not a forcefield, but can be one if such a spell is included. I also assume that electronics don't work inside wards, and that wards grow stronger with age.

** If you've ever read The Santi's Harry Potter and the boy who lived, it has a good explanation that I accept whole heartedly.

That said there are some tropes about warding I absolutely despise and any fic that has them better be a masterpiece in every other regard or I will drop it instantly.

1. “You need runes to build a ward.” No you don't. Runes are just letters. You read them. They have no magical properties themselves.

2. “You need to preform a ritual.” No. Rituals are something else entirely and are separate from wards.

3. “Arithmancy is involved in a major way.” It most certainly is not. Arithmancy deals with the magical properties of certain numbers. It might explain to you why you need to stir a potion this or that many times or why seven is a lucky number but there is no mathematical formula that will automatically build you a ward.

4. “You need a wardstone.” It's just spells. You don't need magic stones for any other spell. Harry and Hermione cast protective enchantments every time they set up camp in DH and they never once had to ‘anchor' their spells.

I really like the idea that magic is something you have to learn through a lot of hard work and the idea that there is a quick and easy formula for a ward doesn't sit right with me. Magic is supposed to be about intent, knowledge and intuition. And wards, which are supposed to be high level magic (as in ‘probably not something you would even delve into deeply while you're at Hogwarts'), should require all that much more effort. A “runic array” cheapens that in my mind.

*** Agree with this to an extent.

I definitely don't think you "need" runes to set a ward, but it's possible that to make it more permanent, etching certain runes onto the physical object or area you want to protect could help.

Arithmancy isn't needed to cast a ward, but it may help you work out what you need to do to create the exact ward you're looking for.

Rituals - meh. The only thing we really see that is anything like a ritual is Voldemorts resurrection, so I don't even know if they're widely used. Potentially older wizarding families have protection rituals, which could be a kind of ward, but yeah I agree that the idea that warding is inherently ritualistic rather than just a protective spell doesn't fit with the magic JKR created.

Ward stones are something I've always imagined exist in places that need warding permanently or where the wards will be updated and improved - like Hogwarts. The spells around the tent that they do in DH are meant to be dismantled when they leave so are working off their magic while they're in the location. But something like Hogwarts that's had, for example, Muggle repelling wards on it for all time, I think those wards are probably anchored to something so that they still protect the building even if the person who cast them is not at Hogwarts or they die or whatever.

So yeah, I agree that in general a ward is just a protective spell, but I don't get put off by writers using runes, ward stones or anything because they can be explained away as making the wards more permanent or strengthening them.

*** All of what you said is using concepts that are an afterthought in canon, I don't think JKR ever intended for them to be that important.

People just picked concepts from other franchises and incorporated them.

1-Runestones(and that includes "magical" practices in the real world) can be used to anchor magic to a place in a more permanent manner. Runes were always associated with magic when mentioned(The Scandinavians believed Odin/Wotan used magicks through his knowledge of them), we also have lots, lots of franchises who use some kind of runic language as the programming language for magic, also, Tolkien.

2-You could have a spell that requires a ritual to be cast, perhaps a blood ritual for a blood ward, what's the problem with that?

3-This is something that I think fanon was more creative than canon, by a lot, JKR's Arithmancy is basically Numerology(but the name is associated with charlatans so she used another) which is a phony way of using numbers to predict or analyze stuff, fanon Arithmancy is using math and calculus to understand magic, stuff like Divine Geometry, Law of Equivalency, and things like that, MUCH more interesting, useful and difficult can also be used to spell creating(which is a very murky thing in canon). It also fits the name of Arithmancy.

4-Again, this is a concept where you have to anchor a spell to something physical so it's permanent in an area, you can say Harry and Hermione's protections would linger for days instead of months/years.

And canon magic is /very/ plot-oriented, how can it be intent oriented when Harry can cast Sectumsempra effectively while not having the foggiest idea of what it did or not having even tried it before? What is needed to create a spell? Is it the Latin-ish language? Similar to Eragon where the universe basically has a command line? What about other countries/cultures? Alohomora? Avada Kedavra? If not the words, then how did Snape assigned Sectumsempra to cut people up in such a way Harry could cast it on Draco without even knowing what it did? Did Snape use a method to "file" the spell on the universe's list?

Honestly, unless you leave magic alone, or limit yourself, expanding and adding to magic in a story is essential, rituals, wardstones, arithmancy, all these can add to the complexity of spell crafting and casting, can open up avenues for new plots. All these JKR left pretty open in canon, and limiting people to follow her extremely plot-oriented view just hurts the story?

Of course, people can screw that up and make it OP, but I think expanding and establishing a magic system is one of the first steps in making a good story where magic is used in important ways.

**** Regardless of her intentions, this is the world she gave us. You're right that incorporating other magical systems isn't a bad thing. What gets me is that the original system is not explored with only in-universe mechanics and anytime someone comes to a road block they try to cram in a fix from another work that doesn't match the themes or context of the canon material.

For instance, the concept of magical cores. There is never any mention of this in the books. Magic is not a finite resource in HP. This means your magic can only be affected by your emotions and how much you actually know about the spells you're casting. This is character building material. Say You're writing a story and Harry and Ron become enemies. What's more interesting: Harry can't cast a spell because it saps too much mana or he can't cast it because it's a dark spell that requires negative intent and he can't bring himself to use such a spell on someone he considered to be his best friend for a long time regardless of his betrayal?

As for Arithmancy being used to understand magic, I think that doesn't fit the world of Harry Potter. HP magic is meant to be mysterious. If you can use numbers to deduce magical effects then they are no longer magical. That's now science. It takes the mystery out of the concept. No one is supposed to know where magic comes from and Arithmancy is the magical world's attempt to spot patterns in magic and to try to understand it. This is what makes HP magic so unique.

Last note, you're right about sectumsempra. It makes absolutely no sense, but I always just thought it was a mistake used to move the plot forward.

Nah, it's taught in a school, it has patterns and children can do it, it's just left unclear so it doesn't block the plot because JKR wasn't keen on writing herself into a corner because of something she wrote two books before. HP Magic is not defined enough. LOTR magic is mysterious. It's not a bad thing, but it makes keeping it consistent in fanfic with worldbuilding difficult, and you have to make stuff up.

I doubt we can know how to create a spell from canon, or answers to things like, how do the Japanese cast Wingardium Leviosa? Do they have to pronounce it right? Or do they have their own version? Do they all use the same spells? Expelliarmus, a Latin expression, even in millenar Korea?

Honestly the idea you need some math to do it, using it to discern what kind of words and movements you need to convey the intent, and when you practice it a lot you can cast it on intent and wand alone.

We call those plot holes, but in this case, it's a justifiable one. I don't think it repeats itself though, all other spells I remember have at least the purpose defined.

****** Not sure about the spell's look matters much. It's just how it is. As for incantations and wand movements, HBP and DH make it pretty clear that these things aren't really necessary. They're more training wheels than anything else.

As for things needing to be defined, I don't know that that's entirely necessary. Like you said LOTOR doesn't have concrete laws. Same thing with the last air bender. These are soft magic systems where the rules are flexible. That said, HP does have fundemental laws like Gamp's laws of elemental transfiguration. There was also that one thing mentioned in HBP about how you choose the potions ingredients necessary for an antidote depending on the quantity and type of ingredients used for the poison. It has its own frame work that a writer can take from.

You bring up a good point about the language of spell casting though. I'd like to see a fic that delves into other magical cultures of other countries that doesn't devolve into “these people don't have wands so they mastered wandless magic and now Harry has mastered it too.” Pretty sure the whole point of wands is that magic cast without them is wild and unreliable.

******* LOTR has a soft magic system but it doesnt use magic to solve problems, Avatar has a middling but leaning towards hard magic system (only 1 element, requires movement, no cost except for the energy used to do the movement) as the magic of Avatar is used to solve the plot.

Harry potter also uses magic to solve the plot and thus has a need to be defined, as according to Brandon Sanderson the effectiveness with which magic can be used to solve a problem is directly affected by the audiences understanding of said magic. So HP magic should not be mysterious. I suggest watching HelloFutureMe on youtube for a better explanation.

I'd call that whole “bone of the father, flesh of the servant...” thing a ritual. What else would you call it? Who knows what other rituals they could have?

There could be multiple types of protective enchantments, with the longer-lasting ones requiring expensive materials like wardstones. Why not?

******* The Graveyard thing had elements of a ritual - like Wormtail speaking the words was a massive part of what was happening. A ritual is a formal ceremony of any kind in which things are done in a specific order, often at a specific location. The base of the potion already existed, but it seems that adding the final things (bone, flesh, blood) was a ritual to activate it, because it had a specific word form and so on, which potions don't normally have.

In potions class, they don't stand there incanting "gunge of the flobberworm, squashedly removed, you will cure my boils" do they?

If you want to believe that the runes on Dumbledore's pensieve were just decoration, and had no magical power, go right ahead. It's just as valid an interpretation to say that the runes were what made it work. We never see a pensieve that works without runes.

I don't see how the use of dictionaries means runes are just a language, with no magical power. Programming languages are languages, with their own vocabularies, and they have power to actually do things. Writing a computer program is essentially translating an idea into a programming language. Then the program does things.

  *A Pensieve is a wide and shallow dish made of metal or stone, often elaborately decorated or inlaid with precious stones,* and carrying powerful and complex enchantments.

******* Charms is not a made up word either... Does this mean that they study charms in the context of whatever we mean by it?

We are talking about a magical world with completely different rules than what we are used to. Just because we can deduce a meaning from the title of the subject doesn't mean we know everything about it.

Also, it is completely possible that Hermione was more interested in the theory of the subjects than their applications. Maybe they do not cover the real world uses of these subjects until higher classes and she doesn't know about it in third year. Remember that Hermione is a 13 year old child when she talks about her courses, not a master of the subject.

Yes, definitely, just look at the first Paragraph of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_charm][Wikipedia article for charms]].

#+begin_quote
  An incantation, a spell, a *charm*, an enchantment or a bewitchery, is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_formula][magical formula]] intended to trigger a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural][magical]]) effect on a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person][person]] or objects. The formula can be spoken, sung or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chant][chanted]]. An incantation can also be performed during ceremonial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual][rituals]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer][prayers]]. In the world of magic, incantations are said to be performed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy][wizards]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft][witches]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy][fairies]].[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation#cite_note-:0-1][[1]]]
