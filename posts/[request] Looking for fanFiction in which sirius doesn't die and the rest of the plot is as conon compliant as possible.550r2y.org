Just reread OOTP again. I'd really like to read something that deals with what might have happened if Harry had used the two way mirror or gone straight snape etc.


** This is a tough one! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261750/1/Misplaced-Moony][*Misplaced Mooney*]] has this, but there is a fair bit of divergence from canon after Sirius is saved because of the addition of young-Remus. It is also a WIP, but a great fic that I highly recommend. linkffn(11261750)

Another canon-compliant where Sirius doesn't die exactly is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][*Choices* by Aebbe]]. It isn't because of the mirrors, but rather because of an interesting time travel plot device. I don't want to give too much away though. Linkffn(5846417)

  A mysterious item and mischievous Marauders end up accidentally shoving Remus Lupin into another time and place where he has to rebuild his life from scratch, deal with the aftermath of a war he hadn't yet been a part of, all with the help of new friends and a special young witch. Remione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. (Remus/Hermione) *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)
