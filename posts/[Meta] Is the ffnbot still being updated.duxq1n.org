****** As someone who works in that industry, it's one of the few corporate policies that I almost don't mind. At minimum it has a solid basis in reality, unlike a lot of other really dumb policies I have to deal with.

****** Eh, I kinda get it honestly. The general idea is 'what if he accidentally leaks something that compromises an important system somewhere' through people being able to dig through his open source program.

It's not like he /can't/ work on something like this. He just can't keep it open source. Combine that with the fact that he didn't have the time to keep updating and bugfixing it alone, and he decided to let development continue without him and he would continue to host the bot.

****** Yeah it's a dumb rule, but these companies don't want employees potentially moonlighting/prioritizing side projects that might be successful at the expense of their daytime job. Obviously a fanfic bot is an extreme application of this policy

******* I am a developer, but the only restriction the company I work for puts on me is that I will not use company resources, namely laptops, workstations, MSDN licensed software, etc, to work on non-work related projects.

I'm still allowed to clock off, go home, open my personal laptop up and start hacking away at something without worrying about my employer. This policy seems extremely harsh. Is this normal in the USA?

********* Why would a company be concerned about that at all? Why is it their business? Can they police charitable donations or volunteer hours too? What sort of ancap nightmare is corporate America?

I mean, it would be one thing if it was something that was being used to generate revenue. But an open-source project with no commercial application in sight?
