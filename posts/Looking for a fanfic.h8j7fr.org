:END:
Hey Guys

Like the title says i am currently looking once again for a specific fanfic that i once read.

In this fic at one point in time the i believe quidditch statium is attacked by the whole acrumantula colony. I think harry was at odds with dumbles in this one and dumbles tried to sacrifice harry to the acrumantulas while harry was casting some impressive magic.

i also seem to remember that there was something important about a phoenix but i am not sure if it was Fawkes or another one.

Does one of you have any idea which fic that might have been?

Can you recommend another fanfic where harry and friends fight in larger open battles? maybe against Beasts/Monsters or Death Eaters?

Kudos!


** I believe the story is called From Ruin by GraeFoxx

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
