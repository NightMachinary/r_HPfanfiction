I watched the "Dexter" series again. In S07E08, Debra confess to her Adoptive Brother, that she has fallen in love with him. He is totally shocked and confused by this revelation, also since Debra is just his sister for him. It reminded me to Harrys "She is like a sister to me" confession for Ron. Now, i want to know if there are fics that have Hermione falling for Harry and shocks (or rather confronting) him with suchs a Revelation, since the Books are from his POV and Harrys statement only counts for HIM, we (and of course, he) dont know how she feels (even if its from his observations clear how it is, but emotions change during time). So she is more or less devastated by her own feelings and he is speechless. It can also be vice-versa. Harry leaves Ginny, because he detect that, despite his statement for Ron, he grows feelings for Hermione. I imagine some Scenarios, but i think Harry will isolate himself from his Friends and Weasleys, question himself for all the Years in School and possibly growing negative Emotions about Ron (not because the said Person, will be angry at Harry for steeling his Girlfriend/wife, but because he will accuse him for steeling the ONE Achievement, he reached without Harry and his so-called Friend takes this away from him. This "feared" reaction will lead Harry to be angry (if not to say: hate) his Friend, without the Red-Head knowing this at all). Anyway, Harry will isolate himself and ignore his Friends calls. Possibly take a Pensieve and rewatch the common Memories with himself and Hermione, especially the Locket Scene. Maybe one evening Hermione will visit, take a glimpse at the scene and Harry will confess his feelings for her. This confession could also happening much earlier and with a not so angry Harry (he is still, angry but not to such a rate).

Ok, very much details for Harrys scene. But im ok, for any fics that has this one-sided Love revelation in it (fics with Harry or Hermione confess this feeling to her/himself in his/her thoughts doesnt count, it has to be revealed in front of the other). If its a long fic, i would gladly only want to know the chapter.


** Well, I've written a scene similar to that in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/12/Divided-and-Entwined][chapter 12 of my story "Divided and Entwined"]], though it involves both Harry and Ron confessing to Hermione, who is rather disturbed by that.

*** Aha! I came in here to recommend this.

To be honest, the big difference (look at me, presuming to tell you about your own writing), isn't that Harry or Ron's (not spoiling anything, though, honestly, it's in the tags which kind of spoiled the whole drama of it, for me) love was unrequited by Hermione, but that she could, obviously, only choose one (in her mind, anyways) and she felt more compatible so far as what she wanted in the future with one of them.
