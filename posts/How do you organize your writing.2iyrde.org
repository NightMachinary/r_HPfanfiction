I literally have a massive word doc. (I know, I know.) The first half is organized by chronology and central character, and the second half is just different ongoing projects and larger multi-character fics.

^{^{^{^{I've}}}} ^{^{^{^{got}}}} ^{^{^{^{a}}}} ^{^{^{^{system}}}} ^{^{^{^{okay?}}}}


** Generally speaking I'll have:

a) A planning document

b) A separate document for each chapter of the fic (they need to be separate docs to upload to FF.Net anyway)

c) A master doc which is all the planning and all the chapters, which acts as a back-up.

I tried the single doc approach with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]], planning and writing all the chapters in a single large document, and by the end of the fic it was getting ridiculous. The document (on Google Docs) was taking ages to load up fully.

*** Do you have somewhere to write random ideas for fics, like a brainstorming doc?

*** I use Google docs as well with multiple files for planning, character descriptions, chapters, and helpful information such as British slang, spells, and other reference material. Then there's an idea mapping app I use called Simplemind to see the bigger picture, which saves in the cloud like docs.

It's really nice never having to worry about saving files or losing anything.

** I use [[http://zim-wiki.org/][zim desktop wiki]]. I write out ideas in it then make a page for each fict. Each of those pages have subpages on backstories, timeline, rough and refined outlines, terms I may use [AU ficts are murder!] and random inspiration. It's easy to set up, use, and it's portable and small so you can take it anywhere. Available on linux and windows [not sure about mac though].

I used to do the one doc thing [I still do for original work because it's usually collabs and those are easier to maintain in one document] but really it get's annoying when you ahve twenty pages of plans and no content. AGH

** One overarching folder (fiction), subfolders (the fiction)

If I ever write more than 10 fics I'll make subfolders for each series I've written for and move my current subfolders into the new ones, a la the fanfiction.net organization.

Which I have saved on dropbox so I can work on it from anywhere.
