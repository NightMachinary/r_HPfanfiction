Hello good afternoon to everyone

I could recommend fics with this theme, although there is one in particular that I would like to find, where Hermione is a slave but manages to escape and ends up finding Draco and help hiding her in his apartment.

​

Thank you very much for your help!

​

I'm sorry my English is not so good, I'm using the help of a translator.


** Sounds like Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria which has been deleted
