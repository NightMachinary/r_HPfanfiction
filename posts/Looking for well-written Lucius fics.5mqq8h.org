I'm writing a story that features Lucius heavily and I want to do some /study/ on what those authors did to bring their Lucius Malfoy to life.

It doesn't have to be a good-guy Lucius, or even feature Lucius as an antagonist, I would like the story to have an /authentic/ Lucius that you can believe.


** "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), has a great Lucius Malfoy. He was a major antagonist, but also very cunning and ruthless. He outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981, and managed to rule magical Britain for almost 20 years. Unfortunately for him, Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance, and his rule relied a little too much on lies and deceits.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Narcissa knows there is another woman - but when she learns who and why, she must make hard choices to bring them all through a hell of someone else's making. A journey of silent dignity and selflessness. Narcissa's perspective on The Blue Vial. (You can read this on its own, but if you're going to read both, it's better to read Blue Vial first).

** This might or might not be what you're after. Lucius isn't the central focus of the story, but he factors prominently into it.
