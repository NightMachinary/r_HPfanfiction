** Harry gets adopted and his adoptive parents spend a big chunk of his childhood in Hawaii before moving back to England. It's in the background though and not the focus on the story.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** I haven't seen surfer dude Harry but I've seen Surfer Dude Snape. He survives the war, moves to LA and starts a coffee shop. He has a son who ends up dating Hugo Weasley. Not that interesting a fic but it had decent dialogue

  An AU look at how the MSF might have gone differently for Beth and Daryl. Recapitulation chronicles Beth and Daryl's journey and discovery of each other and themselves in the midst of a mission to end the plague devouring humanity. They will have to come to terms with being abandoned by their family, dealing with a baby, and deciding what they mean to each other along the way.
