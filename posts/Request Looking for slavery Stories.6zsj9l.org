So I don't know why, but I enjoy reading slavery stories, they're just interesting to me. (Don't judge me please).

Characters I'd like to see be enslaved (again don't judge me please).

Draco Malfoy

Severus Snape

Remus Lupin

Sirius Black

Neville Longbottom

Ronald Weasley

If there's any other character (Not Harry, unless he's minor character), read a few enslaved Harry stories). But if there's any good fics out there with other characters let me know!

Would rather the story to be more serious, but it can be non serious if it's good enough. Any rating is fine. And who the characters are enslaved to that I mentioned doesn't matter.


** Reverse, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/]]), has Draco, as well as most other pureblooded children iirc, enslaved; it basically flips most of canon's social hierarchy & good/evil to something of an extreme.

  Following the end of the War, Death Eaters are sentenced to lives of servitude. Although Severus was determined not to break, he cracks at the treatment that he endures. After rescuing him from harsh conditions, Harry is left to pick up the pieces, and must grow up far too fast. Slow-paced SS/HP.
