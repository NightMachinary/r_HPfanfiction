:END:
It took place during 4th year. Some (or all) of the Gryffindors set up a knowledge exchange session with people from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. They talked about the different ways their societies worked. Hermione or someone else asked how the French and Eastern Europeans handle Muggle-born students. The French apparently Obliviated the parents and sent the Muggle-borns to magical familes while any potential Muggle-borns that /could/ go to Durmstrang were killed off (maybe their families as well?). Hermione was shocked and the response from one of the Durmstrang students was "the weak must be culled" or something to that effect.

Any ideas?
