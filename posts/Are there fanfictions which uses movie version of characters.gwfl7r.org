**** In my reading experience it varies from character to character

​

Ive found many writers like the idea of tall Harry who inherited the looks of both his parents. However ive read fics that have that but also have say Draco who is clearly modeled on Tom felton or Hermione looks like Emma Watson or goes through a mke over to become the Emma watson version

​

Its the same if they want to bash Ron..........he becomes like the dimwitted film version

**** They're the same, for the most part. I'm not really certain how you could tell if the characters were their movie counterparts rather than the book versions. The films didn't change the characters all that much. They just trimmed the plot to fit it into the movie format.

****** I don't think I've ever read a fanfic where Harry had blue eyes. I've read plenty where Hermione was hot and Ron stupid.

I'm really not sure how much physical attractiveness matters in a text based medium.
