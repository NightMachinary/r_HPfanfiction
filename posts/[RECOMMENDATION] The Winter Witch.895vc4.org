I'm honestly usually not a huge fan of crossovers, but to me this is masterfully done. This story follows post-Second Wizarding War Hermione through Westeros as she helps Robb Stark and the Northern Army. The author (Kneazle on fanfiction.net and writing_as_tracey on AO3) just finished Part I and is taking a couple months' break to plot out Part II, but I assure you it is worth the read! There is realistic romance (i.e., not the entire focus and slow burn), lots of action, and a Hermione who is not OOC.

** I tried reading this one because I like this type of crossover. However, I could hardly get past the first two chapters because I felt like Hermione's attitude did not match the situation. Even if she was an experienced witch (but how experienced can she be at 19?) I can't imagine she would treat the battle raging outside her tent with that much nonchalance. Although I suppose I can give it another shot to see if it gets better.

*** She went through the Second Wizarding War. Also, and importantly, those are muggles fighting outside. Barbarian muggles. They pretty much can't touch her. And she didn't want to meddle with the medieval louts bashing each others' brains in - she simply wanted to get home.

**** I read the entire thing and so far I find her actually kinda underpowered. Someone with Hermione's abilities and ruthless streak (see Centaur rape train and DA list curse) would wipe the floor with people like Clegane. The fights are lacklustre, because I don't buy the whole "armour blocks magic" thing. Stuff like the body bind go through clothing without making holes, so armour should not impact it. Magical ropes (barbed wire anyone?) would be another solution.

** I quite liked this story. It had good characterization, new plot points and is daring to change things. Was quite enjoyable.

Thanks for the recommendation!

** I just read the first chapter of this and didn't end up closing the tab in disgust, which is usually what happens when I try a crossover so I'll give the rest a go. I've still yet to finish any crossover but maybe this will be the first.

The problem I've found is that it's hard to strike the balance between the two crossed parts. You tend either to end up with Harry Potter and a Few People From The Other Franchise or A Song Of Ice and Someone Who Doesn't Resemble Harry Potter Much. For instance, the oft-recommended linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) starts out reasonably but I gave up at the point where Harry had essentially become Mal, and Mal was relegated to the background.
