** Love potion sex - Essentially forced. Imperius sex - name something more BDSM than having your entire being controlled.

Different house sex - forbidden/roleplay.

Being burnt alive - apparently its a pleasant sensation, like being tickled.

Centaur (Parvati def had that sizequeen vibe)/mermaid-man/invisible thestral/Goblin/giantess.

Human Transfiguration sex.

**** I remember one fic where that was mentioned offhandedly - Harry blackmailing Snape with his friend of room number (x), who singlehandedly is responsible for 70% of magical Britain's boomslang skin use, and the hairs he collects.

** You know that pictures can move? Yeah, all those anime-girl fans would be in heaven. Not sure how the girls would react tho.

Double polyjuice with your partner so you can fuck each other from a different perspective.

With the wide range of healing spells and potions and the cruciatus curse i'd assume BDSM would be much more hardcore than for us.

And from canon ones - cross species shenanigans. You know those half giants running around, or Flitwick being part-goblin? Yeah.
