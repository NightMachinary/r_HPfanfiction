On that fateful Halloween Night... Harry is saved by Sirius who chooses Harry instead of revenge or maybe someone else saves him (Lily and/or James surviving is a possibility) either way he is taken away from Dumbledore's machinations with Dumbledore assuming that since Harry is clearly 'dead' (or missing which is as good as dead as far as Dumbledore's plans go) then Neville must be the one that the prophecy spoke of.

Then you could have a typical Dumbledore bashing fic. First he tries to claim the Potter money (and fails) then he takes a near creepy interest in Neville's life. Betrothal contracts, paid best friends, etc. (But it's not necessary)

Dumbledore is happy thinking his plans are all in line when suddenly years later a young version of James Potter with Lily Potter's eyes shows up throwing all his plans in the trash.

Basically a story where Dumbledore assumes that since he can't find Harry he'll declare Neville the "Boy-Who-Lived!" even if he has to make up lies then at some point (1st year, 4th year, or whenever) Harry shows up and throws a wrench in Dumbledore's plans.


** I just love how a lot of fanon thinks that Dumbledore is the one who created the Boy-Who-Lived title, while in all likelyhood, it was probably Hagrid who took one too many at the pub and started saying things he should not have said.

*** Probably but "Boy-Who-Lived" title or no Dumbledore still would've used the prophecy as an excuse to meddle.

I just really love to hate Albus "I know everything and you know nothing and I love it that way" Dumbledore especially with how he's written sometimes in fanfiction.

** Isn't Wand of Uru one of these? FF.net is blocked, so I can't link it.
