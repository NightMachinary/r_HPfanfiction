I just recently discovered fanfiction and I'm already obsessed. My favorite pairing by far is Draco Hermione. Could you maybe recommend some fics for me? anything is fine, fluff (?) smut whatever. The longer the better. Thank you


** I've answered this one before, so: a link to a previous comment for you! (This comment is a little old - both The Wrong Strain and my own fic are now complete! Ride or Die is still a wip but SO worth it if you're into muggle aus!)

** I abandoned the Dramione ship years ago and haven't looked back since, so I can't recommend something specific. But check out the following links. You can find fics based on themed etc. at the fic index and ask/search for recs at dramioneasks. Happy reading!
