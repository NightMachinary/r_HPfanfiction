Looking for fics where Harry is with a female member of the Order of the Phoenix. Excluding Tonks, as that one is common enough.


** Here is every fic listed for each pairing (according to the lexicon page for Order of the Phoenix members). Where I got no pairings, went with fics with both characters listed, because it might be an unlabeled pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=3542][All fics in English with Harry and Arabella Fig listed as main characters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=3552][All fics in English with Harry and Emmeline Vance listed as main characters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=3558][All fics in English with Harry and Hestia Jones listed as main characters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=545&pm=1][All Harry/Minerva McGonagall fics in English]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=673&pm=1][All Harry/Molly Weasley fics in English]]

Now that the books members are done, let's take a look at the 70s.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=3539][All fics in English with Harry and Alice Longbottom listed as main characters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=2228][All fics in English with Harry and Marlene McKinnon listed as main characters]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&c1=1&c2=8&pm=1][All Harry/Lily Evans P. fics in English]]

And that's all I can do for you. I'm not trawling through all these fics individually, or looking at Harry/OC stuff.

** It's not that hard to just go to ffn and search Harry/Hestia Jones and peruse all 13 fics at a glance, is it? Or are you looking for Harry/Minerva or Harry/Molly?

*** I think its more of a check to see if someone has seen something like this that was worth reccomending.

** Aside from Tonks, I think all of the female Order members in canon are people Harry knows in other contexts. Might have to look for OCs with this request.

** In the realm of interesting facts, there is not a single fic on ff.net with the tagged pairing Alice L/Harry.
