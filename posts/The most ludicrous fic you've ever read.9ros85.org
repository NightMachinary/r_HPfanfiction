As in the title. What's the most out there, totally bonkers fanfic you've ever read? Either because it was poorly written or so far off track or just completely and totally ridiculous as a premise? I'm mostly looking for unintentionally crazy/stupid fics, but intentional works too just as long as its funny.

my god this is hilarious, Harry just casually spits out its taxonomic classification while Hermione has managed to never see a picture of a dinosaur in her entire life.

  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

** Back in the early 2000s on snitchfiction there were many stories that were really bad, Shitty spelling, ridiculous grammar, chapters that were 90% authors notes, total lack of any consistent plot (and I am not talking about PWP's), you name it they were out there. But one took the cake. It was Harry/Draco mpreg and the one fact that stuck with me through the decades was that the author decided to convert the chamber of secrets into the baby's room. It went on for over 20 chapters with regular updates every week, each chapter running less than 2000 words or so. It was like a train wreck, you could only sit and watch it grow with equally growing horror. It went down with snitchfiction (and good riddance), but in hindsight I wish I had saved it - it was that bad. The author had also written Final Fantasy fics that were equally as stellar.

EDIT: Doing a quick search and reading through [[http://fanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_fan_fictions_considered_the_worst][this page]] I think the author might have been Squirrelking. The writing style of the final fantasy story up on FanFiction of this author reminds me of the HP story in question.

** I think by sheer length, the smutfic sequel linkao3(1114409) that clocks in at 2,291,848 words qualifies. Also anything else by MegaMatt09 just because of the sheer volume of smut the guy (I assume) cranks out. I'm still not convinced that he runs a sweatshop to get so much writing done.

**** HPMOR is pretty polarizing. The first time I encountered it, before it was completed and the HPfanfic cornerstone it is now, I couldn't get through more than a couple chapters before getting sick of the holier-than-thou/JKR's-version-was-so-dumb attitude... like you, I found it pretty boring.

A couple years later, it was recommended so incredibly often that I read it through---if you gloss over the attitude and the characterization, it can be pretty satisfying plot-wise to have a Harry who just destroys absolutely everything in his path and is essentially a clever 30-year-old in the body of an 11-year-old. Pretty much the entire plot of the original series gets wrapped up in a single year; Harry makes almost no mistakes and becomes absurdly powerful using logic™ loopholes. Sometimes you're in a mood to read about quasi-gods who succeed at everything---I get it.

Unfortunately, HPMOR's popularity spawned a number of other "Rationalist" fics, with more holier-than-thou/wizards-are-so-stupid authors... which is pretty lame. And all those authors seem to revere Less Wrong as some kind of logic™ messiah, which is also pretty creepy. But I think HPMOR's lasting popularity is more due to the fact that it went kind of fanfic-viral, much in the way that My Immortal did, /because/ of the yes/no debate around it. As a fic, it's neither exceptionally good nor exceptionally bad. It just gets recommended a lot because it's /so/ well-known.

Personally I can't stand it. I see why some people like it, but it really isn't for me.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD

** Harem and Harry/Tom or Harry/Voldemort stories are usually insane and the authors tie themselves in knots to justify why Harry wants to fuck a mass murdering genocidal maniac who killed his family.

For fun, bonkers fics that are fairly well written...I like "oh, god, not again" and anything by nonjon.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor)

It's smutty, full of crude humor, and actually pretty hilarious imo. It's written well enough and doesn't take itself seriously. Takes place during 7th year.

** There was this one fic where everyone was some kind of LGBT. Hilarious and absolutely crazy.

Edit: Oh look at that, it still exists and still being updated:
