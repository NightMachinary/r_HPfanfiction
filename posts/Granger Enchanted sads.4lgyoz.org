Hello everyone, I just this morning felt nostalgic about my fanfic days (I've not been active in a couple years) and tried to sign in to Granger Enchanted, where most of my fic was posted, and found out that its been taken down. So a fire was lit under my rear and I've been googling trying to find out if anything has been saved or if anyone is trying to revive it.

That brought me here. And finally made me create a reddit account. I've never posted before or really even used the site much but I'm hoping that this site has the same community that the old ones had.

Anyways... If anyone knows anything about a new site or where people are migrating to from there I'd love to hear about it. And I look forward to getting to know you all here.

My penname was E Mitchell btw if anyone remembers me please say hello!

*** Yes that is me. I posted everything there as well, mostly because I couldn't put my fics without Hermione on GE. I still have access to all my fics, I was more wondering about the others on there.

** I think they said on the Facebook page that they were moving the stories over to AO3, hope that helps!
