a fiction where vernon and his family were exceptionally kind and good to harry, to such an extent that they ( like jacob from fbawtft), where given special status that allowed them to visit the hogwarts. so in the final battle of hogwarts, as the battle is going on, in the middle of the great hall, through a portkey, come vernon, dudley and petunia, armed with with vernons shotgun, dudleys collection of firecrackers and petunias stack of chilli powder.\\
" we here to help ya kid" vernon shouts as he blasts a death eater in the face.


** linkffn(A Better Man) might be right up your alley. It features good!Dursleys and it's one of my favourite fics that does so. They even show up at Hogwarts.

linkffn(2531438)

Seconding the assessment of "favourite Good!Dursleys" by the way.

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Maybe blindness? It has the Dursley's being supportive of Harry and his magic, though they don't actually interact overtly with the magical world, and there wasn't a battle of Hogwarts there, so there is that.
