** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] is exactly what you're looking for. It's a Voldemort and Harry buddy cop sort of a thing where they are forced to solve a series of disappearances in France and eventually end up fighting off assassins, gods and the French TSA.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well-Groomed Mind]] isn't an equality agreement but it has something sorta similar eventually. From what I remember it's the best manipulative Dumbledore fic out there. (Dumbledore isn't portrayed as a bumbling old man and Harry doesn't run around screaming about abuse and stuff.) It's probably dead though so be warned about that.
