This is a series, but the sequel is abandoned I think.

I don't think she was a muggle though. The time travel was interesting though. Memories were sent back and everyone involved was feeling Deja Vu whenever they followed canon.

The train happened. Think it was Sally-Anne Peakes that was the daughter.

There are soul bonds though. And evil Dumbledore.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
