  Permanently "ON HOLD" - How much does anyone really know about Harry Potter? Things could have been very different if Hagrid... AU, what if type of story.

  AU. What if Hagrid took Harry instead of leaving him with the Dursleys? What kind of parent would he be? Humorous. Rated T for mild violence. No sex, no slash, no swearing. COMPLETE

** Not officially...

"Growing Up Wild" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118463/1/][12118463]]) Unfinished. Harry apparates to Hagrid's hut during a fire at Privet Drive. The Dursleys don't even report him as missing/lost in the fire, so Hagrid and company conclude Harry would be better off with him. The staff keep Harry's presence a secret from Dumbledore until he starts attending.

"Honestly Harry - Getting to Hogwarts" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6950954/1/][6950954]]) Hagrid takes Harry in after meeting him and the Dursleys at the lighthouse.

There was also one where Hagrid is enlisted to teach Harry how to perform Occlumancy. His techniques include flooding the mind with thoughts of fantastic animals. And a brick.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

  When Number Four Privet Drive burns to the ground, three year old Harry manages to apparate himself to safety - and as a result, Hagrid and Minerva decide to keep him safe on the Hogwarts grounds from then on, right under Dumbledore's nose.

  What if Hagrid decided to take young Harry Potter away from the Dursleys after meeting them? Here's how he might have met Dumbledore and all the Weasleys before going to Hogwarts. Story with H/G/Hr meetings and pairings.
