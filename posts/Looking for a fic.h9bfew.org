:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic called "Strangely Familiar". In the fic, Harry has a dream about his parents, wakes up sad, decides to wander around the house (it takes place at Grimmauld Place), ends up crying, Sirius sees him and H/C ensues. The only problem is that that fic was on ùòçùò¢ùò§ùò¶ùò£ùò∞ùò∞ùò¨, of all places, so I can't find it. Help me, please.


** Ummmmm..

What?

H/C?

I hope you mean "hugging" and "crying" because I don't even want to think about the other H/C with Sirius and Harry.

*** Hurt/Comfort. And, forgive me for my innocence, what's the other H/C?
