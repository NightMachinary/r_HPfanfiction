I think I've never read a fic where those cunts recieve the retribution they have earned for years.

Bonus points if other characters also curse or hex them.


** Something close: in linkffn(Brightest Witch in the Darkest House by Belial666), Harry's friends get him moved out of the Dursleys' by the simple expedient of [[/spoiler][burning down 4 Privet Drive]].

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Not Harry, but Dumbledore puts an intent based transfiguration ward on 4 Privet Drive, in /My Brother!/ linkffn(7405386) The chapter is appropriately titled: /You have brought this upon yourselves!/

And you clearly have not read enough HP fanfiction if you have yet to see the Dursleys suffer at wand-point.
