Harry hasn't had the greatest of lives. His parents dying, being a 'horcrux', living with the Dursleys, nearly dying by countless things at Hogwarts, Sirius dying, Remus dying, and who knows how many manipulations were at play in his life from the people around him.

What if it wasn't just 'bad luck' but the actions of higher beings? Whether it's a crossover with Percy Jackson (Greek Gods, the Furies, the Fates, etc) or Supernatural (Angels and Demons are dicks).

Perhaps it's not even about the past bad luck but his current situation and it's the fault of beings like Aedra/Daedra from Elder Scrolls who took him from his world and put him in Tamriel.

Maybe it's not even a crossover but a being exists in the world of Harry Potter whether it be a being named Fate or Merlin or whatever.

Regardless of the 'who' Harry eventually discovers that this higher being (or beings) exists and decides to find them and get answers even if its a small part of the story that leads into the actual story. Personally it would be interesting to see Wizard Harry with no godly blood (possibly as Master of Death?) find a way to storm the gates of Olympus or Oblivion or wherever trying to find the ones that screwed him over or has been screwing him over and start screwing with them instead.
