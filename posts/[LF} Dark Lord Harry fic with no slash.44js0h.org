Just as the title says, I'm looking for a decent Dark Lord Harry fic with no slash.

I don't have anything against slash, I'd just prefer to read a story where Harry isn't paired with Voldemort.


** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), has 'freedom fighter'/'the mentor' Tom Riddle resisting the 'evil emperor' Harry Potter.

The author has shown excellent knowledge in politics, strategy, and the art of war. The writing is also very good, and characterizations are great.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** depending on your defention of "dark lord" i could have a ton, but almost all of them would be smut centric. for a non smut centric story with an evil harry check out "the star empire : The Sucession of Magic" it does have tons of little grammer errors(english is not their native language) but is a pretty intresting "what would harry do if he wakes up in the far future? why become a space pirate of course and liberally use the imperio" its almost like a HP/firefly cross over only instead of lovable generally moral smugglers (and Jane) its cruel backstabbing pillaging and raping pirates.

edit not sure how I forgot about this but shadowed malice sounds like exactly what you want, Harry is evil joins deatheaters no slash minimal angst; lots of fighting combat commitinng evil deeds and abuse of muggles. Dont worry about the lutain/nagini author note thats a joke ship between harrys snake and voldemorts snake nagini, orginally I was worried the author had changed lucius name and shipped him with the snake lol [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7179133/1/Shadowed-Malice]]
