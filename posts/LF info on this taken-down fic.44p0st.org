I was going through my stories that I've previously downloaded but not read yet, and I found Harry Potter and a Different Time by TheTrickster96 (according to my library) or ShadowPhoenix96(according to Google). It says it's the first of a trilogy, but I only have the first one. Does anyone know if it was finished, or why it was taken down? Does anyone have a copy of the later installments?

*** Is fictionhunt still functional? I can't access it, and web.archive.org doesn't have either story archived.

**** It is working fine. Either it happened to be down momentarily when you checked, or your ISP is blocking it for some strange reason and you'll just have to use a proxy.

** I've had a poke around and it looks like it was never finished, although I don't know why. I've found unworking links to the second installment called 'A March to War' and references to the final part which was to be called 'Harry Potter and the Time's Sacrifice' [[https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20131209134400AAQzEkB][here]]

From what I can find, the last part was never uploaded anywhere. Sorry I can't be of more help -_-

Edit: TheTrickster96 is still active on fanfiction.net so you could try pm him/her about it maybe!
