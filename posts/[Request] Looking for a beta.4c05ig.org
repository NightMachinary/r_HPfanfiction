Hi! I'm looking for a beta for a story I'm currently working on, entitled 'The Skeletons in Teddy Lupin's Closet'. It's a next-gen, focusing on Teddy Lupin, and is the sequel to 'The Escapades of Teddy Lupin' (which is here- linkffn(10554013) ) (quick note about Escapades: only later chapters were beta-d and I'm not very proud of the first part of the story- I'd love to go back and change it but alas, university). I've already posted the first seven chapters of Skeletons, but am on a posting hiatus because I've decided I want to get the entire story done (it'll likely be around 150k words) and edited before I resume posting (and also because I'm v v busy and feel bad for posting very irregularly).

I'm looking for a beta with an eye for detail, plot and characterisation. Language/grammar isn't too much of an issue. Although I would like someone familiar with the first fic/willing to read it, it's not a big deal if you're not (I can always write a quick summary of what happens). Also, it's quite OC-heavy, so if that's not your thing then the project might not be a good match.

If you're interested, shoot me a PM or comment below, and we can chat! xx
