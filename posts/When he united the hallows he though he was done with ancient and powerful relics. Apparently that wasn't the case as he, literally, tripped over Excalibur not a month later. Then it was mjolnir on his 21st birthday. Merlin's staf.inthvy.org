#+TITLE: When he united the hallows he though he was done with ancient and powerful relics. Apparently that wasn't the case as he, literally, tripped over Excalibur not a month later. Then it was mjolnir on his 21st birthday. Merlin's staff not a month later and then Zues's literal lightening bolts!

** Harry sighed as he put the Yata no Kagami in the vault with (most) of the rest of the various artifacts and items. They were mostly useful, if sometimes bizarre (Zeus's record of conquests I'm looking at you and judging you, you indistructable waste of space) and every single one he'd sometimes literally tripped over during the last year.

​

It had taken him a while, but he'd finally found the source of his troubles.

​

Basically, he was The Heir.

​

To what? You may ask?

​

Everything.

​

Every single god, pantheon and metaphysical construct had him marked down as their Heir.

​

Of course, they had all got together and decided that to sort out this dispute of who got to name him as heir they would present him a trial throughout his life, and his actions and sucesses would determine who got to name him as heir to their domain.

​

Of course, being gods and various metaphysical constructs, most of them cheated. Then when the trial was over, they then argued about the result, especially when the cheating of most of them was found out which they argued was part of the contest.

​

Of course the ones who didn't cheat all piped in and simultaniously declared him theirs by right of not cheating. That went as well as can be expected and in the end they all fought, got drunk, presumably had several affairs and just said f it, he's The Heir to all of us.

​

And what did Harry get out of all of this? A bunch of weird oddly specific artifacts and a promise of ludicrous amounts of power. Just as soon as they are done hiding artifacts in ways and places that only he can find them.

​

On the other hand, he thought as he shot up to the surface from the mariana sea trench, some of these artifacts were really useful.

** This is similar to a plot bunny in my mind, which is a bit canon compliant...

The power he knows not is: an affinity for and predilection to find Magical Artifacts.

Brooms, invisibility cloak, mirror of erised, marauder's map, and so forth.

Obviously, in canon this is because JKR used powerful artifacts to close the power gap between a 12 year old and a basilisk... but to make it an official talent of Harry could be a fun story.

** Holding his head in his hands as he failed once again to rid himself of the Three Hallows, Harry could only moan at his fate.

They had all shown up the day after the battle in his room. He had spent three weeks trying to rid himself of them since.

He could feel it, the link, the immortality curse, it was a curse, he had checked, of the Hallows upon him.

Then he had his newest idea. If he couldn't get rid of them he would destroy them!

One crash course in Fiendfyre later and that was out of the cards as they just laid there while the fire refused to even touch them.

Hell he had put out the fire simply by throwing the cloak on top of it. The fire had killed itself rather than touch the cloak.

The cloak that was bound to his soul it seemed, lovely.

So here he was at Glastonbury Tor fulfilling a millenia old prophecy and retrieving Excalibur so he could destroy the stone.

Only it didn't work, at all.

Now he had a fancy sword that /cut souls/ as the stone had integrated itself into the hilt of Excalibur. Which was now bound to his soul as well.

Which meant it couldn't cut him either, he had tried.

Apparently he was now the Mage King of The Britons seeing as he had the bloody sword. So he had secretly taken a shit ton of foreign language lessons, helped by magic, and left the country.

So here he was two months later after pulling the sword from the stone and moaning again about bullshit fate.

So the amazing must see city of Tromsø was in fact amazing. It was also the previously unknown resting place of Mjölnir.

He had been on a tour of a recently open to the public excavation of the oldest settlement in the area to date.

Then he had tripped while looking at a stonewrought mural, fell through said mural, and then literally landed on the bloody hammer.

His bruised arm still hurt, oh and the damn hammer was now attached to his waist.

It was semi-sentient as well and was lonely it seemed.

What the hell...

Deciding maybe it was best time to move along from the area he had made his way to Austria. The mountains were lovely.

Were, there were now a few less mountains.

Apparently an ancient titan had been slumbering in the area for a few millennia.

Which bringing in the foe of giants, slayer of titans, Mjölnir, to the area had woken up.

After almost shitting himself he had managed to kill the damn thing.

Which of course had been guarding the Bolt of Zeus.

So now his, previously faded, lighting bolt scar was a bit bigger and glowed yellow. Also he had spent weeks! Weeks I say! Learning to *not* throw lighting bolts from his hands everytime be reached for something.

After an incident with a television, a magical lighting bolt, and the sudden channel change to some Japanese Cartoon channel he decided maybe Japan would be a nice place.

Obviously Europe was determined to give him a tour, with free gifts, of its most powerful artifacts.

So a few lessons on the most popular Asian languages later, there were a lot actually, and here he was.

Manga was cool, anime, was interesting, and he now had *two* swords.

Apparently being the living embodiment of a God's lighting, while also having a weapon designed to harness lighting of another lighting god, had 'woken up' the sword of the Japanese God of storms...

So he was now taking a portkey right the fuck out of Japan as he hoped no one recognized Kusanagi-no-tsurugi on his waist.

  All my life, people have placed their expectations upon me. They would have me believe I failed. Cowards. What right do these mongrels have to pass judgement upon me. The only right these people have. The only right I allow them. Is to stand in awe and be humbled if and when I deign to stand as their salvation. Gaze upon my wonders. For I sit upon the Throne of Babylon.

** ...apparently that wasnt the case as he, literally, tripped over excalibur not a momth later. Then of course mjolnir had to slam into his tv during his solo birthday party, but atleast he enjoyed a few channels on it until that weird weasley took it back. Merlin's staff not a month later took the cake until it all went down hill when he crashed into some crazy malfoy look-alike with a bronze rod crackling with electricity. Maybe hitting up this history museum will make him feel better, and hopefully he can find out what this strange feeling is pulling him to new York.
