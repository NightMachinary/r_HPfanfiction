So yeah, this is a thinly veiled excuse for rants. Post your diatribe below or just post fics and I'll rant about them for you.

For me it's definitely Wind Shear, like I get there's not a whole lot of Harry/Bella or good dimension travels around but really?! That's the best you can do?! I couldn't even finish the chunk of it that's on ffn let alone the whole fucking thing in it's unbeta'd state. Hell, I'm not even going to bother ranting about the plot line because while that's got more than it's fair share of issues it's really the writing that gets to me. Everyone's always "frowning" (20 times in chapter 2) and "stating" (58 times in chapter 2, /83/ times in chapter 4) to the point where I started to question if the author even knew other words existed.

For once I was excited that there was a fanfic from Neville's perspective since he's such a rare main character but this isn't Neville at all. It's just some macho OC with Neville's name and the other characters might as well be OCs too because their characterization is so far removed from canon. It's also gory for the sake of being gory.

**** I didn't read all of PoS because goddamn but I can't find in myself to read a fic that "gets good after chapter 30" as I was told by several of the fic's fans.

Take the whole Prince thing. Interesting idea no doubt, but the chapter where Harry shows the room to his older housemates is just a badly written, egregious infodump that left my eyes wonky for a while from eyerolling so much. And I generally can't stand the mini-politicians trope. If the kids grow up to about 15, sure, politick away. But at 11 it just sounds so tryhardy that I can't even.

Or Neville's Remembrall. Again an interesting idea, but dragged down by Neville's over the top back story because everything in PoS needs a malicious angle.

I quit about around the birthday party, where a 12 kid was busy "networking". Re: improving on canon, sometimes less is more. AFAIK, the author dedicates a lot of the word count to attach a back story to every tiniest element and every character. "More" doesn't always mean "better".

And yeah, Harry does get taken down a peg later on.

The backstories though are part of its charm I think. A lot of canon characters behave in ways that don't really make sense, and rather than changing their actions (which most fics do) PoS changes their motivations. Which necesitstes a boatload of words for each totally crazy action.

And the only "political" 11 year old is Harry I think (and maybe Justin). Draco and Daphne try but they both fail badly, and no one else really tries.

*** I honestly don't get people who call HPMOR "preachy." You can very easily read and enjoy it while barely agreeing with the anti-death perspective of the author or its Harry. I consider it to be a decently well written fic with an excellent start, a reasonable ending, and a really disappointing end.

And most people find Harry annoying, but the only character I find infuriatingly horrible in that fic is Hermione. That's probably for me the biggest weakness of that fic. (SPOILERS AHEAD) [[/spoiler][I barely gave a /shit/ when Hermione died, and I found her resurrection plot probably the worst thing in the fic.]]

But apart from that, I /really/ enjoyed reading science applied to magic. Harry's powers did make in-canon sense to me and he was by no means always perfect. It's a better written fic than the vast majority.

But it really isnt that. Most of the "science" is just a bunch of jargon slinging that is very accessible and used in the same way that "Big Bang Theory" uses nerd jargon. Using shallow references in an attempt to cash in on nerd points.

The only actual science in the fic is maybe kind of his investigation into the "Comed-tea". Everything else is Harry making assertions about the nature of magic, assuming those assertions are correct, and then never revisting the topic again.

HPMOR is one of those fanfics that when you're reading it, and in the middle of it it seems very good, but a critical analysis or just thinking about it from afar really makes the holes in both the plot and the authorship blow up.

** For me, it's not specific books, but you can really tell when the recommender is from the US sometimes.

At some point I really want to do a study into the difference between the Harry Potter fandom and conceptions of characters across the UK and the US (or maybe the US and the rest of the world).

Superpowered!Harry, Dirty-minded!Harry, Sassy!Harry and HaremKing!Harry have always struck me as very american fandom tropes, injecting certain US stereotypes or character types into a very British-originating fandom and setting. It's not a dismissal of these, just an observation as a UK person who's been part of the fandom for what's now a very long time, and been able to watch its evolution.

I personally find it hard to get into a lot of those as they just...read the characters a little bit off, for me. Some stuff just doesn't translate that well culturally without lots of existing backdrop of culture. For example, I was really surprised to find out that some US readers saw canon Harry as rude and disrespectful when he was cheeky with teachers sometimes, because the culture of banter doesn't really translate that well across the pond.

So I guess my point is, certain fics that people recommend I can see appealing to US readers, but I can at the same time see them absolutely /not/ appealing to British readers and British readers being completely puzzled how anyone could read and enjoy them.

*** i'm gad you've put this so well into words because i've had this thought in my head but wasn't really certain i was making the correct observation or if it was specific to authors or particular fanfic genres.

Another example I can think of is the fratboy/footballer type harry (or other characters). Because Harry was on the sports team he's given this weird characterisation of a popular footballer-type character in fics sometimes and it doesn't make sense. I'm from australia so the culture is dissimilar to the US and UK (but way more like the uk*) where being on a school sports team is not 'a thing' here like it is in america, and im fairly certain it isn't in the uk either. (correct me if im wrong but that's my observation)

I'm very curious to know if there are any other things you've noticed about different interpretations or representations between the UK and US (or other countries..eh) ??

**** Wow, okay. Careful what you wish for - being in this fandom so long I have a lot of these! So helpless!Hermione and hot!Hermione are two more that have always struck me as probably coming of US origin. Because she's usually in those fics reminiscent of a female character from certain American movies, and nothing like the vision of Hermione that JKR had. That is, while she's helpless, she also generally doesn't retain any of the other characteristics JKR, a British author, suggested less explicitly that she had, which has always suggested to me that authors less familiar with non-explicit characteristics just haven't picked up on them.

The treatment of evil would be another due to differences between US and UK treatment of criminals. In the US there's a feeling that as soon as someone's a criminal they waive their right to being treated humanely to an extent, so US fics that deal with justice have characters being a lot more trigger-happy so to speak. The country still has capital punishment; so characters killing criminals, especially mass murderers, is a realistic course of action rather than something from fantasy. Also e.g. stand your ground laws and self defence laws are different between the two countries. So something like e.g. Harry's canon continued use of Expelliarmus rather than something stronger reads to Brits as what's expected of an honourable person, but to Americans as ludicrously weak and possibly suggestive of a reluctance to get involved with the reality of the situation, a desire to delude himself. Furthermore characters who use stronger spells read to Americans as sensible and to Brits as stepping down to the terrorists' level, or letting themselves be corrupted. There's also the wands = guns that everyone has, a comparison obvious to Americans where guns are legal, and probably read as an intended commentary, and at the same time probably something JKR never even considered, writing the books in a country where use of and personal ownership of guns is completely banned outside of armed forces.

Americans, and people from non-UK countries in general also sometimes miss hints of class differences. One example is that its doubly ironic that Hermione is so out of her depth in the wizarding world, not just because she's personally super-smart, but because she's from a comfortably upper-middle class background, indicated by her parents' jobs, their lifestyle (holidays/vacations) and even her own name. Going from that position in muggle society to rock bottom in wizarding society is a big role reversal. Even more so when she has to learn about wizarding society from someone like Ron who is heavily coded as much /lower/ class than her, while being bullied by Malfoy, who despite seeming the highest of high class, has a surname which suggests French extraction, meaning his family aren't as 'pure' British as they could be, and Snape who we learn grew up in essentially a slum. I've always found those notes interesting.

So a lot of this though touches on things US authors either wouldn't pick up on or would have difficulty finding out unless they'd lived in the UK though. To go back to hot and weak Hermione, I feel that comes from first placing Hermione in the role of the love interest and then leaving HP behind and moving to more common or visible media to pick up tips on /what a love interest should be/, at the same time leaving behind most of her canon characteristics.

Actually on that point, one more. Hermione's father being gruff and interested in her love life to the point of wanting to meet and vet out her boyfriends, just by himself, not as a part of e.g. a family meal. You really don't get that in the UK haha. Shockingly we recognize young women and teenage girls as being able to make their own dating decisions without their father threatening their boyfriend as if they were meat. I couldn't believe that was a real thing still and not just a fanfic trope!

***** oh wow, i don't regret asking at all thank you for this! I do have to agree with you on a lot of this and you make a really interesting point on the equation of wands to guns. It's not something I or my friends would ever pick up on also coming from a country where the laws on fire arms are so different to the US.

I also think that's a really good point you made about Harry's use of expelliarmus and I think maybe that's where some fans need of a 'ruthless' Harry comes in and i guess american fans complaining about Harry being a pushover or something? I feel there was (maybe still is?) this mentality that Harry was stupid for relying on incarceration rather than death for his enemies. But I feel that takes away from the poignancy/shock (depending on the character) of the actual deaths in canon and their meaning and impact. (that might just be me though)

Also the stuff about Hermione's class coding and her interactions with other characters and their treatment of her. This is super interesting because I've always been aware she comes from a very wealthy upper-middle class family but in australia it isn't such a big deal, and there isn't thousands of years of history of it, so I never noticed this added theme of her role (from her perspective) being completely reversed. There's still a disparity and different treatment but it certainly has nothing to do with family names. Not all job descriptors are a sign of wealth (obviously a dentist will be haha) but here, where there's this huge mining and farming culture it's unreliable. Someone from a rural area with a bogan accent and only a high school certificate could easily be a millionaire. And for me I have a comparatively weak australian accent, very good education (public schools are top shit where I live) and very little money :'). So while an australian could recognise the class coding quite easily, being aware of how that might impact interactions or the significance behind them is another story.

Also yeah, fathers meeting boyfriends and flexing at them. wtf. I thought it was some made up trope but it really happens... :/ why? same for the 'popular sports player at school gets all the girls'. It just doesn't apply, particularly when (usually at private/grammar schools) playing on one of the sports teams is mandatory. This is getting a little off topic but the kind of people in australia who would be on the sports teams in school would also be more outgoing in general, and therefor be more likely to get into relationships, rather than the fact of them simply being on a school team being the deciding factor. just my two cents anyway.

Thanks for the answer again. this was very educational :~)

** Methods of Rationality, for obvious reasons.

The second is Santi's Boy Who Lived. That fic has aged /horribly/, yet everyone is so eager to read it and get to the chapters they haven't been able to read yet on ffnet.

I mean I did use to like the fic. But on a reread later, it's just bad. Harry is Harry-In-Name-Only, his brother is the real Harry, Ron is a caricature of the standard cliche "All Slytherins are evil", Hermione is ruder in the first few chapters than she ever was in the books, and Durmstrang is the standard super school that is better than Hogwarts. Despite Krum being its pick for the Triwizard and Cedric going toe to toe with Krum with no apparent difficulty.

But despite all that, I just hate that Harry has no facet of his original personality. He has no urge to save people in danger, he has no love for flying or quidditch, all he is is a fantasy version of what we'd all want to be if we were at Hogwarts: kid who reads ahead and practices magic all the time. And he's also non-athletic and nerdy because why not. Of course then there's the sympathy card because Harry is ostracized for... not being his brother.

Why even make a twin to take canon Harry's place? Usually the reason for this is to have Harry be neglected in home in favor of his brother, but this time they were both treated equally by James and Lily. The prophecy already gives us a ready made canon character to replace Harry as the BWL: Neville. I guess in place of Lily and James, he's neglected at Hogwarts by the student body instead. Which is extremely contrived, as is Dumbledore refusing to let him advance in his classes because reasons.

**** That's your opinion and you're entitled to it.

But that's a dumb view to take of fanfiction. Because once you take away everything about a canon character that... characterizes them, you're left with nothing but a name. That's not fanfiction, bro, that's an original character. And once you change the setting around to something not seen in canon, that's an original fiction set in the Harry Potter world. And there's a reason the majority of fanfic readers tend to avoid OCs and why fanfiction is easier to write than original fiction: because making a viable character that isn't boring, a mary/gary stu, or just plain bad is really, really hard. As seen in BWL, where Harry is nothing but a non-athletic nerd's wish fulfillment: a smart, capable, mature, well spoken young man with no love for sports, who's ostracized by his peers, and who deserves a different environment to thrive in, where he's accepted for the marvelous prodigy that he is.

That's not a good character. That's a boring character. He lacks personality, depth, flaws. Anything that makes him human.

Harry in canon was snide, sarcastic, generous, reckless, loyal, brave, and a star seeker. This Harry is... none of those things. Except maybe loyal.

There's no need to have him be a canon counterpart. If you want, change him. But there's a limit to how much you can change about his core character before it just becomes an original character. And 99% of original characters in fanfiction are shit.

***** When there are major and severe changes on a major canon character (like Harry, Albus, Tom, Hermione etc) the outcome isn't called an oc. Rather it's called as ooc.

But that DOESN'T require major and severe changes. Getting a piercing or dyed hair can be an action that would make a character act ooc.

On the other hand MOST characters in fanfics are oc. Why? Because outside of a couple handfuls of canon characters, we know jack shit about most of the characters Rowlling created. What do you know of the personalities of students in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff or most of the Slytherins during Harry's year.

How much you know of the students in the higher or lower years?

How much do you know of characters like: Amelia Bones, Fabian and Gydeon, Arthur's brothers, Luna's mother, the Malfoy fmailly beyond Abraxas, Lucious and Draco?

And then we got GREAT, 100% oc. Such as Arcturus Black in Honour Thy Blood.

I get your point, but you don't seem to realise that by my disliking "fanfics" sticking too close to the canon, I don't necessarily idolize needless deviation from it.

****** Yes, I've been reading ff for more than a decade now, I know what OC and OOC is. Acting OOC is one thing, changing every single thing about a character until he or she is unrecognizable from their canon counterpart is a completely different story.

I'm not sure what point you're making in regards to the characterization of the tertiary characters. Yes, they have no real character. They're basically an open book to play with... and this actually further proves my point about fanfic writers being terrible at creating characters. Look at what the majority of authors do to Daphne. They have no real skill so they hop on board the bandwagon train and thus the "Ice Queen" is created until they don't even realize that it's not canon.

Most stories don't really contain more than the core cast. It's not needed. JKR created an enchanting narrative with just them, fanfic authors are free to explore further, but to tell the story of Harry Potter, all you need is right there. We have enough information on the primary and secondary characters, the rest is just filler.

Fanfics don't need to stick close to canon to still have a semblance of their character's canon counterpart. Look at Harry in Mira Mirth's Slytherin story, he's far different from Harry of canon, but still resembles him enough that it's not jarring.

Granted Runic Animagi is the only first person POV I have read...and the only I can stand. So that may be the reason I liked it so much. Also, the role of the Slytherin Ice Queen that's in fact kind hearted to her friends is not given to Daphne in this one. Nor is Daphne a super rich pureblood princess. Pureblodo yes, the standard stereotype? Nope.

Now, as for Thanks to a Snake. Well, I liked it. It had its cliches and tropes, but it wasn't awful. Not like other HP/DG fics are.

As much as I loved the books when I was younger, canon Harry is pretty much a blank page. He is not magically strong, apart from that Patronus episode. He is not clever (or at least does not care about schoolwork). He is stubborn to a fault (resulting in Sirius' death in Phoenix and nearly getting him and Hermione killed in Godrics Hollow in DH).

He also works well under pressure, which is partially why the whole Department of Mysteries fiasco didn't end with a bunch of dead students.

As for stubbornness, I will note this: he was worried, and the adults who could have reassured him all pretty much ignored him. After four years of almost the same crud happening, most people would treat that happening yet again as a reason to jump head-first into it.

The lackadaisical romp it is up until that point is nice enough (personally the "hooker to service you" moment kills me, but it definitely gets recommendable once things start rolling along. There is some implied angst with stories of the original dimensions takeover by Voldemort, but overall the world is a toy box in the beginning.

From chapter 12 on, there is still romping, but it's interspersed with plot. Not necessarily the tension of say, a horror move, but a good action movie. Given the path of the story to that point, an ending along the lines of "Rocks fall; Everyone dies" is unlikely at best, but how the plot is resolved isn't immediately clear. Nonjon also puts in a couple of unique twists as well. There is also a great amount characters from alternate dimensions interacting, which is something I love when it's done well, so perhaps I'm a bit predisposed to it.

Some days I'll be in the mood for the most schmoopy, ridiculously cute romance fics, and some days I'll rage about how unrealistic romances are in fanfiction. The most recommended fics tend to merely appeal to the most common desires of the readers. They don't have to be particularly good if the reader is willing to ignore the flaws. Truthfully, very few fics are very good. Most authors settle for "acceptable" and never really attempt to exceed that.

And in all honesty, I've been reading fanfiction for, what, over a decade now? And while I've always disliked grammatical errors and typos and whatnot (I looked back at my reviews on ff.net and I think my very first review complained about people pluralizing with " 's " lol) and cliches, over time I've gotten more and more bitter about these issues. My recommendation is to take a break for awhile if it's starting to drive you crazy.

***** I understand what you mean, I tried reading this popular AU where muggleborn kids are kidnapped and taken to a separate school run by Umbridge( I forget the name, but Hermione was the main character). I couldn't read past a few chapters, it was too depressing.

That said, I am a huge fan of the Pureblood Pretense series, and I just thought it was them going one step further than Durmstrang, by excluding halfbloods. The world took a dark political turn, and because there was no war like in canon, people on both sides are less radicalized.

*** I'm not trying to change your mind, but here's some thoughts:

I love The Red Knight, but I love it because I've read all the fics about Harry (and sometimes Hermione) ending up in another dimension and having to figure things out. There's something refreshing about it happening to Ron. It's not that great a fic, and it meanders into weird places (it's been stalled in France for fooooreeeever, when I just want to get back to Hogwarts again), but I'm willing to put up with mediocre writing for a unique concept and my favorite character.

As for Pureblood Pretense: it has basically nothing to do with Harry Potter. But I'm also a fan of the Alanna the Lioness books, and I love all the tropes it plays with (especially "girl who crossdresses as a boy to advance in society"). As a Harry Potter fic, it's kind of a failure; Rigel has basically nothing in common with Harry. But it's a fun story that contains lots of things I like, and that's plenty for me.

They're definitely not for everyone, but nothing is.

**** Sure, I didn't want to mention obviously bad fics, just the ones I don't really get, but know are recommended a lot.

I tried to read Pureblood Pretense twice, but didn't get past 6-7 chapters. As for The Red Knight I think it's written in a poor manner, while the concept is interesting. It takes way too long for author to come to the point when Ron, Fem!Harry and Hermione confront each other about their Time/Dimension travelling and then there is this infuriating relationship between Ron and Daphne when she pinches him and he calls her 'my lady' all the time. For me this was so irritating I stopped reading this story a while ago. Author tries to be humorous, especially when dealing with Ron's Slytherin group of friends, but he/she doesn't really posses a sense of humour. All this 'overprotective Slytherin friends' also gets out of hand imo.

Edit: I'm also not familiar with Alanna the Lioness so it may be the reason I couldn't get interested in Pureblood Pretense

*** As a fan of Wastelands I'll offer my perspective. There are 750,000 ish Harry Potter fanfictions. Of those about 400,000 are Harry beats Voldemort in a new way but its not new at all, its just how is Harry 'better' than canon. Wastelands is different. That's already a plus, its writing style isn't for everyone but I like it, the pacing is good. Its its own world, its so much more creative and engaging than the 23rd canon rehash that I've tried to read in the last week. I can feel the effort put into that story. It does go down its own rabbit hole a bit and that can lose some people but its just so much better than Harry finds books in the chamber of secrets/restricted section and then does the same things but better.

Also we do like 10 flashbacks before we get off the god damned train! Each Flashback freezes time in the current run, so the story is stalled for things that weren't that important to start the story with.

And the different Quirrel and Lockhart are important too - they show that those events didn't happen as they did in canon so when Lockhart returns later in the story, people won't expect him to be a fraud. More importantly, though, they show that Dumbledore is active and proactive, and not affected by the "adults are useless" trope as in canon, since he deals with the Chamber of Secrets, saves Ginny, and didn't miss Quirrell being possessed for a year, nor used easy traps to protect the stone.

I absolutely don't get the praise it gets for being a "realistic" portrayal of war. Look, if I want wizards messing around with muggle shit, I'll read Emperor. But whatever, it's just guns and bombs, right? Lots a d lots of bombs.

The Muggleborn Resistance has an unbroken streak of victories against people more trained and qualified (a trope Starfox5 seems concerned about) and all they ever do is set off a bomb and escape in the chaos. It's /boooooring./

And let's not forget how Hermione who had a hard time scraping two friends together in canon becomes the unquestioned and capable leader of a guerrilla group. She's so great at everything in general that Harry and Ron agree to take turns dating her.

The muggleborns never sustain any substantial losses. I'm conditioned to expect them to win - why am I supposed to be rooting for these guys again? They're not the underdogs the author keeps insisting they are.

*** The Resistance have more or less easy victories when they have the initiative, surprise their enemies, and can prepare in advance. In any battle they lack that, casualties are taken - half the Resistance members are dead by the time Voldemort dies, and the story isn't over at that point either.

Also, they're not going up against more trained and qualified people - the average Auror (a cop in my stories, not some special force member as in canon) and the average Death Eater are simply not that well trained nor as experienced, but basically cops and thugs. Veterans of the last war, however, are quite different, as Moody and Bellatrix, among others, demonstrate. And Dumbledore and Voldemort are in a league of their own.

Also, you might decry it as unrealistic, but small groups of terrorists have had such "winning streaks" in the past - see: Rote Armee Fraktion - because, as I pointed out, they have the initiative, surprise, and can prepare in advance. But if things go wrong, they suffer. As in the story.

With regards to bombs - they work. If you have time to place them, and can use them without either endangering the SoS or causing collateral damage. Not that the Resistance are the only ones to use them - Voldemort uses one to take out half the Aurors in the Order, and frame the Resistance for it. It's not as if Tom Riddle somehow missed WW2. But as a "win button", bombs are not that different from Fiendfyre, or Blasting Curses. They have their uses and limits. And the purebloods pretty quickly adapt, and go into hiding. You can't bomb what you can't find.

With regards to Hermione being unable to organise anything - that's wrong. Even in canon, she was the force behind Dumbledore's Army founding, and organised it. She's not the most charismatic leader, but given that the rest of her group aren't Harry either, she's quite likely to lead them simply because she has the most drive, is the smartest, and has the most experience as well. And she is pretty much the archtype of a guerilla leader - or terrorist: Brave, stubborn, idealistic, with a fanatical streak, and willing to oppose an entire culture for what is right (see: slavery).

** Starfox, I was recommended a story trying to find a similar fix to The Sum of Their Parts. It was awful, perfect Hermione, goes on massive rants against evil Dumbledore and stupid McGonagall about all their racism while Harry sits in the background thinking how wonderful Hermione is and maybe she totally would like me? It was bad writing and bad cliches, and I can't understand why people like it.

** Most of the abandoned ones. Lots of the time it's filled with plot points that never meet satisfying conclusions. I don't understand why when someone asks for a STORY rec, people give them something that's unfinished. Yes, I get that Forging The Sword is good, and so is Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived, but they're not stories.

*** I sometimes rec unfinished stories because for me it's often about the journey, not the destination. I rather read a well written fic that's abandoned than a crap one that's finished. Good fics draw me in, get me attached to the characters, make me feel happy, sad, excited, etc. I dont need to know the conclusion to experience those things. Sure, it's unsatisfying to not know how certain things work out, but usually it's still worth it for me.

*** Oh sorry. Let's talk about the fucking plot then? That make you happy? The whole thing starts off with Fucking Harry defending himself in a bar and everyone else going omg! Nobody's ever defended themselves like that in the history of histories! He must be a third side! Now, some might think what the fuck does that even mean? He's just one guy whose made zero political claims and he's a third side?! Well some wouldn't be in the story then because the Blacks and the Malfoys (I think I don't really remember if it was the Malfs or not) are all over +Harry's+ /Storm Chaser's/ dick and Bella's got the hots for him because she's into getting beaten up by powerful wizards. Voldemort does some stupid shit and suddenly Harry's defense teacher and the board of directors or whatever they're called at Hogwarts have joined the blacks kneeling before harry's impressive girth. Oh, and Bella is trying to seduce him or something but like most of the other characters in this fic she's bland, boring and unimportant and I can't be bothered to care about her.

***** Not to be mean, but you pointed out that not everyone's native language is English. While that can excuse some grammar mishaps and spelling errors (to a point, for beyond a certain point it's more not caring than it is English not being someone's native language), and while it certainly can excuse problems with the style of writing, when the problem is that the plot jumped a shark and then made a voodoo fire instead of doing what a plot should be doing (making sense) it rather isn't something that can be excused by someone not being a native speaker because if they were so bad at English that they would translate a coherent plot into gibberish then at the same time they would be bad enough at English that they wouldn't be able to actually write a story in it.

Edit: That said, yes, I agree that OP may have overemphasised their issues with the style of writing over the issues with plot quality.

*** Exactly, and it doesn't really matter if someone is stating, saying, voicing, talking, uttering or vocabulating, they're all just words to go before speech. Can't see much reason for OP to get worked up TBH.

**** They are not just words to go before speech. They are called said bookisms, and they are a sign of lazy, or more often bad, writing. Said and a few variations like 'asked' are mostly invisible to the reader; said bookisms tend to draw unnecessary attention.

Besides, it is often a shortcut. Instead of showing through body language, or construct the dialog in a manner that implies the way the character said it, the author just puts it in the dialogue tag. This, among other things, avoids showing characterization and it also prevents the reader from immersing himself in the story.

The writing in Wind Shear had quite a lot of problems, which was disappointing considering it was recommended so much and the writer is a self-published author. It's fine if you like it, but it doesn't mean it's flawless.

****** You shouldn't have to add a dialogue tag for every line. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Harry rolled his eyes. "I can't imagine why."
#+end_quote

You already know it's Harry the one who said it. Besides, there are plenty of lines that let you know who's speaking by the manner of speech or the order in which they do so. Harry Potter is actually considered to be a bit heavy on said bookisms, but JK Rowling can pull it off because she's a good writer--to break a rule, you need certain proficiency with it.

There's a reason why so many, if not all, professional editors and authors follow this rule.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it's not like OP gets worked up over nothing--word repetition, said bookisms, poorly punctuated dialogue, /way too many/ adverbs, etc.

** Anything by Nonjon. He wrote into his stories an insidious bigoted, homophobic, misogynistic world view that makes my skin crawl in the age of Trumpism. HE must look back on what he wrote, now that he is older, and want to remove his stories from the Internet. He sounds like a 14yro trying to desperately prove he is popular, cool, absolutely has never thought of another male "that way" and really just hates his mother any anything feminine. The worst bit of story I read from him was when he had the house elf in Black Comedy talking like a nappy haired jigaboo. It made me hate him.

*** I never really noticed that from Nonjon; than again, I've read everything by /Radaslab/ and /Lionheart/. So my scale is probably calibrated differently. Also, Nonjon is writing (or attempting to write) humour, so perhaps he gets more of a pass than authors who are writing serious fics that involve Harry owning female slaves.
