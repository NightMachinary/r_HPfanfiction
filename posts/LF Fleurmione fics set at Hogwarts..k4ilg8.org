** Someone else who loves Fleurmione!! I presume you've read the classic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7169075/1/On-Teenagers-And-Love][On Teenagers And Love]]? I admit most Fleurmione stories I've come across are one-shots so few are 5k+, but there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583780/1/Animal][Animal]] by LookAtMyShoes.

If you're willing to bend on fic size, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7294853/1/Coconuts][Coconuts]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6986447/1/Library-Love][Library Love]] are very cute. If you'd rather compromise on setting, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7559031/1/Witnessed-here-in-Time-and-Blood][Witnessed Here in Time and Blood]] is epic. It's set when the trio arrive at shell cottage and personally feels very canon compliant in the sense that it really does stick to the rules of the universe, but unfortunately, is by nature too late for Hogwarts.

** I enjoyed this one GOF with a twist, Dumbledore is very fun and not evil in it, a bit smutty but mostly fluffy linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19877560/chapters/47077630]])

  Hermione gets herself in trouble with a certain irate French witch at the Quidditch World Cup and things get rather muddy.
