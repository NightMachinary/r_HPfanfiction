So... yeah. I wrote a short fanfic a while ago and was *excited* as I thought it was actually pretty good for once. I proofread carefully before posting first one chapter, then another but I had to abandon the story for a while due to school. When I returned and re-read what I've posted and the chapters I had planned I realise that I just don't like it anymore.

Has this happened to any of you? What did you do?

It is the first story I've ever posted and I got really excited about the hits and the kudos and the comments and the subscriptions... I should have asked someone help edit but it contains some weird smut so I felt awkward about trying to find a beta-reader, haha.

[TL;DR] I want to finish my story but I'm stuck. Got any advice for me?


** I think JKR said it took her 12 re-writes just to get the first chapter of the first book. Not being happy with what you've produced is the default state.

Writing, like most other things improves with practice and like most things practice is annoying and you get it wrong a lot. Think of it like a musical instrument, years of practice go into a public performance but before that you sounded shit for a long time in private, that didn't mean you weren't excited the first time you made some noise and I bet your parents clapped. Much like practice for most things it can also be a slog at times. Like most hobbies if you want to get better you need to work for it but if it always feels like work then you should think about spending your time doing something that you enjoy more. Free time is precious.

Realising what you've written is terrible is frustrating, it is however, a sign of growth. You've learnt something. Next time you'll do better. Read through it and work out what sort of thing has gone wrong. Is it a bad idea in the first place, have you done something that doesn't fit? Has a character acted very much against how they behave, is an event happening that should have been butterflied away by a previous event? Identifying errors can really help identify what you need to improve. If you are happy with how things happen but what is happening is the issue then perhaps you need to plan more for example. Editing can easily take as long as writing, editing is almost always extremely boring so I would recomend in future you write well ahead of anything you publish so if editing drags you down you can relax and write something new for a bit.

Another thing that might be worth saying is there is a very big difference between a fun story and a technically good story. Have you ever read Unattoned? Some people say its the best written fic in the entire fandom. I wouldn't say I know enough on the technical side to agree, but I can say I dislike reading it. On the other hand, there are some dumb powerwank fics that are definately guilty pleasure fics. Guilty pleasure but shit fics often get a lot of attention on FFnet etc. So long as you can tell the differnce it doesn't really matter what you write. Sort fics by favourites on any big site and you'll realise they don't generally correspond to quality all that much. Are you writing for favourites or for youself?

Finally, there is nothing wrong with having multiple unwritten fics sitting around as you work on whatever catches your attention. You don't owe anyone anything. Promising updates to people is silly and just puts pressure on you. Maybe you want that but not everyone does. Don't feel you have to finish your story just because it has some favourites if you aren't happy with it, maybe take whatever idea first sparked it and try again.

*** Thank you for all your great advice! You are right that the 'writing quality' often has nothing to do with what fics become popular - and isn't that what is so freeing and inviting with fanfiction? We appreciate each other's stories for what they are as we are all trying to get better.

One of the reasons I finally dared to post a story(except actually liking what I'd written) was that I thought I'd get feedback that would help improve my writing. The surprisingly positive response sort of changed the focus from that to just the pressure to make two good last chapters. Thank you for lifting that pressure a bit.

I think I will try to find a beta reader to get the feedback I so desperately need. But for a now just working on other (still fun) ideas does sound nice.

**** This subreddit has a discord you can join and people there are pretty friendly. Not the place to ask for your entire thing edited but they'll probably be happy to read over a small section if you're struggling.

If you're feeling really brave you can head over to the Dark Lord Potter forums where you'll get the harshest feedback but they know what they're on about.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-advice-thread.37586/][I will always recommend reading through this entire thread for anyone trying to improve their writing.]]

** It happens all the time, it's not just with you. I left a chapter "mainly ready" to post and had to take a break, and when I came back it needed so much editing you wouldn't believe! There are some things you can try, the first is to look for a beta reader (they are magical beings that take your chapter when you think it's finished and suggest a lot of changes). When we're writing we don't have the emotional distance necessary to tell whether it's good or not, and betas help a lot with that. If you can't (or don't want to get one), one way is to wait a day before you post and not touch it for that time, and the next day read it again (out loud if necessary).

***** For the HP fandom, there's a Facebook group called Wordsmiths & Betas that's meant to make finding a beta easier (If I'm not mistaken, they have an album with beta profiles). You can also make a post asking for a beta on a FB group that's specific to your pairing (for fics about the Marauders, there's Shrieking Shack Society, for rarer pairs there's The Fairest of the Rare, and so on and so forth). Just make sure the person is okay with the pairing and with whatever kind of smut it is that you've mentioned (and that there isn't any group rules that forbid it, that's important as well).

** Yeah I had that happen with the first several things I posted.

It's so hard when you think hey I actually like this and I want others to see it. Then you go back later and it's full of errors and doesn't flow or whatever.

It took some effort but now if I write something I just save it to my drive and then come back and check on it in some days or weeks to edit and add to.

Eventually i'll post something but i think i'll do the wait till a story is fully finished and mostly edited before doing so.

*** Glad to hear I'm not the only one, haha.\\
I think the next time I feel like posting something I will also wait till it's fully finished. Although the pressure of having someone waiting for updates makes me write a lot more, it also takes some of the fun out of it.

** This literally just happened to me recently. (BTW, I'm brand new to reddit as a user - been a lurker forever on various subs, but created an account today to get involved in this sub because I have recently come back to fanfic and am super bummed that the HPFF community - as in, the actual "HPFF" site/forums - is no longer what it used to be. I digress).

I posted a ton of stuff years (and I mean /years/) ago and abandoned some WIP's when I got busy and completely faded away. I finally got the bug to pick it up again, and while I have a good emotional connection with most things I'd posted, as I looked back over some pieces/chapters I was like, /That's horrendous, why did you actually write it like that?/

I posted new chapters on a couple of fics to get the updates /out there/, but resolved to go back and revise earlier things that were bugging me, too. If what you're dealing with is mainly ticky-tack annoyances, I'd suggest doing that.

Our minds and abilities change over time, and sometimes when you look at older work, you just realize you were less mature (as a writer), less polished, etc., so I think it's really normal (even good!) to look back at your old stuff and think it's too crude, over-embellished, doesn't flow, what have you.

If you're just really horrified and don't want anyone reading it at all in its current state, you can just make it into a "draft" (or similar function depending on where you're posting) so readers can't see it while you tidy it up - then post your updates once you get the glitches out! One of my stories that was pretty popular back in the day - I went back and re-read it and cringed so hard I couldn't stand it. I've hidden it for now so I can do major re-works of a few things before I pursue an update.

And I agree with [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]], sometimes you just need to let yourself write something else to clear your head and see what is really inspiring you. Maybe try out a new fic with the same/related characters, see if a fresh approach helps you figure out what didn't work the first time.

*** Welcome to Reddit and thanks for your advice and encouragement!\\
I had no idea you could make already posted content back into drafts, might do that!\\
I think I will abandon this story for a while and write on something more enjoyable until I'm up for the challenge of editing the whole thing again.

**** Thank you and you're welcome. :) Just a caveat as to the “draft” feature. I'm nowhere near an expert with most sites so please take my suggestion with a grain of salt and make sure your preferred site actually allows such a thing. I could totally be wrong and it wouldn't be the first time. :)
