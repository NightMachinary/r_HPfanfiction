Just reading a lot of fics where things are better in mainland europe in reagards to bloodpurists and the fact that people dont like it

To me it always simple - Grindlewald killed all the blood purists because they stood against him and the only reason Dumbledore didn't intervene earlier is because bigots were the ones most vocal -in england - about fighting against him because they felt their power would be gone if he won and dumbledore didnt want to look like he supported them

If you have an actual opinion on this then pls post if you just agree/disagree and want to express it be polite otherwise dont comment


** Too many fics just sort of assume that Dark Wizard = Pureblood Supermacist, but it makes more sense for Grindelwald to have drawn the line at wizardry, not ancestry.

I haven't seen a fic that made your headcanon explicit, though too many (usually ones that bash Dumbledore) assume that the rest of Europe is more progressive than Britain. (Because no-Muggleborns-allowed!Durmstrang totally makes sense in Progressive!Europe...)

Some authors (e.g., [[/u/Starfox5]]) make the opposite case but for the same reason: Grindelwald offered Muggleborns equality, and they had flocked to his cause. With his defeat, their oppression had redoubled, and they are viewed with distrust.

** It is my personal headcanon also that Grindelwald was staunchly against Blood supremacy too. If anything, I'd imagine a great deal of his followers were Halfs and Muggleborns. His ideals never gave me the impression of a proto-Death Eater group. Dude was just a ruthless speciest, in the same vein as Magneto. He probably preached that Magic is Magic, regardless of blood.

*** I too prefer the magic supremacist rather than blood purist idea of Grindlewald.

*** In the movies he mention that "magic blooms only in rare souls". And that he didn't hate muggles but the had a different purpose most likely enslavement. But i don't think he was a blood purist like voldemort was.

** Personally, I agree with you. It makes sense to me, that Grindy would kill off the people who went against him and their positions would end up being filled with the survivors. It's also possible that those survivors would also be Pureblood and that stigma against non-Purebloods would be even stronger after the trouble, but I think it'd be quite likely that many non-Purebloods would end up in power.

** It's simple - we don't know enough about continental Europe - or where the magical communities might divide in their opinion - to state how it should be in canon. We do have a few possible hints - France seems to be more open to non-humans, with Fleur seemingly highly respected (despite obvious Veela heritage) and Madame Maxime in a position of high authority (despite being a half giant, though she tries to hide it to a degree). Durmstrang is described fairly evidently as darker than Hogwarts, but along with other factors let us interpret it in various ways (eg - dark in Britain aligns itself with Purebloods and blood supremacy - so we could assume similar for Bulgaria & Durmstrang. Alternatively, given Bulgaria's use of Veelas, their Prime Minister seeming to like Harry for defeating Voldemort, and Krum having no issues with Hermione being muggleborn, we could see them uncoupling those two ideologies).

That opens up Europe - and regions of Europe - to different interpretations on blood purists. Your view would be a very possible one, particularly in central/western Europe - though it would require fleshing out Grindelwald's war, and if they managed to actually control any parts of Europe or just acted as terrorists.

I think there are plenty of other roads to take to get to whatever state in different parts of Europe that an author wants - either more pro/anti-muggleborn, more pro/anti-demihumans, etc.

** I've seen at least a couple of fics where Grindelwald breaks out of Nurmengard and actually fights against Voldemort.
