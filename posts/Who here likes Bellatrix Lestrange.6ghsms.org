I adore her. Though it seems like no else does. Am I alone?


** I love how Helena Bonhart Carter plays her in the movies. I wouldn't say that I really like her as a character that much, but she is just so wonderfully crazy and expressive so I definitely love to watch her in action. That scene where she plays Hermione who is poly juiced as Bellatrix trying to act as Bellatrix was really good. In the books she is also quite awesome in a crazy death eater kind of way.

** I see Ginny having a lot in common with her: aggressive, devoted, loyal, pretty, and powerful. If you swapped their upbringings, you would have a Ginevra Lestrange who was Voldemort's chief enforcer, and a Bellatrix Potter who was Harry's heroic wife.

You can go all edgy if you want, but at the end of the day she's still murdering people because they came from muggles.

******* Well going after civilians and torturing them to death during raids is pretty evil, regardless of alignment.

Being a hero doesn't mean that you're the perfect embodiment of Good or Light, It means that you're ready to fight for your cause no matter the price, and that you're ready to sacrifice your own life for it.

It is absolutely possible to be an evil hero. Which Bellatrix is since she's ready to give absolutely everything for Voldemort. I don't think she would hesitate a second before taking an AK or him.

Does that justify whether or not she's truly evil? If one side states that she is? Because perhaps, she's under he Imperius. She was always capable of love, albeit being a psychopath.

******** You're missing the point. Book - *Canon* - Bellatrix is pure evil. That is the entire point of having her character in the book. She's a big fat neon-red marker to underline Voldemorts evil with her fanaticism. That is literally her entire purpose in the original books. We never see her in other occasions, because we don't need to. She's not in the book to be a deep character, she's in the books to be a target for Harry's primal hatred. And thats it.

If you like Canon-Bellatrix as a person, best case is you're just trying to be superedgy.

The moment we stop talking exclusively about canon, I'm willing to let all these "Imperius, Amortentia, Brainwashing,..." explanations count. As I said before, we only see her in the situations of fight or immense stress. I don't think I have to tell you just /how many/ fics are out there that explain her insanity and evil in some way - some better, some less so.

I personally like to think that she was relatively /there/ before Azkaban. Voldemort, for her, was a pragmatic choice she had to make in order to keep her family. But Azkaban - without the help of an animagus form to keep relatively sane - twisted her into the bloodlusty psychopath we read of in the books.

But yeah, to wrap it up: Canon-Bellatrix is pure evil. Full Stop. Fanon-Bella has some options in this regard.
