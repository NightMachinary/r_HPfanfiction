I'm looking for a fic in which Harry has an unusual power that is central to, or plays at least a moderate part in, the story.

The power can be anything that others witches and wizards generally can't do. Doesn't have to be unique but should be rare or very rare.

Longer fics are preferable and completed is even more important. Thanks!


** The proper fair for this type of post would be *REQUEST*.

**** I can see how that could be thought of that way... but the way I remember it is: the flair is from YOUR perspective. That is, are you REQUESTING something? Or are you RECOMMENDING something?

â€‹

*Request* - Asking the community to give you stories that meet your requested criteria

*Recommendation* - Is when you just finished some totally awesome story and you want to recommend it to everyone else to read.

*What's That Fic* - Is when you can't remember the name a story, but you think you can remember a couple details or maybe a whole scene from it and you want to see if anyone else can recognize it and help you out.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]] Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow

It's in an AU where Voldemort wins the first war and Harry's parents are still alive. It's pretty dark but Harry is still a good character. He catches the attention of Voldemort and he becomes a sort of mentor to Harry/ friend. Harry ends up having a unique ability that helps him win the tri tournament. It's incomplete but still updates, irregularly.
