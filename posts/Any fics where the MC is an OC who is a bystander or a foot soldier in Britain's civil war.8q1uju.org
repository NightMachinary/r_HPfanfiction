Something where the main character is utterly powerless to do anything on a major scale about the war but they're still trying their best to survive?

Edit: hey come on I don't think it's /that/ bad. If you can read 400 stories of godmode Harry thrashing his allies and enemies with ease, you can read a single one about somebody original who doesn't follow the stations of canon except where the consequences directly affect them.


** I think it's a fine idea actually, but I can't see how it's a Harry Potter fanfiction. But wizards during the Civil War would be pretty cool. Did I read something very dark and interesting recently where the king (was it James I?) was a wizard?

*** Ah, I meant the civil war featured in canon with Voldemort. I was thinking of a story through the eyes of somebody like Arthur Weasley, somebody who is very much at risk of some gruesome shit but they don't really have the option to run away and look for Voldemort's Soul Toys so they have to stick around and make do somehow.

**** Oh, you might like the Anguis Series which the later stories have the original characters working for the regime as they can't risk their families but at the same time doing everything they can to bring it down.

There's also the Scarlet Pimpernal and The Sleeper Awakes with Percy.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  It's been coming on for a while," said Percy ... "But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time." DH, ch30 . This is Percy's journey to that point.

**** Ah, I see. Was it referred to as the Civil War then? I thought it was just the wizarding war. Mind you, the Civil War sounds like a more interesting source of material for a fic.

***** I said civil war because in my mind the British wizard war was basically a civil war. To be honest I think a civil war fic would be way more interesting than the idea behind my original post.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
