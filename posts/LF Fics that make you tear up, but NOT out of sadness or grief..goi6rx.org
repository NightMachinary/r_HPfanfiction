What are some fics that made you cry from laughing too much, or cry out in relief after a tense point in the story, or cry from parental pride after one of the characters showed a lot of growth?

What are some recommendations and how did they make you tear up?

Preferences for canon ships and no character bashing.

** Can't really remember any fanfics that elicited this response, I'm afraid. Sometimes a community coming together to overcome hardship or tragedy will get me weepier than the hardship or tragedy itself, but generally only for visual mediums like films or tv. Not so much for text.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** A03link(running on air by Eleventy)

God I don't even like M/M pairings but man it was so freaking well written. It was realistic and gritty in a way that wasn't cringy or depressing. It was just super emotional and beautifully written in a way I cannot imagine being able to write.

** FloreatCastellum has a lot of lovely canon verse fics. These two in particular made me feel really touched.

linkao3(19943710; 18648013)

These two short oneshots by esama subvert popular fic tropes (WBWL and forced marriage) and are just hilarious.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114]]

Knowledge of pervious parts is not needed. Of a Linear circle Part 3. When harry is asked to be adopted. When he meets a house elf. When the horcrux temporarily takes over his body and the mental battle that follows. When he meets another basilisk. When he finds out he's related to tbree of the founders of Hogwarts. I shed a tear or two of joy during all of these scenes. There are a lot of funny moments too, like when Harry is brewing the oculus potion. But I have spoiled this enough.
