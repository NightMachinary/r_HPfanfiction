I don't care for family fics much, but this amusing idea came to me and like always, seeing that I'm a terrible writer, thought to put it here. Please keep in mind that it's humor. Don't complain about Harry and Ginny being terrible parents.

--------------

Like her mother, Ginny is very fertile, so Harry and Ginny have 21 children:

"Who were you again?" Harry asked apologetically.

"I'm Firenze, dad!" The boy said, annoyed, but not offended. It happened a lot, after all.

"Sorry, sorry, son. What's the problem, do you have trouble with your girlfriend? What was her name, Milley?"

"No, dad. It's Grawp who is dating Milley. I'm only eight." The boy said, wrinkling his nose at the thought of dating a girl.

"Ah, uh, sorry Firenze. What's wrong then?" He asked, trying desperately to keep an eye on the tottelors playing in the living room.

"Collin stole my book!" Firenze said angrily.

"I'll take care of it, mate." Harry said, smiling, happy to finally be able to help.

As he started to go and find Collin, he froze. Which one was Collin? He looked desperately at the kids playing around him. Was Collin the five or six year old boy playing with a quaffle in the yard? The boy turned and Harry saw his green eyes. No, no, he was Dobby. Only Dobby and Albus had green eyes. He finally decided to get help. He turned and started toward the kitchen.

Ginny was busy cooking, and screaming herself raw, by the looks of it. Around 6 children ranging from babies to teenagers were squirming in the kitchen, getting under their mother's feet.

"Hey, you guys!" Harry said sternly. "Move on. Your mom is trying to cook here."

After the kids reluctantly left, Harry approached his relieved looking wife and asked helplessly. "Ginny, which of the kids is Collin?"

Ginny looked lost. "Collin?"

"Yeah. He apparently has stolen Firenze's book." Harry said.

"Uh, isn't he the one with the Weird Sisters t-shirt who is standing outside?" Ginny said with uncertainty.

Harry looked out of the kitchen door at the aforementioned boy. "No, that's Kreacher. I remember him beating that boy for mocking his name last week."

Ginny lifted her hands in the air helplessly. "I don't remember. Call him or something."

Harry sighed heavily. "It doesn't work. You know that. They keep claiming to be each other all the time."


** When I was in high school I dated a guy that was 1 of 11 siblings. At some point his dad just gave up and started calling every girl Connie. His own daughters, his kids' girlfriends, any female children that came over to visit. The boys were just "hey you!"

He didn't even have any kids named Connie though.

** /September 1, 2025; Potter Residence/

"James hasn't been home since he started dating that stupid Polly Chapman," Minerva complained as she made her toast. "I bet he won't come today either."

"Polly is not stupid," Ginny said patiently.

"The woman still can't tell Rubius and me apart," Colin complained. “It's not that difficult, seriously. I'm the redhead, Rubius the giant. "

"I'm not a giant!" Complained Rubius and crossed his arms over his chest.

"You're a head taller than me even though you're ten months younger!" Colin said, straightening his glasses.

“Don't argue children. We have to go to the train station in half an hour,” Harry said patiently. Then he started counting. When he was just at eight a bloodcurdling scream went through the house.

"Daaad!" Shouted a voice from above. One of the girls. A little later she came running down ... and looked like a doused poodle. "Dad! Neville exchanged my sleakeasy for olive oil!"

Harry looked briefly at the girl until he remembered her name. "Lily - go wash your hair, I'll talk to Neville."

“But my bathroom time is over! It's Dora's turn now,” Lily moaned.

"Then go to the lower bathroom," he sighed. Lily made a face. “That's the boys bathroom. Have you ever looked in there? I'd rather kiss a dementor. "

“Hey!” Complained several of his sons.

“This is a disaster, Dad! I'm Head Girl - how will the others respect me when I look like a drowned kneazle? "

"You are Head Girl?! Congratulations! I'm so proud of you,” Harry said and tried to kiss Lily on the forehead. Lily avoided him and looked at him unimpressed. “I know Dad, you told me this the last three times when I told you. Have you already forgotten again?"

"Um, of course not. I just wanted to tease you, darling,” Harry said quickly.

"Of course Dad - anyway - I'm the oldest, I think I should get five minutes more time in the bathroom." Lily said with her hands on her hips. She looked incredibly similar to her mother. Before the hair crisis could be resolved, however, there was renewed screeching. What now? Harry wondered, turning around.

In the middle of the breakfast table was Kreacher, the toad. It belonged to ... one of the boys. Harry thought for a moment before seeing Reggie sailing across the table trying to recapture the toad. Ah, so it was his. Reggie jumped across the table like a frog, trying to catch the toad, but throwing eggs and toast on the floor. It was Minerva, Molly, and Myrtle, the triplets, who had screamed. They had scrambled eggs in their hair. Immediately he pulled out his wand, shocked the toad and handed it to his 8th born son.

"Put it in a cage, will you?" Harry said wearily, watching out of the corner of his eye as Ginny was removing the scrambled eggs from her daughters' hair.

"MUM!" Yelled another voice.

"If there isn't a fire, I don't want to know!" Ginny yelled back. Another daughter - one with Harry's black hair this time - stuck her head into the kitchen.

“But mum! Wulfric and Brian poured some juice all over my summer homework!” Complained Andy, one of the two elder twins.

"She's lying, Mum!" Came a voice right afterwards. Her twin Dora. The two were like water and oil. "She didn't do her homework at all."

"That is not true!"

"You had to mess around with Alexander Flint all summer!"

"At least I have a private life - you only have your stupid kneazle!"

"Enough!" Said Harry, giving his second oldest daughter a stern look. "Who is Alexander Flint?"

The twins looked at each other briefly - a wordless conversation passed between them - then they said as if from one mouth: "Nobody."

"He's the Slytherin Quidditch captain," said his third oldest son, Remus, who had just sat down at the kitchen table. "They say he does drugs and he's been already suspended twice."

"Dora was caught with him in a broom closet last year," added his fourth oldest son Neville with a grin.

"You two are dead," Andy informed them, then turned to Harry. "It's really not as bad as everyone thinks - he's just misunderstood.“

Harry rubbed his forehead. Before he could say anything, Ginny shouted, "Five minutes, Harry!"

"Right - right, one, two, three, four, five, six, the triplets make nine, Colin is ten, Rubius is eleven - where is Al?"

“Al graduated from Hogwarts last year, Dad. He's been living with his boyfriend for a month.“ Lily reminded him. "We helped him move in."

"Right, the Malfoy boy," Harry remembered. "Does that mean Arthur is going to Hogwarts this year?"

"No, Dad, I'm only ten," said the boy in question. Nine-year-old Emmeline slapped him on the head. "You idiot! We could have told him that we can both go to Hogwarts! "

"That wouldn't have worked," said eight-year-old Susan precociously. "Only those who are on the list are allowed under the Sorting Hat."

Harry blinked. “Who told you about the Sorting Hat? That should be a surprise. "

Six-year-old Orion rolled his eyes. “Dad, with Colin and Ruby there are eleven Potters at Hogwarts. There are no secrets about Hogwarts left in this family. "

"Three minutes!" Ginny announced.

"Right - kids, we have to go!" Said Harry.

"But my hair!"

"My homework!"

"Neville stole my tie!"

"There's a toad sitting on my suitcase!"

The children's voices boomed through the kitchen. Harry sighed. They'd probably miss the train - again. It was a good thing that Stan Shunpinke started to give them quantity discount. Before he could get his band of rascals under control the doorbell rang.

"It's open!" Ginny yelled over the chaos. Harry quickly helped Lily to spell the oil out of her hair and threatened Neville to keep his broom at home until Remus told him Neville wasn't playing Quidditch. In the next moment Teddy, James and Albus were standing at the door with grins on their lips. All the children jumped up and looked at their older siblings. They babbled, complained, or talked excitedly about their lives. Teddy took out his wand and fired a warning shot in the air. Immediately they all fell silent. Sometimes Harry felt like his children didn't respect him.

"Oi, you little hell lions," Teddy said. "You know how it's done - Hufflepuffs and first years to me!"

Remus, Colin, and Rubius trudged obediently to Ginny and Harry's eldest.

"Gryffindors, to me," yelled James. Lily, Lavender, and Neville followed James. Albus didn't have to say anything at all. Dora, Andy and the triplets were already at his side.

"Have you ever noticed that half of our kids are Slytherins?" Harry asked in the direction of Ginny while cleaning the table with a spell.

“Dad, we are a really large family. To be cunning is a question of survival at this point”, explained seven year old Regulus, who was pulling a piece of ham out of his hair.

“Harry, you have to go if you want to catch the train! Quick, quick!” Ginny shooed the last of the children out of the kitchen. Harry kissed her goodbye.

„Fourteen done, seven to go“, she said, giving their younger children breakfast. Harry smiled and followed the kids out of the house to their enchanted car. As if by miracle, they even made it to the train station on time - and there was only one bloody nose. Harry counted that as a win.

*** 1. None of the kids think it's special that their dad saved the world because there are 20 other kids in the same boat.

2. They don't get stared at at Hogwarts or anywhere else (except for the fact that they make a lot of noise).

3. Ron once made a joke about Harry compensating for something and Harry got a far away look “so many people died to protect me”.

4. Grandma Molly used to get sad about how quiet the Burrow was with everyone moved out but now she is grateful to get some time to herself.

5. Harry has had to take on a permanent position as DADA professor because he was just as often getting called in for misbehaviour. (This conflicts with him being a good dad to the kids at home so maybe just flying instructor so he can stay home most of the time).

**** Well there were 50 unnamed victims at the Battle of Hogwarts + Remus + Tonks + Fred + Collin, also Sirius, Dumbledore (who had four names to choose from), Cedric, Lily, James, Snape. Also there are plenty of people that didn't die so I think they can go for a while with no great concerns. And if it comes down to it, he can always go to Voldemort Lord Potter. After all it was Voldemort, even if unintentionally, who shaped Harry as a man.

** Seeing how Occlumency canonically involves organizing your mind, and is a kind of mental judo where you redirect probes and attacks (that whole "build a shield" thing is fanon), I've always had the personal fanon assumption that mastering it gives you a form of eidetic memory. Which is why I believe Dumbledore makes use of his own pensive so much; it's to store all the extra things he remembers that he does not need or want to remember.

Working under that idea, that Occlumency gives you a form of perfect recall, it'd be pretty funny if Harry was forced to finally get a handle on it */after/* the war was over and Voldemort was dead, because it's the only way he can keep all his kids and their lives straight.
