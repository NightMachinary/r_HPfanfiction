:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fanfic on either ao3 or ffn but I'm leaning towards ao3 around a month ago.. I forgot to bookmark it & I could not find it in my history. After the war Harry Potter learns that due to him being a horcrux he is unable to father children Ginny promptly leaves him for someone else. Harry started to search for a solution to his infertility & faded away from wizarding Britain's eye along the way. Eventually he starts traveling overseas to mainland Europe & elsewhere on his search for fixing his sterility while learning other stuff along the way. This is where I think time travel came in but I'm not sure.

While Harry learned a lot on his travels he wasn't able to fix his infertility, depressed he finally gave up his search. He later settled down in Sunnydale where canon events of BTVS play-out & gradually starts seeing Buffy as a surrogate daughter.

Towards the end of the fanfic Hermione who was searching for Harry made the connection that Harry Potter is Rupert Giles who had become quite famous in his published research about vampires. Harry & Hermione spent time reconnecting & visited Buffy's grave at the end of the fanfic.

EDIT: This is a completed fanfic & I'm pretty sure it was a one-shot/two-shot. EDIT2: Over a month later I found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/33/The-random-craziness-file]]
