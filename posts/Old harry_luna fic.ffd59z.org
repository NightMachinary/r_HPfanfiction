:END:
I'm trying to find a very old fic at this point that was on the restricted section all I can remember about it was that it starts with harry finding luna in the ROR to comfit her after hearing about her dad dying and that it had a dudly/oc side paring later in the story .

If anyone know of the fic I'm vaguely describing and has a link to it I would be very grateful.
