Please offer a justification and some explanation. A class or list of classes without any explanation isn't a particularly interesting point of discussion. Also, here is the list of current classes without any explanation.

First Year Classes:

- Transfiguration

- Defense Against the Dark Arts

- Potions

- Charms

- Herbology

- History of Magic

- Astronomy

- Flying

Third Year Electives:

- Care of Magical Creatures

- Arithmancy

- Ancient Runes

- Divination

Sixth/Seventh Year Electives:

- Apparition

- [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/alchemy][Alchemy*]]

** Language classes. Possibly with extra lessons on origins and translations of spells.

One mandatory year of Study of Wizarding Societies. Explaining how the Wizarding World is structured, what laws there are, how the Ministry works and how Magical Societies are structured in other countries. Maybe also some chapters on the ICW?

** I would add a more physically challenging subject. Notice that most are all theory or a mixture of the two. There isn't a subject that would burn the kids out at the end of the day. Good old fashioned Phys. Ed. would help the kids in the long run.

Keeping kids physically, mentally, and magically tired would help lessen the shenanigans...and maybe provide stronger graduates too.

** Okay, firstly:

- Latin & Ancient Greek classes

Okay, so I normally include characters having a Latin dictionary to hand for figuring out spells, but given that the majority of spell roots seem to come from Latin or Ancient Greek, I feel like lessons in both would be really useful for students of magic.

I know that they study individual theories of magic in Transfiguration and Charms in terms of the physics of it, but a more comprehensive study of languages involved in spellwork would make it so much easier to work through their years at Hogwarts.

- Modern language classes

I'm sincerely opposed to any children being raised to only speak one language, honestly - there's no excuse for it in a modern society, and magical foreign relations would almost definitely be improved by kids learning languages like French, Arabic, German, Russian... Or, you know, learning languages like Mermish or Troll!

Who doesn't want kids chatting with the merpeople in the lake on a summer evening?

- Spell Creation.

Okay, so this I'd love to see as a NEWT elective for more talented students, as it obviously wouldn't be great for twelve-year-olds to blow themselves up trying to make a charm to make their quill look like a Pikachu or whatever, but encouraging kids to approach spell creation in a safe environment would be fabulous for the magical world in terms of bolstering productivity and novel sorts of magic.

- Textiles & Design

Okay, this one is my personal whimsy as a gay boy speaking, but I am so into the idea of Hogwarts with a class that teaches sewing and tailoring charms, charms to customize their clothes, as well as spells for approaching woodwork and the like.

Magical children presumably will never know the true satisfaction of soldering something, but I'd love to see Design courses as a third year elective, with kids learning to design certain crafty things and then approaching them.

Making one's own clothes is exciting, and so is burning designs into wood and the like. It'd be great for them. Miserable little shits might avoid being nearly killed for once, so long as Harry was kept out of the class.

There should be a magic literacy course for muggle born students. A complement to Muggle Studies. That would solve this problem. It would teach household magic and discuss aspects of the magical world that wouldn't make sense to muggle born students.

*** I would agree on the language classes. However, in-universe, teaching mermish/troll/any other non-human language wouldn't fly by blood-supremasists.

I think spell creation shouldn't be taught in Hogwarts. It should be after the fact. Unstable spells would wreak havok in Hogwarts. Maybe advanced maths instead? E.g calculous. It'll provide a supplement to arithmancy too.

** I imagine that there is a fair bit of Magic Theory taught in all classes, especially Transfiguration and Arithmancy, but I always figured it should be a class. Maybe it wasn't offered because there isn't a whole lot of theory behind magic in general?

Clearly there is a great deal of research done in the Department of Mysteries, or at least we are lead to believe as such, but it would only make sense to teach it in school.

Also there appear to be a marked lack of prerequisites for courses. It would make sense to have some NEWT level courses on more advanced subjects that have OWL perquisites.

*** There is a lot of theory - you have whole books related to one charm mentioned. And there are prerequisites - there was matter of potions and Snape demanding Outstanding whereas Slughorn IIRC was content with Exceding Expectations.

** I would definitely add something political. Granted, it is somewhat covered in History of Magic, but that's more the context for what happens today. Something to do with the functions of the Ministry of Magic, the political positions that each Minister has taken, foreign policy, etc.

** Hogwarts as a whole seems to be a middle school, high school and technical college all rolled into one, but I'd like to see classes oriented toward research and study. A class like Philosophy of Magic might be an interesting topic to explore.

** - artifacting (wizarding shop class)

- sex ed (contaceptive charms, etc., mandatory for 3rd- or 4th- years)
- intro to wizarding law
- wizard lit
- intro to the wizarding world (for 1st-year muggleborns)

** Easy: [[http://forumsdev.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=222500&postcount=979][gum magic]].

(Actually, any random chapter of Flairgold's trilogy is likely to have some brand-new, invented-on-the-spot, world-breaking, magic system.)

** Languages, cooking, houshold-charms, enchanting and tool-creation (including how to create magical items including something like those communication-mirrors and maybe even swords etc.), wizard-traditions, politics and economy, spell-creation and maybe something physical like fencing :)

Oh and something really neglected:

Art, music and maybe creative writing :)

** It would be lovely if Muggle born students were given the option of taking the GCSES/A-levels and wizard students also had to take some GCSEs as well. I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] covered how unfair it is to essentially cripple Muggleborn students if they ever want to get a job in their world or go on to muggle university. If they drop out of the magical world, they're trapped in menial jobs without test scores.

Since so much of standardized tests are memorization-based, I would like to see memorization potions/study aids used to cram it all in so they can also focus on magical subjects. So it'd be nice to see GCSEs: Year 1, Year 2, etc.

Edit: sorry, I misread the post and thought you were looking for electives.

** Muggle-world infiltration: a yearly basic survival skills course that is required for all students, though they can 'test out' at the beginning of term if they make it through the simulated field test for that term's topic [starting with basic fashion; using money; using transit all the way to modern vocabulary, conversational immersion and media-based colloquialisms]

Art, Music. Literature

Philosophy, Ethics

Citizenship and Civics in the Wizarding World

Advanced Muggle Studies:\\
AMS: Earth Science\\
AMS: Physics; Chemistry; Biology\\
