I am looking for fics where Hedwig is more than just a standard owl!

By that I don't mean that she is somehow Merlin reincarnated, but that she is somehow important to the story or the plot. There is something extra to her.

Three Examples: ( but not limited to them)

Hedwig becomes a phoenix on her first death (I know it's cheesy but I like it)

Hedwig is a major emotional support and it plays a role in the story.

There is an actual benefit to a familiar bond, be it big or small.

â€‹

Of course, completed stories are preferred, but stories that are not dead and are being uptdated (like in the last 12 months) are welcome.


** Hedwig being major emotional support is actually pretty accuracte to canon as well. Harry was more devastated than I was losing my pet dog of 10+ years. Plus I find that most stories have her being a kind of support for Harry early on at least. The way Harry is terrified even of accidentally leaving Hedwig at the Dursleys/castle/Hermiones/Rons is hilarious.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

**** Hm I don't know why it's rated M. I definitely don't remember any explicit content. Hedwig is actually an Animagus and she's a young girl I think a little older than Harry. It's been a while since I read it but it's not what you're thinking lol.

  She's a suave, flying personification of unstoppable demonic fury. But you can call her Mother Owl.

Hedwig isn't the main character but she is becoming a true magical familiar. I'm considering naming the new species that she's turning into 'the Tundra Phoenix,' though it won't be 'Fawkes, but ice instead of fire.'

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.
