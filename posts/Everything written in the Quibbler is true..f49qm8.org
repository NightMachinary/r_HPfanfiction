Maybe its a secret agent newspaper and "nargle" is a code word. Maybe it prints things that the government is trying to hush up, in a way that is beneath their notice. Maybe magic is really just that bizarre. Maybe there's some other explanation. Regardless, every single article in the Quibbler, from Stubby Boardman to Spectrespecs is real.


** I read a fic once where Luna meets Sirius and she calls him Stubby Boardman. He then says something along the lines of "we dress up once as the famous band to get free drinks and it still haunts me?"

*** Yes, although they're wrong about the Crumple Horned Snorkack. I mean, it's obviously a magical strain of brontothere, and at that size it's clearly not a an arctic or subarctic species - Bergmann's Rule tells us that the larger species are found in colder climates, and the Crumple Horned Snorcack is /small/ - and frankly it's probably an example of island dwarfism to boot.

They're being misled because the type specimen was found in the First Mate's cabin of a tramp steamer in Malm√∂, so they're hunting all over Scandinavia, but who knows where that vessel had been previously? They'd have better luck hunting on tropical islands, frankly.

** I don't know about nargles. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that there are a lot of animals that haven't been discovered or have been discovered and through time, been forgotten. I mean think about it, on the non-magical world there are species that are considered extinct even though there are reports of their sightings and some scientists even have rediscovered some of them, and that's with non-magicals outnumbering magicals by at least 7 billions of people. So imagine that there are parts of the world that haven't been visited by any magicals and muggles, and there is a high chance that there are numerous species there that are living their lives, going unnoticed by humans. I mean not all magicals can see thestrals so the existence of some creatures that you have to have certain qualities to see them is not unthinkable. What do you think?

Btw the part about a guy finding animals that were thought extinct is about Forrest Galante whom I saw on the Joe Rogan Podcast. I do recommend watching it. It's very interesting.

** Maybe they report on what's going on in other parts of the multiverse/alternate timelines.Would fit in with the trope that the Lovegoods are a Lovecraft reference.

** The way I handled it as a minor detail in one of my fics was that much of the Quibbler is thinly-veiled political satire. Most people just take what's written at face value, either believing or dismissing it, but the clever ones find it insightful and amusing.

At least that's how it was until Pandora Lovegood's death, when Xeno cracked...

*** Which fic are you talking about? There was one I read not too long ago (no idea which one at this point) where it's pointed out that everything in The Quibbler is basically written in code. So that part about gum disease taking down the ministry from the inside is actually referencing death eaters - because eating Death is probably not good for your oral hygiene. I wish I knew which one it was.

This was really just a bit of a throwaway in the fic, but it there were a couple of examples given and then Hermione asked for a copy of the last few years of The Quibbler so that she could catch up on their style of commentary.

  "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world." Some would say that Hogwarts is the wrong place for Umino Iruka, and he's about to find out. With new students, he hopes to light the Will of Fire in this new world while new dangers lurk in the darkness. No overpowered ninjas running roughshod over the Potterverse in this fic! Mentor!Iruka, Gen fic
