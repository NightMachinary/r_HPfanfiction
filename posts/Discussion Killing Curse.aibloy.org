So, the killing curse requires genuine hate and desire for someone to die to work. So, if someone were to step in the way of a killing curse meant for someone else, they would live because it wasn't hate at that person.


** The Cruciatus requires hate and the desire to deal out pain (according to Bellatrix).

We have no idea what you need to cast the Killing Curse (even the wiki still states "citation needed" for that claim). We can only go off a few points here, one being Barty Crouch Jr. who claims that no 4th year could cast the spell successfully. The books don't provide a lot of pointers here.

However, it would make sense that the spell requires some emotional or at least intellectual foundations to work. If that in itself could create a "shield" for people who were not supposed to be the target is a question I'd rather answer with "no".

*** I also wouldn't call Bellatrix a reliable source, despite her apparent mastery. It is entirely possible for other ways to cast that spell, especially considering that Harry couldn't cast it properly after she had killed Sirius, but Carrow got one for spitting in McGonagall's face (who was utterly useless to Harry for 98% of his Hogwarts time).

**** Sadness overrules the anger in this situation I guess, though we may never know, but I don't think Harry felt that much anger in the moment of Sirius' passing and more pain and sadness.

While Carrow spitting in Minerva's face was just fueled by pure hatred. McGonagall had not that close of a relationship with Harry, I agree, but the act itself can be described with hatred towards someone Harry respected.

As for the killing curse, we know that someone can sacrifice himself through the power of love. But I think the mental state to be able to cast a killing curse should probably be something close to a point were someone threatens another person with a pistol, e.g. Robbery, intense hatred, self protection etc.

** No, it's more about the intent that the caster wants /someone/ to die, than just hating one person.

** No.

If I hate X and I cast the killing curse at him, I still cast a fully powered killing curse. Y will die even if she wasn't the target.

See: Fawkes' forced burning day when intercepting the killing curse intended for Dumbledore. Fawkes wasn't the target. Under your theory, he wouldn't have been harmed at all.

** There was a fic, I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unforgivable Tournament) that posed the idea that you need hate, but not a specified hate. So if you can call on your hate for Voldemort (which would be strong enough to power the curse) you can use it.

** In the Half-Blood Prince, a Death Eater called Gibbon ends up in front of a killing curse meant for Lupin and gets killed, so yes, an accidental subject would die.

** It is not genuine hate. It is not personal.

It is a genuine intent to kill.

** The Killing Curse doesn't require any hate, you just need to want to kill the other guy. Casting it while aiming to kill X will still kill Y if Y jumps in the way, since it is a fully formed spell that is fired, and not a dud. The exact situation happens in Book 6, where Rowle throws around the Killing Curse like crazy, and hits one of his comrades, Gibbon.

None of the Unforgivables require any hate - you can want to dominate, torture or kill someone without any feelings attached.

** It's one which intrigues me.

I mean, it's possible, but then again Bellatrix can just fire off a killing curse and slaughter a fox without knowing who or what it is. It may just be that if you hate everything enough it doesn't matter anymore and the killing curse will be effective in any case.

Alternatively, the power of the spell might just be imbued in the spell as soon as it is launched. I don't think we really have sufficient evidence either way.

I would like to think that your theory is right though.

*** I'm inclined to agree with this theory. In general, crimes of passion are more " forgivable" than the fanfics that show dark wizards feeling pleasure from hurting, killing or mind-controlling. There is something about rejoicing in others' suffering that is unforgivable.

** I've always thought it more that you had to truly desire to rip somebody's life from them. I feel like the idea of hate and anger may contribute to it. I remember Harry Potter and the Boy who lived by the Santi had the dark arts being spells that you had to truly desire something, ie he had tried casting the trauma curse and failed because he wasn't thinking about someone/something he truly wanted to feel real terror.
