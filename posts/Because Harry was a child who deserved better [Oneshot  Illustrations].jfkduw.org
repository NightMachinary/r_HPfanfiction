*Title:* Ever After ([[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637005818780188683/767809308276031508/image1.png][Cover Art]])

*Summary:* This Cinders girl is just like you!" Dudley snickers as he watches the television. "Dressed in rags, does all the chores, always dirty, and no one wants her. Even her parents are dead!" Later, when Harry lies in bed and stares up at the dusty cobwebs on the cupboard ceiling, he can't help but wonder wearily: "If I'm Cinders, does that mean one day someone will come to save me too?" Oneshot. HHr.

*What to expect:* Hurt/Comfort, Childhood Trauma, Healing, Friendship, Family, Mentions of canonical abuse from the Dursleys.

Thanks, once again, to [[https://www.reddit.com/u/arishatistic/][u/arishatistic]] for bringing this fic to life in a way I could never have done alone, with her amazing illustrations (which, if you're reading on FFN, you can find on [[https://www.instagram.com/arishatistic/?hl=en][instagram]] or [[https://arishatistic.tumblr.com/][tumblr]]).

**** I feel like the happy ending could also be taken as a sad one, like it was all in his imagination as he sat in the cupboard, especially since there was mention of pretending that his life was a fairy tale.

Maybe I'm just too cynical.

***** Nah, don't worry. I could never write something so sad. You'll notice that after they don the costumes, there are two scenes in italics where past tense is used whereas the rest of the story is all in present tense. Those two scenes are flashbacks.

But what you think is something that Harry often thinks as well. There will probably be days in the future...even when he's old and his hair is grey and he is no longer a child, when he wakes up in a cold sweat and is certain that he's back in that cupboard. That everything was really a dream that he made up to console himself.

Then he'll look to right and see Hermione lying next to him, fast asleep. Slowly his heart will stop racing and he'll think in wonder: "This is my reality."

** I got really emotional! Usually I'm not a Harmony shipper because people overlook the friendship aspect of their relationship and opt to only focus on the romantic sexual sides which really diminishes the power and magic of their bond in my opinion. However, your story was very balanced in that regard. It showed the strength of their friendship and also the potential to become more just because of how close they are platonically. I also enjoyed the bit of role reversal going on because I'm sick of reading stories were only Harry is doing the wooing or is extra stoic/suave in the relationship. I would imagine that by leading a war and killing a basilisk he might want to be more vulnerable and open in a relationship letting the other person have more initiative due to always having to lead and be strong in real life. So it was nice seeing Hermione take on that role while still showcasing her deeply emotional and empathetic side really trying to soothe Harry's soul! I loved this so much especially when Hermione said that she would cry for the both of them. Fantastic story can't wait to read more of your work!

*** The whole reason I ship Harmony is because of their incredible bond and friendship. Their relationship is stronger, not weaker, for the foundation of trust and and respect between them and not enough fics capitalize on that. Friendship and love can complement each other and co-exist so I'm glad you thought I did that well. ❤

Hermione truly is always saving Harry in canon and is also the type to take initiative since Harry is quite emotionally stunted from his upbringing. So the role reversal was fun to write 😂

Thanks for the thoughtful comment and I hope you enjoy my other works if you do decide to read them. ❤
