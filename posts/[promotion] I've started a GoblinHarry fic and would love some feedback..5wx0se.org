** I think you shouldn't mention "Red Death" in the summary as if it's some known canon element.

*** Okay, I can definitely try to add more background information.

When you say this tends to be more like Harry Crow, could you expand on that. You said Harry Crow was boring, so did you think this was boring as well? If so, is that just because I don't include enough background information, or are there other contributing factors?

I'm not really sure what I could do about the pacing though. I can understand that it might be a bit off, since it takes longer to write than read, but I don't want it to feel like I'm waffling just to increase the word count.

Thanks for your help, and for reminding me about "Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone". I seem to remember liking it, so I might have a re-read for some inspiration.

***** Okay, thanks. I can see what you mean now. Harry will probably come to care about humans and human stuff a bit more as the story progresses, but I don't know how much yet.

I'll bear the OPness thing in mind, but there will definitely be some setbacks.

Thanks again for your help! :)

#+begin_quote
  Having been adopted by the goblins, Harry Potter is not keen on going to Hogwarts. But when a Gringotts vault is broken into, the council decides he must. For tensions are running high and the goblins want to see the culprit caught and punished. Will it turn out to be the Red Death behind it, or is there more going on here than anyone realises?

** The summary seems a little disjointed and the wording is a /little/ iffy I think. I'd remove the mention of the Red Death in there, since it's in the title, and isn't a canon thing.

Don't mention him having a brother, I honestly wouldn't say anything at all about Red Death, leave that for within the story.
