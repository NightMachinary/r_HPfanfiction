For example, the Insane Asylum Escapees is about a version of Harry who thinks that Hogwarts is an insane asylum. He keeps inventing different reasons to explain “magic” ranging from holograms to really good fertilizer. It's funny for awhile till you realize that his explanations for magic are really stupid.

He accidentally makes a flower sprout on top of Dumbledore's head and concludes that Dumbledore must have some really good fertilizer on his head.

He thinks ghosts are holograms of all things which really sounds stupid as those don't exist. I didn't finish the fic but I'm assuming his explanations get stupider.

It seems like it would be a funny one shot but it lasted for far too long.

I'm curious to see if anyone else has been annoyed by fics like this.

I think it had a really nice twist, and a fairly decent premise. It was just hampered by its length and superfluous scenes. That wouldn't be the case if it was a one-shot.
