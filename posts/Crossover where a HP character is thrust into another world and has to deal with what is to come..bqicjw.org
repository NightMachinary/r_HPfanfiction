Basically what's in the title though I would prefer them to stay as a wizard/witch. Letting them suddenly be a elf, dwarf or whatever is kind of weird and turns me off, if not done well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/Gods-Among-Us][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), is really good. Harry and Hermione both work as curse breakers after the war, and they discovered an ancient spaceship. They first meet people on Battlestar Triton, and eventually uncover the secrets of Star Gate: Atlantis. I especially like the fact that Harry and Hermione make a huge difference in both these new worlds.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086), has Harry living in Middle Earth for 10 years before the last War of Ring broke out. He alters the course of war rather drastically and gets together with Eowyn.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), Ginny also falls through the Veil and meets Sirius in Essos. I like this fic a lot because it shows HP Magic in its full glory as Ginny and Sirius carved out their empire in Essos within a few years. The story slows down for a while as the author is shipping Ginny with Rhaegar Targaryen, but it has picked up steam again. The author has indicated a major, unspecified, new threat in which Rhaegar can make some meaningful contributions too.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
