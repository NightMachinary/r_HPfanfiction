So, hello there.

I think the story I'm writing has some potential, but I don't want to mess it up with my constant tangents, weird ideas and writing style, so I really an outsider to take a look at it, but I have no experience with betas and I don't know what to look for.

So I am turning to Reddit! Yay!

Anyway, I need a critical eye (Or two, or two, or none... I don't discriminate based on number of eyes and I don't promote favouritism toward cyclopes, although if you are, that's awesome.) or at least advice on how to find one.

Thank you in advance.

By the way, this is my profile on FFN: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7445005/]]


** I was about to offer the brilliance known as me, but it appears that someone else has asked long before me. Woe is me, and all that.

*** I haven't had any further connection established with our esteemed Hufflepuff DobbyShouldHaveLived up there (also I have absolutely now idea what the hell I'm doing - betas and all that), so the position may still be open. In any case, I would appreciate any critical opinion (I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing way too often, I guess).

**** Hello again! Apologies for not responding last night, I got hooked on an old favourite and have been reading it non stop. I have no experience with betas but know that some people have multiple betas for different things. I loved the premise of your fic but agree that you do need a little help with some of the English, where it doesn't flow as well as it could. I'd be happy to help and could pm you my email as that might be easier to help on?
