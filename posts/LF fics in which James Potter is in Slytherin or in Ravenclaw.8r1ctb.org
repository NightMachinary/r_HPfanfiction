** I don't know any stories like this but it could be really interesting.

James and Sirius meet on the train and become fast friends. When discussing which house they want to be in Sirius is of course adamant about not being in Slytherin, James feels the same way. The sorting happens and Sirius is sent to Slytherin. James sees just how distraught his new friend is and uses all the courage he can mister to also get put into Slytherin. Profound implications for the rest of the series abound.
