I think it's kinda a waste that in canon and the majority of fics, the other two members of the trio never interact with Voldemort at all. They don't have to win the fight, I just want to see them have some type of interaction with Voldemort.


** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has this massive battle in Diagon Alley with Voldemort, his Death Eaters and a bunch of kidnapped muggle children hostages on one side, and Sirius with the Order, the Twins, Ron with his gadgets from Dumbledore, Harry with the Elder Wand and Hermione with her guerilla army on the other. The Minister with her aurors arrives a bit late. It's a completely chaotic battle and one of my favorite scenes from all of fanfiction.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Many Thanks linkffn(4692717)\\
Time traveling Hermione defeats Voldemort.

Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion linkffn(5483280)\\
Ron defeats Voldemort. Ron is polyjuiced to look like Harry at the time. Fate is rather embarrassed she didn't notice this and made the prophesy about Harry instead of Ron.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Hermione beats Voldemort from a distance at the end of the Arithmancer series. The plot is merely passable IMO, but the selling point of the series is the world building, which is quite good.
