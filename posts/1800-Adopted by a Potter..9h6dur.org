Looking for fics where Harry adopts a child while he's still at Hogwarts, more the likely they are witches or wizards.

Been reading a fic where harry is sent to an orphanage after being attacked by Dursleys and thought one of the kids would end up being muggleborn and he'd take them in as their dad or older brother.

Are there any fics like this? Or any fics where he adopts a kid for whatever reason???


** (Offtopic) Dang it... I thought you were saying 800 rent a hero was adopted by someone...

***** *Oni*

Oni (鬼) are a kind of yōkai, supernatural ogre, or troll in Japanese folklore. They are typically portrayed as hulking figures with one or more horns growing out of their heads. Stereotypically, they are conceived of as red or blue-colored (green-colored), wearing loincloths of tiger pelt, and carrying iron clubs.

They are popular characters in Japanese art, literature, and theatre, and appear as stock villains in the well-known fairytales of Momotaro (Peach Boy), Issun-bōshi, and Kobutori Jīsan.

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.

** Harry adopts a witch he gets acquainted with during his "8th" in Hogwart. He doesn't adopts her immediately but a bit later when the girl's family (grandparents) gets unable to take care of her anymore. Bit of an old canon post DH fic and the adoption wasn't the main theme of the story. Part of an ongoing (if really slow updates) series.
