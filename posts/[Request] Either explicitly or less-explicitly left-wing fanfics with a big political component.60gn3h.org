** Left wing compared to what and on what issues? Even ignoring social issues, where they are clearly quite conservative, the British wizarding world has a single privatized bank with money based on the gold.standard, a school which has no real government oversight outside of running exams and Umbridge, no mentioned unions, workers rights laws, social security equivalents, or environmental protection laws. It doesn't take much to be radically liberal compared to the wizarding world. I mean, for example, governments around the world have set aside political differences to spread the smallpox vaccine far and wide to their citizens, but the Ministry can't or won't do the same for the much more localized need for Wolfsbane.

******* I think what's being referenced is simply the personality changes as the werewolf approaches the full moon. I doubt anyone could pick out a werewolf from a crowd during a new moon. Once the werewolf has his condition revealed, the co-workers might be offended that they weren't warned of his condition ahead of time, but the werewolf wouldn't say anything because he'd lose his chance at the job if he came clean ahead of time.

The whole thing is an allegory for the social situation and privacy issues for the AIDS-infected as seen during the 80's and 90's. Misinformation was prevalent and powerful, and for most employers, no amount of apologizing would permit an AIDS sufferer to keep his job once the condition was revealed, even if he/she had no contact with co-workers or customers.

** I have yet to read a fanfic (except Starfox5) that has the Winner seriously confiscating assets from Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers.

Harry had to be incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, might as well get organized, demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. Since they formed pretty much the only viable military force after the Battle, they would most likely get what they wanted.

With the control of the legislature (Wizengamot), it would be easy to pass laws to SEVERELY punish atrocities committed under Voldemort's regime. For example:

- Torture victims could get like 1000 Galleons for every second of Crucio, on top of criminal punishment for their perpetrators. Murder victims would get more.
- The Longbottoms would perhaps get half of Lestrange and a significant portion of Crouch assets.
- The Malfoys would pay maybe at least 100k Galleons for each Basilisk victim in Year 2 and at least 200k to Ginny.
- For those who WILLINGLY tortured their fellow students in Year 7, they would pay at least 1000 Galleons per second of Crucio plus life in Azkaban.
- Any Ministry officials who willingly assisted the Muggleborn genocide would simply have ALL their assets seized, plus potential prison terms.

Money seized would go to victims and some sort of a Reconstruction and Economic Stimulus fund. The new administration should use resources seized from their enemies to both establish favor with the general population and push through their own agenda. I see a Win-Win situation here.

*** This wouldn't work. You'd have a similar situation as Germany after WW1, and more likely than not only add fuel to pureblood supremacist propaganda. There would be extreme backlash. Take the Lestranges. What if the two brothers are only a cadet line and the majority of the family opposed Voldemort? Should innocents suffer for the sins of others?

Say there's a kid whose father was a death eater, all their inheritance is confiscated and they are left with nothing. Are they going to support the new Ministry? Fuck no, they're going to rise up and rebel. You say the money would be used for social programs and whatnot, but what of those who were better off without them?

Then there are the people in the ministry. How can you decide if someone was willingly supporting the persecution? Even with veritaserum, all you would have to say is, "I was doing what was best for my family." Does that mean you were protecting them from being brutally murdered or your family would do better in a pureblood dominated society? Do those guilty of treason have the right to not self-incriminate? What about the imperius curse? Is Thickenesse, as head of state, guilty even though Yaxley had him under it?

While yes, I do support severely punishing the Death Eaters and assisting victims, what you wrote is extremely radical. I think there would be those who would consider this similar to Voldemort's policies. Although instead of being murdered you are financially and socially ruined. Personally, I think Harry would be among those who would feel that way. His thoughts about and experiences with the Durselys and Malfoys show that. Your ideas would certainly be proposed, of that I have no doubt, but I highly doubt they would be allowed to be implemented.

**** They tried go easy on the bad guys after the First War ended, and see where that got them.

Those murdering and torturing psychopaths had their chances, and they used them to torture and murder more.

This time, the public would be UTTERLY merciless. "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!" never rang more true here.

Those incorrigible monsters should at least be destroyed economically and politically. Magical Britain couldn't have peace and prosperity if the ideology of Blood Purity was not defeated once and for all. A very clear message should be sent that committing tortures, murders, and genocides carried a VERY VERY STIFF penalty.

As for children of those criminals, they should be FULLY EXPOSED to the monstrous crimes their parents or relatives had committed. They should be constantly reminded that what their relatives stood for were heinous atrocities, and that the society was MERCIFUL in just going after their money.

Alienating moderates is a great way for a cause to collapse, and that is exactly what you propose.

******* I definitely think fines and confiscating fortunes would be appropriate.

I think that what other people are reacting to is that actually trying significant portions of the population and this redistribution of wealth is radical and might create a backlash that's hard for the good guys to ride out. That's one reason so often countries move to reconciliation committees, instead of having enough trials.
