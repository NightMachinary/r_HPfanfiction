I just finished reading the amazing [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/][Renaissance by Slide]] and I realised I love the “finding our way back to each other” trope

Can anyone recommend any good breaking up then making up fics? For Ron and Hermione? Thank you in advance :)


** I am sad to report that I can't recommend anything better than Renaissance (I loved that story). But I can recommend a couple of oneshots that are well-written and fit that theme.

EDIT: Either the bot's not working or it's been too long and I've just forgotten how to use it. Anyway, here are my two oneshot reccs:

I'm on the sequel now - Begin Again. It's M but doesn't get too spicy. I enjoyed it.
