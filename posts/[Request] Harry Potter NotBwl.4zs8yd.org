  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  "'So, Neville Longbottom has come to Hogwarts. I'm Malfoy. And this is Potter, Crabbe, and Goyle.' Malfoy sounded a bit like a shopkeeper with a sales pitch. A boy with red hair, who'd been standing behind Longbottom, snorted at Malfoy's introductions.'Think my name is funny, do you? No need to guess yours. Red hair, ratty clothes, you must be a Weasley. You wouldn't want to go making friends with his sort, Longbottom. I can help you there.' Malfoy stuck his hand out.Longbottom, who seemed very nervous, took a big breath, and, as though puffing his chest out would make him seem more intimidating, tried sneering at Malfoy's hand. 'I have my own ideas about who I should be making friends with, Malfoy.'Harry wondered what exactly everyone was so impressed with. Longbottom was rather pathetic, really. And more than a little rude. "Harry Potter, a normal half-blood, living with his abusive muggle relatives, has, without Dumbledore's influences, no positive experiences with muggles. Upon learning he's a wizard, he runs away and makes his own way to school. And oh, what a thirst to prove himself.

  Major AU! SLASH LV/HP: Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions.

#+begin_quote
  A series of one-shots set in a universe where Vader turned double agent for the Rebellion about three years after ROTS, and Leia is now his primary contact with the Rebellion. New: The Unstolen Child. Every Force sensitive child is registered with the Imperial Inquisition, eventually to be taken and trained. Ahsoka isn't going to let that happen. And she has some unexpected help.
