So I've just read this fic and I found myself surprised at liking the sex scenes, normally I would just skim through them as they are utterly ridiculous always making Harry some kind of sex god. Here though, while he showed that he was no virgin it was also clear that he wasn't a god, and in fact acted like most teenagers would.

I liked the Ginny scene, but the scene with Lavender was much more realistic and made me keep reading the fic hoping for more, sadly I was disappointed.

Do you know of other fics where the sex is actually believable?


** I didn't know there was such a thing as a believable lemon.

** Author HoosYourDaddy does a fair job in linkffn(A Boy and His Cloak by HoosYourDaddy).

I'd recommend my stuff but with the caveats that\\
1. only the most recent might be considered 'realistic' and\\
2. I'm not the proper judge of that due to personal bias.
