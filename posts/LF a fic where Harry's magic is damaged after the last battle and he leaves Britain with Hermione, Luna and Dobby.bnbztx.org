The only scene I remember is the last one where the four of them are living in a tent and are planning to visit a historical site. A food fight breaks out. It's a sweet ending.

  Ron leaving them stranded on the hunt for the horcruxes wakes Harry and Hermione up to the fact that they cannot continue on as they have. They will have to think things through and not trust to luck or a destiny that may or may not turn out in their favour.
