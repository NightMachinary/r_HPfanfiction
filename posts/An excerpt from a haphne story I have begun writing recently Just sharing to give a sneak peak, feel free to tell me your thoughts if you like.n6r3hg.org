** only thing is that its should be it's, parselmouth should be Parselmouth, and it should be plural

Ex: Except with the Chamber, it's accessed by Parselmouths, which to all available knowledge...

â€‹

ALSO, whenever you see 'chamber of secrets,' it should be 'Chamber of Secrets' (capitalization)

I did not, however, realize that parselmouth was actually supposed to be a plural word, so ty for that

*** Yeah I'm on the new haphne discord, and will be promoting it when am ready to start posting chapters.

And yeah, Harry's parents were death eaters, but I have the story planned out that there will be some twists, turns and misdirection when it comes to his parents being death eaters. Were they death eaters because they were lured into the blood supremacy belief? Did they mutiny against voldemort from a change of heart or did they mutiny because they wanted to take control of the death eaters? Were Harry's parents truelly death eaters, or were they a spy pair from the order of the Phoenix, recruited while at Hogwarts, and it was their job to infiltrate the death eaters? Harry has no idea, he only knows that everyone hates him for it. I have some cool, in story reveals planned

Once I have a few chapters done I'll be sending them off to my beta who is a professional writer himself (he also knows Jim butcher personally so fuck ya there lol).

This is my first ever attempt at creative writing, so I just hope I can write the story that I have in my head well enough to do it justice.
