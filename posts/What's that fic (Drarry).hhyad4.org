Solved!!! It's Foundations by Sara's Girl

Hi y'all,

I have scoured the internet for this fic! Harry is a healer, ends up taking home a kid when his mom is sick, co-parents with Draco (their relationship is new and developing). The mom has a mystery curse that is making her age.

One thing that distinguishes it is that the cupboards in Grimmauld place talk to Harry.

I've looked everywhere. Did it disappear? Has anyone read it?

*** Oh man, you're right about the cupboards being in Reparations. I think the kid fic might be separate? I don't remember there being a kid in Reparations
