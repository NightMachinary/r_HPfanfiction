The Well Groomed Mind by Lady_Khali

Best Barty Crouch Jr ever, truly interesting Voldemort, and some truly brain-bending moral dilemmas. Harry isn't in Slytherin, but he should have been.

Sarcasm and Slytherin series by Sunandmoonandstars

Not much is explicitly stated in the first couple books, and it's WBWL, but then there's a beautiful moment where Hermione Granger yells a line of Death Eater propaganda at fake Moody. By the time you find out that you were learning about what the DE's and Voldie think, you're already halfway indoctrinated.

Neither are drarry, sorry. I too lament the fact that it seems impossible to find any that isn't horribly trite or excessively ooc.
