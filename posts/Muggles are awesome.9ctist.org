I want a fic where muggles are awesome. Maybe they figure out how to replicate or suppress magic with technology. Maybe like in the the Bartimaeus trilogy muggles exposed to areas of magic eventually develop resistance to magic. Maybe muggles just have cool toys like the internet and robots. I don't care what the particular bit of awesome is. I just feel like I've never read a fic that lets muggles and/or the muggle world be cool too. So, please, give me whatever you've got.


** Just read HPMOR /s.

** Harry Potter and the Natural twenty linkffn(8096183) has snippets of some muggle police officers overcoming obliviations, piecing together /some/ puzzles and eventually laying an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8qnDvGtOA][ungodly ass whooping]] on some bad wizards. These parts of the fic are actually some of my favourite.

** I don't think muggles can be "magic resistant" unless they have magic themselves.Like how trolls and giants are magic resistant and stuff like that.

I too would like to have an ability to avoid terrible cliches by a sheer coincidence.
