Just as it says; I'm looking for stories where Aurors look for all kind of bad guys, not just Death Eaters.

I'd like some really intense cases. Some kind of action in there, maybe some world building or building more on the concept of magic as a whole. (Not too picky, just make it believable).

Bad guys who are into human trafficking, bad guys who sell a potion that something like a drug?

Bad guys who hold people hostages.

Et cetra.

Can be with Harry and Ron, or could be centered on Nymphadora Tonks, or Alastor Moody, or whomever; it doesn't matter.

Can be canon complaint or be AU.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

I don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as pairings, but anything else goes.

No super Powerful Harry (Harry smarter or more powerful than he is than canon is fine, but if it's centered on Harry; make it believable).

No Harem Harry

No Weasley Bashing

Would rather the story be completed, but if it has a lot of chapters that's fine as well.

It can focus on characters outside of Harry and Ron, they don't have to be the main characters in the story,.


** I would highly suggest The Aurors (and it's currently in process sequel Hollow Ash) by FloreatCastellum linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors]])

It might not be as action oriented as you'd like, but it reads like a detective story. The sequel, in my opinion, is shaping up to be even better. Good old fashion detective work and an interesting premise. It does have an OC, but they're not distracting.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]])

If you haven't read it, feel like it's on here a lot but one of my faves. AU after 5, slow burn for sure but that's what makes all Harry's powers believable, author really takes the time to develop them and build the magic around them. Two sequels, last one is incomplete but worth the read nonetheless.

Been a while, but the auror dept definitely fights kidnappers and smugglers and organized crime (a lot of it doesn't quite get started til the sequels though IIRC). They fight death eaters too, but not in the way you'd think (since AU), so a lot of that is mixed together (can't really elaborate without spoilers).

It's obvi not solely about that, but it has the best auror Harry I've read and an amazing amount of character development, so gotta be a little patient to get to those parts. His friends at the Auror dept are some of the best OCs I've read too.

** You might like to search through Northumbrian's stories on FF.net. It might be daunting to navigate through his stories coz he has built a whole new world based on the 7 HP books (prior to JKR's additional changes on Pottermore and Cursed Child). In his world, many of Harry's peers became Aurors in order to help catch the remaining Death Eaters before moving on to other careers. Harry eventually moved up through the department making changes here and there. Some of the stories deal with the "revamped" Auror Squad Harry got to fully build when he finally became the Head of the Aurors.

The author's bio of what the sequence of the stories should be might help you. The ones with MLT or MIT on their title (Muggle Liaison Team or Muggle Interface Team) are the ones talking about a special team created within the Aurors.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the conspiracy of blood by cambangst) has exactly what you are looking for. The plot is slow in the first 12-13 chapters but it really picks up pace after that. I would highly recommend this one.

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Auror trainee Tonks gets her first missions: Investigating Lucius Malfoy's search for Sirius Black, Azkaban escapee and kidnapper of Harry Potter. And hunting down Fenrir Greyback, werewolf terrorist. Remus Lupin is working in the search effort to rescue the son of his friend, but he's also a double agent working against Greyback.

The story is partially told from the perspective of Sirius and Harry on the run, and partially from the perspective of Tonks and Lupin hunting them.
