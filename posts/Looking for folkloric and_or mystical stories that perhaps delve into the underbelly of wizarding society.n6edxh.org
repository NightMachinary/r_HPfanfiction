Finished reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583][Unfogging the Future]] by Naidhe and I'm gutted it wasn't longer! I love a good time travel fic so that was a bonus, but what really captivated me was the exploration into divination along with daily life in Knockturn Alley. For some reason it reminded me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] and I think it's the whole world building of a more marginal wizarding world, slightly more on the edges but still so rich with unexplored/ignored/hidden magic. I would love if people had recommendations of stories along these lines, bonus points if the MC is a super minor character. I would really prefer no Harry unless he's essentially a whole different person like in Fantastic Elves.

A deep dive into alternative magic like in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899/chapters/26618625][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]] would also be great!

Edit/PS: I would highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13260163/1/Styx][Styx]] for the same darkish vibe I loved in Unfogging the Future and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13114764/1/Wandmaking][Wandmaking]] for a downright chilling premise. I wish we had more longer stories with these styles/themes!!


** There aren't near enough of this kind of fic, imo, I love unfogging the future so much and I'm so glad you like it too, because I never see people talking about it!

There is The Damned that's still ongoing linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16213826/chapters/37896203]])

The Ever Upward series is similar to fantastic elves and has an elf revolution in it

I'm writing one about squibs and weres and stuff living in the shadows of the wix, but it is still a while off from being ready to post

Have you read naidhe's coven? That's also awesome and has some really great magic stuff in it as well as really amazing characterisation

*** I resisted Unfogging the Future to my detriment because I was put off by Lavender. Silly me! Now I want 100k+ words with her and her adventures! ðŸ˜­

I'll check out The Damned tonight and the other Naidhe's you've recommended :) Thank you!

Hope you get to share your story with us soon.

  An accident with the Resurrection Stone has far-reaching consequences. In which the remnants of the war, the cursed and the damned, band together in some attempt to salvage what they can from the disappointment that is the Wizarding World post-war.
