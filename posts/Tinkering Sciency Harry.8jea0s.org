So, you know that feeling you get when you end up lost in the DIY deep-end of youtube ? Like watching “How I made my own Iphone - In China”, that kind of stuff.

Gimme please.

I'm talking tinkering, experimenting, DIYing Harry (or other MC, maybe something with the twins), where you get to follow through the trials and error and see him creating or experimenting with cool stuff like new spells, potions, enchantments, etc.

In most fics with sciency Harry it goes like this:

-“Harry this is impossible to make/has never been made”\\
/MONTAGE/\\
-”Wow this is really a cool special thing and it was very hard to do and U are very powerful, marry me!”

I'd like a fic where you actually get to see the good stuff, it has to be a main part of the hook of the fanfic and not just one part of one chapter.

Thanks for your recs


** linkffn(The Tinkerer) is like this, I found it recently but unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a year and is only at the start of first year. It's quite good though.

Otherwise linkffn(The Mind Arts) is great and I think it fits.

*** Thanks, yep, The Minds Arts has a bit of that with his room and all that. I would like to see it cranked up to eleven, but that's not really the main hook of this fic and it is already great at what it does so that's cool.

I think I stumbled upon the Tinkerer a few month ago but I kind of noped out when he just casually revolutionized the computer industry and became rich and pals with Bill Gates in the first chapter. Now that's just silly. I'm going to give it another go for at least a few chapters of when he gets to Hogwarts tho.

I'd really like to see something not completelly OP where we get to see an iventor stumble and work their way through building something cool... but the Wish Fullfilment/Power Wank is strong with this one.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** It has a pretty powerful Harry, but I found it very enjoyable. It has an SG1 sequel, and a Mass Effect sequel. He's very scientific, and it focuses on that aspect a lot more in the sequels, but again very enjoyable. He's pretty apathetic to everyone, and isn't put off experimenting on even himself.

*** Thanks, I'm not sure if i'm into the whole madScientist! Harry thing, I remember having noped out of a story where he transfigures himself and do weird stuff like that. Still, I'm gonna give it a go, it kinda looks fun.

**** Trust me it's worth it. He is a mad scientist, but not in a brooding, angsty way, more like...well it's hard to describe, but it's very fun. I know the transfiguration story you're thinking of(I think), and I didn't like it because of how slow it was, and how difficult it was to follow along because of how angsty it was. In The Mind Of a Scientist is enjoyable, because it's fun to read, and I believe that's what a lot of stories suffer from. You can have the best story in the world, but if it's not fun to the reader it fails.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** There is always Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB. He tinkers around and invents things in that series quite a bit. Also a nice, light hearted read.

Thanks, I've seen this one around quite a bit but everytime I get distracted by something more shiny. I think it's time I give it a go and see what the cool kids are talking about :D.
