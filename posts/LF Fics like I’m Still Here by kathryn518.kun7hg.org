I'm most of the way through the fic and I really enjoy the dynamic. A strong Harry with some anonymity. Draco working with Harry and a friendship of sorts forming which I don't see too often in the fics I find. The dimensional travel isn't too much of import, but it does set the reasoning for the moving plot and the abilities of Harry, taking into account the changes which happen to also limit him so he isn't an omnipotent god over the world.


** There's From Ruin by GraeFoxx, which is basically the exact same concept with the 'edginess meter turned up to eleven'.

Also, if you do a subsearch (if you're unaware of how to do that - go to the reddit search bar, type 'fics like I'm still here' and click the tickbox to limit to this sub) you'll find this request has been made very often and most of the similar fics out there are in those threads.

There did seem to be more on Page two, but the three main threads I found on Page one were:

** There is linkffn(from ruin by graefoxx) its badly written in my opinion and is not even close to I'm still here in terms of quality and characterization

This isn't exactly similar but it's very well written but like I'm still here this also hasn't been updated in a while

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

*** I think you want Linkffn(I'm Back by FreedomOfThinking) which states in the summary - ain't read it, but mean to - that it's based on Kathryn518's work. As several fics are, what with their 'every couple of years, and probably not the story you wanted more of' update policy.

  "I could make a life for myself, carve my own path and live happily... but that snake faced bastard is still out there somewhere, and I won't rest until he's dead. And if I fail? Well, what's another body among foundations?" (Inspired by Kathryn518's I'm still here) (Time Travel, Family Magic, AU)
