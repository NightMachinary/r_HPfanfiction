I.e., he does something more than Movie Night a la Pensieve.

Please no DE-apologism or slash.

  Canon Divergence AU Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
