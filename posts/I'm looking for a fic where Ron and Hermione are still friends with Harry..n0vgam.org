90% of fanfics Ron is a stupid idiot and Hermione an annoying bossy know-it-all and Harry is the only mature and responsible one. And I got tired of it!

​

I want to read a fic where the THREE prepare for war, their friendship only grows over time.

​

A fic where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are relentless and are not afraid to fight, where they really want to do something and do something!

​

Thanks in advance! (I'm tired of fanfic with the unnecessary bashing of characters)

​

Note: I prefer long fics!


** Trio centric fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]: 4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from a different dimension is asking for help. The Trio and Ginny enter breach one more time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: Canon divergent after Year 4. Guerrilla Hermione kills rank and file Death Eaters, while Dumbledore manipulates the Ministry and prepares Harry for his direct confrontation with Voldemort. Dark war epic, some romance, but it's not the focus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]: This is pretty much the only fic that has Trio in a romantic relationship and a good Plot. But the focus of this story is the fight against zombie battleship Bismarck, with the help of HMS Hood. [[https://youtu.be/4_jDaUSSPhc][This video]] offers some good details on their first battle in 1941.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: No magic sci-fi AU? No problem because it's a darn awesome story with an awesome Trio. Everyone is a lot more dangerous than in canon, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lflrst/lf_ruthlessly_efficient_hermione/gmn8ph0/][especially Hermione]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] has a 'Harry' who thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but only wants to teach DADA forever. He sees Hermione as his successor and Ron as his worthy minion. It's the most popular fic on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: It's canon compliant until the end of DH, but Harry and his friends eventually declare war on Wizarding Britain's incorrigible establishment. Good guys could only be pushed so far. Trio interactions are beautifully written in this fic, and George, Neville, Susan, and Fleur all get to shine.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]]: The Trio and a 5 day old Rose are thrown back to August 31 1991 by a powerful artifact. They decide to defeat Voldemort in a speed run like fashion.

*** In Seventh horcrux he has all voldermorts memories emotions experience and thought patterns regardless of what body hes in thats what makes a person so he doesn't think he's voldermort he is Though I guess the best way to frame it would be split personality disorder with the other personality taking over the body ;)

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis]] Golden trio starts the DA in their first year instead of their fifth. They manage to escape the teacher's notice as they gather allies in all of houses. With all of the help from a large study group and defense club they are much more prepared for the war vs. Voldemort.

  If blindness wasn't enough for Ariadne Granger to deal with upon attending Hogwarts, being the transgender Girl Who Lived didn't help matters.Blind trans girl Harry Potter fic to spite JK Rowling's TERF ass. Starts before Ariadne has even figured out she's a girl and before she is rescued from the Dursleys.Since this fic is gonna be quite long, I'm adding a key here. Note, some things might lack context if you skip.Chapters 1-6: Pre-Philosopher's Stone.Chapters 7-33: Philosopher's Stone. Minimal plot divergence.Chapters 34-75: Chamber of Secrets. Moderate plot divergence.Chapters 76-109: Prisoner of Azkaban. Major plot divergence.Chapters 110-148: Goblet of Fire. Major plot divergence.Chapters 149-192: Order of the Phoenix. Plot-adjacent - Same sorta things happen, but in a different way.Chapters 193-Current: Half Blood Prince.

*** Wrong. He read too many "Harry the hero" stories, where Ron AND Hermione - as the OP mentioned - are bashed. Usually, those are Indy!Harry or "Harry with better friends" stories, often overlapping with "Lord Harry Pureblood culture fuck yeah!" stories.

In the Harmony stories you mean, Hermione usually is the perfect obedient girlfriend who would rather get kidnapped so Harry can save her than dare to contradict him.
