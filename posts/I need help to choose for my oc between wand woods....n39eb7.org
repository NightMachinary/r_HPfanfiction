Basically, I am writing a mix of Voldemort for backstory and Grindelwald for charisma and relationship with the main character of the story.

​

Bronte, which means lightning in Greek, is sorted into Slytherin, but remains basically a morally light character. She is mostly lost in her ways past a certain point and comes to conflict with both Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry Potter. It is a kind of fall from grace then a return into grace fic. Basically, she ends up opening her third side of the civil war in the magical world.

​

The thing is, I already have her wand core "Thunderbird Tailfeather" but I need y'alls opinion on which wand wood between those two:

​

** Aspen
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: aspen
   :END:
Wand-quality aspen wood is white and fine-grained, and highly prized by all wand-makers for its stylish resemblance to ivory and its usually outstanding charmwork. The proper owner of the aspen wand is often an accomplished duellist, or destined to be so, for the aspen wand is one of those particularly suited to martial magic. An infamous and secretive eighteenth-century duelling club, which called itself The Silver Spears, was reputed to admit only those who owned aspen wands. In my experience, aspen wand owners are generally strong-minded and determined, more likely than most to be attracted by quests and new orders; this is a wand for revolutionaries.

** Beech
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: beech
   :END:
The true match for a beech wand will be, if young, wise beyond his or her years, and if full-grown, rich in understanding and experience. Beech wands perform very weakly for the narrow-minded and intolerant. Such wizards and witches, having obtained a beech wand without having been suitably matched (yet coveting this most desirable, richly hued and highly prized wand wood), have often presented themselves at the homes of learned wandmakers such as myself, demanding to know the reason for their handsome wand's lack of power. When properly matched, the beech wand is capable of a subtlety and artistry rarely seen in any other wood, hence its lustrous reputation.

Please help !

​

Also, sorry if I did something wrong I'm having quite a lot of trouble with what is and isn't allowed in my currently unstable bipolar state.


** It depends on what your going for, is it resolve or strength?

If resolve it's Aspen. If strength it's Beech.

***** Here's the link... I'm not that satisfied with the summary, it was a friend who wrote it and I find it... Well, you'll see.
