I was looking for some fun AU stories to read where Harry was raised by Sirius. However, once I was a few chapters into one I'd picked, I realised it was one of those "/Dumbledore secretly took control of the Potter fortune and paid the Weasleys/"-type settings.

Now I can kind of see why these two concepts often go hand in hand -- Sirius's fate was arguably one of Dumbledore's greatest mistakes in canon and can easily be construed as nefarious plotting on the part of evil fanon Dumbledore to keep Harry from experiencing love, or whatever.

However, I would honestly really like to read a story where Sirius managed to gain guardianship of Harry somehow, and yet Dumbledore is presented the /same/ as in the canon series.

Please hit me with your best recommendation.

EDIT: There was a recent request that was very similar, however it included a bunch of clauses that I don't really care about; I would prefer a fic that doesn't focus on shipping but if it does, I won't be particularly mad.


** Have you read the stories that start with linkffn(9469064). They're well written and plotted, and the 4th year story is still updating.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
