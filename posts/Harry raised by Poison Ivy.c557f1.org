Stuff I remember

° Ivy's plants kill Snape when he comes with Dumbledore to give Harry his letter

° Batman believes Harry to be his son from when Ivy seduced him

° Batman travels to England and beats the Dursleys believing them to be Ivy's henchmen.


** I'm so glad you made this post cause I had forgotten how in love with Batman/HP I am.

** There's also linkffn(13003733) not the same fic but a pretty decent Ivy/Batman AU parents story. The author actually has some decent Marvel crossovers with AU parentage as well.

  Lily and James weren't Harry's parents. They were his aunt and uncle. Petunia decides she shouldn't have to raise her nephew when his mother is perfectly capable of doing it herself. She tracks down her wayward sister who enjoys attacking people with giant plants, and quickly washes her hands of the entire situation. Now, Gotham and Batman have a new young villain to deal with.
