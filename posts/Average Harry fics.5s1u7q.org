I'm looking for fics where Harry is an average wizard, just like in canon. I'm so tired of seeing fics where he is smarter than Hermione, more powerful than Dumbledore, and richer than the Malfoys and Blacks. There's also all the other stuff, like a magical core being blocked, him being a descendant of all the founders (and Merlin), and Harry suddenly being good at every school subject.

I would prefer the fics having canon pairings, and written after 2007. Also no Weasley or Dumbledore bashing.


** Harry isn't an average wizard in cannon, he's actually above average, he just doesn't apply himself. His OWL scores(and the fact that he could take on death eaters when he was 15) are testament to his intelligence/talent considering all the crap he went through that year:

- Umbridge detentions(Torture).
- Vilified/shunned by a lot of people in the wizarding world.
- Snape's 'occlumency' lessons that turned into another chance for Snape to screw with Harry.
- His connection to Voldemort which caused him to have mood swings, lack of sleep, head ache's, pain in his scar etc etc.
- PTSD from Cedric's murder.
- The fact that theres a war brewing and he is at the centre of it.

Yet he still managed to do relatively well in his owls.

There aren't many fics where Harry is an average wizard because it's fan fiction and no-one really wants to see an average protagonist. Usually authors change one thing pre-hogwarts and that sets off a butterfly effect which see's Harry apply himself ultimately leading to him reaching his potential.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is probably the best in terms of keeping Harry closest to his cannon counterpart in terms of magical potential.

*** Yeah, never understood why people thought canon Harry was average in power or magical ability. Although, in canon, it was never touched upon why Harry never attempted to further his magical knowledge of spells, or even take up Duelling, as he seemed to enjoy it whenever he did it (practised disarming on others in the second year, simply because he wanted to, and I believe that it was either Hermione or Sirius that gave him Curses and Countercurses, showing that most people know about his love of battle magic). I'm surprised he didn't get a wand of Ebony.

**** I have always been of the opinion that innate power is not actually a thing in Potter-Verse, and there is a lot of canonic evidence to support it, despite the fandoms apperantly need to nerf magic for logic reasons. I have always viewed magic as being done when you concentrate and hold a spell in your mind. Sure, doing it over and over could be mentally exhuasting, but no more so than taking the SATs. Harry is the Dark Lord's Equal, in that he has an almost ridiculously good intuitive sense of spells. He cast a Patronus repelling a hundred Dementors in his Third Year, was able to learn and master multiple spells for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and successfully cast two of the three Unforgivables. Magical knowledge and understanding of spells is what constitutes "power", so if Harry did start studying magic deeply similar to Voldemort, he could easily have gotten to his level. Obviously this all leads to silly tropes like Harry studying 48/7 with a time Turner, but it can and has been done well.

***** Wouldn't he being 13 and casting a spell that not even trained professionals could cast be enough to show that there is innate power in the Potter-verse? Or what about Snape casting curses even before his Hogwarts days, when it's practically confirmed that children cannot cast certain spells do to age difference (Moody in GOF and the fact that we never see 13 and 14 y/os cast Avada). I don't know about the intuitive sense of spells, he apparently studied night in day in order to master the Expelliarmus and Summoning charms, respectively.

****** Not if it has to do with understanding. After all, if it was a pure power requirement, he could not have taught it to numerous others in the D.A. who were also fairly young.

The Unforgivables actually support the theory. They are directly powered by the intent to torture, enslave, or murder. It can very easily be argued that a bunch of 14 year olds simply didn't have what it takes to understand the Avada in its entirety, and still have the intent to murder someone in cold blood. Tom Riddle did, and the emotional requirement can be chalked up to some form of mental illness on his part. I am not a psychologist, but I am pretty sure Riddle is just about a text-book sociopath.

Snape casting dark spells before Hogwarts because he was powerful makes less sense than him being able to cast them because he understood them. Although definitely an above average wizard, he has never been said to be on par with Voldemort. Voldemort himself would serve as a better example for your power argument, demonstrating controlled accidental magic, but that can be explained away as Riddle understanding that something was happening, and figuring out how to do it again.

Your last point, is hard to debate. Perhaps it was an example of Rowling being inconsistent. Perhaps something else. But I will point out that every charm that Harry took the time to buckle down and learn that way, he has mastered, with the notable exception of Occlumency, which is rather debatable in itself. And when I say mastered, I mean Harry is able to cast from his seemingly limited repotoire, almost perfectly every time, consistently above the average wizard. Stunners, Stupefy, Protego, Patronus, Impedimenta, Incarcerous etc. All those spells, Harry is pretty much Auror grade with, not just in power, but in quality and reliability.

******* I'm not saying that understanding a spell doesn't increase your ability to master it, but that isn't all there is. Lupin said multiple times that there were people who completely understood the mechanics, could do everything right, yet couldn't summon one. Not to mention the fact that it is said to show that a wizard has great power. The DA cast mere phantoms of what Harry cast, he stated himself that they were unlikely to hold of any Dementors in a real fight (disregarding The Battle Of Hogwarts, because that whole thing was a definite inconsistency).

I don't know, 14-year-olds can be pretty vicious, not all of them are the same. Moody/Barty was pretty confident that none of them could cast it. Another spell that possibly supports the power theory is Protego itself, it is said to be a minor shield in the grand scheme of things, and considering the fact that there is a nigh-infinite amount of spells in the magical world, why didn't Harry just learn a new shield spell? Instead, he was capable of blocking most high-level hexes and curses when he propped it up. Personally, I think it's another hole in Rowling's magic system (it's like swiss cheese darn it!) I like to chalk it up to the fact that she didn't create this book with magic in mind, sure she created spells with a lot of thought put into them, and a lot of background researching etc... But she never explained the more intricate details of magic. How it felt to cast a spell, for example. Or how about the fact that most transfiguration spells are way too specific? And instead, should be set into a couple categories with one incantation for each category (IE: Transfigurus, Conjurus etc...)

******** One could still blame them for not having the requisite emotional requirements and happy memory, but that topic is at the point of quibbling at semantics.

The issue I have with the fandom interpretations of the Unforgivables, is that they don't take it seriously, or ignore it for the sake of Edgelord McMurderface Harry. I would like to have a couple very pointed conversations with whoever thought that the Cruciatus was invented as a defibrillator. The Unforgivables are thus named because you have to have absolute intent. You can't cast them on accident, or even with righteous anger/vengeance as Harry finds out. You have to deliberately want someone to feel pain and suffer, deliberately want to enslave another human with full control over them, or deliberately want them to die, and to believe that they deserve to die. If we are to look at the muggle world, we can use school shooters as our odds of having children capable of murder. [[https://www.decodedscience.org/risks-school-shooting-versus-airplane-crash/40830]] this website takes a look at the odds, and estimates that there are .02 incidents of school shootings per 100,000 school hours. Also keep in mind that the population of Hogwarts is much lower than standerd schools, which also messes with the data. But it is possible.

You have an interesting point with the magic system. My personal opinion is that Protego is simply a good all around shield. Jack of all trades, master of none, and all that sort of thing. Whereas other shields would be more specialized towards the spells to be used with, and with potential drawbacks.

********* I'm not saying that you don't need emotion, but that's hardly all you need. Righteous anger/vengeance felt like a cop out, considering the fact that you could use a plethora of different 'states of happiness' for the Patronus. I feel like, once again, JKR was trying to make him more human, him having a weakness, in being unable to cast a spell that is considered one of the 'three great curses' (I think it's a pretty dumb concept just to have three spells lying around that have that much power with no drawbacks, such as extreme magical drain).

You really think I have a good point with the magic system? Because I had this other idea, where your imagination plays a great amount into how your charm is done. Think about how Harry managed to shield the people around the great hall from interfering in his battle with Voldemort, with a simple Protego. I think this happens because of how you want the charm to be done. That is why we get so many different interpretations of Incendio and Agumenti (creating localised fire/water, shooting a stream/jet of fire/water, even creating an arc of fire ala Dark Souls). Although the power of charms cannot be changed with imagination, only with how much power you put into it. That is why there are so many different uses of elements in combat without charms because it's a waste of magic when you have inherently powerful fire spells like FiendFyre. And that also plays into the whole "Jack of All trades" shield spell thing, it can be changed around for need, but it isn't the most powerful in any fields.

**** I actually think he knew a lot of spells but always kept it simple when duelling, I'm pretty sure Hermione pushed him to learn a fair few spells in 5th, 6th and 7th year. He would have also learnt a fair few during the quad-wizard tournament in 4th year. I think a big reason Dumbledore didn't give Harry personal training/instruction is because he didn't think Harry would survive. I really found it disappointing that we didn't get to see Dumbledore as proper mentor to Harry, it would have been amazing to see all the kinds of magic Dumbledore knew.

***** I agree with the top point, although I think it has a deeper meaning than simply "keeping simple". I think Rowling really disliked the fact that Harry could possibly not win on luck and chance, and instead outpower Voldemort. So she gave him an Achilles heel in the second book, just to make sure that he wouldn't get too far when it came to magical education. That Achilles heel was definitely the Disarming Charm. I agree with that last point, and I'm deeply saddened that we have yet to get a comprehensive Dumbledore mentor fic, although, it would admittedly require a huge amount of world-building talent. I think that the reason Dumbledore thought Harry was not going to survive is simple, he didn't trust that Harry would even with training. When Harry first appeared in his first and second year, he was very unlike Dumbledore, the happy-go-lucky, cast every spell on first try prodigy. He saw too much James, too much personal attachment, and he knew that that would kill Harry as it did James. That was his main reasoning for putting Harry with the Dursleys in the first place IMO, he wanted Harry to become like him, introverted, content, uncaring of what others think. When he either heard or understood that Harry pleaded with the sorting hat for a house change, simply because he wanted to honour the legacy of dead parents, Dumbledore knew that hope was lost in training Harry.

Maybe his faith was mildly restored when he heard Harry was capable of fighting off hundreds of Dementors, but he didn't see it happen first-hand, so he wouldn't know if it was an exaggeration or not, but once again, that magic just further shows that Harry had too much personal attachment to everything, that he was willing to die for his friends rather than win and have his friends die.

****** I am of the opposite opinion.

I think that Dumbledore didn't want to be a mentor to Harry because he didn't want to get attached to him knowing he would have to die because of the horcrux in his scar. He thought that if he got attached he would hesitate to do what needed to be done to defeat Voldemort. Dumbledore needed to look out for the good of the wizarding world and getting attached would have hindered him. Harry was nothing like James tbh, from everything we saw in terms of temperament he was like Lily, the only thing's he didn't get from her was her work ethic and social skills. Although I think if Harry had grown up with a more nurturing family he would have been far more like Lily but with James' confidence. The Dursleys really screwed him over in that regard.

******* I don't really know, I always thought that in what little of Harry we see, dialogue wise, he was James. In the Lily sense, you could say that that's where he got his skill in charms, but from most of the dialogue between Harry and Sirius in POA-OOTP, they seemed to be very similar in a lot of ways. To the point where Sirius would just follow as Harry led on (Department of Mysteries being the prime example). In his social skills, I definitely agree that he got James, as James always looked at the bright side no matter what, Lily instantaneously (from the looks of it) cut-out Severus as soon as he called her a mudblood. It seems that she didn't have the patience for touch and go with friends as Harry did (GOF, DH being the prime examples).

But Dumbledore is highly a coin toss, I'm sure there were ways to extract the Horcrux other than killing it (after all, if Nagini died of old age, would his soul forcibly eject from her or would it still be the remains of the snake? Could he transfer it to another vessel?) Of course, this is assuming (as JK Rowling did) that the Horcrux was fully created, but the 'nasty ritual' was circumvented somehow. But let's be honest for one second, why else would Dumbledore send Harry to the Dursley's? The story could have been just as good, if not better if it was a well-cared for Harry discovering that he was a wizard with a muggle family, or already being in-tuned with the wizarding world and just introducing us and learning his destiny. I'm sure that 'blood connection' wasn't the only reason Harry was put there. I feel that a protection like that is a bit overkill for just hiding Harry, an over-powered notice-me-not cast on him when Lily and James died could have achieved the same effect.

*** I don't see any evidence that Harry was above average in power or intelligence, most of his friends fought Death Eaters at 15 as well, and Ron got similar OWL scores. And if we don't count his OWL's because of Umbridge and Harry worrying about Hagrid, there's more than one book to look at. He was very good at D.A.T.D.A., and flying, but he was not above average in most other subjects.

I think that was one of the things I really liked about Harry though, he was not born with any special powers or abilities (for a wizard, that is). He was a regular boy who happened to be the boy who lived. I liked that his "special power" ended up being something as normal as love. I liked that Harry needed help from his friends to succeed because he wasn't good at everything.

Anyways, even if we go by the idea that Harry was above average compared to his fellow students, that's not really what I meant. The fics I'm talking about, I guess the Indy!Powerful!Harry fics, makes him the superior of everyone around him. It makes him so powerful that he uses non-verbal wandless magic, sometimes without training, becomes an animagus overnight, beats Hermione in all the classes, is the descendant of all the founders, is so nice to goblins that they remove the horcrux from him without him having to die etc...

**** Did you actually read the list? Harry had a lot more to worry about that just Umbridge.That's the thing though, Ron, Neville, Hermione, Ginny and Luna are all above average or have the potential to be above average too.

- Ron was lazy but when he applied himself he was actually a really good wizard(not on the level of Harry and Hermione but certainly better that the average wizard).
- Neville had a lack of confidence but after he joined the DA he started improving in leaps and bounds.
- Hermione is pretty obvious.
- Ginny has always been described as being talented.
- Luna is a Ravenclaw, the house of intelligence.

Oh I get it, I only read super!Harry or unique!Harry pics as a guilty pleasure. I am of the opinion that Harry doesn't need any special ability he just needs to apply himself more. The problem is there aren't many good fics out there there that keep Harry closer to canon because it would effectively be a canon rehash.
