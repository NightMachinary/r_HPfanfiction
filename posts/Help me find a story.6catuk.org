I remember that it was an AU, Parents still alive, GWL, with some other siblings as well. Harry has been in a war and has metal scars and I believe appendages.

  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.
