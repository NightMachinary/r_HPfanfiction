I would like to request fics with powerful Harry Potter, by this I mean he has to work for it so no immediate godhood or anything like that, thank you.


** I'm not sure what you mean, but Harry Potter and the Boy Who lived is well written and has powerful Harry, but he studies hard for it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I'm going to ignore the ”has to work for it” part because how tf can you work for better magic without that ”the better shape you're in the more powerful your magic is” trope

If that was the case then I think Voldy would have very little time to rule anything for how 'powerful' he is

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) features a version of Harry that's got a lot of magic at his disposal, but this comes at the cost of him also being the hardest-working student at Hogwarts, putting in hours upon hours in research and development for his magic, along with just about everything else he puts his mind to. He's not the smartest or the most talented, but when it comes to hard work, he won't let anybody beat him at that.

** linkffn(13352687) Still quite early, as the story is just about to enter 2nd year, but as of Sunday, this will begin updating weekly again after my six week break between years 1 and 2 for pre writing purposes. I think it fits quite nicely, and it's a Gryffindor Harry story that will follow all seven years, but is not just canon rehash. Also, no golden trio.
