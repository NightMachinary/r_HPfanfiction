  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

** Not quite the full Order and Death Eaters, but linkffn(9268425) has Harry teaming up with Voldie to fight a shadowy cabal of powerful people. It sounds kinda hokey, but it's very well written (funny as all hell) and the ending might surprise you.

Edit: Haha, that's not the right one. I'll try refreshing.
