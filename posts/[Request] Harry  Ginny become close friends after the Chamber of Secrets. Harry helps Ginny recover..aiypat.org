I've yet to explore the Hurt/comfort genre and I think the shared trauma of the Basilisk would be a good place to start.

Feel free to recommend any Hurt/comfort fics, preferably between peers, preferably not slash

*** It's not really what I'm after. More romance than therapy.

Seems like it's going to be a Ron bash too, which is always exhausting. Plus it has two eleven year olds "kissing passionately " in the great hall in the first chapter.

Thank you for taking the time to rec though.

  Harry decides to help Ginny recover from her experience in the Chamber of Secrets, causing a special bond to form between them. Rating is for violence in the later chapters. A French translation called Si tu peux l'aider is being written by Sined

** Two stories by dirgewithoutmusic on Ao3 come to mind. Ginny does a lot of the healing by herself in both, but Harry plays a role.

In "the girl who lived" Harry (female, named Harriet) plays a larger role in Ginny's recovery, but it's tangential to the story.

In "lost: in defense of Ginny Weasley", her recovery is central but Harry (male this time) only plays a small role. She ultimately saves herself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2249544]]

Both are only sort of what you asked for, but they are fantastic stories and pretty short. And as a side note, "lost" is part of a series of stand-alones that is beautiful and powerful defending the girls of Hogwarts who are frequently disrespected and I recommend all of them.
