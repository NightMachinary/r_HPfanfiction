This is one of the best stories I've ever read on here. Its a geniune piece of literature art. It never has a dull moment. This is a story I cant properly put into words because I dont think I would do it justice. It hasnt been completely but if I could I would the writer to finish this because its that good. To me at least. Make your own judgements but please don't dismiss this because this is like a unique gem that you may never find again.


** I am glad to see someone else that enjoyed this fic too. It's such a fun story and I am glad the author decided to write in an OC for this story. Adds a different element that works well. I am honestly just a fan of any fic that has Harry being a teacher.

*** I hope the author comes back like they did with twins A different life but maybe I'm hoping high.

** Rosmerta threatening aurors with a double-barelled shotgun is rather amusing, but the fic immediately suffers from poor grammar and narrative flow. Harry is massively ooc from the start -mostly due to the pointless profanity- as are the rest of the cast. All in all, I exited rather quickly. While it may be a diamond in the rough for some, it is certainly not my cup of tea.

Though I now have the image of Rosmerta as a gun nut (or even a Prepper) stuck in my head, so thanks for that...

*** Not everyone has the same tastes so I can appreciate that and I'm not sure whether to say I'm sorry or your welcome. Also the author is Argentinian so English isn't his/her second language. But I want to say thank you for giving it a try.

** I love the concept, and the overall tone is delightful... but I can't get past the grammatical mistakes and the phrase “Our estimated headmaster.”

*** Yeah I will say the grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes don't help it but it was last updated 8 years ago and the guy/girl that wrote it doesn't have English as their first language so I wouldn't be surprised but your brain can figure it out. Plus I hoping to get enough coverage on this so the original author might notice it. The author for twins a different life came back after 4 years. But this is a one in a million chance I'm aiming for.
