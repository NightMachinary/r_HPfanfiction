I'm looking for a fic where Harry is a sniper, and gets hired to snipe people and all the warm and fuzziness that comes with that.

70k+ words please!


** I believe linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2275101/]]) involves Harry getting training so he can use a sniper rifle to fulfill the prophecy (he only has one target though).

** For years i've mused on a grosse point blank inspired harry potter fic where harry's hired to kill hermione's dad when he s trying to romance her.

Did you try searching site:fanfiction.net harry potter +sniper in google or other engine? That string will restrict searches to ffn and the +sniper AHOULD force it to show fics with the word in it. I rarely use + myself, usually just - to remove results.

** There's always linkffn(The Sniper by DobbyElfLord). It has a sequel. Another along the same vein is linkffn(The Mercenary by DobbyElfLord) and its sequel.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.
