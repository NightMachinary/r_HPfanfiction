What's the one like Harry and Ron go back in time. Not Gryffindors never die. They start flirting with a girl at the bar


** There was one where Harry and Ron got drunk and told all their woes to the waitress, announcing they were going to jump through the Veil - I forget if they just wanted to end it or where hoping for time travel. I also forgot the name of that one, but I'll figure it out eventually.

I don't know if this is the one you were thinking of or not.

#+begin_quote
  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.
