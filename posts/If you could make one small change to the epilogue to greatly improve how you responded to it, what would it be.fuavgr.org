I thought leaving it as one change would be a fun limitation, in the vein of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail]['for want of a nail']] fanfics. What does it change by knock-on?

(inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fu13a6/what_movie_ending_ruined_the_whole_movie_for_you/][this AskReddit thread]] in which people highlighted the epilogue as the one dark mark on the series. Let's face it, these days, we could do with more discussion threads to keep busy!)


** While I /very/ much agree with previous choices regarding Harry's unfortunate naming choices, I've gotta go with either a) remove the banter about Ron Confunding the driving instruction or b) Remove the 'what if I'm in Slytherin' dialogue between Harry and Albus.

**** It's so awful! It's not the only example of a joke from the books with some unfortunate implications, but it's one of the most jarring ones. The rest of my complaints regarding the epilogue are more overarching and would require way larger changes, so that seems like an easy way to remove (some) of the bitterness.

***** Looking back at the series, as an adult, I do raise my eyebrows at a few things, how certain treatment from certain people is handwaved by JKR while similar treatment from others is brought down on with a ton of bricks.

Throughout the series you /can/ read that as mocking the very nature of double standards, but when things like this appear in the epilogue, I do raise an eyebrow that JK actually condones it.

Two examples off the bat: the Weasley twins' general behavior, and how mean Mrs Weasley, Ginny (and Hermione? it's been a while since I read that book) are to Fleur for iirc zero reason except that she's foreign and pretty.

****** Exactly. Some of it is absolutely just subjective humor --- what comes off as cruel to me could be hilarious to someone else --- and other times it seems like a mismatch between the original childish nature of the books and the attempt to age them up with the reader.

I find Ginny is one of the most notable examples of this. I like her more than a lot of people do, but I always feel the book intends me to read her as more ~spunky~ than harsh and it doesn't always work.

******* I often wonder when I'm in fandom spaces how the disconnect between HP being a British property affected how its international audience received certain characters. JK definitely leaned on certain British character archetypes when writing instead of going for something more all-inclusive, and it results I think in sometimes things being taken not the way the author intended.

(Given that British humor, for example, is notoriously much more harsh and/or dry than e.g. its US equivalent)

I wonder if at some point a more American/ized/ adaptation of the franchise will come that will better communicate the intended /spirit/ of certain characters to a US audience. Ginny is, imo, definitely /intended/ to read as spunky, spirited tomboyish little sister who was babied by her mom and is shaking off that image as she gets older.

** I think I would change the number and names of kids, because I always saw Harry having a big family and while I don't think that Albus Severus or Lily Luna are bad names, naming two out of three of your kids that is kind of...questionable. So I think I would like something along the lines of this:

1. James Sirius & Lily Rose Potter (third years, twins)
2. Albus Severus Potter (first year)
3. Molly Jean Potter (seven years old instead of nine -- I think Percy should've had a son named Ignatius instead of a daughter named Molly)
4. Arthur Bilius Potter (five years old)
5. Remus Neville Potter (two years old -- maybe he has a nickname to prevent Harry from “stealing the honor” away from Teddy? That or a mention that Teddy was cool with it)

Additionally, I think Ginny (in both this ending and the real one) saying that she was pregnant at the end would've been much more satisfying than (paraphrasing here) “and Harry's scar hadn't hurt once in 19 years. All was well”, because that was the /lamest/ last few sentences in a book that I have ever read. And it left me wanting for more rather than satisfied with the completion.

** I would not have the epilogue 19 years later. It would be at best one or two years later after the war. But that's not a small change. So speaking of small changes:

-Ain't no freaking way Harry names one of his kids after Snape. Because fuck that bastard who didn't care about an infant getting murdered as long as his childhood obsession survived.

-And seriously, who names ALL of their kids after someone they knew and their parents? That was seriously too much. His first kid is named Albus and that's it. Even the middle name is something random.

-When the kids see Ron, they are overjoyed. Yep, Ron should be the absolute favourite among kids.

-Don't mention Draco or Malfoys. At all.

-No talk about "what if I end up in Slytherine?" J.K., you completely screwed up with Slytherine. Sorry, but there wasn't a single damm Slytherine in your series that could be considered decent. All of them were either assholes at best and downright villains at worst. You can't save them anymore.
