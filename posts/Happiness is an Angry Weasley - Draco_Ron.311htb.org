[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2927134/1/Happiness-is-an-Angry-Weasley][Happiness is an Angry Weasley]] - /I want someone unexpected, someone challenging. Someone who will be just as much of a surprise. Someone gullible. Out of all the men here at Hogwarts, I've narrowed my choices down to one man: Ronald Weasley./

A story I began writing in high school, finished early in college, then edited a couple years later to fix mistakes/typos/etc. Re-reading it now, it's kinda super obvious that I had no idea what I wanted to do with it and switched gears partway through, haha! I believe it started out as a one-shot as well.

IMO it's funny/silly but with little to no closure. I started a sequel in college but didn't get past one chapter because, again, I had no idea where I was going with it. I just logged back into my ff.net account after a long while and saw it's almost at 100k views. Basically I'm kinda famous. ^{not ^{^{really}}}

Anyway, it's a short read, and I'm kind of oddly proud of my little weirdo of a fic... so I thought I'd share.


** I quite enjoyed that =)
