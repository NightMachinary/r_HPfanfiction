Story: Up Yours Dumbles Linkffn(12714427)

The first chapter has Harry getting a letter from his Mother that she wrote the night she and James got offed by Voldemort.

It was delivered right after 4th year and she wrote it because she had a *vision* the night before showing her Harry's entire life till the end of fourth year. Instead of trying to save James and herself with this future knowledge she writes out a check list for Harry to become his own man!

Including instructions to

Talk the goblins to become Lord Potter cus your emancipated Harry.

Have goblins do a medical check up that your local doctor could do, so they can remove your soul jar scar so it doesn't kill you

Your engaged to Daphne Greengrass they are neutral be friendly and you have a year to marry because reasons. Also Ginny is stinky and has a marriage contract too but ignore her its invalid like she is.

Mummy bought you a hyperbolic time chamber...i mean compressed room use it and become big and stronk like babushka

Mummy also got you and your waifu helmet pensives that have a bajillion memories in them and will *teach you assassins creed style*

I own a house that only i know about (snort snort cus my husband doesn't need to know) that i have a bunch of protections that I a 21 year old fresh out of hogwarts had time to set up, i know i gave you all this special training stuff to fight Voldemort but fuck that leave Britain.

Send Daphnes sister and her best friend to AMERICA so they are out of Britbaboo Don't trust dumblydore he smells like goat

Luv mummy

The books never said that Lily or James /weren't/ Asian, so by JKR's logic, they can be Japanese if you want them to be.

There's a whole subset of Harry Potter fans out there who believe that James was of Indian descent, and Harry is Desi.

This [[http://www.mugglenet.com/2017/10/mind-harry-potter-indian/]["In my mind, Harry Potter is Indian"]] essay sums up a few points in how they got to the conclusion that Harry is biracial Indian, and James is full Indian, which is how they explain why the xenophobic Dursleys had such a hateboner for Harry and "his lot". [[https://desiharrypotterblog.tumblr.com/][This Tumblr]] page has a lot of fanart and Indian Harry content.

********** I've always read Harry as being a typical suburban middle-class English boy. It fits with him thinking of himself as "Just Harry", considering himself as plain and average and nothing special, with the exception of his lightning bolt scar.

#+begin_quote
  "The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning."
#+end_quote

I liked the /idea/ of Desi Harry, but most of how I've seen it used seems so silly and superficial. People use it for the aesthetics of being Indian (making Harry have brown skin) instead of actually exploring the culture in a realistic way, or reflecting on Harry's experience growing up with his English relatives. Why do this if it means nothing but a palette swap? It's just disingenuous.

  Just before his third year. Harry finds his mother's school trunk in the Dursley's attic. Inside he finds a Japanese katana augmented with several charms and runes and documents he was supposed to have seen his eleventh birthday! Now, armed with his mother's "anti-magic" sword, he will carve his own path and embrace his more Slytherin side in order to defeat Voldemort.

Commonly accepted longest story is a 4,556k word story about the "Kantai Collection" called Ambience: A Fleet Symphony.
