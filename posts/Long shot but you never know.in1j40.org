:END:
So years ago I read this fanfic where Harry gets an creature inheritance as a panther Sphinx. Snape is a panther animagus and he saves Harry shortly after. They spend some time with a clan of Sphinx. Harry was deaged I believe. Anyone know the name and where I can find it again? Thank you!


** maybe Cub by Jadie Stee ?
