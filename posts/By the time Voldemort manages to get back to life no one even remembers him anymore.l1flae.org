If we consider all the things that needed to happen and only actually did by happenstance for Voldemort's to regain a body it becomes laughable the amount of luck he had to have to manage it. No Quirrel finding him before first year would mean that even /if/ we assumed CoS and PoA went the same (doubtful) then Pettigrew would have no idea of where to look for Voldemort or even confirmation that he was actually alive beyond Voldemort's own grandstanding if we assume -as it seems likely- that only Voldemort and maybe Dumbledore understood the dark mark, so Pettigrew just spend the rest of his days lying low (unless he is caught) and we have no GoF nor any of the other adventures besides maybe Dumbledore figuring out about Horcruxes and hunting them successfully or not.

Eventually The Next Big Thing happens and people start losing interest on Voldemort (helped by how willing they are to pretend he never existed and the refusal of saying his name at all). Fast forward and the old generation ages while the new never gets to know the war personally and their parents barely speak about that time, so it slowly loses importance until some generations later it gets relegated to just a footnote on history and eventually just some obscure historical trivia to laugh about with friends (The Dark Idiot who lost to a /baby/).

Meanwhile the spirit of Voldemort is on a forest at Albania with no actual sense of how much time has passed when he finds a teenager taking a stroll who, after a surprisingly long explanation about who he is (/'must be a mudblood'/ though Voldy with a mental sneer despite the boy's assurances that he was in fact a British pureblood Malfoy on vacation) and another rather lengthy negotiation (/'uppity mudblood! How dare he ask for compensation or laugh of my threats! Once I have a body I will Crucio him into insanity and then use his still breathing body as an inferi to kill his whole family!'/) the boy agreed to let Voldemort possess his body on the weekends in exchange for him doing the boy's surprisingly advanced homework that for some reason seemed to take as commonplace concepts that as far as Voldemort knew were new groundbreaking and untested theories (/'must be a small seventh year doing advanced extra credit to try for a mastery'/ rationalized Voldemort thinking about the clearly thirteen years old child who had said many times that he had just ended his third year and that still needed to be singed to sleep by his parents).

Some enquiries made by Voldemort during his weekends revealed that Flamel was still alive but that no one had any idea where he kept his stone (or just wouldn't tell the strange kid who talked oddly) and that Dumbledore was dead and that Harry Potter IV was the current seeker for the National Team of England (/'I didn't know the name had been used three times before, what a lack of originality...'/) and so with no way promptly available way of resurrecting himself on sight but reassured that his enemies wouldn't be on him immediately Voldemort found himself forced to re-negotiate with the boy Hugo Malfoy to extend their agreement for the school-year. Hugo was naturally only too happy to not have to do any homework from now on (although he later discovered that he still had to re-read and correct the homework to get passing grades since his new head-buddy had some petty antiquated understanding of magic, but hey, at least he didn't have to do it all /by himself/) and readily agreed.

It was during the year as Voldemort was confronted again and again with a much changed world without anyone who he used to know and as he tried progressively more fanatically to find any reference about him that he was forced to confront the truth, the world had walked past him, he was away too long and freaking chocolate frogs had outlived his memory. All the war, all the fear and all the effort and study he spent, all of it ended amounting to only a couple of paragraphs distributed through a handful of obscure history books. At least Hugo (worried about his new friend) let him eat his chocolate frogs, a remaining piece of the world that left him behind.


** A miscalculation in his reincarnation attempt for a body seems him forever trapped in a magical Roomba, as house elves were freed along time ago.

** I like the premise of Voldemort returning much later very appealing, as it avoids several pesky tropes or issues at once:

- No need to force ridiculous power progressions on teenager Harry and his friends
- No need to turn <16 years old into child soldiers
- No need to write good adult guys as criminally negligent and useless plot devices

--------------

Furthermore, without the looming existential threat from Voldemort, the kids could actually be kids, with all kinds of fun teenager drama and so forth. I've seen lots of requests for a "chill" Harry or him dating around. Well, not having a sadistic genocidal maniac breathing down his neck every day can give you such a Harry, credibly.

--------------

Unfortunately, I have seen only one reasonably well written fic with that premise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], in which Voldemort returned in Year 2005, but remains on hiatus since 2017.

*** Despite Voldemort not really coming back later (at least, from what I remember), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][the one where Harry's a dragon]] is very relaxed.

**** Mild spoilers:

He does come back, but he manages to promptly curbstomp himself /again/ via reflected killing curse, because dragon, and the whole affair passes by without much fanfare. This is rather in tune with the rest of the fic, all things considered.

*** If Harry had normal school years would he be anything special in the future?

Because then you have a story about the boy who lived who just went on to be a normal guy who plays quidditch and was never motivated to become on Auror.

**** Or he could use his natural curiosity and ambition to dive into magic.

Canon Harry ignored the danger in favor of doing stuff he enjoyed, perhaps due to the fact he belived he would die young.

It can go both ways, a Harry without getting into life or death situations might study more since he can enjoy himself later

***** Or maybe not, if he gets no hint about Voldemort for time enough he could believe he was dead, alternatively, without Voldemort coming back to torment Harry yearly chances are that he would just keep pushing it off like he did in cannon until his death (either cause of the ring or any other reason really).

** What could also be interesting is to consider how the greater world changed over the generations. Voldemort might look at the sky and be surprised to see lights on the dark side of the moon. Wizards using magic versions of last century technology, magiphones and wizardnet. Maybe he'll will find out that nobody cares about blood purity any more since most people have custom genomes.

Nah, there will always be fuckwits out there.

There are still people who care about aristocracy despite most aristos being indistinguishable from yer average middle class professional family.
