Think about it. If they wasn't one then Draco wouldn't need to use the vanishing cabinet to bring in the Death Eaters. He could just smuggle in a portkey.

The only time portkeys worked was in the Headmasters' office, and we know Dumbledore can remove the protective charms at will.

*** The only times portkeys were used was in the presence of Dumbledore and during the Triwizard Tournament.

Dumbledore is the Headmaster which means he can remove the charms at his own leisure. The Triwizard tournament needed for the anti-portkey jinx to be removed, so Dumbledore must have removed it during the 3rd challenge.

** From the start, the Cup was enchanted as a portkey (probably by Dumbledore himself). It was supposed to bring the "winner" from the center of the Maze to the place where he entered it so he could receive his prize. It was probably also intended as an anticheat measure since it permitted to "Champion" to not be ambushed on his way back.

If the Cup was not a portkey from the start, it would not have done anything when Harry grabbed it a 2nd time.

** “The time will come when even you will read /Hogwarts: The History/ ...” I think it is mentioned of those Hermione's tirades that portkeys are included in the transportation modes which are prohibited at Hogwarts.

** I imagine the protections Hogwarts has that prevent witches and wizards from Apparating and Disapparating on the school's grounds also prevent transportation via Portkey. It's not explicitly stated as such, but it seems reasonable to assume that the Jinx over Hogwarts that locks down Dis/Apparition also messes with the effect that makes Portkeys work. It's either the same enchantment, or two very similar enchantments working in conjunction - either way, it's reasonable to say that, yes, Hogwarts is protected against the use of Portkeys.

But, as is typical, there does appear to be an exception: the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts grants certain privileges to the one recognized as such - among them is the ability to temporarily lift the protections in order to Apparate/Disapparate freely when required or to permit the usage of Portkeys when necessary. Given Dumbledore is a skilled wizard and was Headmaster of Hogwarts, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that he lifted the enchantments that prevented magical teleportation within the bounds of Hogwarts in order to permit the Triwizard Cup to function as a Portkey, just as he did lift the enchantments around the Great Hall to permit the learning of Apparition by 6th years.

This is, of course, overlooking the fact that in Wizarding Britain, the usage of Portkeys is also subject to regulation by the Ministry's Department of Magical Transportation. It appears that for official uses, you need permission from the DMT to create a Portkey - especially if you're traveling internationally. Thus, it's not easy to just make a Portkey willy-nilly without getting into some legal trouble if you get caught. Granted, Death Eaters aren't likely to care, but it was probably too risky to chance it anyways, beyond the protection on Hogwarts preventing the usage of Portkeys within the school's grounds/castle.

** To answer this question let's look at each of the times that a portkey was used in Hogwarts.

Time number one: Triwizard Tournament

Time number two: Weasley's and Harry going to 12 Grimmauld Place

Time number three: Harry going from the ministry of magic trick to Dumbledore's office

In the first case, we don't know who made the portkey so we'll have to come back to it.

in the second and third cases though we know that Dumbledore made the portkey.

In the second case, you could just say that Dumbledore lifted the enchantments of the school but in the third case that would have been improbable since he was in the ministry of magic. I personally don't believe he could have lifted them remotely.

Because of this information that we have, I believe that only the headmaster can make a portkey that will travel to or from Hogwarts.

The gaping hole in this theory though is how did Moody/Barty crouch Jr get the portkey to travel to the graveyard.

Well, we don't know who made the port key for the maze. I personally believe that Dumbledore made the port key. But then Barty crouch was able to not create but reprogram the port key to work twice and first take Harry to the graveyard.

** it would be one way i think. Only reason the cup worked is because it is two way.

Also pet keys are tracked and hard to make

Also maybe it's kinda a small plot whole

*** I assumed that the cup was meant to transport the victor to the start of the maze, and crouch just twisted the spell to put a second destination in the middle. Like, we already know he's good at adjusting existing spellwork, because he fooled the goblet, so

*** Ah yes

Pet keys, for when you want to open your door by using an adorable item that loves you

Plot whole, when the plot fills you with butterflies.
