Okay, so I recently re-read the fanfic "Life skills outside the curriculum" by Endrina on AO3. I absolutely loved Harry's sassy no nonsense "I grew up on the streets and it made me a badass survivor" vibes. On honestly any quality fanfic where Harry's muggle background results in him not taking any of the wizarding world's bs. Basically I was wondering if anyone had any fanfic recs for stories where Harry is like this. I don't really care about specifics, but I just really like that trope. (Also for any Star Wars Rebels fans out there, anything where Harry is similar to Ezra would be perfect)

Stuff I've read that also kinda fits this would be:

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi (ao3)

Impossible by Belle's Noir (FF.n)


** I don't think this is quite what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot.

linkffn(13230151) and it's sequel linkffn(13461089) These stories are about an independent Harry that has a cynical world view and takes quite a few cues from the muggle side of the world.

  The direct continuation of Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts, in which cyberpunk-influenced, tabletop RPG-loving Harry Potter continues his life in and out of Hogwarts. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Violent!Harry. Book 2 in Harry Potter and the RPG Influence. Rated M for language, graphic violence and sexual content. Dumbledore bashing, apparently.

** I love Life Skills and Hermione's Crammer School! It's been a VERY long time since I read this one so I can't vouch for the quality, but I remember enjoying it. Linkffn(smoke and mirrors by pcp)
