I really enjoy lots of creature fics. especially fics where characters must unlearn internalized bullshit. for example: a character who hates werewolves is bitten by one. however, dont limit your recommendations to fics about unlearning bigotry. unfortunately, i see a lot of fics that use some wierd concept of "creature mates" as a sort of predestined "fuck or die" mechanic, and im not interested. im also not interested in bashing children.

werewolf and vampire fics are obviously included. veela fics are included, but ive only seen 1 that didnt use "mates", and it was unfinished. other, more rare creatures are absolutely included.

i have no preference regarding mf, mm, ff, mmf(golden triad for the win), etc, but please dont rec fics by homophobic authors.


** Saphroneth: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/]]

It's not finished one, but I found it satisfying read as it is and looks to be updated regularly. Harry changed to a dragon in his childhood and thought it was a perfectly normal thing that sometimes happens, but that's because Muggles didn't see his true form. The story deals much with the rights of magical creatures and how to deal in the world of humans when you are differently shaped. To me, it also feels cosy because Harry hoards books and he loves reading the same books I read when I was a teenager. No ships, everyone is so young and Harry is different species.

** There's "Enter the Dragon" over on Questionable Questing (it's PG-13 despite the sites reputation) where Harry turns into a dragon a young age. He proceeds to dragonish things (at least acording to ayoung child)

I'd link it, but I'm on mobile.

Also, it's definitly not mate or die, but Harry does accrue a collection of "Maidens" (dragons are always kidnapping them, so they must be a particularly valuable for of treasure) throughout the fic, but being a dragon, Harry matures much slower than a human and the relationships are all along the good friend/big sister line. It's actually noted as likely to be a problem in the future when Harry goes through dragon puberty.

*** Is there a policy on direct links to QQ here? I know some forums have a strong 'no never' on QQ links, if not I am happy to go get it.

I really like this story, it is a fully authorized continuation of another author's work. Its a bit uneven in tone, there are some chapters that are just poop and fart jokes and crack, and others that are completely serious. It is a good story anyway and being a dragon is taken to its appropriately horrifying bounds at times, which is a refreshing change from 'oh, how nice.'

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

Post-war werewolf Draco deals with his bigotry and self-hatred as he falls headlong into love with a hot male black Muggle cryptozoologist. It's a lot of fun, and one of the most organic redemption arcs I've read for Draco.
