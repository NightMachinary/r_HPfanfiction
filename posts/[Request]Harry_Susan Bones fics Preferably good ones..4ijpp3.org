I'm entirely tired of sorting through the bad ones.

I've read most of the old ones on FF.net. Junior Inquisitor was good(So far, I haven't actually finished it), and that one James Spookie fic that involved a marriage contract. I don't remember the name of was good too but it sorta started to drag and I never managed to finish it.

/Especially/ /anything/ that isn't on FF.net because I probably haven't read that before.

Thanks in advance!

*** It pretty much is. It's like a slightly different Harry/Daphne. Susan is still from a noble family (i'm not sure if this is actually canon but it's in every fic i read so far) but the Bones are a Light family or some such. Susan is basically an OC, but she's often written as more of a sweet but still strong kind of girl whereas Daphne... no actually Daphne is the same, except Harry has to brake through her "Ice Queen" shell first.

I think it's mainly used to give Harry a connection to Madam Bones, Head of the DMLE.

**** Haha, when I realized she was just like Daphne, I wondered why I grew to like Daphne more than Susan. Probably because the Daphne stories I've read are better written than the Susan ones.

Still, the connection Susan gives to Madam Bones is interesting enough that if I wrote a fic, I'd probably go with Susan.

***** I usually prefer Daphne, too. I think it's because the pairing just makes for more interesting stories. While she is pretty much an OC, fanon has more or less decided on what's "acceptable" for writing Daphne.

This is mainly focused on her Ice Queen persona, but i personally think Harry would profit from having a real Slytherin on his side and Daphne is usually portrayed as a highly intelligent and cunning pureblood. She's pretty much exactly what you need if you want to make Harry smarter than he was in canon, which, too be honest, isn't all that difficult, because canon Harry was an idiotic follower.

Pairing him with Daphne usually makes him more autonomous and cunning while still being willing to stand up for what he feels is right.

Susan is in a similar position, except that it usually keeps Harry on the right sight of the law because of her aunt. Harry/Daphne is pretty much two teens against the world (sometimes with morally ambiguous methods) while Harry/Susan is more of a "Harry takes over the Ministry from within" kind of story.

So she could absolutely become a close and useful friend to Harry and get far more screen time. This is one character I feel awfully underutilized.
