this fic is a riff on "to all the boys i've loved before" in the marauders era, and i just posted a new chapter today! please read & review if you love jily as i do.

summary: lily keeps all her feelings hidden in journals! but they fall into exactly the wrong hands and now her quiet, easy life is turned upside down.
