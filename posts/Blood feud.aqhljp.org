** You need to find a reason why Harry would give a damn about a blood feud he never knew anything about and which was forgotten by everyone else as well. Since he's married, he'll be the boy who vanquished Voldemort. Probably Head Auror as well. Ron might still be an Auror, Hermione will already be on the fast track in the Ministry, the Minister himself as well as key figures such as Arthur owe him their lives. Why would anyone think they could pressure him into continuing a blood feud, or even caring about it? Or keep him from merely saying "Alright, let's end this stupidity", and having the other family agree? Magic compelling him? Why didn't that happen sooner then? Peer pressure? He doesn't have many peers, and Hermione and Ron wouldn't pressure him. Social pressure? He's the saviour of Britain.

Since your main plot seems to be "Harry and his love have to see each other in secret because they are on different sides of a conflict", you might want look into simply making it so his love's family is fighting his own friends and family. But since that's likely to be "Harry and co. against genocidal bigot scum", there's really no reason the girl wouldn't switch sides - or Harry dropping her if she wouldn't.

So, I would propose to make him marry a foreign witch, and then have war break out between Britain and the other country - or at least, a serious conflict - and have that strain their relationship. Preferably a conflict that can't be easily reduced to "this side may not be perfect, but they're in the right and the other side isn't kitten-eating evil, but clearly in the wrong".

You can assume a rift between Harry and the Weasleys should he not end up with Ginny. If the Girl is, for example, Bellatrix's daughter (from the first war, not Delphi), no one would want to support her. And unless they want to push an open revoltuion, there is not a lot of support for Harry left.

The Order is dead. Kingsley, a few Weasleys and maybe Hestia Jones are the living members. Compare that to the number of people who sit on the Wizengamot and you can easily tailor a scenario where the ruling elite (think Roman Senate) just sidelines Harry and makes Kingsley a figurehead to appease the "light" side while doing nothing more than a little lip service.

**** That still doesn't answer how anyone could pressure Harry into continuing/taking up an ancient and forgotten blood feud.

Also, I don't see too many in canon willing to oppose the wizard who took down Voldemort - it's not as if they knew how exactly it happened. Voldemort scared everyone witless. Harry defeated and obliterated him. And now the sheep are supposed to push him into continuing a blood feud?

And now the "smart" purebloods had waited for Voldemort and Dumbledore to throw their supporters into the meat grinder until just a few are left alive, leaving Britain ripe for taking. A bit of a stretch, but not nearly as far as a lot of fics out there.

To stick with the Roman comparison, threatened banishment, outlawing him, confiscating any possessions, holding hostages or simply throwing a fake Riot at him to hurt/kill him as the Senate did with Gracchus.

Of course, you also have such concepts as magically binding oaths and contracts to play with.

****** That's quite the departure from canon, though. And what exactly is the motivation for a smart pureblood to do this? Start trouble with the man who beat Voldemort and his friends, for what? Why would anyone go to bat for a blood feud everyone had forgotten? Against the Boy-Who-Lived? That's pretty much the dumbest thing you can do. Especially if said Boy-Who-Lived married into a pureblood family.

If you have contracts and oaths, why didn't they kick in earlier? Why didn't anyone know about this whole thing?

That's why I think Harry marrying a foreign witch, and getting dragged into an international conflict would work better for the more serious plots.

******* Alternatively, you could write it as an AU, where stuff like that actually matters. Things like blood feuds seem pretty archaic, even for magical society as presented in canon. The closest thing you get to that is Ron jokingly telling Rose to beat Scorpius on tests; unless I'm misremembering, there isn't a whole lot of canonical [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZK3rPTAiP8]["the king ordered it"]] sort of generational conflict between families afaik.

*** For the reason they would even give a fuck, it is possible it is magically binding, but vaguely worded so they could find a loop hole, hence the story

**** "Magically binding" opens two plot holes:

First, why hasn't it kicked in before? Why not the first time Harry met a member of the "enemy family"? Why hasn't that forced the other family to attack him already?

Second, if it's magically binding, how did that come to be? And why can't it be removed? And if there's a loophole, where's the problem again? Apparently, it didn't force anyone to attack anyone for ages.

***** Hmm I didn't think of that. It's possible you could pull some bullshit with it only preventing marriage between the two after one resulted in the death of the daughter of whoever Harry marries ancestors.

****** Well, still no problem - it's not as if you need to marry to have a family these days. It's not as if Harry gives a damn about "holy matrimony" or "living in sin".

So, I think some greater conflict between countries might work better if you want something dividing them with outside pressure and internal troubles.

Because the apparation to France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands or Luxemburg is too easy, right? Hell, you can take a flight from Heathrow and be there within 90 minutes.

** Where's that picture of the Old El Paso kid? That's my response.

In all seriousness, I'd sleep on it, and go with the flow afterwards. Part of me wants to see all three of these scenarios though...
