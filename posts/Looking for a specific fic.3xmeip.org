Hey guys, this has been bugging me for ages and I can't seem to find it anywhere. All I remember is on the train back from Hogwarts Harry asks Hermione on a date but she refuses saying later to Ginny that she read in some magazines lavender and Parvati read that you should play hard to get. This drives Harry over the edge and he commits suicide, I think it takes place after fifth year but am not positive, everyone blames Hermione and she's shunned and I think Harry comes back at some point or becomes a ghost or something I'm a little hazy on that point. Honestly it's a bad fic but it's one I think of now and again and the fact I can't find it really bugs me. If anyone could help find it I'd really appreciate it thanks!


** So Harry kills himself cos he couldn't get a date?

I bet this fic is just flawless.

*** As I said from the little I remember it's terrible, the fact I can't find it just irritates me

*** It was mildly amusing, especially coming from an author who ships HHr insanely hard.

** Is it linkffn(All Because of Hermione Granger by Seel'vor)? I just linked this a little while ago. Weird how people think about similar things during the same time period. Probably relates to how Hollywood puts out two Wyatt Earp films, three deep sea sci-fi adventure films and two Big Asteroid Coming to Destroy Earth films all the time.

*** I'm not OP but that's definitely the fic I was thinking of in regards to this.

**** It's definitely similar, I thought it was it for a minute but not quite unfortunately. The major difference I remember between this and what I'm thinking of, is Hermione being shunned by everyone mainly the weasleys, I think Ginny attacks her at some point.
