Where a more sane Voldemort (who could also be going by Tom Riddle) rises with political influence rather than violent scare tactics and Harry Potter and/or the Order struggle against this.

It can have elements of foul play on either side, but the power Voldemort holds is rooted in politics rather than force.

Examples:

linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow) which has an AU wizarding world where Voldemort is the supreme ruler of a anti-Muggle society

linkffn(6996054) permanent WIP in which Harry is a vigilante and Tom Riddle is the Ministry's Undersecretary


** The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter does political Tom Riddle well, on top of being an all around great read. He's in the background early but pushes more and more toward main antagonist as the series progresses and the main character draws his attention.

** /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]])

Has a lot of political voldy. It's unfinished but still worth the read, longer than many finished ones as is. Writing is great plot-wise, maybe the best in a fic I've seen, but grammar is kinda rough in the beginning (I made a habit of counting how many screwed up homonyms got thrown around, ones I'd never seen before) but improves dramatically as it goes on.

It's less Harry fighting with him and more just dealing with him, since it's a fic in which voldy won the first war, and it's long so it takes a while to get to all the politics. But when it does we get some cool international pols too, not a thing that happens in most fics.

*** I see what you mean with the grammar so far, but it does seem pretty good!

**** By the time I got to the second year I almost didn't care, and it really just gets better, the characters get really fleshed out and you get some other POVs. Weirdly the rest of the grammar isn't terrible, it's mostly just the homonyms. Having fun counting them made it less annoying though :)

** I think Taure had a oneshot like this where Riddle became the non-magical Minister.
