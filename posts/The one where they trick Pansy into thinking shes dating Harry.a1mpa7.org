A few of Harry's female friends somehow convince Pansy that she is dating Harry, but he is so good in the sack that it causes temporary loss, hence the no memories of it. She eventually "breaks up" with him, thinking he's breaking her mind. It was a minor part of the story, but the only one I remember.

Which one is this? Please and thank you.

That should be the one with the "mind blowing orgasms"

*** Huh. I thought it was something completely different, but that is indeed it. Thank you.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
