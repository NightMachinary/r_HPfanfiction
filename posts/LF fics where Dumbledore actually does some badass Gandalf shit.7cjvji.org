#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

When he meets the Grangers the summer between years three and four he is wearing a Nundu-skin robe as Spoils of War. (Note: In the Animagus-verse, Nundus are an already dangerous creature that has been hopped up on massive amounts of dark magic, and causes pandemics in its wake.)

*** I disagree:

Gandalf killed the Balrog and stopped the Witch-King cold in front of Minas-Tirith (forget the movie, read the books).

Gandalf also helped busting Smaug and establishing a human/dwarf stronghold in the north.

Perhaps more important, he wasn't even the most powerful good guy in LOTR. Sauron's forces tried to storm Lorien three times and got slaughtered every time by Galadriel.

  For Elves and Wizards, what others might call magic was not something special or different from the natural world, just a part of it that was not immediately visible, leading to more common categorization of things as Seen or Unseen.

*** Inquisitor answered what Gandalf actually did so I'll post a realization I had.

Peter Fran and Philippa (with Philippa doing most of the on screen talking) talked about this in the behind the scenes documentary. What do you leave out in order to create a cohesive narrative.

The under powering of Gandalf (in terms of Middle Earth magic/super powers) is one of those.

Reading your comment just made me realize there would be people in the future (as the movies were made by fans for fans of the books) who hadn't read the novels. I had never considered that possibility yet it seems so apparent now.

They had to make serious cuts and still ended up with 12 hours of movie. They beefed up some parts (Eomer and Eowyn) while cutting down or cutting out some others (Tom Bombadil is out and Gandalf's power is ‘diminished'). But the movie tells a more cohesive story now. The chapters line up better in the movie.

But at the sacrifice of the details JRRT was known for. I wouldn't reshoot the movies to ‘fix' these ‘issues' but still.

You're woefully underplaying Gandalfs power.
