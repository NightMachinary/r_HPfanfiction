** Hi! I'm a moderator on DLP.

You need five posts now to view Work by Author (WbA) content. Why? We've been having problems with plagiarism, and this is an effort to prevent bots from gaining access to this subforum.

A good way to go if you're looking for threads to contribute to is to browse by the 'new posts' or 'today's posts' links at the top of the forum. Or perhaps browse the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/neglected.php][Neglected Stories List]], a collection of stories submitted for review that haven't had enough reviews, and leave your thoughts on them - this helps more people find stories to enjoy. As [[/u/hmm23456]] mentions, do try to steer clear of making pointless posts. Try to add something meaningful to a discussion.

Let me know if you have any questions! :)

*** Could you tell me why this post is almost entirely Lorem ipsum?

**** Well, the short answer is probably that Sesc was fed up of having his stories plagiarised. The long answer may be quite a tale, so pull up a chair.

***** I tried reading it a long while back. I'm pretty sure it was before the whole thing happened. I'd just forgot about it until recently and checked again.

**** Likely you'll just need to wait a bit. I know it sometimes takes a while for the server to update.

Send [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/member.php?u=8439][me]] a PM if you still can't access WbA tomorrow.

*** If I get my linux question answered on DLP forums vs where I've asked elsewhere there will be some worship going on.

** You need an arbitary amount of posts 5- 10 or something. Just remix a few early comments in the review threads to hit the number. But space it over a few days.

**** Yes you have to make about 5 posts to access the WbA where all the stories are hosted. Do not make stupid or pointless comments though or you risk being banned.

Or you could, you know, post things that offer original thought and insight. Crazy idea, I know.

**** Or even just be friendly in non fic related threads. DLP has a huge amount of content completely unrelated to fanfic, it's not as if newbies lack for threads to post in.
