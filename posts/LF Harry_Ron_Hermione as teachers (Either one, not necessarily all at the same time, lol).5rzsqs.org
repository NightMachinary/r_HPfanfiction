Harry being a teacher was pretty much the only thing I liked about Delenda Est before I gave up in disgust. It made me think what a well-written Harry as DADA teacher, or a more mature Ron, or Hermione as...anything, really, would be like. So, does anyone have any recommendations?

(Also, Take No Umbrage was okay, but the author's pregnancy fetish just weirded me out.)


** Both Harry and Hermione end up professors in the "Where in the World is Harry Potter" series though it's a fairly minor point overall. Same thing with linkffn(9191701)

Harry becomes the divination professor in linkffn(11160991) and while I really enjoy and recommend it, I don't know that it will ever be finished.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there. (Sequel, switches POVs)

  Begins at chapter 31 of Pride-of-Time. Hermione does not de-age herself- not everything can be fixed in time, and sometimes the only solution is to move forward with what you have...

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

Overall, it's an okay story. I've read it once, probably won't ever read it again.
