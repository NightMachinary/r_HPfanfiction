** With AO3 (archiveofourown.org) you put in just plain HTML. Way more plesant experience in terms of editing (and also in terms of reading)!

*** Thank you so much. I'm completely technophobic but it already seems much easier than fanfiction.net - thanks for the recommendation.

** ao3 (archive of our own) is a popular fic site. You can change font style/size in boy fanfic.net and ao3. For ao3 you have to pick a custom “skin” with whichever font you like. You can find this in the preferences on your account when you make it.

For fanfic.net I think you have to do it on the desktop version not mobile?

Someone else probably knows better than me

*** Thank you, I've had a go at uploading today and I'm still struggling a bit but I'm sure I will work it out after a bit of fiddling about. Thanks for the recommendation.
