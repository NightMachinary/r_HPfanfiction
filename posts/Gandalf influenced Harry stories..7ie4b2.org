Any stories where Harry has the bearing, temperament, power, and wisdom of a wizard of old ala Gandalf. I'll read any stories either past third year, over 60k+ words, or complete.

This is the meme which made me want to see if such stories exist. [[https://www.memecenter.com/fun/1320767/i-think-he-amp-039-s-getting-cocky]]

Thanks,

Warryn.


** Take a look at [[/u/steelbadger][u/steelbadger]]'s works like linkffn(the shadow of angmar). Not exact but....

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Not at all what you're looking for, but Harry directly quotes Gandalf in linkffn(Stages of Hope) and it always make me chuckle.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Not what you're looking for but this reminded me of the first ever LOTR HP crossover I ever read, back when the 6th book was still shiny and new:

Also, your meme has another version:

**** Oh god, now imagine his interactions with Dumbledore, good, bad, manipulative, whatever. Just imagine the conversation. They'll constantly speak in riddles to each other, and never get anything done.

*** Thanks for the suggestion, but it is sadly a very short read. If you have anything else that I can sink my teeth into, that will kill a few hours i'd greatly appreciate it, but otherwise thanks.

** This is another old fic I read AGES ago where Gandalf somehow becomes a Hogwarts professor.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1772189/1/Professor-Gandalf]]

I'm going to read it again to see if it really is funny or if it's just nostalgia making me recommend this to you.

** The fic A Long Journey Home linkffn(A Long Journey Home) has a female Harry accidentally travel back in time where she takes a Gandalf-esque role in history (ie very powerful, fighting injustice, teaching magic, mentoring others). That's kinda where the similarities end, and the fic does have its flaws, but it's still an extremely good read nonetheless.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
