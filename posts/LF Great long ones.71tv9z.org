The title pretty much says it all i want to know what your absolute favorite is the only requirement being that it's over 100,000 words and no bad guys hooking up with good guys.


** One of my favorites. Canon pairings.

**** Honestly, I don't put much stock in summaries (summary's?).

If someone's recommending a story on one of these threads I assume they like it for a reason and it doesn't take much time to check it out and see if it's worth reading or not. I can usually decide pretty quickly if I'm going to continue or not.

But, if you need more convincing, it's a post GoF AU written during the three year summer. No hallows, no horcruxes, and really, no Voldemort. It really is a wonderful multi PoV fic mostly focusing on Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius, with other characters as well. There's a compelling conflict in the form of what to do with rebelling Dementors following the fall of Voldemort and the romance and character building is well done.

At 600k+ it's a hefty read but I've managed to read it more than once.

***** I just never seen such a bland summary before that was recommended on these threads. I'm not bashing it or anything, but it tells me nothing of the actual story itself, only that it's post-Hogwarts, meaning that if I saw that on FF, I'd scroll right past it without a second thought. I did check it out but it wasn't really for me.

** My top long fics:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 660k words long canon rewrite in a non-magic AU. It's so good I like it more than the original series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): 680k words and still in progress, a great war epic that rivals Tom Clancy's [[https://www.amazon.com/Red-Storm-Rising-Tom-Clancy/dp/042510107X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1506119654&sr=1-1&keywords=red+storm+rising][Red Storm Rising]] in quality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Voldemort was a lot scarier in this 640k words long story, and canon Horcrux Hunt would have completely failed. But Hermione and Dumbledore were up to the challenge. It's another great war epic and polit thriller.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): 700k words long and generally lots of fun, but Years 1 and 2 followed canon stations a little too close. Its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), is even more fun, but the author has her priority set on another fic at moment.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
