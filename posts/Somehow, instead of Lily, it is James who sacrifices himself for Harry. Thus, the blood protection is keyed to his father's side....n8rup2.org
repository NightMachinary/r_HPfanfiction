...But James Potter's closest living relatives are through his mother's side, that of Euphemia Potter née Umbridge. Harry is raised by his father's cousin, Dolores Umbridge. He gets terrible wizarding guardians, as opposed to terrible muggle guardians.

Bonus: Going with the idea of Euphemia Umbridge in general. Harry tries to find himself a new guardian, discovers who has the biggest claim through his father's relations... And promptly decides to stay at the Dursley's.

(Apologies in advance, lol. I just saw Euphemia Potter's maiden name wasn't established, couldn't resist).

** I can actually see this leading to a good (or at least tolerable) Dursleys fic. With Petunia having years to cool down after the breakdown of her relationship with her sister, and with Harry already harboring bad experiences with wizards, the two might share a kind of camaraderie. It would probably be awkward and stilted at first, with more than a few bumps along the road, but I see a lot of potential here for a redemption/healing fic.

Damn now I really want to write this.

** Imagine the shock when a self-hating, ashamed Harry arrives at Hogwarts, mourning the fact that his father married a mudblood and desperate to somehow become more then the half-blood he is, but he also has a huge inferiority complex that's unworthy of Slytherin and would besmirch the nobility of that House if he was sorted there, believing the best place for him would be Hufflepuff because he deserves no better... and then his fellow students start to realize, over his first year or two, just how abusive his home life is, and suddenly Umbitch is facing the reason their House Mascot is a Badger...

Also Harry would have attempted to avoid Hermione and other muggleborns whenever he could because he doesn't want to sully himself further (which would have started a different kind of alarm bell early on among the Prefects, before they started to discover the root cause), and would have no reason to interact with Ron, so the Troll incident might've gone a lot worse. Hopefully not fatally, but maybe something like Hermione winds up spending a week in the hospital wing or something.

*** That Hermione gets stuck in the troll incident only happens if things align just right anyway. Ron has to make the "no friends" comment after class to somebody after having been paired with Hermione and things going wrong.

Harry simply not being in Gryffindor could throw off all of this. Who Ron works with that one Charms class, if he talks with somebody right after and about what, maybe even if he practices the spell before that class and thus has no problems with it...

**** I've read fics that have it happening for different reasons. Like him coming across her by accident, etc.

Maybe this Harry stumbled across her on his way back from investigating the third floor corridor on Delores' orders, and was trying to explain why he was in the girl's bathroom (ducked in to sob because holy shit that was a CERBERUS Delores is going to get him KILLED) to Hermione when the troll lumbers in. Harry is just totally done because first he comes across a three headed dog and now there's a freaking TROLL in front of him this day could not get worse, and deals with the troll. Hermione's grateful and bam, instant friendship. Harry then has to deal with his sudden friendship with a muggleborn when his foster mother hates them.

** Honestly, I'm not entirely convinced that Umbridge would be the worst guardian for Harry. He'd definitely be raised to be a prejudiced Ministry flunky, and would probably be a child celebrity who Umbridge would use to advance her own political career, and obviously neither of those are great. But I don't think Umbridge would be as abusive towards him as the Dursleys were. Neglectful, maybe, but probably not outright abusive.

Unless, of course, being raised by Umbridge made it possible for an "Imperioused" former Death Eater to find a way to get around the protections and kill him as a child. But that wouldn't really be her fault.

But even then, the Death Eaters would probably realize that Umbridge was raising him to be sympathetic to their cause and do what they could to help encourage that. So Harry would probably end up basically turning out like another Draco. So not a great outcome for the world as a whole, but a fairly decent outcome for Harry personally.

*** The woman literally tortures children with a dark object that permanently scars words into their skin. I can't see any evidence that she wouldn't abuse Harry.

She probably wouldn't do anything that could reflect badly on her, but we all know she's a control freak who loves to gaslight people. Being raised by her would be a nightmare.

Supposedly in canon she's a halfblood, and has a estranged squib brother. So I could see Harry tracking down the brother to see if he's willing to rescue him from Delores' clutches. The brother could be an interesting character to develop.

**** And the Malfoys were all for torturing and killing muggles and mudbloods and overthrowing the government, but were also apparently completely loving parents. Not all bad people are bad all the time.

And this would be fifteen years earlier than we saw her in canon. There's no telling how much she changed in that time. And even if she was sympathetic to the Death Eaters at the time, she probably wasn't their explicit ally in the first war like she was in the second. So she may still have felt like she was in constant danger during the war, so she could be very grateful to Harry for ending it.

*** Didn't at least some of the Death Eaters think Harry had some great dark powers of his own that made Voldemort's killing curse backfire? Maybe she'd jump on that train, raising Harry to believe he is the next great Dark Wizard Prodigy. Maybe the Death Eaters would split into Harry's and Voldemort's followers, and they would still fight each other, but not as light and dark but as two evil wizards fighting for sole reign.

** Alternative idea with that theme.

Snape still hates James Potter with a passion but also tries to be a halfway decent and reasonable person. He recognizes that James would have saved him from Remus even if Sirius wasn't in on it and possibly even if it was a werewolf he wasn't friends with. In recognition of this debt he asks voldemort to spare /both/ potters, thus when he tries to kill Lily we see the curse rebounding on him and she becomes the woman who lived.

*** Or without making Snape complete OOC, why not Pettigrew?

Pettigrew asks for James to be spared. I mean, they were friends for seven to eight years. Yes, Peter betrayed them in the end, but we know from DH that he wasn't happy with his friends dying. He was distraught by the McKinnons death. So maybe, in a moment after their deaths he actually remembers that he was a Gryffindor once, find some left bravery in him and asks the Dark Lord to spare James. It would be even more rational for Voldemort to spare him, seeing that James was a pureblood.

**** Maybe, but you just gave me the idea for how to do it without making Snape OOC

He goes on one of his diatribes against James after getting saved and Dumbledore or maybe Lily sets him straight and makes him recognize that he does owe James his life. Unable to stand being in the debt of James Potter any longer than he absolutely must he tries to repay the debt at the first opportunity so he can go back to hoping he dies and maybe even facilitating it. This manifests in him asking Voldemort to spare James as well
