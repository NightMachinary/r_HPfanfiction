Hi, everyone,

​

I'm delighted to inform you that Cauterize by Lady Altair is up. Instead of doing this project on YouTube, I've decided to start a podcast.

The podcast is currently called "HP FanFiction Audiobook Project - Main Feed" ("Main Feed" because I was planning to have multiple feeds until I found out that Sounder's free plan only supports one podcast feed). You should be able to find it up on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and wherever else podcasts are hosted within a few hours. Here's the Anchor link.

​

The first chapter of /Saving Connor/, the first book of the Sacrifices Arc, will be uploaded as soon as possible.
