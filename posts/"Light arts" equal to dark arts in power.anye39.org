I use light arts for lack of a better term, but it seems like the good guys get the short in of the such regarding spell repetoire. The villains get the dark arts and all the dangerous, and sometimes cool, spells and curses that come with it. And the good guys, are left to rely on stunners, reductos, and the patronus.

Are there any fics with any interesting spells the good guys to use? They don't have to be labeled the "light arts." Even some advanced defensive spells would work, as protego can't block everything.


** This is not an answer - but the Dark Arts aren't costless. Using magic with the very visceral intent of hurt and pain leaves a cost on the soul. This isn't a metaphor but a very real condition - the health of the soul and emotions are deeply tied to magic. I think one of the best fics to explore this dichotomy is linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth). It looks like it's abandoned, but it's still a really good read.

*** In a time travel fic where Harry adopts Riddle, Dumbledore counters Grindelwalds demonic magic with "light magic" that also had a cost (extreme empathy/compassion).

It's also my headcanon which fits into Canon quite a bit.

** The closest I've seen to what you want, is white magic from linkffn(Mistakes and Second Chances) which is life magic or albumancy, as opposed to black magic, which is necromancy. Only actually becomes a factor 80% of the fic in, though.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.
