:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember if I read it on ao3 or fanfiction.net but I can't find this fic no matter how many searches I do for it and I hope someone knows what I am trying to find.

The Potters live and Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban and they generally have a "happy" existance.

Lily potter basically manipulates and abuses Harry into caring for his brother (don't remember if it was a twin, younger, older) over his own wellbeing and no one notices, including James, Sirius and Remus.

There was an instance when Harry was little and Lily tells him not to let anyone touch him and this goes on for like a month??? To the point where he is so touch starved and she "rewards" him by reaching out her hand and letting him come to her for physical affection.

I think he is sorted into Slytherin when they eventually arrive at school but I am unsure.

When Lily is finally confronted she is delusional and see's nothing wrong with her treatment of her children and James is devistated.

I don't really remember anything else that stands out about this particular fic unfortunately but any insight is appreciated!

*** Precisely. It is really a great series IMO. I'm on Book 5 right now. The author really turns so many of the cannon events on their head, and does a pretty good job with worldbuilding.
