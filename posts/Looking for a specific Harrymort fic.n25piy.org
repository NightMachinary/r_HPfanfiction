oKAY SO I've been looking for this one Harrymort fic for a while now. It's very dark last time I remember, but it's really good so I wanna find it

Continuing, Harry is kidnapped by Voldie, I don't remember how, and gets tied to a table at first? Harry tries to resists obviously so his wrists are all screwed up. Voldemort comes in and casts a spell that will keep him conscious until he casts the counter spell, tortures him and leaves. Turns out he forgot to cast the counter spell so there are REALLY GOOD descriptions of Harry hallucinating. It turns into a kinda hurt/comfort. Last I read it, it was on a03


** I've read this one but can't remember the name of it.

** I have read this! Damnit but I don't remember the name! I will do my best to find it. It was a soulmate fic wasn't it? Where Voldemort captures Harry and he touches the soulmark on his wrist, accidentally sealing the connection. He doesn't want anything to do with it and stays away. Harry being so isolated fucks him up and he stops eating. There is this one table which he thinks sometimes is on fire but it's just a hallucination. And eventually the hallucinations bleed over into Voldemorts mind as well. I remember a scene in which Harry is practically a goner and Voldemort sits next to him and they talk.

  Eleven year old Harry didn't know how he knew--he didn't even know what it was he knew--but as he stood in Olivander's shop with Hagrid, he vowed that he would never tell a soul about the two words written on his wrist.Avada Kedavra.---a story of souls told in three parts.
