Whether she is married with him or engaged isnt important, although i prefer the first one, unless the Fic contains they are engaged for a time after the war...if there is a War at all. Anyway, like in the Canon, she is happy with him, but then meets a Muggle (since we dont know many Muggles in Canon i prefer an OC) and step by step falls for him. Doesnt matter if the Fic contains sex scenes, but it would be good (not necessary) if the Muggle has some sort of "charming" hobby, like painting or musician. If there are no male Muggles, i would accept a female too.


** I think it would be fairly amusing if she fell for Vernon.
