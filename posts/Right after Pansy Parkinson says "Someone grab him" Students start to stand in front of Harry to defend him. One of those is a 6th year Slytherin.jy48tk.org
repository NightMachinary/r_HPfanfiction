[Haha, yes. Another prompt. These are fun].

He'd been helping the students in small ways all year. He's a pure blood and his family members are death eaters but he didn't share their beliefs and once Dumbledore died, he knew things would change. So, throughout the school year, he would give medical aid to the students after they would get done with detention and forbidden to go to the hospital wing, sneak food to students who were forbidden from eating a meal as part of their punishment, lie to the Carrows if they thought a student was misbehaving and he'd tell them otherwise, etc.

He tried to keep a low profile so he couldn't help as many students as he would have liked to.

He intended on fighting with his school that night, whether he was welcomed by everyone or not. Hogwarts was his home as well.


** Nooooooo! You missed an opportunity to have a Harry/Daphne prompt!!
