This is sort of funny because I saw someone else asking like the exact opposite of me today (fem!Harry with male pairing) but that just happens to be a complete coincidence. I came to this sub to request this when I saw the other post. Anyway, basically as it says, I haven't read much fem!Harry in the past and want to check it out but would prefer if he is paired with another girl. The only problem with that is most stories I've seen seem to have him (her) paired with Hermione and idk why but I'm not much of a Harry/Hermione fan. I'll take any and all suggestions that meet my criteria. Please let me know. Thanks!
