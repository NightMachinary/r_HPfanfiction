*** Only if it can duplicate their effects to a significant degree. For instance, I don't see a Boggart turning into a functional Nuke. It would assume its image, and I presume very likely attempt to duplicate its effect with magic, but as seen with the Boggart-Dementor, it struggles with strong magical effects.

It probably depends on if cognitohazards work in this universe, or if it basically has to "cheat" to create the effect. If they do exist, then you're fucked.

*** Off-topic, but why are Weeping Angels perceived as so scary? I mean the episode has an eerie/horror vibe to it, but I think Dementors are way scarier. A weeping angel will send you in the past and if you're lucky enough you might even live a decent rest of your life. Being stuck in Azkaban with wraiths constantly sucking every little oz of happiness and hope out of you and if you cross them they'll eat your soul so you won't even be able to move on to the afterlife... now that seems like hell.

First of all, they're feeding on your life force while you're in the past. They /eat/ all the years you would have lived. Second, they only send you to the past if they're hungry. If they're not, they snap your neck and/or torture you. And pictures or even /visual memories/ of them become actual Angels.

Also, they're known to trap victims in cells and send them back in time... to the same cell.
