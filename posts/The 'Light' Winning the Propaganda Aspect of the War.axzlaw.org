I've only seen this a couple of times, and I don't necessarily need the entire story to be about it, but can I get some stories where the Order and Trio and co. have the lead in winning the war of propaganda? I've seen a couple of stories have this be a clear effort on their part - even on seemingly small things like referring to Muggleborns as 'first-generation wizards' - such /The Marriage Law Revolution/ and /Reclamation of Black Magic/.
