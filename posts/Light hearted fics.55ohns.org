Any good ones? I need something light as I'm quite stressed at the moment.

(btw I usually like a Snape who manages to redeem himself)


** *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106)

  “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Severus Snape demanded.

  I said, "The Draught of Living Death."

  Severus sneered. "The Draught of Living Death, sir. Ten points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor."

  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

  "Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" he snapped.

  "The stomach of a goat, sir," I told him smugly.

  Severus' eye twitched with frustration. "Twenty points for smirking. What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

  "There is no difference. Would you like to hear its third name?"

  "Fifty points for your cheek!" Severus roared.

  That year, I was determined to singlehandedly win the House Cup.

  For Slytherin.”

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Well, here's "The Wendell That Wasn't."

Snape's ghost has to haunt Harry Potter for eternity. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The_Wendell_That_Wasnt]]

And here's "Dinner With the Weasleys." This one is very sweet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys]]

And "Promotion" features Ron teaching Hugo how to play chess.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11084248/1/Promotion]]

This one is not the best-written, but it has a certain charm to it nonetheless:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate]]

This one is poetry of a sort. More like drabble poetry. There are some light-hearted poems (Chapter 18--"Brothers") and some more serious, but there's still a layer of sweetness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487781/1/10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1]]

This one is written by the same genius who wrote "Not From Others."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982933/1/Aunt-Marge-s-Even-Bigger-Mistake]]

This one is also very nice--though I only recommend it if you're familiar with the "Weasley Girl" stories.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4173777][The Girl in the Kneakle Nightie]] is a super cute Drarry fic from Luna's POV. The Draco/Harry parts are very secondary in the story and it's not at all graphic if you're not into slash. What makes it great is that it's a true character study of Luna done expertly. So lighthearted and so lovely to read. Linkao3(4173777)
