Apparently the internship program was horrendously unfair at the Ministry.  What else is new. When Hermione Granger finds out that in order to get the internship of her dreams, she'll need to pay for the expensive tuition for them to, in their words “justify letting a muggleborn into the Ministries /esteemed/ program, she needs to find a job that will pay quick. Unfortunately, there aren't many jobs open to muggleborns. Fortunately, Hermione's morals were always looser than others.

  *Lucius:* It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to.\\
  *Draco:* Who? That fucking mudblood?\\
  *Lucius:* That "fucking mudblood"... is Hermione Granger. She once was an associate of ours. They call her "Baba Yaga."\\
  *Draco:* The Boogeyman?\\
  *Lucius:* Well, Hermione wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. She was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman.\\
  *Draco:* Oh.\\
  *Lucius:* Hermione is a witch of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw her kill three men at the Hog's Head... with a quill, with a fucking quill. Then suddenly one day she asked to leave. It's over a man, of course. So I made a deal with her. I gave her an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies she buried that day laid the foundation of what the Malfoys are now. And then my son, a few days after her husband died, you steal her broom and kill her /fucking Kneazle./

** Not quite the same, but there's a really great one where she's a professional thief to pay off debts.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
