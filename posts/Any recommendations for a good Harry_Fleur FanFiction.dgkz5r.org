I've sort of been on a craving for this lately. Preferably a decently long one with good plot I suppose. No overpowered Harry either. I really appreciate it!


** I had a similar post recently and got some recommendations. Haven't gone through them much yet. But I love The Half Blood Romantic.

*** Well, I read it. That was really awesome. I just wish it was either completed or it was updated. It dealt with Harry's emotions so well and just ugh. Well anyway, thank you and I really really hope that it gets updated soon

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

** linkffn(8135514) His Angel. One of, if not THE best romantic development Harry and Fleur get in a FanFic, the sad sing is:

1.- It's Discontinued

2.- The autor gives us a "final" and it hurts to read it, The best Fic with the saddest finale.

It's my favorite and the one I hate the most at the same time.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.
