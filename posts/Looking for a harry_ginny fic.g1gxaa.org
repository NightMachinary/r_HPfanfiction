:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In it harry somehow managed to get a note to himself on the day he left for hogwarts the first time. All the note said was something like "get to know ginny weasley" it caused the prophecy to retroactively change as well. Cant remember the name and it wasn't finished when i read it. Would like to see if it's been updated since
