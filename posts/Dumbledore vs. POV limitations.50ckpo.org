Something [[/u/Murky_Red]] mentioned in the 'what makes you drop a fic' thread, but that I've seen come up a lot in pet-peeve discussions is the Manipulative Dumbledore +...does it count as it's own trope now?+ Cliche.

My question: Does anyone have any advice/suggestions on how to write a well meaning and competent but not omniscient Dumbledore who really is doing his level best, but is /unfairly/ treated as being a manipulative bastard by the main character who is telling the story in first person?

If it matters, the main character in my story's case is Tom Riddle, freshly freed from the Diary and hell bent on not being stuck back in it so the option of /cooperating/ with /Dumbledore/ is utterly abhorrent to him, but I want the readers to know that it's /Thomas/ being unreasonable here, not Albus, even though the chapter consists of Thomas grumbling about the 'manipulative old goat' doing <something perfectly reasonable yet mildly inconvenient to Thomas's plans>

Also, on a related note, does that seem like something less prone to inducing anger in those who dislike reading manipulative Dumbledore?

But he's been Thomas for 9 chapters already

#+end_quote

And now I'm sad about that...

The good news is that /Thomas/ considers himself completely separate from Voldemort//Tom/ so the properly murderous Riddle will remain /Tom/. Thomas see's Voldemort as being like the parent that abandoned him (leaving him trapped in the diary for 50 years) and the other horcruxes as his siblings. Harry's scar gets him added to the list of siblings and starts a tug-of-war with Dumbledore over custody.

***** Ha. He actually already calls Voldemort his /mother/ specifically because he expects it to annoy him.

He had the surname Winters grafted onto him as a byproduct of the events that led to him abandoning his canon book 2 plans (Namely, he accidentally ate an SI) so he'll be referred to as "Mr. Winters" by most people. The last name is actually a reference to the very loosely related BTVS fic I write about a vampire named Jack Winters

Do you have a link to Literary High or is it unposted?

Jack spends a little while in story grumping about the last name listed on his driver's license being an obvious ploy to start shit between himself and the slayer. Then he gets hungry and wanders off to continue being a sociopathic monster of dubious sanity.

Yes. THAT is the word I wanted.

Any specific suggestions on writing Dumbledore correctly? My current rules are:

#+begin_example
  He doesn't lie, he just tells the truth from 'a certain point of view' when necessary
  He humblebrags/understates a lot, but with the intent of amusing his audience. (::Wears ridiculous robes:: "I daresay I'm somewhat memorable...")
  Will always know when Thomas is up to something, but not necessarily *what* he's up to.

**** These are elements of Dumbledore I like and use:

His skill as a legilimancer is so practiced, he does it nonverbally by accident, characterized either by twinkling eyes(which is verging on cliché itself) or a hitch of a frown when he finds he's being lied to.

He has a temper, usually held in check but it is there and it is terrible to behold when he lets loose.

He is subtle and not willing to exercise his political power except when forced to. But when forced to, he can reveal he knows a great many secrets that people like Skeeter would commit horrid war crimes to know.

he's addicted to LSD(lemon sherbet drops).

And for those thinking 'well tropes and cliches are the same thing' that's not exactly true. A trope is a storytelling element commonly enough known that if I say "first girl wins" or "You have outlived your usefulness" you know what that means whereas ManipulativeOldBastard!Dumbledore is a cliché in that its an element of a story that is overused, usually by people who rarely know better. They read a story where MOB!Dumbledore is a 'cool' element of the story in an indy!Harry and they decide to write their own story and since they can't see a reason for Harry to be independent, they reuse that element.

Granted, a /competently/ manipulative Dumbledore just face-rolls Harry or produces the canon outcome depending on if he's good or evil. But its REALLY frustrating when he's DESCRIBED as being a master manipulator and then... just twirls his mustache and acts like an idiot in story

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
