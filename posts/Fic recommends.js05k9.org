** I've been training my whole life for this moment. I'll make several comments because my total post is too long.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.

Post-Hogwarts

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. They are complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face.... It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20636933/chapters/49004756][Making Do]] is a story of a miserable, broken man who is forced to reckon with a world he never anticipated living long enough to see. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad Says"]] is an EWE. Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there. I thought the writing could tend a bit towards the melodramatic, but I also stayed up until 1:45 a.m. reading it all in one go, so I kinda have to recommend it :-P It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]], the consequences of Malfoy's petty act of revenge force him to actually engage with the world around him. Trust me. He hates it too. It is complete.
- In a similar vein, Draco acts the fool and gets himself stuck in a Groundhog Day situation in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]]. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the second result. Very good. It is complete.
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series is touching. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive. It is complete.
- Practically everyone has read this, but I would be remiss if I didn't include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It is almost universally beloved for its wit and originality. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is a very popular fic on this site. Honestly, the "ooh, I'm so dark for doing morally grey things" bit kinda wears on me, but I read it and enjoyed it well enough that I think it's worth a rec. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]], Harry is training to be a Healer and rotating through departments. He ends up in Chemical Dependence (basically rehab). An old rival is currently running the department and Harry is forced to face old wounds. It is complete
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]] is the polar opposite of the last one. This is a dark mystery wherein Harry is trying to find his wife's killer. It is complete.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- Edited to add: In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]], Harry gets a glimpse of a world where he made different choices. It is Drarry and epilogue-compliant. Complete

Etc.

- This is by the author of a very famous fic, A Black Comedy (recommendation in the following section). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] is almost like a series of one-shots wherein Harry pops across dimensions killing Voldemorts as he goes. It's a crackfic and, like nonjon's more famous work, can be a bit... problematic at times, but is still generally a good read. It is generally but not exclusively set in Harry's Hogwarts Years, so I put it in the etc. section.
- Difficult to place this one ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]) in time. Harry made a bargain with Time to defeat Voldemort. Every time he dies, he jumps back to the summer Sirius died. I gobbled it up the first time I read through, but is less good on the reread. That said, it definitely picks up from the first few chapters. The author has recently completed the sequel.

To find these, I went through my old favorites and read history on both FFN and AO3. Here are a few that I bookmarked/favorited but don't remember too much of the story.

*** I want to add [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]] to this list. I absolutely loved this one, but I read it before creating an AO3 account so I couldn't find it to recommend it earlier. Some lovely people on this sub were willing and able to assist me. This fic is both (mostly) epilogue compliant and Drarry! I think the less you know the more you'll like it, but I'll put a brief summary under a spoiler tag if you don't want to enter blind. Harry is sleepwalking through life with his epilogue kids. He helps someone who "repays" him by dropping him into a universe where he and Draco are together.

** I've been training my whole life for this moment. I'll make several comments because my total post is too long.

One-shots

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13502309/1/Molly-Weasley-and-the-Second-Cousin][Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin]] is the true story of her Squib accountant cousin.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] is a little similar in that a character is part of the Muggle underworld.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7432218/olivieblake][OlivieBlake]] has two series of one-shots, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12337045/1/Draught-of-Living-Death][Draught of Living Death]] for the darker side and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995576/1/Amortentia][Amortentia]] for light fluff. I loved the Draught of Living Death, but I never truly grew out of my emo goth stage in high school. *shruggies*
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] isn't the best written, tbh, but I really appreciated the concept. It's basically examining how the wizards relying on memory altering to hide their world affects the Muggles in their path.
- In a similar vein (i.e., not the best written, but an interesting concept), I present to you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents][Hermione Granger and The Obliviated Parents]]. It's a oneshot from Hermione's parents' perspective twenty years after the war looking back on how Hermione's obliviation affected their relationship.
- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]], Harry ends up in a different universe where he's not the BWL. It's not the main focus of the story, though. The story is more about broken people healing.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] is from Dudley's POV. It won the Quibbler Awards (not sure what that is, but included in case it's relevant). In this, Dudley reads a story with an abusive family and, through it, is able to realize that his own family was abusive to Harry. Vernon and Petunia do not take this realization well.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3052359/1/To-Live-Nobly][To Live Nobly]] is an AU in which the Dark Lord wins. Our protagonist is sleepwalking through life. A chance meeting with a familiar face wakes him up...
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1712551/1/Folly][Folly]] is an ancient one-shot from 2004 when I was super active in the fandom ('tis true, I am a relic of The Old Days before anyone had even heard of horcruxes). It's Snape's POV on Harry post OotP. Maybe a little emo, but we must respect the old traditions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1089507/1/Je-Te-Plumerais][Je Te Plumerais]] was written in 2002. (A moment of silence for bygone times. This fic was published a mere two weeks after the release of the Chamber of Secrets film.) Harry and a Death Eater are caged together. At least one of them goes a bit mad. There are two more one-shots written in this universe.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is a gem. In this amusing fic, Harry must buy a toilet. Who comes to the appointment but Malfoy, Lord of Toilets. (this came from a prompt)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks.

#+begin_quote
  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.
#+end_quote

- By the same author in the same "what if series" comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][the girl who lived (again)]]. In this case (again) refers to the fact that the author had previously put out a girl who lived in this same what if line. Anyway, here's the first few sentences that should summarize it: "When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy."
- same author in what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him.
- same author, same what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]]: what if Petunia really and truly took in Harry. "

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).

  Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
#+end_quote

​

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/359705][Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day]] is an 8th year Hogwarts fic. It's by Faith Wood. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, she has three of the top ten stories. Draco comes to with an injured, unconscious Harry Potter in the middle of the Forbidden Forest and without any memory of how he got there.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the number one result. I quite resisted reading it for a while. I thought the summary sounded unbearably dumb. But then I caved. And so did mah heart. Check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] for an 8th year fluffy oneshot by a very popular and prolific author.

** I've been training my whole life for this moment. I'll make several comments because my total post is too long.

Fics set during Marauders' Time

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It is complete and has a sequel

During Harry's Hogwarts Years

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is an AU wherein Sirius never went to Azkaban (for reasons explained in-text). Harry spends his days going to Sirius' bookshop until Sirius discovers canon-level abuse and steals Harry away. There are consequences. Sadly, the author is unfinished, but they got up to year 3, so I think it's still worth a read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]] is another one that's probably abandoned but worth reading anyway. In this one, Lockhart accidentally crosses paths with Sirius on November 1st, 1981. Recognizing the PR opportunity, Lockhart decides to raise Harry and obliviates Sirius.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25925863/chapters/63012685][Realizations]] was one of the first fics that got me in the fandom. The author dropped it ten years ago and is coming back to it this year and reworking it. It was originally published between book 5 and 6. WIP
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned). It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is a Snape/Harry mentor story. I like this one because Snape is still a bastard, but he's not the kind of bastard that can watch a kid get abused (canon levels) and do nothing. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- In the world of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][Grey Space]], students get Hogwarts letters at 14. I honestly think that the less you know the better. I love the writing style and it has my favorite kind of magic: homespun rituals (like Life Skills Outside the Curriculum). It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][The Accidental Animagus]] universe is still being updated. Harry escapes the Dursleys with accidental magic and ends up at the Grangers. Frequently recommended. The author has a great expansion on the Magical World.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. (complete)
- I know this one is hella famous and even more controversial, but if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], you should give it a try. If you don't like it by, say, chapter ten, then it's not for you. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] is a crackfic wherein Harry is very nearly a squib. He has to be cunning to get by. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is a little aged, tbh. The author hasn't updated in a few years, but true love lasts a lifetime. This is a bit of a rough read, but all the worst stuff is in the first chapter. Basically, the Dursleys turned Harry against magic and he kind of has a house elf mentality.
- I loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12959277/1/Paradox][Paradox]]. It's got stabby Hermione from an alternate universe, dimension hopping to a universe where Grindelwald rules, and an engaging plot. What else could you want? It is complete.
- Edit to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]: Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys, forcing an impromptu visit supervised by Snape. How will Snape react to seeing Harry's treatment by the Dursleys? In ways that are not out of character but also not super dickish. Complete with one sequel complete and another in the works.
- Edited to add: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge. COMPLETE.
- Edited to add: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. I'm embarrassed I didn't include this before, probably because it's just so well known. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
- Edited to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Definitely recommend this one.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
