Magical Families are supposed to be a small group, purebloods know most of them. Therefore, it seems like an unnecessary extra layer to have a Pince and a Prince family, as well as a Davies and a Davis family. I totally plan to change Tracey's last name to Davies and make her a cousin from Roger, also the librarian is going to be Madam Prince now and even a farther cousin from Snape. Any canon objections? I know people can make Snape a half human, half unicorn wizard in fics if they want to, but I want to stay close to canon here. Any thing in canon that hints to this not being possible?

Bonus questions:

- Do you think this was intentional on JKR's side or was it a typo and she decided to stay with it? Seems so for the Davies-Davis, but I think on the Pince-Prince she maybe tried to make Snape and the librarian related but she needed Snape's last name to be Prince and she had already written the librarian as Pince for 5 books by then.

- Any other similar last names I am missing?


** Name meanings and impressions would be my objection. Names are a huge part of how JKR does characterization. (Remus Lupin is a werewolf. Sirius Black is a dog from an evil family. Severus Snape is severe and snappish. Et cetera, et cetera.)

Davis and Davies come from the same word and have the same meaning: "son of David". (David's = Davie's = Davies) I find it completely believable that they're related and just spell their name differently. If you look back through my IRL genealogy, you'll find Rider, Ryder, and Ridor. Plus the canon... impression, for lack of a better word... of the names is similar: they're both sort of boring background names.

Pince and Prince are two different names with two different meanings. Prince comes from Latin /princeps/, meaning "first". Pince comes from Latin /pinciare/, meaning "pinch, sting". The canon impression of the name Pince calls to mind both pince-nez glasses and pincers, which fit with a stern librarian. The canon impression of Prince is royalty, characterizing the family that rejected Snape as wealthy and respected, and characterizing Snape as secretly noble and heroic.

Although both Pince and Prince come from Latin, so... I guess? Maybe? ...nope, it's not working for me.

** I feel like Pince/Prince is more of an oversight, just because they both work at the same school. If Madam Pince had been a character who worked elsewhere I can see her being intended to be a relation, but JKR's writing in my view doesn't trend towards coincidences of that nature.

** Why would that be a typo? Plenty of people have different but similar sounding names. I'm really not following the logic there. Also, plenty of people are related without having the same name. If your father's sister married a dude that wasn't also her brother and took his name, your cousins wouldn't have the same last name as you.

I imagine the only real canon objection would be the fact that they have different names and aren't related, but that's what you're changing so that note is irrelevant. You'd also have to make Roger and Tracey's male parents brothers, if you're following standard European marital-naming conventions.

*** Typo not because of in-universe explanation. I know plenty people have similar names. It just feels like an action against narrative simplicity to have 2 background characters with last names almost identical, so it has a feeling of not a councious decision.

**** I mean, knowing Rowling's general pattern, she probably made the names up in her usual plot-relevant-description-reference way at different times without intending them to actually be similar and just didn't go back to check the first when she made up the second. So, yeah, I really don't think Snape and Irma Pince were intended to be related and she just misspelled one name, if that's what you're asking. She just made them up to be appropriate to her characters and they were coincidentally similar, most likely. Though saying that, her name does Anagram out to 'I am Prince' and they do both have hooked noses, so...

And well, random unrelated people having similar names is a lot more narratively simple than "Snape and Irma are distantly related but against all odds still have the same last name" because then you have to write that relationship into the narrative. If they're just random people with similar names (which Rowling mostly picked for some referential-descriptive purpose - a la Remus Lupin the Werewolf) then that's less plot justification to write.

***** I was thinking on going with the trio not actually knowing they are related. After all, they don't know Snape is a Prince until much later .

Not sure if there's any interaction between them in the books which doesn't work with them being related.

That's something which would be important to know.

****** Not necessarily. If Pince was actually related to Snape's mother, then she could be one of the family who disapproved of the whole marrying-a-Muggle thing and thus cut ties. Snape didn't exactly grow up a Prince and/or really knowing the Prince family, so if you were to go that route, it's plausible Snape himself might not even know they were related.

Or he was just his usual bitter angry dickbag self about the whole situation. If you were stuck in a single environment where you regularly shared space with a distant relative who'd abandoned your mother, would you not go out of your way to not interact with and otherwise avoid them wherever you could?

But yeah, plenty of people don't interact with the people they're related to, especially those in a... complicated family situation like Snape had. Sharing genetics with someone and not interacting with them definitely aren't self-exclusive.

The only book 'interaction' where Prince and Pince 'intersected' that I remember is Pince noticing Harry with the Prince's Book and getting mad at a book being written in, though I don't know if she ever registered the title or not. But I'm really not a canon-knowledgeable person, so there could be hundreds more I don't remember. I haven't read the books since the last one came out, so it's been awhile. :D

******** Fair enough. Well, either way, you can go with whatever you wanna do.

Just remember, if they are 'distant cousins' of similar ages, Snape's grandfather would have to have a brother who had a son for them to have the same name by standard European Marriage-Naming Conventions and that would only make Irma his second cousin. Third cousin would be the same with great-grandparents and great-granduncles and with two generations of sons for them to have the same name. If you get into cousins-removed, then you'd need to change the ages as you go more generations away from Snape's. So, y'know, keep that in mind if you plan to go into how Snape and Irma are related.

Google 'cousin chart' and look at the family search one, if you want a good visual reference for how that works.

***** Not really. If neither of them going to be plot relevant and their names aren't going to be relevant, then having people like that makes people think they are related when they're not. It adds an unnecessary confusion prone layer.

Having them be cousins doesn't make them more inbred. Actually I am trying to make the world smaller as it is supposed to be. After all Magical families in uk should be few enough for purebloods to know them all.

******* Not necessarily. There are plenty of other families around. Tracey was already a halfblood. I'm only changing the fanon concept of her father being a muggleborn/muggle to being her mother, having her father be a wizard with Davies lastname.

About Madam Pince... I would only make her more inbreed if her mother was in any way related to the Princes... which we have no evidence for that in the books. Her father could very well be a Prince and her mother have no relation with a Prince for as many generations as she can track.

** Not canon but reality: Davies is the 2nd most common last name in Wales and much more common than Davis in the UK as a whole. It's common enough that having more than one unrelated Davies family is plausible, let alone an unrelated Davis. JKR's original classlist had Tracey Davis as a halfblood and Roger Davies background is unknown. I doubt it was typo--she probably named them separately and neither character was worth renaming.

That being said, they are absurdly minor characters that are almost blank slates--do what you want, it's fanfiction!

** You don't have to incorporate this in your story, but in real life, because of mishearing or bad handwriting (and wizards seem to write everything by hand), it's actually not uncommon for names to be misspelled in birth certificates (and I'm guessing wizards might have a thing about True Names and stuff), so Davis and Davies could very well be the same family without even changing anything. I had some (old people, mostly) in my family with a slightly different last name because of that, and at least one of them I know passed it on to his kids lol

But nothing is technically stopping you as Tracey Davies never actually appears in the series.
