Have you seen a recently-updated fic that shows promise in becoming great? I've been trolling the recently updated on fanfiction.net and found some hidden gems, but I don't want to miss anything good. linkffn(11103734) is a good example. I have no idea how it doesn't have more reviews. I want to snuggle it.

  "... The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky... Some say---" "It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead." ---POTC quote. The Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs. Warnings inside. AU-ish.

*** I follow it as well, but the humour, in my opinion, feels forced and repetitive... The story is interesting, but Ron's friendship with other Slytherins and constant (stupid) jokes are tiresome. For example, he always tries to kind of annoy Daphne by calling her 'my lady' and she is always hitting him or something. "She sat beside me and gently pinched my arm. "Ah, yes. My lady's pinch. How I missed it."" . Too much of those.

Still, the grievance is valid. The title of the thread is "Most Promising Up-and-Coming Fanfiction". I think that it's entirely reasonable to expect a minimum standard of polish in regards to spelling, grammar, and (maybe...?) formatting.

To be completely fair, the fic in question has been linked more than once in this subreddit, and I've repeatedly forgotten how difficult it was to read the first chapter each time. It's an unsavoury thing to say, but it frankly doesn't stand up to many of the other recommendations made within this thread.

********** I don't disagree with you about the issues with the story, punctuation in particular, though the author does improve as the story goes on. As I stated earlier though, I look for interesting stories and characters and unique ideas. I'm not an English teacher. I want something that's exciting with characters I can find myself cheering for or empathizing with. TheBlack'sResurgance did that with Honour Thy Blood and I expect he'll do it again in Stepping Back.

The stories recommended so far include a slash, a fem Harry, and a next gen story, all categories that I don't enjoy. Two others were published in March of 2015, which I think disqualify them from up and coming. I actually like Grow Young with Me even though it doesn't check most of the boxes I typically enjoy, but I don't think it counts for this category since it was published almost two years ago. There's a completed two-shot, which by definition can't show promise. It's finished. It's either good or it isn't already. There's a story by a fairly established author, White Squirrel, which fits in a sense, but it seems unfair to classify their work as up and coming. I think they've already arrived. I've also read The Red Knight and other users have pointed out its flaws without attacking the writer (which I'm not accusing you of, I wouldn't have taken issue with your comments because you didn't personally attack the writer for no reason).

That leaves exactly one other recommendation. Other people have different opinions and I accept and embrace that, but if I had clicked on this thread I would have been disappointed with the recommendations. I added my own, a story by an author that I think has creative ideas and who recently finished a story with a lot of action, a good plot that doesn't get bogged down in subplots and tedious side stories. It's also increasingly rare to find a Dumbledore character who isn't either bad or incompetent. I found his Dumbledore to be a refreshing change. I think his next story has a lot of potential, particularly because I don't know that anybody has done a Harry/Bellatrix story that I've truly enjoyed from start to finish and I'm curious to see if he can do it. I don't give a shit about missing commas and random apostrophes, I just want to be entertained.

I don't think it ever gets this far if you had been the one to originally reply. I think your criticisms of the author's first story are fair and I understand if it doesn't meet your expectations. But you said it without saying that the author is shit, which is where all this came from. I really hate people who hide behind user names and insult others, especially somebody who has taken the time to write 300,000 words.

***** This... So much this. I don't think most people understand that the writing is fun for some people, and not a job. It's more about the idea, and creating your own thing, than hours of editing. I try to keep my stories clean of grammatical errors, but I'm not perfect and the same is true for many of the writers on FFN. I once had a review with a copied link to a site with the correct usage of Mrs. versus Ms. My story was "unreadable due to the lack of knowledge of the English language." I giggled a bit, but the point still stands. Most people don't do fan fiction to be a professional author, but rather because it is something they enjoy.

***** There's a difference between not expecting perfect grammar and a story having enough errors to seriously impede readability and flow. It shouldn't be asking too much for an author to know to end declarative sentences in dialogue with a period or comma before the ending quotation mark.

That the author hasn't figured that out in the span of over three hundred thousand words is baffling and that you think [[/u/lord_geryon][u/lord_geryon]] is asking for too much in finding that problematic is puzzling.

This isn't asking a random fanfiction author to know the minutiae regarding omitting commas in correlative conjunctions; this is just expecting one of the most basic things about grammatically correct dialogue to be present.

** Does linkffn(Grow Young With Me) still count? Because it's absolutely incredible, and the author only has one other fic with only a couple hundred reviews. It's about Harry and a muggle woman named Abigail Waters, after Harry has gone through an incredible tragedy.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Lily Luna Potter is one of the magical world's most prominent legal experts. As a student of law, she learned the right thing is not just hard to do, but hard to identify. When laws both magical and Muggle are brought into question, she'll have to figure it out fast. *Sequel to the Albus Potter series on this profile. Reading it first is not necessary but very highly recommended.*
