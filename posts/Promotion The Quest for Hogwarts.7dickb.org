  Pre-Hogwarts. Harry has been tasked with a quest by his Aunt Petunia to discover himself and who he is as well as find the school which he will be attending. (If this fic had a song, it would Mordred's Lullaby, by Heather Dale. No Beta, but fixing chapters as I go along while posting. Chp. 1-8 fixed)
