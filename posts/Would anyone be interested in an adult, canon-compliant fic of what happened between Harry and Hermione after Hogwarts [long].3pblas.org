As the title says. I've been writing this piece in my spare time for a whole month now. It's over 100 pages, although it was supposed to be a short story (around 5000 words). I never really understood The Goddess' reasoning to keep Harry and Mione apart, although after reading [[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/02/showbiz/rowling-hermione-ron-revelation/][her own words on the matter]], I couldn't really blame her.

However, it was evident that Harry and Hermione were made for each other. A perfect pair, really. JK admits that "it would be very difficult for Ron to make Hermione happy", and I would LOVE to read anyone who /honestly/ disagrees, as long as it is well fundamented.

So, since I take relationships in books very seriously (not so much in real life), and since I follow Brandon Sanderson's advice of "take something that you love, but didn't go as you expected, and fix it", I decided to write a post-Hogwarts fanfic of Harry's and Hermione's lives.

I'm a realist at heart, and so you shouldn't expect sugar coating. I deal with very complicated matters in this story (moral and others), and that's why I'm asking if anyone would be interested.

Thanks a lot for your patience.


** If there's one thing I've learned about Harry Potter fanfiction, it is that there is a market for pretty much anything. Especially if it's well written and realistic. And there seems to be a decent sized h/hr sect of fans still that would likely enjoy and seem to enjoy other stories in this vein.

So I'd say go for it!

** Just because Ron and Hermione fall apart, doesn't mean she and Harry will get together.

Harry trusted, respected, but never liked Hermione in the book, the amount of Harry's unflattering thoughts about her appearance and behaviors are just too many. Then during that 2 months camping trip alone together, Harry didn't try ONCE to comfort her, as he was brooding in one corner while she was crying in the other. Even I think it's kind too cruel from him (or JK Rowling), and I liked the dance scene in the movie.

Now compare the above to Harry's thoughts about Ginny in the books. There are not that many, but each of them was highly positive, even her flaws were viewed through rose-painted glasses. Adding on top of that, they both shared the experience of Voldemort's possession, love of Quidditch, similar wicked sense of humor, and many other qualities.

If you really want to write a credible post-war Harmony story, the only way I see is to remove Ginny from Harry's life, either through death, incapacitation, or a complete change in Ginny's character.

JK also said about H/Hr shippers "they need to go back and reread, I think." and that she "dropped anvil-sized hints" about Ron/Hermione ever since PoA. If you think Harry would make Hermione happy as a boyfriend, you completely missed all their interactions.

Harry doesn't actually seems to like Hermione very much as a person - he constantly lies to her, ignores her, doesn't enjoy her company, isn't attracted to her, and wishes she'd shut up. At one point he tells Hedwig to puncture her hands, and when he sees the results, he doesn't feel sorry at all. See [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html][this article]] for explanation. They make a good team, but "made for each other"? P-L-E-A-S-E.

So, no, I am not interested in post-canon story about them, because as I see it, they would not be very good friends without all the troubles they had to face together.

*** Unfortunately, I cannot agree with you. In Book 6, for instance, you see Harry and Hermione arguing about Felix Felicis, and you can clearly see the two have an amazing chemistry. Also, that goes without saying from when Harry tries to cheer Hermione up after she sees Ron and Lavender being unpleasant. But those are minor details. Here's the real thing: You see, on Book 7 it became clear that Harry and Hermione would be happy together. After Ron left them, the two barely spoke, but everything was already implied and understood between them, even when they decided to go to Godric's Hollow. They would hold hands and simply go, not a single word spoken. This is important because that was the first time we could actually see Harry and Hermione interacting without anyone being a nuisance to them. Harry was still angry at Ron, and so he really didn't care if Ron's feelings got hurt. He's been known to forget important things (including his friendships) when he gets angry/mad. My point is: what we saw on Book 7 was a clear indication that the two of them would be better together. The couple simply makes sense from a literary and human perspective. Here I quote JK Rowling, Supreme Goddess of All Things:

"I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfilment. That's how it was conceived, really.

*and*

“For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."

And I also quote Emma Watson:

"I think there are fans out there who know that too and who wonder whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy."

Also, I quote you, my fine person-on-the-web:

"Harry doesn't actually seems to like Hermione very much as a person - he constantly lies to her, ignores her, doesn't enjoy her company, isn't attracted to her, and wishes she'd shut up. At one point he tells Hedwig to puncture her hands, and when he sees the results, he doesn't feel sorry at all."

I can't recall when Harry didn't enjoy Hermione's company. Englighten me, if you would be so kind? As for the "telling Hedwig to puncture her hands", do please remember that that was on Book 5, where Harry was beginning the transition into adolescence. Also, he was being influence by Lord Voldemort himself, as Dumbledore pointed by the end of the book. So the "puncturing of the hands" has nothing to do with not-liking a person.

To end this post, I must also point out that I smiled a little by your description of why they would never be together. My fianceé and I were exactly like that. In fact, most couples are at first.

As a final addendum: remember, please, that JK said she wrote R/H as a form of wish fulfilment. That's precisely the point I'm trying to make: the intentional hints (it's called 'foreshadowing' in writer's jargon) of what was to come between the two of them were precisely that - intentional. She /wanted/ to direct the plot towards the ending she had in mind, and simply ignored the natural development of the characters.

Also, since we can't see what happened to them after-Hogwarts, I decided to write it myself. I think Harry and Hermione deserve a shot at happiness, even fictional, as it were.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Did you even bother reading the article I linked? it presents multiple occurrences where Harry suffers Hermione's company. I can't paste it here, because the list is just so long and detailed.

As for chemistry, I think they do make a good team, but the same doesn't apply to a relationship. I don't know about you, but if there was a girl I was attracted to or in love with, I wouldn't hurt, ignore, and avoid her like Harry does to Hermione. He's simply not interested in her that way. In fact, he's not interested in her at all - whenever something happens to her - like Krum, or the SPEW thing - it's Ron who gets emotional about this, Harry just says "that's nice". You talk about foreshadowing - well, /that's/ foreshadowing. It foreshadows that he just doesn't care about her romantically.

J.K Rowling might have wrote R/H as a form of wish-fulfillment, but tell me, are you not doing the same? why are you so insistent about them when there isn't a shred of evidence in canon that they could function as a loving couple? you say you and your fiancee were "exactly like that", but, guess what, you are not Harry and your fiancee isn't Hermione - they have different personalities and react to situations differently.

Hermione might not be happy with Ron, but she certainly would not be happy with Harry, and neither will he with her. Please read the [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html][article]] in full before continuing this debate, because my reasoning lies in the facts presented in it.

***** I hate to be a buzzkill here, but all of this evidence, for either side, is from Harry and Hermione during their Hogwarts years. I agree that Harry has no romantic interest in Hermione in the books, but they're teenagers. From what I've been seeing, it looks like [[/u/Lord_Avan]] is writing a fic taking place when Harry and Hermione are adults. Beside literally one or two lines they share in the Epilogue, we know almost nothing about Harry and Hermione's relationship when they're adults. Now, I'm not suggesting they're carrying on a torrid affair in canon, but it's entirely possible for two people who aren't attracted to each other as teens to be so when they've grow up, so long as there's believable character build up to it.

****** Well, that's the point of fanfiction, isn't it? to bend canon and create non-canonical events, so Lord_Avan certainly has the right to imagine that, at some point in the future, both Harry and Hermione changed their personalities in a way that would make them fit together. It has as much merit as the idea that, at some point in the future, Harry's personality changed in a way that made him and Draco Malfoy compatible, and that little nod they shared was a secret nod to their upcoming night of love-making. Everything is possible. My argument is that nothing in /canon/ alludes to it, contrary to OP's statement that they were "made for each other" - not saying that it /can't/ happen, but that from what we were shown, they are not suited. But, of course, a lot of fans prefer to ignore what we were shown, in favour of what their imagination shows them.

Holy false equivalency batman! There's a pretty significant difference between two platonic best friends falling in love with each other when they're adults and two straight characters who hate each other turning gay and falling in love when they're adults.

FWIW, I agree there; given what little we see of Harry in the epilogue, I could possibly see him and Hermione as compatible (assuming she hasn't changed significantly from when we last saw her), but I don't think there's a terrible amount of evidence suggesting in canon, bar an inkling of possibility during DH.

** No... sorry, but anything that doesn't at least ignore the epilogue would be just frustrating for me to read. Ron shows in the epilogue that he still hasn't matured and that he doesn't respect Hermione enough not to lie to her. It also shows Hermione is either in complete denial or still hasn't wised up regarding social interactions.

Hermione wanted equal rights for house elves yet she is married to someone who manipulates the mind of a muggle to get what he wants (and thinks it's funny). I don't think that is either a happy or a healthy relationship.

There are probably plenty of people interested in it, but since you asked, I thought I'd give my reason for why I wouldn't read it. The epilogue (and parts of book 6 and 7) are what originally made me want to read fanfiction. I wanted to see my favorite character (Hermione) have a genuine happily ever after.

** As much as I'm definitely on the canon side of this argument, sounds like a good read, and it's not like that ship only appeals to a niche audience.

I would read it if the nickname 'Mione' was never used. Ever. Overdone and ruins a perfectly acceptable name.

** So it'd be H/R, right? because that's what's fucking canon. I can see Harry and Hermione having 'adult' conversations about whatever Hermione is doing for creature rights, or about interesting cases Harry's been involved in as an Auror. That's 'adult', right?

*** I'm afraid I can't see the need for "fucking" on your post, sorry. As far as I'm concerned, 'canon-compliant fanfiction' begins where the official story ends. As long as everything that's happened in the past remains "having happened", the rest is up to the author.

**** meh. I just can't see reasonable character development that would be compliant with the epilogue AND result in 'the one true ship'. Ron, and even moreso Ginny, wouldn't put up with that .

"Hey, Ginny! My wife is cheating on me with your husband!" says Ron, as he realizes the love of his life; the person for whom he forced himself to actually grow into maturity for; is cheating on him with his LITERAL best friend - a man with which he has shared almost everything since he got on the Hogwarts train so many years ago.

/Ginny literally breaks down into a miserable wreck/

Violent sobs begin to shake Mrs. Potter as she feels the betrayal of a love that was not for the Boy-Who-Lived, but for Harry James Potter - the boy who actually valued her as a competent companion and not just a pretty face, who was best friends with Ron, who supported her Quidditch career and in so many other ways. Even when he left in sixth year without her, she knew he cared so much for her. Her sobbing turns to violent wails as she realizes a foundation of her life is ripped away from her.

/so does Ron/

And then hopefully H/Hr both realize "Oh darn, cheating on my fiancee/husband/wife is pretty terrible. Especially when the entire Weasley family has completely accepted them as family, and they've (I'm assuming) done nothing to either of us to deserve this humiliating betrayal."

I simply can't see any possibility that Ron or Ginny would be able to forgive H/Hr for their (in my opinion) terrible behavior, and I can't say that they should. Because of this, Epilogue wouldn't happen. Epilogue is canon. H/Hr whirlwind romance/torrid affair /probably/ (I honestly guarantee) wouldn't be canon-compliant.

(and I *suppose* the language could be avoided. But I did like the emphasis it gave.)
