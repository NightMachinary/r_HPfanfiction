She learns that Santa Claus, far from being a Muggle myth, is a real entity who uses house elves to build his toys year round. Obviously, she then goes on the warpath against Santa in a gritty noir investigative type fic, culminating in a final epic battle with Ol Saint Nick himself. Bonus points for Ron and others breaking into her gritty noir monologues to ask her what she wants for dinner or if she can make it to Teddy's birthday party on Saturday.
