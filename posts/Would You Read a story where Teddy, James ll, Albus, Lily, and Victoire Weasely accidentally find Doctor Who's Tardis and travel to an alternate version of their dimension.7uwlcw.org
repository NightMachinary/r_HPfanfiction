** Yes, way better than the Cursed Child.

I mean it doesn't even have to be Tardis, Al could have found the Resurrection Stone and it reacted with something else to trigger their dimensional travel.

They could have adventures and meet interesting people in universes depicted in other fanfics, such as the Bellatrix in Delenda Est, the Dark Trio in The Sum of Their Parts, or Emperor Henry I of the European Empire. Scorpius Malfoy would be especially shocked to meet the head of the imperial guard Astoria Greengrass.

*** I have avoided all TCC knowledge very well so far, but please: is there time travel in it or something?

**** It's basically Back to the Future 2 on steroid, along with tons of contractions to the Books and OOC developments.

** Depends on whether or not the main canon characters play a big role or not. I'm not really interested in the next gen.

** No, next-gen is awful.

[I will never understand why people latched on to the worst part - the epilogue - of the worst book - deathly hallows - in such a way]

** I honestly wouldn't but that's just because I have very little interest in the characters you mentioned. But there's always an audience for every type of story. If you feel willing to write it, then do so.
