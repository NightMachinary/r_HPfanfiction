** It is definitely a good idea if you dont wan't some discussion about plot holes in your fic

If you need help with plot holes i can help you but i probably can't help you with typo's because i am not that good in english

** If you write quickly (a chapter every week or two or something) then a beta reader is probably a good idea. If you write like I do (take three months on a chapter, then spend another two weeks after the initial post rewriting it again to clean it up) then any plot holes will probably be caught by you during editing or rewriting. Anyways, cheers

*** Ok, thanks. So far, I've been writing fast - I've got about 3.5 chapters written (22k words) from this week. It's going to slow down a bit though as I had two days off this past week. I'm planning on posting every other week to give myself some buffer for revision.
