** The stories are unfortunately mostly incomplete novels from way back when, as the lists have been mostly the same since when I first joined the site in 2008 and the site hasn't been as active since the HP fandom heydays. But there are some great still-active authors who have managed to break the top 10 in recent years :) I recall there being a lot more terribly written Draco/Hermione last time I looked.

*** As a regular on the site for the past year and a half, I agree with mostly everything you say. The "best of" list is pretty much static at this point. Unless JKR writes some more books, the site will never again be able to generate enough traffic to knock stories like /Delicate/ -- which is really, /really/ good, by the way -- from their perch. I've seen it suggested to the site owner and staff that the "best of" page be modified to give more recent stories a chance, but there just isn't much enthusiasm for change. The site's back-end code seems to be a bit fragile, and every time there's an update it's like playing with fire.

The page for [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/getinfo.php?page=dobbys][Dobby Award Winners]] is a little more current, although it still hasn't been updated for the 2012 winners.

**** I suggested the same before, too! I think it comes up pretty often. I'm supposing they don't save monthly hits, and reads all go in one data field. I suggested sort by read count a long way back too, but they said something about it'd be too much of a load to constantly recalculate, and I guessed that might actually be the reason the never fixed the read count 'bug', where the total # of read counts on a story don't update until you make changes to a chapter, because that means less updates to the database.
