It was Lily's magic that saved him. Harry did nothing, because he was an infant. Lily, a Muggleborn, defeated Voldemort postmortem.


** Because Lily's contribution, major as it is, is actually very subtle. Most parents would protect their kids so the average person wouldn't find her actions to be extraordinary. The only difference is hers had consequences that were great for a lot of other people.

** The wizarding world has not been proven to be the brightest of bulbs. They believe whatever is printed in the papers. In this case, the Daily Profit announced that it was Harry. This is a simple and easy to understand explanation, so it was accepted by the wizarding populace.

‚Äã

I have a head canon that Dumbledore deliberately spread this in order to hide the true way Voldemort was defeated. That way no one else would know about the blood protection that Harry received from Lily. Like an added layer of security.

I think the same can be said of all people. It takes effort to be skeptical which unfortunately hasn't been something taught to most.

** He was the only one to survive. No one credited Ollivander with Voldemort's defeat either, even if it was his wand.

I like to think it was a bit of misogynistic blood-purity, too. Lily was muggleborn but Harry was half-blood at worst and the scion of an old pureblood house at best. A muggleborn couldn't /possibly/ have defeated Voldemort...

**** My headcanon has no textual basis? Huh, whodathunk ü§î

More seriously: Purebloods have patriarchal families instead of inheriting the 'best' (most pureblood, most famous, etc) family name or instead of passing on both pureblood names by having one child with the paternal surname and another with the maternal. The Blacks are almost completely wiped out just because of of their name carries were women and thus lost their Most Ancient and Noble House's name.

That looks like a lot of misogyny.

***** "By the late twentieth century, the House of Black had become extinct in the male line with the deaths of Sirius and Regulus Black, neither of whom had children. The female line continued through the Malfoy family, Teddy Lupin and through Delphini who was Bellatrix's illegitimate daughter"

Sirius is the only one to ever say anything about "noble/ ancient house" and he says: the ‚ÄúNoble and Most Ancient House‚Äù of Black. Which would indicate it's purely his house's belief, not one echoed by anyone else. Especially to his derision of it, if it were a common thing, he'd probably be more accepting of this title, as it would be echoed in other family lines ie, Potter/malfoy/longbottom, but we get nothing about houses and succession in any of those.

I find it hard to believe that something as important as succussion/male heirs wouldn't come up with someone like Draco malfoy.

The fact that the wall tapestry followed both female and male lines would indicate what that quote said, that female and male lines were all significant, and there's nothing to say that a female couldn't carry her house name if she chose to, just like there is no real indication that gender would matter in succession. A pureblood line is a pureblood line, I don't think the name mattered so much as the blood status.

** Think about it from the point of view of the normal Witches and Wizards.

The night of Halloween 1981, Voldemort attacked the Potter alone. Of the 4 people present in the house during this night, 3 are dead (or at least believed dead) and one survived. It is not far fetched to believe the baby "vanquished" Voldemort, it's also more sexy to have a "survivant" than a martyr and (personal opinion) a Half Blood to end the Blood purity war as some appeal.

‚Äã

No matter what Lily did that night (and even us don't know, canon say love but it can be anything from involontary spell born from sacrifice to blood ritual), it didn't leave a lot of trace and may have been masked by the destruction of Voldemort spell. And since nobody except Dumbledore and some people in his confidence checked on Harry, they don't even know if there is anything unusual about him. Even his scar must have been revealed to the public by hearsay (I blame Hagrid).

We know that magic leave traces so it should be possible for people to identify what spell was used (I think they do that in Fantastic Beast but not sure avec its canon validity).

In books, we have at least Moody who say clearly in year 4 that Harry survived the killing curse, but I don't know if it's because it is common knowledge or the Death Eater giving too much details gleamed from its master. And if there is other canon mention, can't remember them.

****** This is only my headcanon but i believe that /someone/ (maybe with big beard, bones, finger and pretty much everything) took drinking a little bit too far during a celebration and left out some details that could have remained secret, with or without the accord of Dumbledore.

Then again, in the book, people are celebrating Harry Potter during the 1st of November. At that time I believe only 4 people had seen Harry. One was chasing a traitor, another was depressing, the 3rd was with said baby and we don't know where the last one was so either Rowling have a problem with dates or Dumbledore started the whole thing.

-- Rubeus Hagrid

There's a sense of reverence in Hagrid's words, even if his actions or tone doesn't imply it.

To add to that, Lily's sacrifice is not known to anyone. You know, I've always wondered how it was that Dumbledore knew that Lily was given the choice to step away that night...there was no one there other than Lily, James and Voldemort, discounting a one year old.

It has nothing to do with Lily being muggleborn. The wizarding world isn't as anti-muggleborn as fanon likes to believe.

  ‚ÄúThere is a room in the Department of Mysteries,‚Äù interrupted Dumbledore, ‚Äúthat is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.‚Äù
#+end_quote

People so often speak about how 'many mothers have died to protect their children' as if that is a good argument against the canon explanation. In doing so they disregard any input from Harry, making him only a spectator, or a baseball bat, in the scenario.

Harry and Voldemort are deeply linked. Holly and Yew, good and evil. And it began with the prophesy before Harry was born, not with the scar. Harry was always going to oppose Voldemort, prophesy or no prophesy, but in attempting to eliminate a threat Voldemort created an enemy that could defeat him. He empowered this person, so diametrically opposed to himself. Gave something of himself to his greatest enemy. And found again and again that his failure to understand this part of magic, this thing that Harry embodies, is greater than Voldemort is.
