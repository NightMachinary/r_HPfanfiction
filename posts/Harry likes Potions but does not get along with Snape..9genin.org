Are there any stories where Harry loves the discipline but still doesn't get along with Snape? No m/m or pureblood culture, please.


** In On the Way to Greatness by mira_mirth, Harry reacts to Snape's behavior by becoming extremely good at potions but the two still don't like each other.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste linkao3(10588629) no m/m or pureblood culture in it and it spends a lot of time on Harry liking potions but not Snape.

*** This fic is great, but while Snape is still kind of an asshole, he and Harry do end up getting along quite well. Their growing connection is the main theme and focus of the plot. It is a good Snape mentor figure fic although I don't think it's what OP is looking for.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
