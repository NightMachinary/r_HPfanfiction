I love love love Remus Lupin. I find his character fascinating and his struggles with lycanthropy and losing all of his friends. Any really good fics with good characterizations of Remus? Bonus points for slash fics but a relationship shouldn't be the focus of the story

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

** I'm actually reading one right now that I really like, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2633783][Momentum]] by Children_of_the_Shadows, which is exactly as requested (wolfstar and everything). I'm not sure when it will end though, I'm guessing probably around 1981.

Another that is great and one of my very favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]]. It's technically a WIP but where the author left off is the end of 6th year and even then it's nearly 400k words and an extremely well done portrayal of Remus (and Sirius) from childhood through hogwarts.

I also loved [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]] is a great Hermione/Remus time travel with a really great middle section from Remus's POV from POA through DH.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

  VERY LONG fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges.Eventual wolfstar, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! On the plus side, I do update very often (sometimes twice a week, sometimes daily).First Year - Fifth Year complete, Sixth Year about to begin!***Nominated for the 2017 Marauder Medal, 'Best Work in Progress' by the Shrieking Shack Society!***
