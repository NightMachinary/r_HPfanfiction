Tom Marvolo Riddle as the Marvel Motor Dildo.

Hermione Jean Granger as a Rare Mahjong Engineer.

Sirius Orion Black, Ruins Crook's Alibi. But Peter Pettigrew, I, Pet, Wept Regret.

And Harry James Potter, Her Parrot Majesty.

--------------

...So, seeing as we've been having a lovely thread coming up with names like these...who knows of any fics which actually make use of these anagrams? Either just the characters poking fun at them, or actually being transformed to reflect punny names?


** "Sirius Orion Black, Ruins Crook's Alibi. But Peter Pettigrew, I, Pet, Wept Regret."

That one's /brilliant/.

*** Makes you wonder if JK Rowling managed that one on purpose.

Or maybe she was just going for Sirius Orion Black is an S.O.B. and PETer PETtigrew.

** I too would like to be a Rare Mahjong Engineer. But really, playing with anagrams is fun, until you decide that you need to make a name that actual sounds good out of some fancy French word you've chosen. Then you decide the name also has to have all of its fancy meanings, and by then, it just gets really frustrating. Anyone who manages (especially Rowling herself) is nothing but brilliant.

*** Mm. The Voldemort=Flight From/Of Death thing is really clever, isn't it?

Although it's not perfect; what kind of a silly name is Marvolo?

**** Based on research, apparently Marvolo may be an adaptation of Malvolio, from. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, or to trace its roots farther, from Latin malivolo, meaning malevolent. There are also alternate explanations available too. But the use of "I am" to help the anagram flow better indicates that Marvolo may simply the dump name used to help complete the anagram.

***** “Oh, hey, I'm going to give my kid a dump name so that he can better be evil in the future.”

Merope would weep at your accusation. But yeah, considering that the anagram happened first, it probably is a dump name.
