It's pretty old. Hermione has to touch and be near him for some reason or she will die (?). He lets her move in for some reason and they fall in love fairly organically. Pretty sure it was posted on FFN and I feel like it had a fairly garbage summary. Maybe rated M?

Me and another user were talking about it but CANT remember the name. Help us!

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.
