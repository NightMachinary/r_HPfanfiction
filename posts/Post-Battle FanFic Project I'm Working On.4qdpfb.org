Hi all!

I'm an avid reader of fanfics devoted to Harry/Ginny after the Battle of Hogwarts and really any canon-compliant fics set immediately after that time.

I have my own preferences of what I like in such stories, namely it being canon compliant where Rowling indicated (Harry is an Auror, Ginny plays for the Harpies, Ron eventually helps out at George's shop, etc).

Part of the problem with having your own specific criteria is you don't know whether the author will violate your rules until you start reading. I'd personally hate to start a fanfic only to find out Ginny dies in the middle and its really about Harry finding new love. Just not for me.

My other problem is I've read so many that they start to bleed together and I forget which ones I've already read sometimes.

With that in mind, I have begun the process of creating one-sheet breakdowns of every Harry/Ginny or Post-Battle of Hogwarts fan fic. My plan is to eventually share this with the community. I want to focus on completed, long fanfic (over 60,000 at least) that is not AU, but generally complies with Canon. I have outlined the categories I will be using in my breakdown, but am open to other categories.

Additionally, as I want to share as I complete, I was wondering what you all think the best way for me to do that is, without providing any personal info like my email address.

Finally, I'd be happy to take suggestions on breakdowns others might like. I probably forgot more stories than I remember myself.

Categories:

Title Author Chapters Word Count Summary Level of Canon Compliance Time Frame of Story Strengths Weaknesses Level of Danger/Fluff Harry/Ginny Relationship Harry Ginny Ron Hermione Other Weasleys Hogwarts Alumni Ministry Other

For the characters, I want to break down how they are portrayed and their level of involvement in the story.

I look forward to sharing with the community.


** A love canon-compliant fics myself. You seem to have a solid plan and I'm looking forward to your list!

I'm that way about any Lily/James fics over 80k.
