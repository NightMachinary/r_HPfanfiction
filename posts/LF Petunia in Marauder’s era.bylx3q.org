I just finished (rather brief) linkao3(Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters) and I love how different she is. We usually see her only through eyes of her abusing Harry after the death of Lilly & James, but it is interesting to see her how she was before. Not better (she had to be as bitter as before, and that treatment of Harry had to have roots somewhere), but very much limited to her role of an abuser.

I like glimpses we get in linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee), but do you know about some others?
