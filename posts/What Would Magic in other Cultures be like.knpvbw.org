How do you think the cultures of different countries would effect the magical world? Would there be some cultures that don't even use wands? Would some countries demonize magic and lead to the magical community to hide even deeper, if not flee to other countries? Would species and skills considered Dark in the British Wizarding World be considered valued and respected in others?

What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear what everyone thought their countries magical communities would be like.

I'll go first with my own country: Australia.

Since white people came to Australia from Britain on the Prison Fleets, we can only assume that the British Ministry would take this golden opportunity to clear out Azkaban and send some "undesirables" to another continent to be someone elses problems. So the early magical settlers of Australia would be criminals, muggleborns and halfbloods who spoke out against the status quo and various "Dark" races like Werewolves, Vampires, etc etc.

Magical Convicts would probably follow the development of their Muggle Counterparts, but would split off as soon as they could. Many of these Magi-Cons would lack wands, due to either being prisoners before arriving, having them snapped by the British Ministry or simply never having been allowed them in the first place. They might meet the Aboriginals and form an uneasy agreement. Not due to the difference in skin color, as in HP it seems that wizards care little for skin color or gender, since any race or gender can be equally powerful in terms of magic, but because they were unknowns and possessed unknown magics.

Over time the Magi-Cons would form their own communities and towns, living alongside Aboriginals and learning their magic. The magic of the Aboriginal people varied wildly between the tribes, but they were all wandless and dealt with various rituals. Nothing dark or gruesome, simply rituals to pay respect to the land, and manipulate flames to aid them in telling others about their mythology.

Over time, the wizards, werewolves and vampires would learn this magic. After a while, when Australia ceased to be a prison continent and was finally considered its own country, English Magicals would visit and find the Magical Communities scattered out in the Outback. Wands would be reintroduced to the Australian Wizards, and while many would go on to use wands for everyday magic, Aboriginal Magic would remain part of their culture.


** for america, it depends on what part of the country what culture settled in as it really is a melting pot of cultures. My area, the midwest was originally french territory so there might be some lingering effects of that. my state also had alot of german and irish immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. So i'd say my area would have some old french style magic mixed with geman and irish style as well

** I generally view HP magic as a technology analogue, with the wand taking on a role parallel to the industrial revolution (albeit one that occurred centuries earlier).

So just as the techniques and machines of the industrial revolution were adopted by the whole world, so too do I imagine the wand spreading worldwide. By modern times magic would be a globalised, standardised affair, and individuals who learn and use pre-wand magic would be the hipsters of the magical world.

With regard to languages, I see spells as universal but incantations as variable. So the Levitation Charm does exactly the same thing in China as it does in Britain, but they may use a different incantation to call upon that same magic.

*** Agree with you completely. Since Ollivanders have been doing Wands since the 382 BC we could say that wands have pretty much pushed Staffs or any other method to the side.

But yeah I dont see everyone using the same language for magic.

​

I wish JK Rowling did a book showing the magical cultures from the rest of the world.

​

Same way I wish the newest movies were about Newt going in the wild finding magical beasts instead of what we got.

** Arctic and subarctic magic would be pretty neat, I think.

I remember hearing stories of Angijukait, shaman or mystics in Inuktitut, doing ridiculous things like raising islands from the sea and prying fjords open with their hands.

Animals who could take off their skin to become a human, and change back again, and Tunnit, giants strong enough could row their Kajait multiple Inuit in Kajait head into a gale, lived alongside the Inuit then.

If I knew which of my issues of /Them Days/ had the old myths in them I could probably find more. That's not even touching the Naskapi or Innu stories.

** Muggle history in the HP verse is indistinguishable from ours, so it's likely that the existence of wizards didn't make too much of a difference in world history. Wizards also aren't much better than muggles when it comes to tribalism and constantly killing each other.

And we know from the goblins that having wands is way better than not having them. Wandless magic may have some neat applications but for quick, accurate and reliable casting in a battle, nothing beats wands.

So it's pretty likely that while the European muggles were using their superior guns to colonize places around the world, the European wizards were using their superior wands to make sure the local wizards didn't interfere, for the greater good of international secrecy.
