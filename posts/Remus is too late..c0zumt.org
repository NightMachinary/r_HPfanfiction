Are there any fics where when Sirius falls through the veil, Remus is too late to stop Harry from following him? As long as it is not A Black Comedy. I don't mind if it is an aftermath or they fall into a new dimension or that they travel back in time, as long as it is well written.

  When Sirius falls through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries Harry attempts to nose-dive after him. A strange encounter for Harry radically changes his world view;why worry about a Dark Lord when there's a good book to explore?

***** Did you mean a crossover with The Good Place (the tv show) or something else? Because a Harry Potter/ Good Place crack!fic sounds really amazing.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.

** I've been thinking about writing one, where it turns out to be a gateway to the Discword, where James went to school at the Assassins school post Hogwarts.

Assassin schooled Harry, struggling to come to terms with contracts to Inhumane people, and justify them to himself was always one of my favourite rabbit holes to go down, a few years ago.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr
