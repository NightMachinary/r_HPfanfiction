Any fics where Harry just one day snaps and spends his entire life killing his enemies in the most gruesome ways possible and not caring about the consequences of his actions On the lines of the punisher

In this one Harry does kill his enemies gruesomely but it's almost crack and not remotely as serious as Punisher.

#+begin_quote
  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.

** "....When they fear you... you become stronger, you become better. But let's never forget, it's a display, it's a posture, like a lion's roar or a gorilla thumping at his chest. If you lose yourself with display, if you succumb to the horror... then you become the monster. You become reduced. Not more than a man, but less; and it can be fatal." - The Jackal, Far Cry 2.

The biggest problem I think a lot of fics tend to make with that sort of characterization of Harry is they're missing the consequences of those actions. Sure the John Wick or Punisher part can be fun, but if it doesn't come with some sort of serious cost that makes you stop and ask if the world is really a better or worse place at the end of the day and the end of the story because of what Harry does then I think it'll have a really hard time sticking the landing.
