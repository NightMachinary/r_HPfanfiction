** I imagine that killing someone, even someone as unpleasant as Snape, whilst transformed was one of Lupin's biggest fears, therefore he would almost certainly have been very upset at Sirius for essentially using him as a weapon to potentially kill someone.

I recall reading a theory that the event caused the two to fall out quite significantly and thus explained why Black was willing to believe that Lupin was a spy during the first war, and why Lupin was willing to believe that Black had betrayed the Potter's.

** I think Lupin would still be mad at Sirius. First mainly because it would pretty much be guaranteed that at that timeframe Lupin would be executed for a werewolf attacking a student.

Two because Lupin hated being a werewolf because of being attacked as a child. So for him to attack another person and either kill that person or turn him would tear Lupin apart emotionally/mentally. And for this to happen because Sirius wanted to get back at Snape would be a betrayal.

Lupin would also see this attack as Lupin betraying Dumbledore's faith in him by allowing him to attend school even though he knew he was a werewolf. Basically meaning that no other werewolf child would ever get the opportunity (of course, this begs the question why was no other child who was attacked by a werewolf given the opportunity to go to Hogwarts. Surely Lupin wasn't the only deserving child).

So bottom line I think Lupin would be very mad at Sirius for doing what he did. I think James would be mad as well knowing what might have happened to their friend if Sirius' "prank" had been successful.

*** I know he says Prank but i really do wonder if it was really a prank for him. He does really intensely hate Snape I dont think its just a Marauders thing. Lupin for example doesn't seem to hate Snape that much even though Snape outed him as a werewolf which made it harder for him to find work after the anti werewolf bill passed. He should probably dislike Snape more than Sirius who has no real canon reason to hate him this much honestly

**** I would agree that "prank" is a little too lighthearted for what he did. It was more ok you bastard you want to find out what's going on then here you go let's see how you handle it.

If terms of Sirius' dislike/hate remember that at this time Sirius was cast out of his family for not following their pureblood beliefs and being aligned with Voldemort. You have the war heating up, you have the deatheater supporters at school, and you have Snape aligning himself with the deatheaters. You have Snape calling Lily a mudblood (I believe this happened before the Lupin incident) emotionally hurting Lily because a supposed friend turns against her.

And then add Sirius being very protective of James (because his parents "rescued" Sirius) and of Lily and you can easily see Sirius going overboard to "get" Snape who represents everything that Sirius is turning away from/rejecting.

Then add they are all hormone driven teenagers who rarely fully understand the potential consequences of their actions and you can see where things can go wrong.

** I think James and Remus were both very upset with Sirius for almost making Remus a murderer and very nearly exposing all their secrets.

And, while I think Snape was stupid as all hell to waltz outside to find and possibly do something to someone he suspected to be a werewolf, "kids are a bit sociopathic" doesn't fly with 16 year old Sirius.
