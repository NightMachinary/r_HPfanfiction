:END:
Way back in 2013, I read a great novel length Harry Potter fanfiction. I want to reread it but I can't find it online since there have been many many fanfics written since then. Let me know if you find this fanfic!

It was based on book 5 (Order of the Phoenix) and I'm pretty sure it was titled the same. In the book Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to Azkaban to break someone out. The three also learn to be animaguses. I know it was quite long, reaching over 30 chapters. It was also written before 2013 and I'm pretty sure the author also wrote fanfics of the 6th and 7th book as well.

That's all I remember. I've been looking for a while but haven't been able to find it. Thank you so much if you find this!
