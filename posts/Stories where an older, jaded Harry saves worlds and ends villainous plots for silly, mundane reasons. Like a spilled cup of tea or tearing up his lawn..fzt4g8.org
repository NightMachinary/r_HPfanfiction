Preferably a crossover, where an older, jaded Harry owns a little shop or something and wrecks a villains day because the shockwaves from his superweapon deflated the soufflé he was baking. Or Godzilla made the mistake of nudging Harry's bookstore, damaging the facade and toppling a shelf he had just reorganized and promptly gets reverted to an unirradiated gecko as punishment. Or Thanos dusted a waitress and now Harry's chicken parmesan is all over his lap and the floor, so Harry's going to thoroughly ruin Thanos' day, week, month, year, and decade in retaliation. Of course he also does this because the Big Bad is threatening truth, Justice, and free will and that's /a/ reason Harry defeated them, but he's just really angry about his spilled milk and he's too old to cry about it.

And he's constantly being hounded by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers and the JLA and the Monster Buster Club to get him to join up and fight the good fight, but; “I already fought my fight! I did my job, and yours as well! If you want to protect the people then fuck off and get better at it, stop hounding an old man to do your dirty work!” And then kicks Fury or Batman out of his home or shop and casts a spell on them that will make everything they wear for the next 72 hours into [[https://imgur.com/gallery/oIZK4dH][this shirt]] to spite them.

** Ideally this Harry should be Saitama-level OP and casually /destroys/ any villain/monster dumb enough to annoy him, oftentimes annoying the younger heroes. "Damn it, Harry, we were trying to take him /alive/!" "Well, then you should have caught him before he got to me."

Extra bonus points if Harry's getting increasingly irritated because all of these villains/monsters seem to inevitably run into him, and he's beginning to suspect there's some sort of higher power involved.

I don't think it would kill an eldritch god like Chthulhu, but Thanos, Hulk, Godzilla, sure. Why not lol. The Killing Curse kills living things. Those beings are living. I can only see something like Ultron or a higher being like a God surviving.

(From PoA)

Anyway, my personal headcanon is that Avada Kedavra kills you. As in: you were alive, and now you're dead.

No, there is no physiological explanation of what happened. Before the AK you were there, and after you aren't.

If there are side-effects that happen from dying (such as a soul departing), they do happen. But they don't cause the death, they follow from it.

** Wind Shear is kind of like that. Harry gets sent to the past and decides he doesn't really want to fuck with the timeline or get drawn into the war again so he's just going to drink a pint and plan how to avoid everyone for a while. Then Deatheaters.

  "You know, I had already been having a bad day." She didn't recognize the voice but instinctively she knew it belonged with a pair of brilliant, cold emerald eyes. "I came in here for a bit of peace and quiet and a nice drink. I just want to be left alone."

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** Kinda like the Harry in linkffn(I still haven't found what I'm looking for), but that was more he didn't because he felt like it, casually defeating dark wizards every few decades. Also it's more in his backstory.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
