I was thinking about various ships today, and one that never seems to get mentioned is Ron/Luna. There's even some basis in canon (if a little one-sided), as Luna seems quite taken with Ron in OotP. As I recall, she laughs too much when Ron mocks Goyle, and sings "Weasley is our King" dreamily under her breath at one point.

Obviously it's nowhere near canon, but it just got me thinking. Any thoughts?


** It used to be kinda big back when the books were still coming out.

I personally think it's sweet and it's a shame it's usually just window dressing in Harmony fics

*** If only more Harmony fics featured Ron/Luna instead of Ron bashing.

** Because Luna is a delightful cinnamon roll, and Ron is an obnoxious twunt? This ship makes me 'RRREEEEEEEE' internally. She deserves better.

*** Genuine question - did you read the books or watch the movies first?

**** Books first.

Started reading the books after PoA was written but before the first movie was released. I've watched the movies maybe 3-4 times each, read the books at least 7-8, and book canon pretty much always takes precedence over movie canon for me, regardless of the fandom.

***** Okay great, thanks for answering!

I was curious, because I had a theory that people who hate Ron saw the movies first, and he is much worse as a character in the movies.

But you have proved me wrong!

This is true for 95% of the cases though.

**** While I'm not quite as vehement about it, I also disliked Ron while reading the books.

I understand why Harry stayed friends with him, but I don't much like him as a character.
