For those who haven't played Knights of the Old Republic II, Kreia was a former Jedi turned Sith who hated the Force and wanted to destroy it. Basically Harry in this story would be the same but with magic.

"I hate the Force, I hate that it seems to have a will, that it would control us to achieve some measure of balance when countless lives are lost". - Kreia (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II)
