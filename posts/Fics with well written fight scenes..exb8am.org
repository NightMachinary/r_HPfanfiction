Something I read really tilted me recently, the fic built up and up and up to a climactic fight scene, and when the chapter ended, I expected the next chapter to be off the walls guerrilla fighting throughout Hogwarts. But, it just like. Skipped it. All of it. Up to the end where Voldemort was already dead.

That tilted me, and now I've been blue balled out of my fight scene quota. So [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], what're some of the best fight scenes you've seen?


** Anything by Shezza, specifically the Resistance at Azkaban and his masterpiece starting with the Denarian Renegade.

*** The Denarian series got me hooked on the Dresden files, and I read all of it over like, 4 weeks. It was absolutely amazing, but unfortunately the spinoff (You know the one, That one with Fleur, and the overabundance of pizza) didn't quite get me going. Still though Shezza's god tier.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

*** Loved both of these, primarily because HarryBella is one of those rarepairs which get me hype, but the action was great too.

Unfortunately though, I've read both already lmao. Thanks for the throwback though man.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]], what I consider to be the best fanfic I have ever read, has some of the greatest combat I have ever read. My favorite part of fics are often combat scenes and some other fics (overall quality may vary a lot but has good combat) that I have enjoyed are:

I've put stars by the ones I have seen people recommend often for good action. The rest are good in my opinion. I favor faster paced, powerful magic. I abhor, and I mean irrationally and vehemently detest, fics where wandless magic is used instead of wands.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
