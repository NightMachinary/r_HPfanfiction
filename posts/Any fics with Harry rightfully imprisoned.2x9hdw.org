There are a lot of fics with Harry framed, betrayed, or simply thrown in Azkaban for the sake of convenience.

Are there any fics where Harry was actually guilty of the crimes he's accused of?

Hardly my favorite, but I think it matches your requirements.

If I remember correctly: Neville is the BWL, Harry's parents are still dead and he is raised/abused by the Dursleys. Neville is basically the same as he is in canon whereas Harry is a genius and was sorted Slytherin. Fic begins with Harry brutally torturing/murdering the Dursleys after the end of second year.
