  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  When Steve crashed into the ocean he wasn't expecting to wake up inside someone else's head 38 years later. For Harry, it was like having a big brother that was always around. They would both follow each other anywhere, even to war. NO SLASH!

** I'm writing a canon rehash where Lily's ghost accompanies Harry through life. It's a Good Things Happen to Harry fic. Very little teenage drama, since I find that boring, and some of the canon drama is glossed over so I have had a complaint that things are too easy for him.

It's called Well That Just Won't Do - Book 1. I'm working on Book 3 now and update pretty frequently.
