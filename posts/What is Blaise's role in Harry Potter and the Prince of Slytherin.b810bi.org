I just read chapter 68 and found out that he is somebody aware of the deathly hallows and may have stolen the cloak. I want to know how it goes on with him?


** I'm a couple of chapter behind, somewhere around 110, but so far nothing actionable has actually happened with that story line.

over the following 40 chapters all that's happened was some backstory. Lot's has been inferred as is the wont of the author.

I don't recall Blaise stealing the Cloak, as he would only have access to it through Harry and Harry only has it when he cons Jim into lending it to him.

Harry is aware that Blaise has an agenda, but isn't sure what it is. Being Slytherins that doesn't really bother either of them. Still, Harry is better friends with Neville and Theo, despite spending more of his time with Blaise.

** That's a very good question. I stopped reading the fic after its latest arc ended because I simply lost interest, but Blaise, by that point, has contributed very little to the overall story. Marcus Flint has had a great impact on the plot.

*** I just found out that it was actually Ron who was possessed by the diary who stole the cloak
