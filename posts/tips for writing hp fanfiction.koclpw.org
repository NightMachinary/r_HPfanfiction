i've been writing fanfic for years but hp is just such an expansive universe and fandom i've been too scared to dip my toes in. now i have an idea for a fred/oc fic i really want to write but i'm still scared to try.


** I was terrified when I jumped back in after like ten years, because the fandom had grown so much. Since I am new, I can't claim to be able to give you good advice. But I can tell you what I did.

I tried not to read any other fics while writing mine, because 1) they intimidated me and made me not want to post, and 2) I didn't want to subconsciously bleed someone else's ideas/dialogue/etc into my own fic. So maybe avoid reading?

And though I didn't read, I DID "research" - in other words, I checked searches of my MC and genre to see if it was bloated with stories. Luckily for me it wasn't terrible. But if yours is bloated, (and I don't think it will be) then look a bit deeper, maybe at summaries etc, and see what kinds of plots are already out there. That will help you see how common your idea is.

And even your idea has been done, */write it anyway/*. Everything has been done by now. You have to make it your own. Just like with everything else, you won't know until you try (and I ignored this advice in everything I did and suffered greatly for it). Besides, the thrill of having written something and having a creative outlet are their own rewards <3

*** yeah it's definitely not bloated but i 10000% get intimate by other fics!! i have pretty much the whole story outlined and it's not particularly similar to any that i've read recently.

and you're totally right!! i can still write it either way - it's just a bit daunting haha

** Just write it and see how it feels. I have 3 Stories started because the concept sounded really cool in my head but after I reread (another tip) it after a weak so that I can see how the reader would interpret it I decided not to post it.

+if your writing a crossover+

If you're writing a crossover don't make either side look incompetent (except if one side is portrayed as incompetent in the original series) it really makes a lot of crossovers like a one-sided bashing fic and whilst ill admit that I like some character bashing fics if they are handled as a comedy searching for a crossover where your favorite character gets treated like an incompetent moron is not fun for the reader.

*** Yes. I've found this problem when looking for Percy Jackson crossovers. Either for some reason it's common in those or I'm reading the wrong fics.

**** Yeah, I know almost all of those authors describe the magical world as a bunch of asthmatics shooting stunners at people... whist in reality I would describe a wizard as weapons of mass destruction that the unfortunate (for everybody else) ability to teleport.

I'll admit that the Percy Jackson characters will probably be more athletic than the average Wizard but portraying them as those invincible killing machines is just boring (in my opinion as a Harry Potter fan) I have read about them shrugging of Killing curses and slaying dementors and at that point, it just drops off the plate of reason and dives straight into bullying of one Universe.

** Keep a note in your phone dedicated to your story. That way, when you are out and about, I'd inspiration hits, you won't be scrambling to find a pen.

Run your chapter through an editor. Or two. I use Hemingway app, which is free online, and grammarly, which also has a free service.

Hang out with us on the discord! People answer my dumb questions all the time. If you get stuck, there's usually someone around to help you out. They're pretty nice over there :)

**** oh, I get it now lol. Then the hp Wikipedia is your friend! I have to constantly reference it. It is such a vast world, but there are also massive parts that aren't developed. Like... healing or magical art. Let your imagination run wild when the opportunity presents itself! You are only limited by your imagination :)

** Write all your ideas down. Have another section for snippits of them. Some you won't use others you can incorporate later.

** Generally, if you make an effort to Britpick (do a subsearch here for resources or get a British person to check it for you), get character/place names right, and capitalise spells appropriately (both of which can be done in editing with a google-check), you'll probably get an appreciative audience regardless of what you write (content-wise, I mean). This sub isn't really representative of the Fandom as a whole, so don't take opinions stated here as utterly definitive.

**** You're welcome. And yeah. There's plenty of Britpicking threads and HP-writing advice threads and various posts about various facets of life and history that are actually quite useful for reference around. I do recommend trying a few synonyms for whatever you search - there's always a variety of titles used for posts on any topic.
