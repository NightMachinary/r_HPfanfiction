I've just read [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/8797351/chapters/20168260][A World Changed]] and really liked it. It doesn't have to be a soulmate or reincarnation fic or anything, but I'd like for them to at least be repeating Hogwarts or for it to be a re-do type of fic. I'd like for them to both be involved with the time travel. Thanks!


** I remember this excellent fic where Harry and Ron were both teleported to their fourth year, I forgot the name of it though:(

***** Mmm, no. I'm not really interested in fics where Ron and Harry go downhill into alcoholism or something similar. Thank you for bringing it up, though.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

*** Is it slash? Between Ron and Harry? Because I'm pretty sure it's a Harry/Ginny fic. Thanks for the recommendation, though!

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.
