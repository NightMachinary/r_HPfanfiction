I read a story the other day where Harry got all the Hallows early and became "Master of Death" and used its special powers to defeat Voldemort yet it was a minor part of the plot only at the end of the fic. So I am looking around for a good Master of Death fanfic but mostly everything was some kind of cross over until I had my own story idea. I was wondering if anyone knows of any stories out there where it is set after DH and for the first time ever there is trouble in the afterlife (maybe something to do with Voldemort's splintered soul or something completely different) and it will end up affecting the world of the living as well so Harry (as the Master of Death) must cross over with his "powers" (either alone or with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc...) and investigate this new evil, with the help of everyone who has died of course (Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, his parents, Fred, etc...). If there is anything out there even remotely similar I think it would be awesome. I have done some writing myself but don't have enough time to do this so if anyone wants to take this idea and run with it go right ahead (you can always contact me and I can help with more ideas / details).

Also completely unrelated to this idea, if anyone has knows any good Master of Death fics where it is not a crossover, I would be happy to receive recommendations for those too. Thanks!

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  We all have wishes some are small and some are big, but what happens when we get more than we bargained for? Well, that's what happened to Sandra Jones when one night during a meteor shower, she wished for something exciting to happen that would change her life forever. I'm pretty sure she hadn't had in mind a certain Autobot weapon specialist.
