I imagine a Charlie Weasley/OFC where she is a prostitute/sex worker in a luxurious club and they have sth like a golden ticket where they'll do whatever you ask from them within a day. and then Bill sends her to Romania as a joke gift for Charlie's birthday for staying single for too long. They enjoy each other of course, but not in a romantic way.

Meanwhile Molly is convinced he has someone in his life and keeps sending him letters about her acceptance to whomever his partner is (Basically she thinks he is gay and hinting 'we love you anyway'). Charlie hasn't come to visit in a while and she thinks the reason is he is worried about their acceptance to him; she just misses her son.

Her latest letter was about 'Harry and Ginny upcoming wedding and how it would be a nice opportunity to introduce his partner for the family'. He panics since he can't avoid his mother anymore and doesn't want to break her heart when he shows up alone.

He goes to the club and ask for the same girl, and she stops him telling him her time is literal money and he has to rent a room if she is just going to be hearing him vent (she is very money oriented). Fast forwarding she accepts if he is going to buy golden tickets for the days she is expected there, buys her the formal robes, and any other accommodation she needs.

They'll even make up a background story about how they met thro her volunteering at the infirmary and Charlie keeps coming with different wounds. Molly will be smitten with her, Bill not so much (he remembers her from buying the ticket), his wife knows from him and is very judgemental towards her, Percy recognises her from the ministry and how he has seen her with different politicians also very judgemental towards her. However, they will keep it a secret; they are worried about their mother's reaction.

I imagine it being mostly funny filled with the OC wits and charms, but also there is more angsty stuff to come (what got her to be in this business) I just think I've already wrote too much XD.
