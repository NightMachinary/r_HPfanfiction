This story was amazing, and I really want to see where it goes. The only request I have is no bashing, no manipulative Dumbledore, no love potion Ginny, no Uber-Jealous Ron, no Draco in Leather Pants, and no Prodigy Hermione.


** Could you link to it? I don't know that story.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!
