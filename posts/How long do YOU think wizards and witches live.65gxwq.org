HP fanfiction has never seemed to have reached a consensus on how long magical people live, despite JK's canon saying a witch/wizard can expect to live 137 years on average. I've read stories where magicals on average live anywhere from their seventies to over three hundred years.

What are your thoughts?


** As long as the plot requires.

** In canon, we only see like two witches and wizards naturally living longer than the oldest muggle on record (jeanne calment lives to 122). Off the top of my head, there is Bathilda Bagshot (who was Grindelwald's great-aunt) and Griselda Marchbanks (who was like 130 in book 7). Other than that, you've got the Flamels because of the Philosopher's Stone. I can't think of any other evidence to supports a triple digit average lifespan other than "magiclol".

Given what we know, I think it's possible that a witch/wizards average life span is 10-20 years older. But, it also seems like they're more likely to die from other causes before old age catches up to them. Dumbledore was pretty active when he got killed at 109, so I could see him having lived to 150, but that I definitely think that would be an outlier and not the normal.

*** - Barry Winkle was a wizard who was 755 at the time of the first book
- Armando Dippet died at 355ish
- Nicholas Flammel managed to give himself pseudo-immortality and lived to just under 700 along with his wife
- Griselda Marchbanks was at least a generation older than Dumbledore, probably older which puts her at least at 133, probably far older since she was his OWL examiner.

**** I'd say Flamel doesn't count tho, since he had specific magic aid to live longer, he'd be an exception.

I guess magic generally helps you to live longer because getting food is much less of a problem for an adult wizard than for a muggle, and "muggle" sickness is also no problem as JKR stated.

Even if there's magic illnesses, doesn't seem like part of every-day life for them, to get sick. Most of us generally get a flu/cold once per year at least, and have to deal with allergies, stomach problems or something. A person who never gets sick is remarkable.

I imagine all these, added up generally helps wizards to naturally live longer.

Now, I'd say it's commonplace to wizards to hit three digits, but not more than 130. 130+ is not unheard of, but it's like 90 in the muggle world. And 150+ is like 100 in the muggle world, you occasionally heard about this, but rarely know someone personally.

- Snape's newspaper in the Chamber of Secrets confirms the month and year of his birth.

Nicholas Flammel

- "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)." (Chapter 13, 176)

Rowling has shown time and time again that canon consistency between mediums is not at all a priority. Even her own [[http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/therules.htm][list of rules]] contradicts what is established in books.

Your final point, is however a good one. I don't disagree with the notion that Wizards have supernaturally lengthened their lives, just using the movies as a source.

**** Was it ever confirmed that Flamel didn't just cook up another stone? I mean as long as he goes into hiding (so no telling even Dumbledore!) nobody will be the wiser till he shows back up once Voldemort has been dealt with (hell, he doesn't even have to show back up, he can get himself a new identity)

** Well, Griselda Marchbanks examined Dumbledore, who taught Voldemort, who recruited Lucius Malfoy, who fathered Draco Malfoy. If we say generations are 25 years apart, Marchbanks is at least 15+25+25+25+25 = 115 years old.

And she's still working happily and isn't mentioned as unusually long-lived. So 137 life expectancy is pretty consistent with what we see in the books.

EDIT: Bathilda Bagshot is yet another generation above (so, at least 140). But it's clear she's getting on a bit by the 1990s...

** I go with the average Rowling presented. It doesn't matter for what I write, so I didn't waste too much time thinking about it, but in general I like it when the expectancy for a wizard or witch is so high.

Most humans die of some disease. Magicals shake off dementia or cancer like its nothing with the right potion.

#+begin_quote
  Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. - from Pottermore.
#+end_quote

So if the main reason for death is gone, a high life expectancy is just something to be expected. Add magic to the equation and its going to be relatively normal to reach ridiculous ages (in the eyes of muggles).

** My sense is that the wizarding risk profile is very different from the risk profile of a Muggle in the developed world: the hazard (annual risk) of death from natural causes is much lower for all age categories; the hazard of death by accident is probably about the same, especially for adults (since children are protected by Accidental Magic); but the hazard of a violent death is much higher.

Now, most wizards and witches actually has quite a bit of control over the latter factor: if they

1. refrain from being a Dark Wizard/Witch;
2. refrain from fighting Dark Wizards/Witches;
3. hide when categories 1 and 2 take an interest in them;
4. do not engage in magical experimentation;

then they can expect to live for a very, very long time --- easily hundreds of years.

In short, the 137 life expectancy at birth might actually be plausible, if one excludes violent death, and the "silent majority" of wizards and witches who don't ever do anything interesting enough to be noticed by Harry Potter may well reach or exceed that lifespan.

Mind you, not everyone has that option. Muggleborns certainly didn't with Voldemort around.

** Two cases:

1) Wizard medicine has, for quite a long time, been of a quality analogous to the best Modern mundane medicine of perhaps another few decades from now, and wizards' standard of living is comparable to at least the middle class of modern first-world nations. In this case, 137 as average life expectancy is not so far-fetched, perhaps.

2) Being magical makes you live longer, intrinsicically. Like, your magic will instinctively take over body functions as your parts would otherwise fail due to old age. The strongest wizards live for a ridiculously long time, because they have more magic power, so it takes longer for their magic to not be able to keep them going. Squibs likely are on the upper end of mundane lifespans. Dumbledores and Merlins live for centuries, if they do not fall to accident or disease. However, since most of their magic is stuck keeping them not dead, their ability to actually do magic is much weakened - so such wizards probably hide themselves away, OR they run into 'everyone I ever knew or loved is long dead' and die of broken hearts, or even suicide, as they lack the ability to share their long lives with others. This recurs because even these wizards are too damn stupid - or lack the courage or cunning - to use their longevity to singlemindedly stalk Death across the lonely centuries, to banish it forever. In this case, Flamel is/was a relatively low-magic wizard, but he maintains the same level of magic due to the Stone, or the Stone requires one to permanently sacrifice a large portion of one's life and magic to create or something like that (which explains why so few seem to attempt it. I sure would.)

** Rowling has never been good with numbers. 137 seems really high.

I would expect the median age to be on the upper end of our life expectancy. So, maybe 85ish, with some living a lot longer and some a lot shorter. The number of wars (at least in Britain) has some effect. I'm also going off the Black family tree: the oldest person listed there lived to about 90. Then again, I /just/ said Rowling has never been good with numbers (and there is a 13 year old having a kid), so I don't really know.

Edit: autocorrect never understands when I try to type "just"

  137 is the wizard life expectancy, but just like in the muggle world, most die before that life expectancy.

That's not how averages work. Yes, many people die before the life expectancy, but those people are counterbalanced by those who live longer.
