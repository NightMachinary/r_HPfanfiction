I remember this story fairly well, but for the life of me cannot remember the title.

Harry was entered into the Triwizard Tournament as a first year, and because of this, there are several deviations from canon.

- Virtually nobody thought Harry entered himself into the Tournament, and even Malfoy's attempts to bully him are half-hearted.
- Fleur, Krum and Cedric are all seventeen years old, and quietly try to make sure Harry doesn't die during the Tournament.


** There's a oneshot. Not the greatest, but it follows the premise.\\

  AU. What if the Triwizard Tournament took place in Harry's first year, not his fourth?

** just upvote the post if you want to be reminded of it. it'll stay in your upvoted posts list so you can check it whenever you want, and it'll rise higher on the hot tab, meaning it will reach more people and therefore a higher chance of someone finding and posting the fic.

*** I upvote practically everything, so this is useless for me.

Thankfully the devs of reddit have done a wonderful thing and made a magical button that "saves" things when you click it. It provides a purpose-based list of items you think are worth checking out later. It even remember the list across devices if you use the same reddit account.

This function is also why I consider the remindme bot to be more spam than helpful. Sure, it's nice to have a red notification popup in a week or whatever, but that's literally the only extra function that it offers compared to the save list. I check my save list once every few months and there's always something interesting to read about that i've completely forgotten since i saved it.

*** I think it's mainly that the remind me's formed the majority of the comments here a day ago; check the times the comments were posted. Also Remind Me posts still alert the OP that someone commented, which really sucks when they check to see if someone found the fic only to see a remind me post.

[[/u/DaGeek247][u/DaGeek247]] made a very good point when he brought up the save function.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
