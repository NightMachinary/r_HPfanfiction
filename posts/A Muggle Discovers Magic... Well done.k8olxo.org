Hi all,

I recognize that this is almost certainly a common premise, a muggle somehow stumbles onto the magical world and must survive/find a place/etc. I'd love to find any examples in this genre that are particularly well done, weather because they are well written, or the premise is handled with originality in some way. If anyone has any particularly fun examples to pass along I would very much appreciate it. The Dursley-centered request I posted yesterday is largely responsible for my current sleeplessness ;) thank you all for the wonderful responses.


** In Harry Potter and the Natural 20 there's a side plot of the Little Whinging police finding out about magic. Unfortunately the story is abandoned in year 3, still an amazing read.

*** I remember getting more invested in those police officers than by the main characters.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations]]) was mostly focused on Harry moving to Diagon Alley after finding out the Dursleys had moved during the school year to get away from him, but also on a muggle mother with two pre-Hogwarts muggleborn daughters accidentally finding out about and getting adjusted to magic. Including the amusing, if strange, thought that somebody would actually enjoy pumpkin juice enough to buy it in bulk from the Leaky Cauldron.

Unfortunately, the story kind of died at the climax, but what's there is pretty solid.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

** You know I would like to read a story where the world at large discovers magic and they don't care/ are unimpressed and go on with their lives. Most stories it turns into some great conspiracy where the muggles try to take over or wizards are exterminated or something vise versa.

Muggles find out that they surpassed the average standard of living with technology and let wizards get on with it. Perhaps make a wizarding embassy of some sort but that's it.

** I need to try Natural 20 again. I think I just bounced off the early chapters, though I don't remember why.

** linkffn(Memorium by Aesop) - not 'fun', but well-written and complete. Some Aurors clean up a Death-Eater crime scene using memory charms, but it has devastating effects on a muggle family. One of the family discovers the magical world and pursues justice for her losses.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
