Basically, any Susan-centric story where Amelia (or at least her job) is kinda irrelevant for the main plot.

Gen, a Harry pairing or femslash would be preferred. Please no Death Eater whitewashing or m/m.

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.

****** I don't quite understand the question. My understanding of "rehash" refers to the direction a plot takes, revisiting the "stations of canon", such as confronting Voldemort in front of the mirror of Erised, saving Ginny from Diary!Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets, the GoF Graveyard etc. In that sense this fic very much avoids canon rehash.

If you're expanding the meaning of "rehash" to "occurs in a largely canonical world", then yes, this fic is rehash. The fic does its own groundwork, seeking to stand alone as an independent story, rather than relying on canon to fill in gaps in the reader's knowledge. This means when things are introduced, they are introduced as if the reader knows nothing about the HP world. This reflects my general approach to fanfic, which is that it should attempt to imitate a publishable work rather than being overtly derivative. IMO, relying on canon as a crutch to fill in gaps in the reader's knowledge stunts your development as a writer, because it would be impossible to do the same thing if writing an original work.

That's what I meant. While your approach is commendable since it makes getting into the story easier for newcomers, it isn't great for people who are already familiar with the material.

Your readers know canon and while you fix several plotholes/inconsistencies, there's also a lot of stuff most fanfiction readers are familiar with and it just feels like you've read a lot of words for very little new content.

** She features quite a bit in Seven Names, she's paired with Harry (Amelia Bones isn't even mentioned). It's Hermione centric and Draco plays a role but they don't white wash any of his deeds-in fact the whole cast is very shades of grey.

It's essentially a very AU story where everything didn't play out as it did in the series and both sides comitted significant war crimes. In the interest of fairness they organise a impartial board to review the actions of everyone during the war.

Although you could see it as bashing Harry and co. for thinking that refusing to reveal criminals who killed other criminals is actually worse than working for mass-murdering monsters. In any case, you are supposed to be on Hermione's side, but the story achieves this by going full-out "everyone, especially her best friends, betrays Hermione, and she suffers in silence, abandoning magic, a noble, abused victim, poor her".
