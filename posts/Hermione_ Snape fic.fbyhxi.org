:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cannot for the life of me find this old fic I read. I know it was on ff.net at one point.

The plot I remember is that Snape was sent to keep Hermione safe over the summer, as she was the only Order member underage without an adult wizard to provide protection. I think it also ended up focusing on Ron's gift for strategy, and had the final battle set up as a chess board that he directed.

Does anyone remember this fic and what it was called? I've been trying to dig through to find it but none of the ones I'm seeing are fitting the bill.

*** Yeah but they didn't hanky panky til much later. I was more interested in the Ron focus. Also, found it, and she was already 18. Still no movement in their end until much later on.

Hermione was of age at the start of the fic, and Snape is sent to live with her to keep him hidden as much as to keep her from plotting with Harry and Ron into going off on their own. Its still a pretty interesting read.
