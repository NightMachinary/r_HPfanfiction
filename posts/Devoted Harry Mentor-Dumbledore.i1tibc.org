I'm looking for any fic where Harry and Dumbledore have a really good mentor relationship or even parental-esque with Harry being really devoted to Dumbledore to the point where he would trade his own life for Dumbledore. The kind of scenes I am envisioning is Dumbledore being in mortal danger in a fight where he would surely die but Harry saves him and fights instead and dies, or maybe the ministry plans to capture Dumbledore but instead Harry acts as if he did everything Dumbledore was accused of, taking the blame and running away


** Oooh yah, sounds a good idea.
