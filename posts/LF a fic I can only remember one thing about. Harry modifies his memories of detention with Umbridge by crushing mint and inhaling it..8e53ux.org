** Dammit, I remember this scene. It was in something I read the entirety of. He used this as a cover for hurting himself to get Umbridge in trouble.

Maybe, just the barest of maybes: linkffn(The Merging)?

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)

***** Ah, I remember now. I thought this one was a bit of a let down from book 4, and book 6 only got three chapters in and the author vanished.
