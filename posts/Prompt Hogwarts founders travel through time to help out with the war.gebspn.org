I randomly had this fic idea in the shower and its been running through my head these past few weeks.

id imagined it to be a full 7 book rewrite, and somewhat like this:

- the founders have a close friend who happens to be a seer (perhaps named Helenus). Most of his prophecies have been about things that will happen in the future, decades upon centuries after the founders have gone.
- the founders have developed an item that allows them to travel through time, and using this device the founders travel to the time period of the prophecies Helenus makes to help out and make sure the world doesnt go to shit.\\
- Helenus sees a prophecy that describes the events of the First Wizarding War, and tells what will happen during the Second if they do not interfere.
- ‚ÄúDescendant of Slytherin has wreaked havoc upon a world divided by status. A world of peace remains after many lives lost and an orphaned child protected by his mothers love. in 1995, The peace will shatter, and the orphaned child left with unfit caregivers, then 15, will not know how to sufficiently protect the world. an unprotected world leads to more lives taken than necessary and a world that will never recover from the monstrosity it will go through‚Äù would be the main gist of the prophecy (obv worded much more poetically and stuff)
- the founders travel to 1990, a year before harry starts hogwarts. three of them decide to become the same age as harry, so they can help him more closely as opposed to if they were adults. they use that year to gain as much knowledge as they can about what happened, and form strategies that allow them the best way to make sure the world doesnt go to shit.
- they obviously cant show up as descendants of the founders, because that's suspicious and whatnot, so they show up as Garrick Goodwin,, Rosha Risewell, Solnus Sykes and Hesmina Hislop (the only adult) (idk can change names if u want)
- Hesmina/Helga makes her way to a powerful person in the ministry, making sure she has as many connections as possible. Garrick/Godric, Rosha/Rowena, and Solnus/Salazar are her ‚Äúadopted children‚Äù. They lived in Australia and moved to England in 1990, because Hesmina/Helga wanted her ‚Äúchildren‚Äù to attend the same school she attended.
- the founders become friends with harry right off the bat. they tell him about hogwarts, the houses, and ensure him that the house he goes to doesnt matter. his house does not dictate his person. Harry sorts slytherin with Solnus. The two become the closest friends, but the four founders do not let the different houses affect their friendship, promoting house unity and new friendships around hogwarts.
- the founders make sure they inform harry about everything. his past, parentage, relatives, everything they were able to find out. its alot for harry at first, but it makes harry trust them more for actually telling him stuff instead of keeping him in the dark.
- They spend the first five years preparing Harry, but not training him into a soldier. they teach him etiquette (but not to like pureblood malfoy extent, just enough so he knows how to mingle with purebloods without making a fool of himself) and they teach him how to harness his magic its full extent.
- The books dont really happen the same way. I would say Book 1 doesnt happen at all. Book 1 would more-so be focused on teaching harry about his past, getting accustomed to Hogwarts, promoting unity. Harry is still friends with Ron (Ron and Garrick/Godric are friends) Hermione (who sorted ravenclaw and is friends with Rosha/Rowena) but is also friends with Draco(S), Neville(H), Blaise(S), Pansy(S), Theodore(R), Luna(R) etc.
- Book 2 is handled by Solnus/Salazar within weeks (i like to think that the founders would use the Chamber as a secret hideout since its the one part of the school only they can access, and when Book 2 events are happening they figure it out fairly quickly).
- Book 3 the founders find a way to prove Sirius' innocence and get him a proper trial (through Hesmina/Helga's connections). Sirius spends the rest of the school year going through wizard therapy for his trauma and ptsd, and by the time Year 3 ends, Sirius is able to adopt Harry and gain his rights as guardian. (Remus no longer needs to hide because of Hesmina's active movements to get rid of the anti-werewolf legislations) (Wolfstar shipper, so id like to think Sirius and Remus rekindle their relationship and Harry gains two dads)
- Book 4, Harry gets entered into the Triwizard Tournament, majority of the same stuff happens, Solnus/Salazar goes under the lake instead of Ron, but Harry wins the last tournament alone, not with cedric. (aka cedric doesnt die) Voldemort is resurrected.
- Book 5 has Umbridge but the book is filled with Hesmina constantly showing up and debunking Umbridges methods and doing everything she can to get Umbridge fired. Hesmina ends up geting the minsiter and umbridge fired by the end of the year. the DA does get formed, Rosha's idea, the founders and Harry are the founders of the DA, except they call it FOCUS (Fair Outstanding Civilized Unified Students) (idk)
- Book 6 pretty much completely the same, except Draco does not get the dark mark nor does he get tasked with killing dumbledore. Bc of book 1, and the newfound unity, alot of the children of death eaters defect, and decide to support Harry (note: they dont support dumbledore or the light side. They support Harry who is GREY not light or dark) Voldemort doesnt have any student insiders at hogwarts, and find a different way to breach hogwarts. Dumbledore still dies. Severus doesnt. (note: severus is like a mentor to Harry, he sirius and remus apologize after year 4 and form a friendship)
- Book 7 has the hunt for horcruxes but instead of destroying the founders possessions, they find a way to extract the horcrux, put it into a different ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù and then destroy it. they also dont live in the woods. The founders have so many different safe houses with ancient ward magic that is so much safer and harder to breach and they just jump from a diff safe house every months. Wolfstar adopts teddy, NO ONE DIES except bellatrix, dobby, greyback, hedwig (im sorry!!) moody, dumbledore, and lavender.

notes: - salazar and godric never get into that huge fight and remain the best of friends - when the founders travel back in time, they create alternate versions of themselves that dont need to go back. so they can remain in that timeline forevermore. - harry, hermione, ron, blaise, dean are bisexual - draco, seamus, pansy, neville, ginny are gay - luna, charlie, fred, george are pansexual - some possible ships: Draco/Harry, Pansy/Hermione, Blaise/Neville, Luna/Ginny, Blaise/Ron, Dean/Seamus, Neville/Luna, Ron/Hermione, Blaise/Pansy - the founders either arent interested in dating or Godric/Salazar and Helga/Rowena.

what was supposed to be just a couple jotted down ideas has turned into me completely investing myself in this fic and planning it out for the past three hours. oops

i have a feeling this is somewhat of an overused trope with a twist, but it seems like such a cool idea.

should i attempt to write it? any thoughts ideas contributions i should include?

thanks for reading hah

He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

** One issue here is that it seems like the founders would be better at magic than say Snape. They lived a thousand years ago. Ancient ward magic? More like outdated security features.

A seer seems forced. Perhaps a magical accident? Etiquette is something that could be interesting to explore potential differences between wizarding and muggle cultures but almost always devolves into pureblood supremacy justification or just plain cringey actions.

The proportion of LGBT+ people seems relatively high and would be jarring. This may seem like a good way to explore the issues of LGBT+ people but honestly it seems trite and unfocuses the story. Is this a social commentary or a time travel story? A better alternative would be to focus on one LGBT+ person.

If you're going to redeem Draco, Pansy, and Blaise from being the racist filth they were in the books, make sure there is a reason. Do the founders (who have mysteriously mastered modern language - make up an explanation) show them the error of their ways? Are their parents no longer racists like in canon?

‚Äã

Horcrux transfer cheapens so much. It avoids the theme of destruction being easier than creation in canon and I think it would devalue the struggle. Plus the chance for the founders to make a hard choice could be an interesting struggle and plot point.

Don't do the grey/light/dark thing. Not canon, always overdone. One thing to have a fourth faction (canon: voldemort, order, ministry) crop up in a war, another entirely to have it called light/dark/grey.

‚Äã

I'm going to be honest and I don't think it's what you want to hear. I don't think this is ready to be written yet. At the moment, it seems like it'll be a canon rehash with every overdone trope from canon. "Wolfstar", ancient magic, manipulative dumbledore, alternate founders go back, etc. Besides the creepiness of adults traveling to the future and living with children, instead of actually making an impact more efficiently, it feels like all tension is being removed from the story. Racists aren't racist, good people don't die (except the ones that matter less emotionally to you - or at least it seems to me), werewolf legislation is repealed though it's unlikely society would be so quick to change, umbridge is easily fired, etc. Also I'm a little confused on how Sirius and Remus would adopt Teddy if he wouldn't come into existence if Sirius was with Remus. Honestly, this feels like complete wish fulfillment. I'd take some time and try to come up with a more focused story with more originality and conflict.

*** I don't think it would be outdated, rather I think it's more unknown magic, and security through obscurity is a much better way than to just be like ‚Äùwe've the best wards ever and you couldn't possibly break them‚Äù which is basically an invitation for wardbreakers

I would bet a lot that there are translation spells that work both ways when you're talking

(It could also be that the seer or whatever told them of the future and stuff taught them what they would need?)

Otherwise I agree

*** hm you actually made a lot of good points. to be completely fair i wrote all these ideas down at like 1am, and is im rereading this your completely right. im going to change things.

my idea with the ancient ward magic was that Ancient Magic hasn't been explored in a long time. think of the magic around Hogwarts. While it was possible to break(with hundreds of hundreds of ppl attacking them), those wards were still very strong.

im not sure about the magical accident :( i created the seer idea bc them traveling back in time is supposed to be something they can control. But i can see the appeal of an accident. it would add a bit more story and interest. hm ill see

hahshhdhw i went out of control im sorry. like i said it was 1am and i was just writing shit down. I honestly dont know if ill include any main relationships as it is, which is why i included it in the notes section. i want to focus more on the time travel aspect then that relationships.

I made Helga an adult, and they all traveled to 1990, a year before harry starts hogwarts. that year was meant for them to become accustomed to the time period and learn the ways of others. i would say the founders use translation spells while they are getting used to modern language.

Draco Blaise Pansy etc. their redemption is caused by the founders helping hogwarts form unity. With hogwarts unified, a lot of the children of blood purists realize that muggleborn children arent so bad. one of the main things i noticed in the books is that the Purebloods only hang out with other Purebloods. if they were to interact with halfbloods and muggleborns, they might begin to realize that some of the strife their parents said wasnt true. Salazar would be a slytherin, and with his friendship with Godric in gryffindor and Rowena in ravenclaw, i hoped that he would make the biggest impact on the way the Pureblood children saw things.

hm youre right. i was going to avoid them destroying the original horcruxes because it is obv their prized possessions, but you do make a good point. the destruction would be an interesting struggle.

so by the grey/light/dark i meant voldemort, order, ministry etc. i couldnt think of the right way to say it, so i just called it light/grey/dark. many people refer to the order as the light side and voldemort as the dark side, so i just kinda referred to harry as grey. i apologize.

i dont plan to have manipulative dumbledore. Wolfstar was an optional thing, im still iffy in including relationships in the story. and your right i am removing all the tension from the story. im going to go back and edit my notes and try and make it so its not just some bland story. i was being stupid with the who died who didnt. im most likely to go kill off everyone who died in canon. i do want the werewolf legislation to repealed, but i wanted Helga to start working on it in 1990, not 1994 when remus becomes proffesor. that way society has at least 4 years to get used to it. umbridge wont be easily fired, she has an upper position at the ministry. i wanted umbridge and helga to have conflicts throughout book 5 where helga is trying to get umbridge fired, but umbridge is so close to the minister that its practically impossible. at the end of Book 5, Helga manages to get her fired by compiling a list of all the illegal and wrong things Unbridge has done. There are definitely still going to be a couple of racist students, i cant remove them all. draco pansy blasie etc dont rly become ‚Äúnot racist‚Äù until like book 3-4. As for the Teddy thing, im sure wizard adoption exists, or they can get Tonks to surrogate the child.

i want to THANK YOU SO MUCH. this is exactly what i wanted to hear. i love constructive criticism and this told me exactly what i need to open my eyes on, what im being stupid about, what i should consider changing. This was a big help thank you!!!

** I think Of a Linear Circle series by flamethrower is somewhat similar linkao3(11284494). Though only Salazar is here in the present. Harry is gay, in this one, although I don't remember anyone elses orientation. Very well written, regularly updated, currently at something like 1,4 million words.

** Consider instead of a seer giving a prophecy, Roweena tried scrying 1000 years from then to see the glory of her school and saw a very grim future for Hogwarts, she then finds where her group could make the most changes, maybe sending Helga first, since she's agreeable, and after they all do the ritual one by one, Ravenclaw leaving last after Helena runs off with her Diadem and hearing of her death.
