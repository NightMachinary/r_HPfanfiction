** You're dangerously close to rule 8 on this anyway you look at it. Careful.

*** I think it's a direct violation. They're actively seeking smut where the main premise is that girls of 16/17 (who are for most legal purposes sexually mature adults) are somehow attracted to a pre pubescent child.

**** I'm not seeking smut? I meant that girls had an attraction to him when he was still a teen, and when he is a child they look after him.

** Why does this have to be sexual? Why would you want a story where people are being sexual with a little boy?

A story where Harry deages himself and Hermione and Ginny decide to give him the childhood he never had sounds like it could be awesome and cute.

A story where Harry deages himself and Hermione and Ginny decide they find 7 year old boys sexy sounds like something people go to prison for.

**** I think it's ok to judge people who want to read about sexual contact with primary school age children tbh.

Plus that sort of thing violates the rules of the sub. And is /illegal./

***** Maybe we can pray the kink away. Or maybe we can beat it out of them? Castration? People don't decide what their kinks are. It's an emergent result of their brain chemistry. The only thing you decide is your actions.

Illegal doesn't mean immoral and im not convinced its either. Its against reddits rules though, so this should be gone irregardless.

****** This is nothing sexual about my idea? Maybe the â€˜Momdom' part, but other than that? Really nothing

** I would initially say that this is like any other time travel fic where an older Harry ends up in a younger body. So in one way he is mentally the same age as the girls, just not physically.

However the OP stated that he lost his memories so he wouldn't know he was older. So definitely not my cup of tea.
