For September let's go for a comedy.


** I bring you all the hilarious, but maybe somewhat short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons With Hagrid]]. It's funny, it's silly and it's great!

Another one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All the Dementors of Azkaban]], a great laugh. Somewhat cracky and an absolute joy to read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]]

So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN. Rated: Fiction K+ - English - Humor/Parody - Harry P. - Chapters: 50 - Words: 162,700 - Reviews: 9,817 - Favs: 11,320 - Follows: 4,765 - Updated: Dec 23, 2009 - Published: Sep 13, 2008 - Status: Complete - id: 4536005

Complete and wonderful and pretty long. I'm sure most of you have heard of it if not read it as it's pretty popular.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match][The Original Naked Quidditch Match]]

When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control. Rated: Fiction T - English - Humor - Harry P. - Chapters: 10 - Words: 22,510 - Reviews: 758 - Favs: 2,935 - Follows: 431 - Published: Jul 29, 2007 - Status: Complete - id: 3689325

Takes half a chapter to get used to the mmail format but totally worth it. This was one of the first fics I ever read ans it's hilarious. Even if it doesn't get picked I recommend reading it, it's not too long.

** Comedy has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]

Hands down one of the funniest fics I've ever read before.

That or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]

*** The Lie I've Lived is really great, but it isn't really comedy imo, though it obviously has comedy elements. A Black Comedy is also great and /is/ a comedy, so I'd pick that one.

** I'd like to suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]] by Chipmonkonspeed. It's hysterical, brilliant, and, to my mind at least, underappreciated!

** Oh, I'd say [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] by Rorschach's Blot

Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

or [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4036037/1/Two-Weeks-in-the-Alley][Two Weeks in the Alley]] by BajaB

13 years old, a vault full of gold, and two unsupervised weeks in Diagon Alley -- What's a boy to do? Summer before PoA AU, some adult themes.

Harry Potter - Rated: K+ - English - Humor - Chapters: 1 - Words: 12,075 - Reviews: 279 - Favs: 1,892 - Follows: 368 - Published: Jan 26, 2008 - Harry P. - Complete

Both classics and with less adult content than The Lie I've Lived or A Black Comedy.

**** I think you're thinking of Partially-Kissed Hero.

Dumbledore is not the villain in Make A Wish, though he does get some criticism. There are a few canon-related errors that arise from it being published before the last book was written and it's never been through an edit so there's a wide range of formatting and word-substitution errors, but it's still a hilarious romp.

** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter, the Geek]] The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc. Rated: Fiction M - English - Humor/Adventure - Harry P. - Chapters: 23 - Words: 65,238 - Reviews: 338 - Favs: 880 - Follows: 717 - Updated: Jun 7 - Published: Oct 30, 2013 - Status: Complete - id: 9807593

I laughed out loud almost as much as from A Black Comedy and this one is lesser known. Its full of pretty contemporary references to internet jargon and anime, totally worth a read for fellow geeks!
