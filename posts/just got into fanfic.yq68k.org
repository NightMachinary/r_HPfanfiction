Finished reading "Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood" as well as "Searching for the power" and "the last horcrux". Anyone know of any other good fanfic stories? Looking mainly for things that happened after the war ends up until the epilogue from DH. Any recommendation's would be greatly appreciated!!!!


** Okay, none of these /really/ match what you're looking for, but I can guarantee they are all excellent.

These take place after the war, although they aren't epilogue compliant:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/][Unatoned]] By SeriousScribble

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]] By Matt Silver 3k

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon

A few more which are from during the war, and /very/ AU

The Denarian Series By Shezza88, starting with [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The_Denarian_Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]]. These are crossovers with the Dresden Files, but any non-HP stuff is very well explained.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] by Joe6991, and its sequel.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The_Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] By enembee. Also check out everything else this guy's written, it's all awesome.

And when you're done with those check out many more excellent stories [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/][here]].

** Anything by little0bird is great It's all next generation stuff. The first day picks up right where deathly hallows left off. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]] And this is my absolute favorite fic. Ever. It's so cute and funny and... Just read it now. It's a next gen with Lily Luna and Jacob Wood [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=243629]]
