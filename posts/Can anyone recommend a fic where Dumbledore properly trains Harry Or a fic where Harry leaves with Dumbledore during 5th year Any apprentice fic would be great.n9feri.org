#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

It's hot Hermione bashing , Harry/Daphne paring and I think it's leaning into Indy Harry.. I read it long ago so I'm not sure about a lot of the detaila, but there is an apprenticeship.
