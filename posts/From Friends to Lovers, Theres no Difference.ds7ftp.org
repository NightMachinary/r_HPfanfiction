Any fanfics, preferably in Fanfiction.net, that have Harry and another female as really, really close friends. So close that once they become a couple, their interactions don't change that much. Apart from the new intimacy as a couple, everything else is the same for them. No Harry/Ginny please. AUs, timetravel, Dimesion travel, and everything else is welcomed.


** Linkffn(13147431)

After one too many angst-filled FWB -> lovers fic, I decided to write one where the transition from friends with benefits to lovers doesnot really change anything.

**** Smut in longer fics gets repetitive really quickly, and writing good, explicit scenes is one of the most difficult things to do. Like, I have read a lot of fanfics across a few fandoms, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of 10 where it was really done well.

As for a 50 chapter romance, I really struggle when making one-shots into something longer because it is impossible to capture the same spirit; the same narrative tone. And I am quite busy with other projects. I have two ongoing fics (150k words combined) and am working on two other fics as well as at least 2 WiPs. So I am sorry to say, but it won't happen anytime soon.

****** I am not sure if that would capture the same spirit as their relationship would be at the "couple" stage and lose its defining characteristic as "failed" FWB.

I might end up writing more in the same universe eventually, but right now I am working on a Christmas chapter for another fic (No Longer Alone), so writing another Christmas scene is out of the question for the near future.

****** The thing is, a lot of people want smut. In one of my fics, Harry gets a "You as a girl" polyjuice set as Christmas present from his girlfriend Tonks. And that promptly got me a lot of requests for an explicit scene. I mean, I don't know a guy who wouldn't want to experience sex from the female perspective, which is why I even came up with the idea in the first place, but the thirst for porn really surprised me back then. And I don't think it would have added much to the story in terms of anything really.

****** The thing is, usually, when I write something, I start because I am annoyed by the way a fic I've read turned out. For example, I started to write "No Longer Alone" because I couldn't find one where Harry gets an adoptive family and does NOT end up banging someone from said family. I wrote "Bad at This" because I was annoyed by the angst in the FWB fics I came across. I am writing a Clone Wars oneshot because there was no fic similar to what I was looking for (SW is one of those fandoms which is too canon-compliant IMO)

So usually, I have a very clear idea of what I want to do, what note to end on and so on. And once I get to that point, I have no idea how to continiue.

******* And so you choose to end them? Honestly, that might be smart, so many fics turn bad bc they continue writing after reaching the goal for their fic. Like, yes I'd love to know how it goes for Harry and Hermione at her parents house in Bad At This or how the rest of the school reacts to them becoming public, but as it is, Bad At This is so good and complete, there really is no need to. I think the way you do things is good (just read Stop Worrying For One Evening, loved it) so I guess I'm trying to say don't feel bad for not giving in to greedy readers asking for more, we're stupid and can't realise that the more we're asking for is not gonna be as good, like addicts.

Quick Edit: I'm obsessed with GenderBender Harry, particularly To Reach Without by InwardTransience (it's so good). Lots of other gb Harry fanfics are really terribly written, do you have any qualms with them and would write something to that effect?

You either die as a hero or live long enough to become a villain. And I'd rather not have my fics compared to struggling artists who drag themselves on stage after 30 years because they need the cash.

#+begin_quote
  gender-bending
#+end_quote

The thing is, in my friend circle, we played that one through, and pretty much all of us agreed that, if we, for whatever reason, ended up in a woman's body, none of us would leave the house for the next few days because we would be "busy". And if it's long-term, well, time to dress butch and be a lesbian. We all agreed that it wouldn't be a downgrade.

The thing which really annoys me about them is that Harry suddenly embraces the social side of being a woman with the usual stereotypes (liking make-up, dresses and so on) but struggles with his body. If I were to write one, it would just be business as usual with the exception that Harry now has different plumbing. Which would be a novelty for a week, but get boring rather quickly. So I am not sure if I would be the best to write such a fic.

Oh, yeah, I agree haha, no offense, you're a great writer, but obviously genderbending is not your category haha. GenderBender Harry is probably wish-fulfillment for those of us that enjoy reading them.

Well, I'd argue that "become a woman because you're curious what it would be like" is its own kind of wish-fulfilment.

*********** Yeah I guess.

I just finished reading No Longer Alone and I'm absolutely in love with the fic but ffn won't let me leave a review so just wanted to let you know I LOVE IT and can't wait for the next chapter. I'm all for Dumbledore-bashing but I love the unique way you decided to portray him (hands off and not just a "dumb light side"). I'm so sure there will be repercussions for his weakening influence compared to cannon, so I cant wait to see what goes down.
