Looking for any fics where wizards are dismissive of muggles and technology because wizards have it all, and much better versions through magic. Would also appreciate having a justifiable reason for disliking muggleborns ( such as them not conforming to the new culture/them thinking everything muggle is backwards etc)

*** That fic is more "holy crap, we are totally slackassing here. The muggles advanced farther than us, we have to do something!" And then they actually did something about it and outstripped them again. And then the wizardwank starts heavily.

I do like that fic's alternative explanation on why the Weasleys are bloodtraitors. And no, it isn't about them being muggle lovers.

I love this series. It rewrites canon in just the right places to uproot the whole plot. I still don't have a plausible reason for Ginny acting the way she does... The diary? I don't know...

** To a small extent, Victoria Potter by Taure. Much less focus on the wizard wank compared to the actual story, but it's clear from the text that Wizards just have it better in every way.

** Will be hard to find something like that, mostly because it is close to impossible to make believable. The only way I can think of would be a completely different dimension that some character got dropped in.

I mean some fields you can easily make believable, like medicine, economy, travel, etc.

But technology? No idea how anybody would make it believable that wizards have better versions of current high tech.

In case you end up toning down the request, I think I got some "wizard wank" fics. But nothing as extreme as you are currently looking for.

  “All those substitutes for magic Muggles use --- electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things --- they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air. No, Rita's using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. . . . If I could just find out what it is . . . ooh, if it's illegal, I'll have her . . .”
#+end_quote

Hermione, muggleborn, calls technology "substitutes", which implies inferiority.

Healing - repair and cure all mundane illnesses and injuries. A single spell is fix a broken arm. 6-8 weeks in the real world.

Transporation - teleportation. Say no more. Leisurely transport? Enchanted cars, enchanted trains, flying brooms. Artistic inspiration taken from the muggles, but the actual workings are very much magical.

Surveillance system? - muggles have systems that rely on physical objects near the people being surveilled, whether it be cameras, microphones, or someone's electronics whose data is being tapped. Wizards have the trace, the taboo, and the marauder's map. Two of them are nation wide systems and are incredibly sophisticated. You can't hide from them easily either. Can't hide from a taboo even with magical means. The other is a real time tracking system that defies concealment. Hiding your face is enough to defy facial recognition, literally changing your entire body is not enough to defy magical surveillance.

AI - portraits, ghosts. If you take fanon, maybe those brains in the DoM as well.

Other technological features - I see little reason as to why magic would not be able to mimic the other functions of technology. Technology is the muggle substitute for magic, after all. Technology allows muggles to communicate without magic, a substitute for communication with magic. Wizards can create shooting stars, change the weather, and bend reality with a wave. They literally take muggle inventions and make them better in the books.

**** I did say that it would be easy to make believable for medicine and travel. Why then do you reply as if I said the opposite?

I also never said that they couldnt do it. I said it would not be believable in the context set by JKR and therefore be a hard request to fulfill. In which I feel validated if the whole fandom turns up two fics that fit the request, and even then it is questionable if either of them actually does fulfill the whole request.

So while your reply was great and brought up interesting points that I actually didn't think about, you didn't really counter the main point of my comment: There are no fics that 100% fulfill the request, only very few that maybe roughly fit.

***** Your point was that it would be rather impossible to create a fic that the OP wanted while remaining faithful to HP, hence the unlikeliness of finding such a fic.

My point was that it would be more true to HP if the world building was along the lines of OP's thinking.

#+end_quote

As you undoubtedly noted, I then used multiple examples of current functions technology performs, beyond simply medicine and travel, to illustrate this point.

And no, I didn't bother to discuss your belief on the lack of fics based on the OP's request. I chose to discuss the point that belief is predicated upon.
