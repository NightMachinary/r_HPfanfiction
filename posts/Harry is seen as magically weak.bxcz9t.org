*** Yeah that certainly wasn't what I was expecting. And yet, I definitely should have expected that.

  There is no Boy-Who-Lived; Albus Dumbledore defeated Voldemort and destroyed his Horcruxes. Harry grows up as an ordinary boy---a very ordinary boy, with barely more magic than a Squib. He sets out to prove himself, but in private, because he doesn't want to see the disappointment in everyone's eyes if he fails. And that leads him to a very strange relationship, mediated by stubbornness on both sides, with Severus Snape.

*** Thanks for the link. Was a surprisingly decent read (not a fan of the Harry/Snape pairing /at all/). To anyone who's interested in the fic but squeamish about the pairing too, the romance is pretty much non-existent in the first half and you can almost trick yourself into thinking it's a mentor-mentee relationship. Light hints of it work itself in throughout the second half, then the heaviest parts (which are quite skimmable cos most of the plot is done by then) are only in the last 500-1000 words or so.

**** I didn't see the pairing coming until tchapter 8, and it was really interesting up to that point where it got creepy.

***** Yeah, might be biased, but the romance seemed to appear quite awkwardly and suddenly, which did not help lessen the pairing's inherent creepiness.
