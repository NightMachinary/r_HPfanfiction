Also, I'm looking for a story that took place right after the battle of hogwarts. I only remember the beginning, when Harry was under his cloak in the great hall, and thinking of what to do, and decided to go talk to Malfoy and give him his wand back. Ring a bell?

Tons of them.

On the comedy side:

- Harry Potter and the Natural 20
- Seventh Horcrux
- Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them
- The middle half of HPMOR

On the more serious side:

- The Arithmancer
- Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time
- The Lie I've Lived

**** It's a somewhat popular complete Harry Potter fanfic called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Noteworthy for its annoying main character, various attempts to criticize JKR's worldbuilding, and author tract for his brand of rationalism, it garners a lot of criticism in most HP fanfiction communities, including this one. It is very long. I'd characterize the writing as technically middling, which is above average for fanfictions in general but below average for /good/ fanfictions.

People tend to have strong opinions pro- and anti- HPMOR.

*** I disagree. I think that, while its premise is good, and it even does some tropes well, overall the plot is way too convoluted and boring. I think I stopped about 75% of the way through the first year, simply because of the constant collecting of friends and the overcomplication of magic. From what I read about the later part of it, it only serves to get more convoluted.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Resigned to a life of servitude as a Courtesan, Harry is instead drawn under the wing of the Dark Lord himself. Between the scheming Order and his powerful benefactor, Harry finds himself steadily drawn deeper into the growing conflict. Eventual Lord Voldemort/Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** Yes, I didn't like books 5 and 6; I actively hate book 7. For that matter, not too chuffed up on book 1. I have only watched the first three movies.

Series I've enjoyed more than the books:\\
Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle; The Seventh Horcrux; Too Young to Die; G is for Gabrielle)

There are more, but my memory isn't amazing so those are the ones that come quickly to mind.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Considering that I majorly dislike the books and think that Rowling is a mediocre writer, the bar for fanfiction I like more than the books is pretty low.

Yes, she made billions. No, I have not. Doesn't mean she didn't completely miss on the potential of her idea, *in my opinion*. Plot holes, ridiculous scenarios, constant duex ex machina, fundamentally unlikable characters, the list goes on and on.
