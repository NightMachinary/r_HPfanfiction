Hello everyone! I'm a reporter, working on a story about FanFics as a way to deal with pandemic-related anxiety. If you just got into reading fanfics or have been reading more than you used to, I'd love to hear your experience!


** Boredom mostly. I don't have the time/mental energy to read fanfics much anymore but I couldn't fall asleep the other night and accidentally read a 70k fic instead.

*** I get that! I read a 100k one a few days ago--but it took me a few days. Do you know of anyone who got into reading HP fanfics (or any fanfic really) during COVID-19?

** I read fanfiction pretty regularly, so the global situation has only impacted my habits slightly in that regard. That being said, I found myself returning to HP specifically during this time because it's a damn good comfort fandom. There's just so much to read. You're pretty much set for the long haul and even less popular ships or characters still have content, which is not always the case.

** I use reading fanfiction as a way of coping with my severe anxiety, so it's been extra helpful this month. Granted, I've been an avid fanfiction reader for a long time, but it's especially useful when I desperately need a distraction.

** I frequently read fanfiction and have done for years before COVID-19 was around. For me it's a large source of entertainment but I also find it calming and it helps me cope with stress.

** It's comfort food, basically. I don't have to learn about new worlds, customs, or peoples when I read fan fiction. It's easily digestible and it's fun to see how people utilize the same universe in different ways.

** Personally, I love reading books. I can't really go to the library because of quarantine, and I don't want to reread all of my books at home, so I started reading some of the HP fan fiction I used to read. Then I started looking at more threads and learned about more fan fiction I was interested in, and it just progressed from there. I am currently juggling 4 fan fictions right now.

** Exploration and mental exercise. The Harry Potter books are written from an extremely politically centrist viewpoint, frustrating me to no end, because the characters rarely act in human ways, forgetting things constantly, never being proactive - hell, Hermione and Ron turn their brains off in book six just so that Harry has to struggle all by himself. In fanfiction, often times the what-ifs fanfictions are based on are just people writing Harry Potter characters as real humans.

** Well think about it. Why do people watch more Netflix now? What's up with all these Instagram-Challenges?\\
Most people just start craving 'normal' social interactions. That's why Netflix watchrates have skyrocketed. And Fanfiction ist the same: People start imagining themselves in this world where 'normal' interactions are still possible.

** So I haven't been reading as much as usual because my focus has been terrible throughout all of this, but as an author that finished a semi-popular fic in mid-February and then saw it suddenly explode in popularity once the world got shut in... the number of reviews that have come in saying "I stayed up until 5am/6am/7am reading this" are absolutely astounding me.

** While I've been reading fanfic regularly for the past year, I've felt the need to change some of the tropes I used to search for. There's so much angst, anxiety and unknowns happening around us that I want fics that focus on positivity, hope, friendship, and camaraderie.

** I seldom read fanfiction during my usual routine because I tend to obsess with one story and my job and law school don't allow me to give it as much time as I want to, so when my government established mandatory quarantine I took advantage and started reading fanfiction again. Although I still work and study from home, not having to travel makes me able to read more.

** Honestly... it's the escape. Going back to those familiar characters. It's a safe space. Facebook and twitter are inundated with pandemic/coronavirus/COVID-19/politicking talk and debate. And honestly, I'm tired of it. I just want to read some adventure stories.
