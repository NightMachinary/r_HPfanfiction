I honestly haven't read the books in at least eight years. Was the trope of Zabini's mom being a black widow canon? Or did some clever person come up with it and everyone just kind of absorbed it?


** It's canon! I'm pretty sure it's alluded to in the 6th book in one of the chapters with the Slug Club, I believe it was the first one with them all on the Hogwarts Express

**** No worries! I found the exact quote for ya

“Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).”

***** Now make it super tragic and turn the trope on its head and have her be cursed to never be able to keep a marriage partner! :( Like the DADA curse except someone put it on her as revenge a long time ago. :( :( The gold being left for her is just a happy side effect since she keeps falling in love with rich people, but it can't ever replace the person!

****** I read a fic once where her first wife was killed by Death Eaters, so she made it her personal goal in life to kill everyone responsible for it. What made it even more heartbreaking was she actually fell in love with one of the dudes and he loved her back :'( I think I actually cried reading that.

But yes in this house we support defenestrating tropes.

  Arania Zabini forges her grief into something more useful: first anger, then a passion for revenge.

****** I had that idea too. Its more original and less sexist than the "gold-digging black widow" trope.

Of course, after the first few lovers dropped dead, you'd think she'd figure out she might be cursed. But then she might start trying to game the curse, by only dating people who have terminal illnesses already, or something (like Dumbledore seems to have tried to game the DADA professor curse by hiring people he wanted to get rid of, like Lockhart).

There have been /several/ serial murderers that did exactly that: Marry rich people and then "mysteriously" they die, leaving everything to them.
