If you hate reading on FF.net on mobile because of small text, use Brave browser and turn on Simplified View in settings, there should then be a little pop up at the bottom of the screen every time you start a story. It allows you to adjust text size by zoom, and keeps good spacing. Also loads a bunch of chapters at a time.

Also there's the whole browser tracing issue that brave prevents but thats a side benefit lol.


** You can also scroll to the bottom of the page and change the text size, it's a feature on the ffn website.

** In the bottom of the page, you will have a option to select font size, small, medium, large and XL as far as I remember

But just switch to the app, it is actually much better

** Also, more browsers (certainly my Firefox) have Reader View (small book-like icon on the right side of the URL bar).

** Also has anyone noticed that you can't use desktop mode anymore, or is that just my phone being weird? Cuz when I got to FF.net I scroll to the bottom and it's just not there anymore.
