The story is very similar to linkffn(Heart over Mind by Regann). Hermione is dosed with a love potion (I don't remember if it's part of class like HOM or if it's just her), but rather than not having a reaction because she already has a soul mate like in HOM, she doesn't react because the effects induced by the love potion are no different than what she already feels every day and she's used to ignoring it and not letting it show. I read it so long ago that I'm not even sure it was particularly well-written, but it has been popping up in my brain off and on for months and I want to re-read it to get it out of there! Thanks!

  PART 27 ADDED, COMPLETE. Something odd about Hermione causes her to have unexpected reaction to a love potion. Only it's one which no one expected. How could a lack of reaction cause so much trouble? AU to Books 5 and 6.

** Heart over Mind is the only fic with this theme that I've read.

You should try asking over at the [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/][SS/HG LiveJournal page]]. If anyone knows the answer to your question, it would be someone there.
