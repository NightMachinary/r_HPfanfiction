I've read a few and the idea really appeals to me. Looking for any recommendations for fics I might not have come across.


** What ones have you read?

Would make it easier to recommend things.

I think that this should fit the criteria.

This story was hyped up a decent amount for a little while and didn't really manage to live up to what people wanted.

Despite that, it does well enough at telling a story, and considering the niche, it is pretty decent.

Edit: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun]])

linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1965345/1/Back-to-the-future]])

No clue about either of these stories, just what I found in a cursory search. Might be something you like, might not.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
