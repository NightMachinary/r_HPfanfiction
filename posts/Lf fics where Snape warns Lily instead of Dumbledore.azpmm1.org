*** I always figured the reason he went to Dumbledore in first place was because Lily was outside his reach, otherwise I really can't see him go to Dumbledore as a fully-fledged Death Eater (who has little reason not to just chuck him into Azkaban).

***** None of these methods gurantee that Lily actually bothers to listen to him. Additionally, I'm not sure if full-on DE Severus is able to cast a Patronus (which apparently need you to have a pure heart to work). I always figured it was something Dumbledore teached him to master once he became a spy.

Even if he was able to cast one, would he really want to show her its form -- and the obvious implications?
