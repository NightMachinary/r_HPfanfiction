I'm sorry. It popped in my head, and I just /had/ to post it.


** I know what this is a reference to and that episode still kind of freaks me out man. It's the only one that I remember just creeping me out even though that whole show is creepy.

*** Doug Walker just recently did a video about the episode about Naughty Fred, mentioning how it was one of the creepiest episodes of /Courage the Cowardly Dog/, and someone responded in the comments

**** Yeah Ramses is like the scariest thing in that entire show. I watched this show as a kid and I have no idea why it was considered a kids show because the crap that this show is just way too creepy. And it says something that the first thing that I think when I remember this show is Ramses even after a years of having this show ended and that thing still creeps me out to this day when I get reminded of him.

***** I think I have to go back and watch the whole episode. Every time I hear it, I just think of how /silly/ it is. "Kiiiiiing Ramses! /The man in gauze! The man in gauze!/"

******** For whatever reason the other episodes never really screamed creepy to me as a kid besides Ramses I just thought that it was a really weird show and didn't think anything of it. And now looking back I can see that this show was freaking crazy and I think that's kind of weird that I never really saw this as creepy and I don't think I was that young that I wouldn't understand what the show was really about. Pretty sure that I was in the 5-8 ish range if I was going to guess my age and I understood what creepy stuff was at the age range to so kind of weird.
