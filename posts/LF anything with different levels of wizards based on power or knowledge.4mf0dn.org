Looking for fics where there are different levels of being a wizard. Something like wizard, warlock, sorcerer etc. or something with guilds or groups based off skills such as enchanting or war wizards.


** linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope)

Not very Narutoey, despite the premise, but a large amount of Nasuverse crossover. Power levels, etc. discussed in detail. The fic was rewritten, but I haven't read it yet, so can't recommend it yet. Titled Fractal, by the same author.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** linkffn(Only Enemies) is really good. Harry went way dark to beat Voldemort (with Dumbledore's help) and ends up getting sent to another dimension as the battle ends. It's got great fight scenes. This is pretty much the only Harry Bella ship I've enjoyed all the way through.

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
