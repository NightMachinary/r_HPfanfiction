** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]] is a brilliant telling of Snape's year as headmaster. I remember once I was using text-to-voice to listen to People of the Goddess, and my husband asked me if I was listening to the books.

*** Nice thanks it looks interesting

Also it's wild that some people can put over 100k words of effort into stories and get so unlucky to get so few hits on their works.

**** You're not wrong in general, but luckily that wasn't the case for this story! [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=93566&textsize=0&chapter=1][It was originally posted]] on mugglenetfanfiction.com and ended up being named Best General Fic by the site in 2017! Honestly, MNFF is probably the ideal site to read it on, because I noticed that when the author imported it into AO3, it led to occasional weird punctuation errors in the story.

** It diverges quite a bit by year 7, but if you're looking for that kind of Snape, you might find linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) to be quite interesting. Harry has more interest in potions, and so he spends more time around Snape. This does not make either of them particularly happy (but it's very funny!).

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** I disapprove of both pairings, but I'm of the school that believes that post-War Snape /was/ a significantly better person, and not just acting out of love for Lily alone. Oh, he could never shed his inner pettiness and other unpleasant characteristics --- but however flawed, I don't think it's inaccurate to say 1997 Snape was "kind of a good person".

*** He was definitely a better person and was working for forces of good, and did some good things- but I wouldn't call him a good /person/ in the slightest.

I believe the only thing he was acting out of beyond a love for Lily was his respect for Dumbledore, which is something yeah, but it doesn't make him a good person.

**** That's a valid interpretation, but my interpretation (and I think it's Rowling's too, given how she speaks of the character in interviews, though, of course, Death of the Author and all that) has always been that Lily's death was a catalyst for his realizing quite how horrible the things he and the Death Eaters did really were.

** linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is often recommended for this, it's a complete retelling of Snape's life from his perspective. I've only ever read it up to him starting at Hogwarts and enjoyed the writing but was just kind of put off by the overall length. I'd imagine it still makes sense even if you only read the last few chapters about the Deathly Hallows time period.

*** In all fairness, the story does make snape out to be a better person than canon would imply, so you might not find what you're looking for here OP. It is, however, a wonderfully written story and I wholly recommend it on that basis alone. Even knowing how the story inevitably ends, the final chapters hit me like a punch to the gut.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
