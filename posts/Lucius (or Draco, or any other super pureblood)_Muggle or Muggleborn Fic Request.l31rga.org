(Meant to add this to the title but it won't let me change it now- NO Hermione. Preferably an OC or a canon character that isn't super popular/elaborated on) Hi! I don't know where to begin with this ship, but here goes. If anyone has any fic recs where a very old school pureblood, preferably Lucius but I'm down for others, falls in love with a muggle or muggleborn and has an "oh shit" moment, that's what I'm looking for. They can be together, he can denounce the other person, literally anything, I just want the pureblood to legitimately fall in love with the muggle/muggleborn, while at the same time, it's in character as much as possible. The other person can be any gender, so can the pureblood. Thank you!

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law trope. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
