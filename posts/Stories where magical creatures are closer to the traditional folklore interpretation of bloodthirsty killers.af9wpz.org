We all know the stories where Harry or Hermione take up the banner of the werewolf cause and prove the world that they are harmless and the laws against them are baseless.

But what about stories where Lupin is the exception to werewolves and not the norm? Where the Forbidden Forest is off limits because the Centaurs rape every woman they can get their hands on and even raid Hogsmeade. Where Vampires are a dangerous threat and not Slughorn's party guests. Where Dragons were hunted to extinction because they had a habit or razing entire villages.

Preferably with Harry and/or Hermione as monster hunters. No Death Eater revisionism, no m/m and preferably as little of the Weasleys and Lupin as possible.

Canon does imply this actually. Most other werewolves rally under Greyback, and Lupin's efforts to stop them from joining Voldemort's side fail completely.

*** I agree - I've always thought it was notable that just a scratch from Fenrir in human form was enough to leave a curse scar that started affecting Bill's personality.

Sure, it was mostly just liking really rare steak. But it makes you wonder how much a bite under the full moon would normally change a person.

** Magical creatures in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) are ruthless and closer to folklore (but obviously much closer to DnD).

** linkffn(11191235) has werewolves as truly terrifying beasts whose feral nature carries over into their human form, with Remus Lupin as the exception who remains sane by dint of massive levels of mental and spiritual effort. And is still a terrifying ravening beast on full moons.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
