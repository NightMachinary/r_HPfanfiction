I am a Snape fan and would love to find some new fics with him as a key character that I may have missed, I generally read Snarry or Severitus, so obviously there's a massive range of other pairings I'm missing out on, as well as fics with no main pairings. I prefer fics over 50k words and MUST be complete.


** I like fics in which Snape is still misanthropic and antisocial like in canon but also has meaningful friendships with his colleagues and takes his job seriously. Here are my favorites along those lines:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] linkffn(11687216)
- [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] - (Completed story on Wordpress) Hermione's time turner breaks during an accident in Potions class, trapping the entirety of Hogwarts in an endless loop of repeating the same day over and over. Snape and Hermione are the only people who realize what is going on.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]]) is a fic that chronicles Snape from conception to his funeral, it's /mostly/ canon compliant and I would say fully expect there are some minor things you have to get over. I thought although it might have been /too/ Snape-apologist, it was an excellent charcaterization

*** I had 2 minor nitpicks with this fic: 6-7th year interactions between Severus and Lily portray them as remaining somewhat decent acquaintances (even if their close friendship was mostly destroyed after the OWL incident), while my headcanon has them only talk when absolutely necessary in canon during this time, and the very jarring way Severus' questioning of Harry in his first Potions lesson is explained (the fic doesn't try to justify his behaviour, but Severus' own reasoning of the ordeal is something I found to be outright bizarre).

Otherwise, I really liked the fic. I especially like how it portrays parts of his life that basically no other fic does -- Severus' life before Hogwarts /in detail/ (some fics speed through 1969-1971 giving some backstory to the Sev&Lily friendship, but very little beyond that -- his home life in depth, years before 1969, etc), and his life at Hogwarts during 1981-1991, including some extra plots that could plausibly be canon-compilant while remaining interesting to read.

**** I agree that at some points that the fic goes a bit /too/ far to explain Snape's most ridiculous behavior and I definitely agree with the fact that Snape and Lily would have only spoke in class after the Mudblood-incident. However, I don't think that these minor issues detract the fic so they're honestly not that big of a deal IMHO

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I have a hard time with straight Severitus stories, if they don't deal thoroughly with the fact that the canonical Snape character was truly quite disgusting figure (a teacher which achieves to be a boggart of his student?). There has to be so persuasive conversion story, otherwise it feels silly. However, exactly a good conversion/repentence story could be a foundation of a good fanfic, but I am still looking for one.

Having said that, there are some stories which are better than others, where Snape is taken at least favorably:

- linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) --- focus is on Harmony story with rather quite nice characterizations of Grangers, George & Fred, and quite interesting pair (not a romantic one, just friends) of professors McGonagall & Snape
- linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) --- fem!Harry (one those on-seventeenth-birthday-Harry-gets-another-gift-he-didnt-expected), rather nice story, too much explicit sex (including horrible magic-causes-wizards-to-be-oversexed trope), and BDSM (not presented) done by the Snape & Hermione pair. One of those stories which are actually harmed by too much porn elements. But Snape is rather well done. Even better portrait of Snape is adjacent one-shot linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao).
- Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel --- it has been linkffn(9931566), but it is gone now; you can get links to the alternate sources in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my review]]. I would really like to like it, but ... see the review.

  A young Severus makes yet another mistake, and discovers that it's not only joining the Death Eaters that has far-reaching consequences.This is a prequel to 'Becoming Harriet', dealing with Robin's early life. It's going to be episodic and fluffy, and will probably be most interesting if you've read at least a bit of Harriet!
