Hey! I have a problem with fanfics in which they're never long enough or memorable. I want to find a good NSFW one similar to The Sword of Gryffindor to binge read in a couple of days. I'd rather not read an abandoned one or one that's not very long(maybe around 100k words minimum). Any suggestions help

That moment when you just want to jack off and somehow stumbles on the best depiction of the three hallows you've ever seen in fanfiction in between Harry fucking girls till' they can't walk. Just... smh.

*** Obligatory "This fic was started before Book7 released. So lots of things were different or not present at all. Horcruxes are different, in different locations, or not present at all. The Potter cottage from halloween '81 may or may not be a theme park ride."

** Protection: the sword and the shield by bishop2420 is my all time favorite when it comes to nsfw, completely over the top but still a very cool storyline. Not finished but it is still sporadically being updated.
