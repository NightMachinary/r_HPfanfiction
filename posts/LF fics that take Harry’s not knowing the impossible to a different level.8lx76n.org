I remember a fic where Harry was able to get multiple animagus forms and there was a spell that created a torrent of fire.

Anything similar?


** Harry Potter series by semprini (veil of mystery, ring of reduction)

It's super long though

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

** This reminds me a fic I read a long time ago, in which Harry can do anything with magic as long as he is not told it's impossible. So one scene has him summoning food out of nothingness, because he wasn't explained the Law that theoretically prevented this. Hermione (and I think Ron and Ginny?) realize what he can do and strive to prevent him from learning of any other limits to Magic.

*** It must be from Jeconnais, the one that is a Hinny. It was really good at the time but just cringy now.
