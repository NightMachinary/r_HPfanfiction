Does anyone else roll there eyes when they come across works about him being "neutral" or him creating a /third/ side to the war as if some 15 yr old could actually do that or if it would help the situation at all


** I roll my eyes when there are factions at all in HP fanfic. "The Light" sounds ridiculous, especially when the worldbuilding starts adding more and more on, to the extent where there's "The Grey" faction, and Dumbledore is a Light Lord.

It's even worse when the author throws in strawman political positions for each faction, like The Dark being a pureblood frat full of pagans, while The Light is deep into the Muggle rights activism, even when it's dangerous to wizards. And Dumbledore is revealed to have sealed the Potters' will to keep Harry with the Dursleys... as a way to make him ignorant uneducated about his inheritance, and sympathetic to Muggles. Too bad it backfired, lmao.

When you see it pop up, you just know that all this worldbuilding has been added in to make the setting more /political/, so your indie shit-stirrer Lord Hadrian Potter-Black can step in and take charge, as you said, by creating a third side.

** Problem with "Independent!Harry" is that, at least in all the fics I've read is that he comes across as a child throwing a temper tantrum because not everything goes his way, and who thinks the way to being viewed as adult and worthy of respect is to talk in a really pompous way, and make threats whenever someone doesn't immediately bow down, worship him and make him the absolute center of their lives.

"Third side" or "grey Harry" usually just means "Harry goes around doing whatever he wants, refuses to cooperate with anyone, and acts like a total dick, and somehow that proves he's better than Dumbledore."

I mean, say what you will about Dumbledore, but at least he is POLITE.

** The only way to make a proper Independent!Harry work, while he's Hogwarts age and without sticking an older mind into Harry's body, is for Harry to be the figurehead but not the leader.

He might well be helping call the shots - for example, if it's Sirius in charge, then he'll obviously try to incorporate Harry's goals - but he won't have final authority, because he's a teenager. Training him to become that leader provides plenty of fodder for the writer to work with.

** I like Harry leading his own faction, but not as a <16 years old with ridiculous power progression/wank.

In fact, a mature Harry running his own show has generated some of the best and most popular fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106): You have to admit that Harrymort is totally independent and does whatever he wants to.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry finally says "fuck it" and slaps down that incorrigible Ministry & Wizengamot. He puts both Kingsley and McGonagall in their places.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): When he returns, he has lots of fun running his indie operations behind the scene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): He manipulates people around him into cult-like following and pushes relentless for his own agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): He and Sirius are doing whatever they think is fun or right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): He is totally the third faction and he will destroy the other two.

**** Here is my take on "Emperor":

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.
- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- This Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. He was quite bloodthirsty and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications a few times.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2024.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military environments. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of new circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Elicia, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.
- Astoria heads Harry's personal guard, while Daphne is a key official in the Order of the Phoenix.
- Voldemort is still around, has abandoned Death Eaters, and has built a much stronger power base in Russia.
- This fic seems abandoned though, after the author announced that the last story arc was basically done. Very disappointing.

** There were three sides in canon. Dumbledore was at odds with the Ministry almost the entire series starting from book two. Harry could create a fourth side, I suppose, but unless you're writing evil!Dumbledore there isn't really a need to. I've always liked the stories where the DA is expanded into more of a militia.

​

One thing he can't do is be neutral. Even if he wasn't looking to avenge his parents, he'd need to fight just to survive.

​

Still, there's something to be said for a Harry that doesn't do what's expected of him, which is where the indy!Harry genre really thrives. Harry shutting down Scrimgeour makes you want to pump your fist. Dumbledore even says "the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything." So many stories revolve around Harry being the chosen one and having to be the hero. Indy!Harry stories can provide a counterbalance, the plot that asks, 'what if Harry wasn't inclined to run headlong into danger?' He's a kid. It shouldn't be his responsibility. What would happen, how would it play out? It's an interesting diversion.
