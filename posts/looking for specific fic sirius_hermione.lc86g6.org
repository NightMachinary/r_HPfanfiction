help finding fic!

hi guys, so i read a fanfic recently but i can't seem to find it anywhere and i stupidly didn't keep the link. i think it was on fanfic.com and it was a sirius/hermione pairing. basically hermione goes back in time but under a different name and spends time with sirius and babysits harry and gets killed by voldemort protecting him. then she wakes up and runs to find luna because luna has a dream about hermione and she's altered the timeline. james, lily and harry are a family and all alive. then hermione finds out she's pregnant from sirius and keeps it a secret. any help in finding this fic would be great, i've literally searched everything and anything i can remember
