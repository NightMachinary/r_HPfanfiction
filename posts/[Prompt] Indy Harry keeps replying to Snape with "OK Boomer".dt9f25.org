** 10 years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry returns to Hogwarts. He stands at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, then gestures with his wand. "Accio Resurrection Stone!" he cries. Within moments, a small black stone whistles out of the trees. Harry snatched it out of the air with the reflexes of a veteran Seeker.

Turning the Stone in his hands, he was briefly visited by the shades of fallen loved ones. James Potter, Lily Potter, Sirius Black, and Albus Dumbledore were greeted together, and informed that Harry's children carry their names. Fred Weasley is told of the nephew they shared, and Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Lupin - who Harry couldn't think of as anything but 'Tonks' - were regaled with stories about their child by his godfather.

Then, when all the friendly faces had shared laughs and faded away, he turned the stone just once more.

"Potter," came the familiar drawl. "I certainly hope that your reasons for disturbing my peace-"

"OK, Boomer." Harry interrupted, his words and smirk both age-old companions to his conversations with his second least-favorite teacher.

But this time, Harry had to /communicate/ something besides derision. Luckily, he'd come prepared.

"Why would you even use the Stone if you were only going to-"

For the second time, Harry interrupted Snape. This time, instead of words, he held up a photograph. Yet another boy with messy, dark hair, and piercing green eyes. Snape considered the image as it shyly waved at him. Not Harry, but clearly enough another Potter brat.

Though for the first time, he considered that his own dark hair might have been a tad messy if he'd worn it shorter.

"I'm sure your son will terrorize the school before settling in as another arrogant, puffed-up blowhard, like yourself and your father, Potter, no matter how shy he is now." Snape's words were sharp, but weary, already knowing the response.

"OK, Boomer," Harry replied. Then he flipped the photo. A newspaper article was taped to the back. Snape leaned in closer, his expression disbelieving as he read the birth announcement of one Albus *Severus* Potter, second son of Harry James Potter and Ginevra Molly Weasley, clipped from the Quibbler. His eyes darted up to meet Harry's once more.

"Potter. Harry. I- I'm... touched. Shocked, but touched."

They regarded each other in silence for several long moments. Neither could think of anything else to say. Well. Almost nothing.

"...OK, Boomer," Harry said, as Snape's form faded away into mist.

*** I've also heard us being called a microgeneration of "Xennials," I think that's something like 1979-1984. Analog childhood and digital teens; there really is only a small number of years that applies to. In Harry's case I don't think he had the digital, though.

***** Again, arbitrary definition, which Wikipedia acknowledges. Some places say 1980, some say entering adulthood in the 21st century. When it comes to time periods and eras, they tend to be loosely defined after the fact.

***** I feel like the micro generation theory is accurate: I was born in a cusp year, and I don't really fit into either Gen X or Millennial. Especially if you consider cusp years' relationship to technology... If I graduated from college before Facebook was a thing, then I had a wildly different experience compared to people that had myspace and facebook etc in middle school.

A good indie Harry fic is one, like all fic's, that has a good plot line. It also would definitely have to explain the why, and not one that is basically “well just because” .
