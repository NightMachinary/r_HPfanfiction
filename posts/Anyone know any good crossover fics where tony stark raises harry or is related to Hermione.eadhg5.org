  Tony's in London on a business meeting and escapes for a little while.On his walk he runs into an orphan...he should walk away,he shouldn't care,he wasn't up for this...but when you tell one Tony Stark that he can't do something, he does it anyway to prove you wrong.Besides...how can he say no to those woefully sad eyes that don't belong on a six year old. Deaged Harry.

Harry, raised by Tony.

Great quality story, long, but unfinished.

Note: this story follows Marvel Comics Canon, not MCU.

** Sort of. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/]]) has Tony Stark raising Hermione (who may or may not be related to him; it's been a while, and I don't remember).
