The situation is an AU where Ron ends up Hufflepuff and Harry ends up Slytherin. The two have a brief falling out when Harry overhears Ron Slytherin bashing. What could I have Ron say? Bonus points if it can be Harry specific. Timeframe is first year, just after sorting.


** The easiest way is Ron's obvious distaste for anything slytherin, you could have him act like everyone did in year 2 thinking harry is the next dark lord for being a slytherin

** I mean, they're eleven and Ron is an insensitive tactless little bugger, so it's probably quite simplistically cruel. If you've written in some evidence that Harry doesn't like to be touched, for example, he could poke at that. "What a freak, he cried over getting hugged by Hermione!" kind of a deal.

**** I... don't know if that's a compliment or a complaint, so I'll just smile and say thank you.

/smiles/

Thank you!

:)

He really is though. Good or bad, moron or strategist genius, he's still tactless as all hell.

*** I'm definitely going for tactless over malicious. Ideally working in some insecurity from Ron ending up Hufflepuff. I'm no good at mean though, so it's tough to write.

**** I know what you mean. I wrote a character bitching at her mother for remarrying after her dad died in an LiS fic and I just felt so ridiculously uncomfortable the entire time I was writing. It's real difficult to do mean well, especially for kids since they're utter morons and generally too innocent to really know what crosses the line like adults do.

"Hey Potter, how's it feel to be everything your parents died for? Gonna go kill your aunt to make your new Lord happy?"

"You're a cowardly dick, Weasley! Come say that to my face!"

"I am saying it to your face, mate. Looks like Potter's a moron, everyone! Can't even tell who's talking to him! I bet he thinks 'Bibbity Bobbity Boo is a real spell!"

"-actually I read that-"

"Nobody likes you, Granger! Stop with that reading thing and go sit on a piece of wood and sticks to make some friends!"

"You're a bully, Weasley!"

"Yeah, at least I'm not a dirty snake who worships You-know-who like you, POTTER!!"

"Who?"

"You-know-who!"

"I really don't, I didn't know any of this existed until yesterday and all Hagrid told me was where to get the best fish and chips since I'm too young to worry about our faulty tax system and antiquated government by a corrupt and racially-biased upper class."

"I mean, He-who-must-not-be-named!"

"So, your mum?"

"Don't you say shit about my mum!" etc etc.

**** If you're going for tactless over malicious, go for something that Ron just doesn't get - like how Harry has money (which Ron doesn't have) and yet doesn't spend it. "Why does he wear such crappy clothes? I mean, his parents must have left him money so he must be loaded! What's his excuse?"
