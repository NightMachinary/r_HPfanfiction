** I usually assume that 100% of the fanfiction community has read HP & the Boy Who Lived, (and chances are usually good that that is the story that usually prompts searches like this), but if by some small chance you haven't, I'd look at that.

** If you haven't read it, linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) is a great story. It's a Harry Transfers story, with a completely original background, magic system, and awesome skills.

It doesn't have a dramatic exit though.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

*** You know the way you hear about "Harry Potter in name only?". His name is Rakesh in this. That's how far diverged from canon it is. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if the reason this stopped updating was the author looking at pro publishing.

**** I would love to read it as original fiction. I'd buy the book in a heart beat.

It really is almost original fiction. I think there's about three or four chapters that are properly HP, the rest is pure awesome.

** Well, first fic I can think off that has Harry transferring doesn't have that scene you want, but I don't give a shit. I've got a real soft spot for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697521/1/The-Brave-New-World][The Brave New World by bellerophon30]] because the school (Great Lakes) is in the UP and most likely an incredibly damn short drive from my hometown. And Chapter 6 has my favorite chapter title of all time: Bladvak, It Means Pickaxe.

However, I do have one complaint about it. Chapter 11 claims that a character took the SAT at the Marquette high school. This is false. The ACT (which is the more common of the two standardized college admission exams taken in the UP) and the SAT are taken at Marquette's college, Northern Michigan University.

*** I second this story. Great, long read. Fair amount of action.

Also, seriously? That's your complaint about the story? Perhaps years ago it was more common to take the SAT there at the high school.

Everyone I've ever talked to about SAT and ACT took them at a local high school. So I think it's a perfectly acceptable assumption.

**** That was me being a smartass.

Plus it isn't often that the UP shows up in stuff. May be a third of the land of Michigan, but only 3% of the population.

*** This story is fantastic. Also the AU version of it where he doesn't leave by the same author is pretty good too.
