Ignoring CC and the Epilogue, since in my eyes they don't jive with how canon Harry acted, what would, say a 25 year old Harry be like? What about a late 30s or early 40s Harry? Depictions in fanfiction seems to vary wildly, but what are some commonalities that seem in line with canon Harry?


** In heavy need of therapy, I'd say.

** I'd imagine him in his thirties just being a normal dad, albeit a little overprotective and determined to make sure that his kids have the best childhood that they could possibly get.

  a little overprotective

I've always imagined Harry would be the opposite personally, Harry always hated being left out of the loop and having things kept from him because "he was too young". Add on to that just how restricted an oppressive his own childhood was, I think Harry's much more likely to be a trusting and lenient parent, as opposed to an overprotective one.

** The thing about Harry is that essentially, trouble is all he knows. His formative years were spent going from one life-threatening situation to the next, and to some degree he's at his most competent while he's fighting for someone's life.

In my headcanon, he goes full-on John Watson from /Sherlock/ - trying his damnedest to not admit to himself that he /misses/ the war, despite the horrors of it. He'll be constantly trying to balance the part of himself that needs action (his "saving people thing" as Hermione calls it) with the part that wants to lead a quiet, spotlight-free life.

I think canon had it pretty much right with him becoming an Auror, in that respect - it's a job with plenty of action, opportunity to indulge in saving people, and relatively little press coverage (most of the time, the news will focus on the criminal that's been apprehended, not the cop that did it). Eventually, he might settle down into being the full-time instructor for the Auror Training Program, owing mostly to his time instructing the D.A. in spells outside the Hogwarts curriculum.

I can't picture him ever going into the /political/ side of the DMLE. That is one point where my headcanon diverges from official extended-canon - I can barely picture him as Head of the Auror Office, let alone Head of the DMLE.

Relationship-wise, Harry needs someone who understands him, can keep up with his lifestyle, and can tell him to his face when he's being a prat. In light of that, his canon relationship with Ginny will not be argument-free, but it /will/ remain strong throughout his life. She's pretty much /exactly/ the kind of person he needs.

*** I don't see him working out with Ginny long term.

They both have very different versions of the same monster living rent-free in their heads, and neither has ever really dealt with what that's done to them.

**** I disagree - I think that's /exactly/ why they work well. They understand each other more than anyone else could, /because/ they've both had that experience. You'd be surprised how many relationships come out of support groups for this exact reason.

I don't see them /not arguing/ and ending up in a storybook-perfect relationship, that's something else entirely. They're both headstrong individuals with a particular land-mine to step on, they're going to have arguments and there's going to be times when the emotional trauma makes things difficult for both of them. But that's /healthy/ in the long run, both for the relationship and for dealing with trauma.

** Peaceful. He had his fight, he lost many times but in the end he found his peace, not in the death of his enemy but in his own acceptance of his death. He understood that life was meant to be lived fully for the enjoyment of life and not in fear of death.

That would probably make him a bit fun-loving guy who meets with friends often and plays with his kids and wife, ranging from simple things like Gobstones to Quidditch.

He wouldn't be aggressive against the past death eaters i.e. those who ran away just before the end of the Hogwarts Battle. But their future crimes wouldn't be ignored.

At least that's my belief.

** I imagine John Watson from Sherlock

SHERLOCK: Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths. JOHN: Mmm, yes. SHERLOCK: Bit of trouble too, I bet. JOHN (quietly): Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much. SHERLOCK: Wanna see some more? JOHN (fervently): Oh God, yes.

Just him going stir crazy from a lack of action

** I imagine 25 year old Harry would be full in on being an Auror which is a job he excels at and brings a sense of fulfillment but not happiness. Likely has one or two kids with Ginny and is starting to feel like he's not spending enough time with them.

In his 30s-40s I'd think Harry would be looking for a teaching career (Hogwarts if he can obviously) as being an Auror is wearing on him and a higher level position in the Ministry isn't what he wants though his friends and family think he'd do great work there. Harry's a pretty good dad that probably allows his kids too much leeway when they misbehave but serious trouble would bring out Harry's anger which severely frightens the children.

After the war I think he'd deal with a lot of guilt and PTSD that fades as he gets older but never really goes away. Just settles in the back of his head and resurfaces periodically which Harry tries to hide from his family.

** I think Harry would go into post Hogwarts life with a massive wave of energy and relief that would over the course of the next few years start to trail off.

I think he would very much excell at and enjoy being an auror but would definitely deflate when faced with no overarching villain. No clear end goal just a continuation of the kind of violence and weariness that has dogged his entire life.harry definitely has a saving people complex but police work is almost universally attempting to stem the river of human suffering as best as one can.

Cedric and Denis creevey and Remus and Sirius weigh on Harry's soul and his inability to help them. He'd meet a new Cedric every day of the week. And there's no Voldemort for him to center his efforts on.

Dude would have a midlife crises at like 24. And in all fairness to Ginny I don't know if she could shoulder Harry's burdens enough for that relationship to survive continued auror work. To stay together he'd have to change Jobs.

Ultimately I don't see Harry staying long as an auror before either the job or the politics got to him.

I think something low-key where he helps people would be his destination. Either some sort of repair guy, a private detective or a teacher.

Other way would be to go into quidditch but it begs the question if Harry could stomach the publicity.
