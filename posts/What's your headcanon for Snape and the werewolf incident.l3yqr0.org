Here is what we know:

Snape was interested in where Lupin went every month and that he saw Madam Pomfrey leading Lupin to the whomping willow. We also know Snape didn't make it to the Shrieking Shack and didn't actually come face to face with a transformed Lupin but Snape was still absolutely certain Lupin was a werewolf later on.

​

#+begin_quote
  "They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?"

  "He's ill," said Lily. "They say he's ill--"

  "Every month at the full moon?" said Snape.

  "I know your theory," said Lily, and she sounded cold. "Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?"
#+end_quote

We can infer that Snape suspected that Lupin was a werewolf and it wasn't the first time he told Lily this theory.

Some people (mostly Snape fans) say he suspects the marauders of being illegal animagi and doesn't suspect Lupin of being a werewolf. But that doesn't make sense at all. A good chunk of this conversation is focused on Lupin. Snape's curious about where Lupin goes. He's trying to lead Lily into thinking his illness is a ruse and then Lily replied "I know your theory" immediately after Snape insinuating that Lupin is a werewolf. If the theory was "Marauders are illegal animagi" this conversation just sounds very weird.

Some people also suggest that Snape didn't suspect Lupin was a werewolf until after the incident. For this to be true, the order of events would have to be:

1. Werewolf incident.
2. Snape tells Lily his theory of Lupin being a werewolf.
3. Days passed
4. This conversation happens.

This order of events seem very unrealistic. So *we can reasonably believe that even if Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf for certain, he at least strongly suspected it.*

We can also infer that Snape wasn't trying to save the student body from a werewolf because he saw that staff was involved. (Unless he suspected that Madam Pomfrey was going behind Dumbledore's back? Or he thought the entire staff was dangerous?)

But after that I'm stumped. Why would Snape willingly go to the Whomping willow if he knew a suspected werewolf was behind there? Why did he even listen to what Sirius Black had to say? What did Snape hope to accomplish by going there? Did he think he can take on a werewolf?

If he wanted to ruin the marauders and get them expelled (as Sirius suggests) why not just start a rumor? Why would he need proof? Did he want proof because Lily wouldn't believe his theories?

After that why would Snape keep Lupin's lycanthropy a secret if he was so eager to get them expelled before?

What about Sirius? Why would he tell Snape that information? Did he think Snape was too much of a coward to follow through? Did he not even consider how Lupin would feel? How did he tell Snape that information? (An anonymous note? Face to face? Letting Snape purposely overhear a private conversation?) Did he receive any punishment? How did the other Marauders react?


** I read this a bit ago and my impression, for whatever its worth, was that Snape was told to keep quiet.

Or, in other words,

- 1) Snape suspected /something/, and investigated.

- 2) After the incident he knew Lupin was a werewolf, BUT Dumbledore /requested and required/ him to hold his tongue.

- 3) His asking of Lily mirrors his DADA teaching. Questions to which he already knows the answers to, and yet is unable to outright say.

Extra thoughts. Magic has power, words have power. "Your word, Severus." not just in an Unbreakable Vow. Once Remus is 'exposed' and proven a danger to students in PoA, Snape is free to reveal Lupins condition (which he does). And if Lily figures it out, he would likewise be free to discuss the matter in confidence (as he might do with Dumbledore or Pomphrey). Until that time he risks magical consequences (quite outside any from Dumbledore), for breaking his word if he speaks directly. I imagine he has done his homework however, and knows when he is /technically/ staying within the rules, barely.

*** What is this something? Because canonically he knew Pomfrey was involved in whatever rule breaking the Marauders did at the Willow. Did he suspect Pomfrey was in on it? If so, why didn't he go to Dumbledore or Slughorn or any other authority figure before actually going into the tunnel?

We saw 11 year old Harry (who was very anti-authority figure and probably much dumber than Snape at 15/16) tried to tell Dumbledore that he suspected Snape was stealing the stone. And at multiple times throughout, he tells his companions to go back to Dumbledore. We know why Harry was hesitant to tell adults of his suspicion. People thought he hated Snape and wouldn't believe him without any proof. We also know Harry in CoS goes to the staff room to report and then also go to Lockhart's room to help before going down the chambers.

I'm not aware of any reason why Snape would think authority figures won't believe him when he says 'I saw Madam Pomfrey helping students go to the Willow.' His feud is with the Marauders not with Pomfrey.

In canon we don't know for certain if a transformed werewolf looks anything like their human form. If Snape only caught a glimpse of the werewolf and didn't suspect Lupin of being a werewolf wouldn't the logical conclusion be 'The Marauders and Pomfrey are hiding a werewolf near the school' and not 'I knew Remus Lupin was a werewolf'? (Unless you think James is dumb enough to yell "Stay away from Remus!" or something like that at his enemy who is intent on causing him trouble?)

** I'll give 2 versions of this. The first is my headcanon on what happened, and the second is someone else's take on it, whose headcanon is my personal favorite, even if I personally don't actually think it is what happened.

My own take on it is that Sirius thought of this /hilarious/ prank where he somehow tricks Snape into going into the Willow tunnel, either by inferring that Evans is in danger, or by letting him overhear when Sirius talks to one of his pals (probably not James since he was the one who stopped the prank later) about the location, "accidentally" letting Snape overhear. The former is likely the only way that would make Snape willing to go to the tunnel alone even if he did suspect there might be a werewolf involved, because otherwise he'd probably have brought a group of Slytherins with him to catch Remus together. However, I don't think he belived he'd meet a werewolf -- he might suspect Remus, but I don't think he connected the dots, figuring that Remus was better protected than that. After all, Dumbledore can't be /that/ stupid to set up a bunch of defenses that teenagers can easily disarm, right? Prank happens, James intervenes when Sirius tells James about the "hilarious" prank since James knows it will almost certainly lead to Severus' death (something Sirius fails to realize because he's undervaluing Remus' danger as a result of having been with him on several occasions as an Animagus). James saves Snape, and Dumbledore, being an idiot, pulls what is most likely the action that would be the final nail in the coffin for Severus' ultimate choice of side in the war, forcing him into silence without considering the likely result of how this would feel for Snape, who at this point is traumatized by the near-miss. Afterwards, James brags about saving Snape to the other Gryffindors, since nobody silenced /him/ on the matter. This causes Lily, who -- lacking the entire story -- calls Snape out on being ungrateful, and Snape's failure to clarify the matter (since he's bound to silence) basically ends up putting their friendship on edge of ruin. I also think this is what makes her start to see James differently, even if at this point it is completely undeserved IMO. No, I am not a fan of the werewolf incident. While I think Sirius got off way too easy, I don't think he really wanted to murder Snape, nor do I think Snape wanted to essentially kill Lupin. I blame Dumbledore for the debacle most of all, in the actions he took in the aftermath.

I once saw an unique take on the incident in an oneshot. What I like about it is the fact that it isn't actually implausible at all, and is the only version I've seen where Dumbledore's actions in the aftermath is 100% justified, whereas in the vast majority of ways you spin it, his actions was otherwise very poor/stupid.

In this version, Snape feeds Sirius Veritaserum, in order to get the Marauders in trouble. He starts asking various questions, forcing Sirius to inadvertly reveal how to get into the tunnel under the Whomping Willow. Realizing what he is about to reveal, he flees the scene and hunts for James, explaining what happened. The rest is history. In this version, Dumbledore's actions actually make perfect sense -- Severus was feeding Sirius an illegal potion, and Sirius' only wrong was essentially to needlessly weaken the security of Lupin (i.e. not telling the teachers about the fact that a group of teenagers could bypass and dismantle the defenses), so the minimal punishment makes perfect sense. Meanwhile, swearing Snape to silence ensures that he doesn't blab about it, and since he brought the entire thing upon himself, he sort of deserves it (even if I do think he ought to have received couseling afterwards regardless).

** Here's a headcanon I have to try to minimize the stupidity of everyone involved in a scenario where Snape suspects Lupin to be a werewolf*.

Sirius tells us that Snape wanted to get all four Marauders expelled (“It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us expelled. ...”). There's a connection between Snape trying to expel the Marauders and going to the Willow. But there's no way proving Remus was a werewolf would expel any of them, especially since the staff knew (and with Madam Pomfrey leading Remus to the Willow, it's obvious she and Dumbledore knew). Why would James, Sirius, and Peter get expelled for Remus being a werewolf? Why would Lupin get expelled for being a werewolf? There has to be more to it than proving Lupin is a werewolf, and the key question is what could get them all expelled.

​

#+begin_quote
  Some people (mostly Snape fans) say he suspects the marauders of being illegal animagi and doesn't suspect Lupin of being a werewolf.
#+end_quote

He could not have suspected them becoming animagi because he'd share that theory in PoA to explain how Sirius got into the castle if he considered it. There's no definitive proof that Snape knew Lupin was a werewolf before seeing him. If he suspected it, then *I think he suspected that the Marauders were letting Lupin loose in his werewolf form*.

- This explains why Snape would believe it would be safe for him to go into the tunnel if he suspects Lupin is a werewolf: he believes the Marauders are safe entering the tunnel (maybe he thinks Lupin is restrained) and wouldn't know that they rely on their Animagi forms to be near Remus.
- This explains why (post-prank) Snape starts his hints to Lily about Remus with the words: "*They sneak out at night.* There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?" He thinks the Marauders are sneaking out of the school, and he brings it up in connection with Lupin because he sees a connection between the events.
- This would be a serious enough breach of the rules to expel them (see Lupin's quote below)
- Bonus: it's true! That is what the Marauders were actually doing (although as animagi):

#+begin_quote
  “That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?”

  “A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily. “And *there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards.* We were young, thoughtless --- carried away with our own cleverness.”

  “*I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust*, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and *he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety*.
#+end_quote

- This would also help explain why Snape is so angry and disturbed in the Shrieking Shack in PoA: he just listened to Lupin admit that the Marauders had been doing exactly what he suspected them of doing as teenagers. He was right all along. The rage!
- It would also fit your order of events since you believe that the theory Snape shared with Lily /before the prank took place/ is that Lupin is a werewolf (*but the books don't make this clear and only tell us that Snape knew what Lupin was after the prank).

​

My post is already long, so I'll only say this about Sirius not considering Remus' feelings: I think given the "near misses" they "laughed about," Sirius didn't believe another near miss with Snape was a big deal for Remus since Snape wasn't harmed in the end. It seemed like Remus didn't argue about it with Sirius because they both still minimize it years later.

​

Also, your list of things we know as facts has an unconfirmed interpretation:

#+begin_quote
  We also know Snape...didn't actually come face to face with a transformed Lupin
#+end_quote

Lupin tells us Snape saw him transformed:

#+begin_quote
  Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was
#+end_quote

It's unclear in the books, but when Snape glimpsed Remus, he had to be close enough to Remus for both him and James to be in danger of being killed. In two different places, Lupin establishes that Snape and James could have died:

#+begin_quote
  "Sirius here played a trick on him which *nearly killed him*"

  your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at *great risk to his life* . . .
#+end_quote

For all we know, werewolves run super fast and have a keen sense of smell for tracking prey. However close they were to Lupin, they were in mortal peril and were in danger of coming face to face.

** My headcanon is that he was trying to get Remus expelled at the very least, possibly executed and/or "killed in self-defense". Just outing Remus as a werewolf would probably drive him out of Hogwarts, but nothing more given what we see at the end of PoA (unless Dumbledore called in a lot of favors and threw his weight around big-time to save Lupin, contributing to Fudge's hostility in the next two books).

On the other hand, if he had a direct encounter with Remus during the full moon, Snape could use that to say he was attacked, which would likely lead to Remus being sent to Azkaban or simply executed. He could also just use it as an excuse to kill Remus "in self-defense" and face no legal consequences.

If this plan had worked, I think Dumbledore would have been angry but unable to do much about it, Lily would have probably been pissed off, and the other three Marauders utterly enraged. Those three would probably have targeted him for retribution in some way that crossed the line enough that Dumbledore would have no choice but to expel one or more of them, though whether Snape would survive intact is another question.

*** I never understood this point of view because it doesn't explain Sirius' role: if Snape 100% knows he is going to face a werewolf, what's Sirius' "prank" or "trick" then? How does your version work as a laugh or deception from Sirius' perspective?

It's called a "joke" and "trick" over and over again in the books:

#+begin_quote
  Sirius here played a *trick* on him which nearly killed him, a *trick* which involved me ---

  Sirius thought it would be --- er --- *amusing*, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk

  “So that's why Snape doesn't like you,” said Harry slowly, “because he thought you were in on the *joke*?”

  your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing *joke* on me

  “The *joke*'s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled.
#+end_quote

​

Lupin describes the prank as almost getting Snape killed (as opposed to Snape almost getting himself killed), which sounds incriminating to me: "Sirius here *played a trick on him which nearly killed him*... " Your version comes across as if Snape played a trick on Sirius instead to get the information out of him so Snape can finally go to the Willow and face a werewolf.

Maybe I misunderstood you and you don't intend for your headcanon to comply with book canon?

**** The whole point was to be the "innocent" student, which meant he wouldn't have wanted to give the impression that he knew what to expect. He still needed to know how to get past the Willow, so baited Sirius into telling him, which would have the added bonus of making the whole incident look more like Sirius's fault. That isn't to say that Sirius telling him was okay - it was a major betrayal of his friends' confidence and put Remus at tremendous unnecessary risk.

My recollection and understanding of the book canon is that Sirius didn't just walk up to Snape out of the blue and go "Hey, Snivellus! Push the knot on the Whomping Willow and go through the tunnel in the roots. Do it Tuesday night, it'll be fun!" They were arguing and Snape indicated that he knew the Marauders were up to /something/ and that he'd find out what it was, or something along those lines, and Sirius told him exactly how to do it.

Saying Snape baited/tricked Sirius instead of Sirius tricked Snape does change things from Sirius' perspective because it prevents a scenario where Sirius instigated. We don't know what Sirius thought Snape would or wouldn't do. We don't know what his intentions were. It sure seems like the joke was to get Snape past the Willow, and not a joke that revolves around Snape not going.

That's only a "trick" in the sense that his intent was to bait Snape into the tunnel; that seems to be the limit of his plan - trying to get Snape killed by Remus seems out-of-character for him, if for no other reason than the fact that it would probably see Remus executed.

Meanwhile, we obviously can't take Snape's account as entirely accurate because he puts it as "your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me" when it was entirely Sirius's plan (as far as we know; Pettigrew might have egged him on). Throughout the series he proves that the instant Sirius or any Potter is involved the red mist descends and reality ceases to matter. Further, he shows little if any ability to recognize his own culpability in events. He certainly wouldn't just announce it that he was actively trying to get Remus expelled/arrested/killed.

I didn't say the books did.

I didn't quote Snape in my previous reply; I quoted Lupin's version of the events. The point is that everyone calls it a joke or a trick, Snape, Lupin, and Sirius. If everyone says the same thing, including enemies, then it's reasonable to take that as fact. I'll ask the same question I've asked you twice before: what is Sirius' joke in telling Snape to get beyond the Willow in your version? If it's not a deceptive trick (something that relies on cruel humor), how is it a /funny/ trick?

​

#+begin_quote
  trying to get Snape killed by Remus seems out-of-character for him, if for no other reason than the fact that it would probably see Remus executed.
#+end_quote

I didn't make the claim that Sirius was trying to get Snape killed. But Sirius is notorious for not thinking through the consequences. He wishes it would be a full moon to Lupin's annoyance in SWM, he goes after Peter alone after he knows Peter betrayed the Potters without telling anyone about the Secret Keeper switch even though he ran into Hagrid, he didn't heed Dumbledore's warnings about Kreacher, he doesn't care about being spotted on the train platform. Sirius is frequently reckless. That's part of his character. I'm sure he didn't consider Remus could be executed.

As for what's in-character for Sirius, we know his view of the werewolf prank in PoA is that it "served [Snape] right," and we know that he had no qualms killing an enemy on two occasions: he tries to kill Pettigrew in 1981 and again for Harry's third year/PoA. We know SWM takes place /after/ the prank, but Sirius is still willing to provoke Snape after Snape knows Remus' secret. You'd think he and James would leave Snape alone in case Snape retaliates by telling everybody the truth about Lupin, but that possibility doesn't seem to occur to them because they aren't concerned about potential consequences at 16.

When Sirius is framed for betraying the Potters to their deaths and killing Peter and a dozen Muggles, Lupin never questions it in 12 years because he believed Sirius could be capable of these actions (Dumbledore doesn't question in either). Sirius' role in the prank sets up a huge plot point for the series. Jumping through hoops to make the incident Snape's fault defeats the purpose of the event in the books.

Your theory relies on reading against the grain of canon in many ways.

I'm pretty sure that Snape could have actually killed lupin if the encounter took place in a cramped space, such as a secret passage simply by spamming his own creation.

Alternatively, he was going for the martyr angle. Get himself killed in order to get Lupin executed and the others imprisoned for helping Lupin or something like that.

** My headcanon was that, while Snape suspected that Lupin was a werewolf, they were so heavily discriminated against that not even the people who hated the Marauders were willing to believe that the teachers were going to allow one in the school. I think Dumbledore personally quashed some of these rumors since it was his reputation and job on the line (either through use of authority or magic). I think Sirius intentionally let it slip so that Snape would overhear, probably to James and later on the latter noticed Snape overheard them and tried to put a stop to it. Snape, even if he didn't get to the Shrieking Shack during Lupin's transformation, understood what was going on but was asked by Dumbledore not to talk about it.

** Ok, so my headcanon is biased because I like Sirius.

So I imagine that it started out with something that pissed Sirius off maybe he found out that someone important to him has died or was severely injured. Then he runs into Snape in the corridor and Snape taunts him about lupin and how he's gone every full moon and that Severus would get him expelled.

Sirius being the teenager he is interpreting that as Snape knowing that Lupin is a Werewolf and because he is currently emotionally unstable he tells him Jokingly how to get past the Whomping Willow because he doesn't believe anyone stupid enough to go after a Werewolf on a full moon.

Snape does not know that Lupin is a Werewolf though he believes that they are brewing a Potion/ doing a Ritual that requires the full moon and Remus being the most studious of the Marauders is the one to prepare it every full moon. He only noticed the disappearances only this year.

5 minutes after Snape runs off towards the Willow to gather evidence/ bust the Ritual or potion Sirius realises that he has sent a boy to his death he sprints to the Gryffindor dorns to tell James what has happened and for them to go save Lupin from killing Snape. James being royally pissed of after hearing what Padfoot had done knocks, Sirius, out and saves Snape from Moony.

After that Dumbledor swears all of them to secrecy and life goes on in Hogwarts.

** The more variables you include, the more implausible this incident becomes. So I just focus on Snape when trying to make sense of this.

From Snape's pov, he never expected to find an actual werewolf on the other side of the tunnel. He probably thought he was going to find some evidence of Lupin being a werewolf or something else equally incriminating, not a very dangerous magical creature.

Do you mean to say he thinks the tunnel leads to Hogsmeade where they apparate Lupin somewhere? If so how could he find any evidence? (Lupin has to be in human form before he apparates. If not Hogsmeade would have a werewolf problem and Pomfrey would be dead).

That would mean he never realized how much actual danger he was in. (Didn't make it into the shack to see that the werewolf wasn't caged).

She's a healer. She must know there's nothing you can do for a transformed werewolf even if she put herself in needless danger (Wolfsbane potion wasn't invented yet).

It doesn't really defy logic (like Snape knowingly following a suspected werewolf). I don't see how Pomfrey escorting him doesn't make sense.

** u/adreamersmusing:
#+begin_quote
  This order of events seem very unrealistic.
#+end_quote

Why? It makes complete sense while keeping everyone in character. Tbh this is what I think occurred. Since this conversation happened after the Whomping Willow incident, all the other conversations probably did as well. What I think happened is:

1) Snape is completely clueless about Remus's condition, but he does think the Marauders are acting sketchy. In one of their fights, Sirius goads Snape into going to the Shrieking Shack.

2) Snape goes and almost dies. James rescues him. Snape is forbidden from talking about it by Dumbledore. James Potter then brags about rescuing Snape and word spreads.

3) Snape, feeling resentful and angry at the incident, and at how James Potter is now considered a hero attempts to tell Lily about what happened. But, since Dumbledore has forbidden him from speaking about it, is reduced to vague hints. He tries several times but Lily is not having any of it and thinks he's just obsessed. The instance quoted is simply one of those times.

I believe this post lays it out rather logically: [[https://bloodyhellharry.tumblr.com/post/158568680910/messrsmemoirs-friendly-reminder-that-sirius]]

This reads like it's the first time Lily mentions James saving Snape to Snape. "The other night" suggests the incident happened recently.

For your headcanon to make sense it would have to go.

1. Incident
2. Snape tells Lily his theory.
3. Lily doesn't know James saved Snape so she doesn't mention the saving part.
4. Days passed.
5. Lily finds out James saved Snape.
6. Conversation happens.

Why did it take so long for Lily to find out James saved Snape? If James is such a braggart that he goes around bragging about saving Snape why would he wait so long to appear as a hero in Lily's eyes instead of telling her immediately?

#+end_quote

Well, yes. It would take time for word to spread. There could be several reasons. Maybe the Marauders were shaken up about what happened initially but once they got over it, James might have spread the word. Alternatively, if James didn't spread the word, someone saw them go to Dumbledore's office and rumours spread. Lily also sounds exasperated in that conversation, so it could also be that it hasn't been long since the incident took place, James has bragged about it and Snape is trying non-stop to tell her about Lupin's condition which is why she's so fed up.

#+begin_quote
  If Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf why was he following them?
#+end_quote

Several reasons. If Lupin's official story is that he's ill, Snape could be wondering: Why does he leave the grounds if he's ill? Why does he leave only at night? Why do his friends accompany him if it's just an illness? Where do they keep going? etc. All of these are sketchy questions. We have to remember that Snape doesn't have an essay assigned to him by a vindictive teacher. And with the stigma against werewolves, the possibility of a werewolf being allowed would have been ludicrous, especially considering /Remus himself didn't expect to be admitted as a student at Hogwarts./

#+begin_quote
  Are you suggesting only Snape is trustworthy and both Lupin and Black lied? (Quite an extreme opinion).
#+end_quote

Lied about what? Both Lupin and Black admit that Sirius told Snape how to get to the Whomping Willow as punishment for following them around. The version I've suggested doesn't contradict that.

***** I believe the picture was edited later on. I've deleted the second part of my comment to reflect that.

If he thinks the Marauders were doing something against the school rules other than Lupin being a werewolf and he saw Pomfrey was with Lupin then how come he didn't go to Dumbledore about how a member of his staff is helping students break rules?

So you're saying it's pure coincidence that the first time Snape tried to hint at Lupin's lycanthropy, Lily didn't know that James saved Snape but the nth time Snape tried to (when the conversation happened) she does? Sure. I could accept that. (In case it wasn't clear, this isn't sarcasm).

** Well, the corresponding passage from PoA is

#+begin_quote
  “It served him right,” he [Sirius] sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...”

  “Severus was very interested in where I went every month.” Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “We were in the same year, you know, and we---er---didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be---er---amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it---if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf---but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was...”
#+end_quote

I don't disagree with your take, although I don't see any indications about the timeline either way. What was your reasoning re: the dialogue with Lily couldn't have happened after the incident?

If we take PoA at face value, the most natural sequence of events IMO is that Snape was curious (and I wouldn't be surprised if he actually /would/ happily have taken any evidence that came his way to get James & co expelled -- but clearly, that can't be the reasoning here, as Madam Pomfrey was there). Sirius told him how to follow them, then Snape glimpsed Werewolf!Lupin, and /then/ Snape told Lily in a circumspect way, as a "theory", since he wasn't allowed to talk about the incident itself by Dumbledore.

The goal there would naturally be to turn Lily against James & co, using the stigma of "werewolf". From Snape's POV that makes sense.

From Sirius' POV, well, he is the prototypical anarchical Gryffindor. "Just because" would probably enough reason to tell Snape, and if we trust Lupin and the euphemistic "amusing", in fact he thought it was a great trick to play on Snape. And as we can see, some 15 or 20 years later, he still thinks it "served him right".

As for punishments, clearly, Sirius wasn't expelled. Which is in line with Dumbledore as we see him in Canon; he's very lenient (with a certain bias towards Gryffindor). I suppose Sirius served detention. Which, tbh, I can get Snape feeling bitter about. Detention for a joke that might kill someone is kinda wut. But of course, he wasn't innocent himself either. The bottom line here probably is a failing to put everyone in line sooner, so that it wouldn't even get to that point -- which is a direct consequence Dumbledore's approach to punishments.

i mean, canonically he allowed Draco Malfoy in his 6th year to remain at Hogwarts even when he knew that he was responsible for 2 murder attempts. Imagine if either Ron or Katie died, Albus would of had the death of a innocent student at his hands, due to his decision to allow a terrorist to remain a treat to other students.

The werewolf incident happened at some point in Snape's fifth year before his worst memory. Why?

- Snape said that Sirius was capable of murder at age sixteen (very likely referencing the werewolf incident there). And since JKR revealed Sirius's birthday as being on the 3rd of November (she did so on Twitter), that means Sirius was sixteen for most of his fifth year.

- Analyse the SWM scene and you'll notice Remus being very avoidant when James and Sirius taunt Snape. Remus sits down and essentially hides behind a book while everyone else is all super interested. Could this be a mix of guilt and fear that Snape would mention the werewolf thing, should Remus join in on James and Sirius's dissing of Snape in the open?

- Snape was actually able to have a chat with Lily after the incident. But this couldn't have happened after Lily cut ties with him after SWM (no way would Lily and Snape be walking and chatting together after that).

** my head-cannon is that after the fact,, i think even though Snape continued to be mad about the entire situation, especially Dumbledore covering it up- I don't think he blames Lupin. Snape is intelligent, he can look past the propaganda that the wizarding world publishes as fact around werewolves and he can recognize that maybe, just maybe Dumbledore is right and this werewolf deserves a fighting chance, an safe try at an education. That's what makes Snape's actions after Sirius' escape with Buckbeak even more horrible--- he exposed Lupin just because he had anything to do with Black,, he just went along with public view and putted a man who he knew wasn't dangerous other than that night. I think that is also part of it, if Lupin could forget the full moon even once, what's to stop it from happening again! Long story short, I think the blame (in Snape's eyes) fell solely on Black and later on Dumbledore for his lack of action against Black.
