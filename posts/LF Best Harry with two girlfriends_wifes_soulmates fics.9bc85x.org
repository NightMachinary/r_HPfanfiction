** Harry/Hermione/Daphne:

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3807777]])

The cool part is that the fic does a good job looking at it semi-realistically: Daphne joins mostly for political reasons and everyone tries to make the best of it, but the crippling jealously becomes a real issue. It gets resolved by forming a (artificial?) soul bond.

I also like a lot of what's going on in

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble]])

Harry + 12 wives (yeah, twelve). Fun one-shot... Hermione goes full-hog with the power of love theory:

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny

** Probably Temporal Knight's sequel to "Like Grains of Sand in an Hourglass" whenever he get's around to writing it. Grains did such a good job at laying the groundwork for a believable Harry/Hermione/time-travelling Tonks that actually has the characters deeply care for each other and there is a plot beyond just their relationship instead of just being "Harry and two hot chicks". There is very little of the actual triad in the published work however since it ends with them agreeing on becoming a triad and a rather harmless night spent together. The eventual sequel is where their relationship blooms.

It also says a lot about the quality of most triad stories when a fic which just touches the issue at the end is better than most of the full-fledged stuff written with this premise.

**** The story itself, for the most part, is Harry paired with Tonks, who was thrown back a year through time. Over the course of the story, Hermione plays an important role as best friend to both and mentions an interest in Harry, even if she concedes that Tonks won his heart. At the end, there is a discussion where they talk about a lot of stuff about the whole time travel, two Tonks (original one and the time traveller), emotions, plans and so on. They fall asleep cuddled together, wake up and Lavender makes a comment about them finally getting together.

It is not a triad at that point, but all the foundation is there and it is by far the best attempt at writing a believable threeway relationship, even if it just hinted at (which says a lot about the other triads around). The emotional part of the triad is there in Hourglass, the sexual part will be in the sequel.

There is an author's note announcing a sequel at some point, which "will be Harry/Tonks/Hermione".

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
