Mrs. Weasley isn't the mom this fandom needs. She's the one we deserve.

Let's look at the kind of mom Mrs Wesley is shall we? Starting with the first time we hear see a little bit of her character. No, not when she helps harry get into the platform but on the train when Ron takes out his sandwiches and said that his mom made them for him and his siblings. While she forgots Ron doesn't like corned beef it's the act of simply making the sandwiches for all her kids that counts.

While a mom making sandwiches doesn't seem like a big deal. in reality there are a lot of moms that don't do things like this At all. Not all mom's are created equal. There are moms out there who don't give their kids the time of day. Let alone getting up probably hours earlier that day and making not only breakfast but planning ahead for lunch on the train.

Next are the sweaters(jumpers?) at Christmas. She makes them new sweaters every Christmas. How many women do you know that take the time out to do those kind of things? The answer is not a lot. Those of you reading this that have hand made clothes or blankets stop ask yourself this. How much do you actually wear or use the thing your mom made you? I have a quilt my mom made me when i turned 18 and moved out and I've slept under it every night for 6 years. Hell I'll probably give it to my kids one day to. It means that much to me.

Next is Harry himself. Every time she sees him she treats him like she would treat any of her sons. Not because he's 'the boy who lived' but because she probably realizes he never had a proper family. She wants to give Harry what he doesn't have. But also what he deserves.

So yeah. Molly Weasley is a mom amongst moms. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go give my mom a call.


** I could always see her point of view while arguing with Sirius but something is to be said that practically no one agrees with her at the table, not even her own husband, and certainly not when she told him to back her up. But that was such a low blow, the poor bloke doesn't need reminding of it, he probably thinks about it every single day.

Mr. Weasley himself was at odds with her for that very same thing two years ago (she didn't want Harry to know Sirius wanted to kill him, Arthur did, and he was right, even if Sirius was innocent). Molly is very protective, but being a mother of seven will do that to a person and I can certainly understand where she comes from, and that's the most relatable thing about her for some people whom Molly became an echo of their parents.

I do find it odd that people go as far as kicking her it of the house and dosing Harry with love potions on behalf of Ginny, and wanting all his money. Molly does have very negative associations that female characters are often portrayed with, like being a big gossip (she believed everything Skeeter wrote down about Hermione, for one, and treated her terribly afterwards). Her treatment of Fleur is also frustrating, and I hated that plot point so much, because it perpetuated the stereotype of women being catty gossips. But to be honest there's also always going to be people like that in the world - male or female - and I'm glad the books addressed it.

The brilliance of her character however is that she embodies so many traits and avoids becoming an archetype. I think Molly and Mrs Weasley are two very seperate people. Molly was the one who lost two brothers brutally to the war, and later had ther murderer break out of prison, so she must've been nerve-wracked with worry for her children even afterwards, on top of her Order work. The way she tries to have some control over Fred and George even after becoming of age and being entirely responsible for their actions, was as heartbreaking as the boggart scene. The fact that Rowling wrote it to be straight after the fight with Sirius wasn't an accident; Mrs. Weasley may be wrong at times, or overbearing but she just worries for the people she loves, even when they seem to think she is being overprotective.

But her involvement in the Order after her brothers' death always struck me as interesting. If she was so scared for her family, then she could easily just board herself there, prevent them from going to Hogwarts and stay under protection until the war has ended, and yet she rank the risk of herself dying and leaving them behind (as she confides in Lupin later, she's afraid of them being alone in the world). The fact that they were poor was also an added stress, both herself and Arthur were at risk of dying, and yet she wanted to make the world a better place for them (and Harry) by fighting. If she cannot protect herself, then she can protect them. She's the only woman within the Order who has that many children and yet still chooses to fight, because Molly is in her true nature a warrior, just like her brothers and her children. They must've gotten it from somewhere, after all. Molly wants to fight, Mrs Weasley wants to protect.

What I love about Molly (and so many other characters), is that they're good people. They're kind, they're loving and they're courageous and the everyone has a glaring flaw. This is always what has drawn me to the HP characters more than anyone else. Lupin can be a coward, Sirius can be thoughtless, Dumbledore has shady principles at points, Fletcher fights for the Order and yet is a crook, Harry has a hero complex, Hermione can be extraordinarily cruel. The list goes on and on.

Either way, I love Mrs. Weasley as a character, and I appreciate how well-written she is. Bashing in general is a sign of poor writing, but people can do what they want, after all, it is fanfiction. But the sign of a good writer is someone who appreciates all the good and bad qualities simultaneously, and balances them in writing.

I dislike it, but I understand her treatment of Fleur and she does try to get Ginny to stop calling her Phlegm. /However/ her treatment of Hermione after the Witch Weekly article is gross even if it's just for a moment. She should not have needed Harry to tell her it was rubbish.

Her disregard for Fred and George's dream was no good. That Ron was walking around with a second-hand wand with a hair sticking out while Percy received an owl and new robes was bad. Her treatment of Sirius was bad.

They said it was gross, not unacceptable. Though to be honest, I personally DO think it was unacceptable. She was a middle aged woman doing something cruel to a 14/15 year old girl, one who had been her youngest son's GOOD FRIEND for 3 years at that point. One who had spent time with them, been places with them, stayed at their house for weeks each year.

Knowing all that and knowing Hermione, Molly still chose to do something petty and cruel to "punish" her for a shitty article - all without ever asking her (or Harry, Ron, or any of her other kids) the actual TRUTH. She's an adult and should have known better.

************ I'm replying about your earlier comment on Sirius. I'm defending him simply for one major reason. Mental health. Now I know this series is very illogical across the board, no doubt about it. This is one thing that was never addressed. Sirius was in a prison that essentially made you relive your worst memories over and over. Whether or not he had an ability to dampen the effects, the amount of exposure is still extremely damaging. Have you wondered why he might treat Harry like James? It's been about fourteen years for him in Order of the Phoenix, thirteen in prison and one on the run. The concept of time when all you do is relive something, whether it be a dream or a nightmare, is extremely diminished. It's similar to being put in a coma, when you wake up you just remember what you last saw, even if it was years ago. Honestly in some aspects this series is fucking atrocious in how it handles mental health, or sensitive topics. This is just an example, similar to how people basically parade about on Halloween celebrating the downfall of Voldemort, with no disregard whatsoever to the deaths. Even Harry himself doesn't really fully acknowledge what it meant. It was essentially the day he lost his entire future. Maybe it's not wrong, and I don't know what I'm talking about but holy hell it's just awful to read and see them celebrating a child being orphaned. I get this is a fictional series, but it doesn't change how gruesome it actually was.

That said, I think of Molly as yet another flawed character in this cast of flawed characters. Her brothers were killed a few years before we see her. Of course she's overprotective of the family she has left. She's another traumatized character who isn't necessarily dealing well with that trauma.

A lot of fanfiction reduces Rowling's complex characters to simple caricatures. Molly is just one example.

I am going to vehemently disagree with that.

Fanfics are not written in a vacuum but in an ecosystem. Yesterday's reader is tomorrow's writer, and how a given writer sees and writes a given character is a function not only of the canon texts and the writer's values but also of how that writer has seen that character written in the past and what discussions they have had or seen about that character. This is not a value judgement, but a statement of fact.

If bad characterisations, bashing, pernicious (and, occasionally, benign) fanon, and other bad practices aren't called out, then whoever can put out pablum the fastest wins.

*"Don't like, don't read"* is a very healthy way to go about it.

People write from experiences, some people have shit, overbearing mothers and write Molly from that perspective, some people have great mothers and write her that way.

Bashing fics aren't 'wrong' or 'bad' they're someone's opinion and imagination.

Personal experience is one source of experience that influences characterisation; reading other fanfics and online discussions is another; there are myriad others.

Nobody's policing anyone's /thoughts/ or even what they /like/. People are judging each other's /acts/ of posting a particular story. And, it's up to each of us to decide what we believe is good and bad---within a story and for the whole ecosystem---and act accordingly.

You claim that just reading something makes people write the same. I call bullshit. I've talked to a few people and we agree that if anything, reading something makes you want to write the opposite, to do things right rather than whatever we've just read.

Again, the fanfic that people read is only one of several things that influence how they write.

It's not even a conscious process, most of the time. Can you ask those people whether they've ever thought that something was canon only to realise that it was from a fanfic? I can think of at least a few instances of that for myself---and I've probably forgotten many more.

Human memory is not like files on a computer, which you can open /read-only/, or where you can give two files different names and have contents of one not affect the contents of the other. Rather, every time we read a fanfic and a canon character or event is invoked, our memory of that character or event has the potential to be altered, often without us noticing.

Maybe a bashy portrayal of a character will cause an adverse reaction and motivate the reader to write a fanfic with the opposite portrayal (incidentally reinforcing that opposing image of the canon character in their memory, rather than leaving it intact). But usually, the bashed character is not the focus of the story, and so the reader will move on, their memory of the character subtly nudged in the direction of the fic without them realising it.

And there is a lot more fic than there is canon, so it adds up.

For example, what fraction of the fanfic-reading fandom would you say thinks that Dumbledore ordered Hermione and Ron not to write to Harry during the summer of 1995, and that they obeyed? (As I am sure you know, in canon, he only told them not to put anything sensitive in their letters, which was a very good idea at the time, even if it frustrated Harry.)

Now, given how many fanfics actually /start/ from that point and include that as a key element of their premise without giving any indication that this is a deliberate divergence from canon, I'd say that it's quite a high fraction of the fandom. I don't think they've all developed this misconception independently.

Bashing is just an extreme form of negative character distortion, and it is often a sum of milder ones accumulating up. Say, a writer might read a hundred Harmony fics in which Hermione is portrayed as an authority-worshipper "rescued" by Indy!Harry from this mindset---a portrayal that is actually sympathetic, if degrading. Then, they sit down to write a non-Harmony fic, and when Hermione makes an appearance, her fanon authority-worship becomes a point of bashing.

The example I gave elsewhere on the thread---that Dumbledore prevented his friends from writing to Harry during the summer of OotP---is a very common misconception and an inconsequential detail in the grand scheme of tings. And yet, it motivates massive amounts of conspiracy-mongering and Dumbledore-bashing.

**** So you're telling me that you voluntarily read things tagged with 'bashing' to bully people into stop writing bashing?

I'm hyperbolizing your behaviour, of course (I hope) to make a point. If someone writes a fic with bashing and it gets little views or a lot of views but 3 kudos (meaning the readers didn't like what was written) they will understand that bashing is not something to write to appeal the public and write something else (or not, if someone writes for themselves might keep writing what they like instead of what will give them kudos).

"Don't like it, don't read it" is based upon that ecosystem.

You are saying that you don't like bashing, but other people do evidently, or there wouldn't be that many kudos in fic with bashing. Bad characterization, bashing and bad practice aren't objective - this is fanfic, everything is in various degrees of out of character.

**** I somewhat agree with you in the sense that, whatever the craft, your art is open to critique once you publish it, and that there are ways to objectively criticize art. However, I think that the disconnect between you and the other people here is that most people don't read fanfic because they think it's good art. Don't get me wrong, a lot of fanfics are well-written, plenty of people write fanfic to improve their skills, and a lot of people only enjoy fanfics that are well written. But that's only a portion of people who read and write fanfics. Others do it as a hobby to get their stories out and don't care about improving as an artist, others don't care about the quality as long as it's readable and it fills what they're looking for. Others still might purposefully read poorly written fics. A lot of people just sort of see it as something to read for entertainment and not think about it too hard, like Transformers. While you can criticize it, most people aren't going to care. It's kind of like trying to criticize The Room; no one watches The Room because it's an amazing drama or should be treated as such, but because it's entertaining.

This goes a bit deeper than your original statement and touches on criticism as a whole, mostly the last part of the comment I'm replying to. However, as for bashing, simply disliking a trope isn't enough to objectively criticize it. There's a reason that tropes exist, and the usage of tropes doesn't make something inherently bad. Look at the Star Wars OT: it's just The Hero's Journey but in space. But it still uses that template well and makes a decently original take on it. So the issue wouldn't simply be the usage of a trope, but rather how it's used and how the story is written as a whole. Another thing is that you can't really compare canon characterizations with fanfic ones, unless the person is trying to make it canon-compliant up to a certain point, in which case, if the characterization is grossly inconsistent with canon, then it's fair enough to criticize. However, pretty much every fanfic is its own universe with its own characters who have the same names. So you need to see how each individual fic portrays the characters and judge them one at a time rather than throwing out a blanket statement saying that all fics that include this are bad. The most well-written fanfic out there could very well be a Molly bashing fic, or at least something you would consider Molly bashing.

***** Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I don't want to spend any more time on this conversation than I have to---not least because the ancestor posts have been downvoted into hiding and so I have no idea who is still reading this---so I'll try to be brief.

1. I think that any criticism that is factually accurate is fair. The line between the objective and subjective is a fine one and is often itself subjective, which leaves us with the marketplace of ideas: I'm a judge; you're a judge; the writer is a judge; everyone's a judge!
2. If the author intends to give a character a non-canon characterisation, the only thing I ask is that they put it in the summary or in the A/N. It is when bashing and other degradation is sprung on the reader without warning that it becomes a problem. If the reader notices, then it's a theft of the reader's time, because the reader had invested time in reading the fanfic under the assumption that the writer was writing in canon universe unless otherwise stated. If the reader doesn't notice, then it's more insidious, because the reader's view of canon is nudged towards the degraded portrayal---which will influence the reader if they ever write, thus polluting the whole fanfic ecosystem.
3. I would ask the proponents of the Don't-Like-Don't-Read maxim to apply it to criticism: don't like to be criticised, don't read the criticism.

This describes almost every adult in Harry's life, so it's unfair to use it as ammunition against Molly specifically. There's plenty of indication that Remus knew about the abuse and he never advocated for Harry as far as we know (other than to be part of the group who warned the Dursleys to lay off Harry at the end of book 5, which isn't really worth much of anything). The same could be said about Arthur, but somehow only Molly gets the blame. Sirius is really the only one who tried to remove Harry from the Dursleys, and we all know why that didn't work out.

Maybe Molly was being naive or deliberately obtuse, but I don't see this as a reason to hate her. She saw Harry as her son, and just as she wouldn't want her children to be put in the line of fire, she didn't want that for Harry either. She was wrong, but it was coming from a place of love. Despite the fact that Harry has been failed by adults in the past, he's still a 15 year old kid, and to a middle-aged adult, that's impossibly young, and she's just trying to protect him, even if she's going about it in the wrong way.

That's a stretch.

That's the thing about child-centric stories. There's no easy way to put them in dangerous situations without making all the adults incompetent. It's just that as the characters aged and the series grew darker, the incompetence of the adults became harder and harder to ignore. It's the same issue with the Dursley's abuse. In the first couple of books, they were written as somewhat cartoonish, but things seemed more sinister in later books, when Harry started showing signs of PTSD from the graveyard, which illustrated the very real consequences of the trauma he went through.

I actually think this is one of the most realistic flaws/mistakes of any adult in the series, as it was clearly framed as a problem in the book rather than glossed over like the other issues you mentioned. It also felt very real, somehow, like something a person might do in real life. His actions were fueled by pain, fear that his child would be like him, and a need to be needed. He saw the error of his ways and went back to his family, and his actions were never painted as anything but wrong.

There's two things that could've been done by this series, either explain it away by saying those with more magic mature faster, or start it from a more mature standpoint. It feels a lot more like an elementary at times honestly, which is my overall problem.

** Honestly, my biggest issue with Mrs Weasley is her utter disregard for the abuse Harry has to suffer. There were bars on his windows? Better to (jokingly) threaten my own children with the same abuse. Oh, Harry gets no food? Better send him some rather than get any authorities involved.

I know that the British law is a bit different to German one, but here "failure to rend aid" is a criminal offence. British law is different in so far that it only applies to people under your responsibility, but given that Molly claims the parent role (most notably when talking to Sirius), at least by my logic she also gets all the responsibilities, meaning that she has to ensure Harry's well-being if she claims the mother role. And she fails to do so spectacularly.

When Harry was grieving Cedric, nothing, followed by telling the boy who faced Voldemort 4 times due to adult incompetence that he's too young. After Sirius' death, nothing again. Before that, in book 2 she says that she was worried about Harry to the point of getting him away from the Dursleys the next weekend, but despite her sons telling her about the windows, she never does anything. Not informing any authorities (and her husband works for a branch of the DMLE), nor intervening personally or even threatening the Dursleys. Just nothing but sending token food and keeping her mouth shut. That is bordering on helping the Dursleys with their abuse. She had the opportunity to stop them, but she does nothing.

As long as he lives with family he is protected, with such protection Dumbledore himself couldn't rival it.

He has /told/ Harry this, and we've every reason to think he's told the Weasley parents this as well. We know for instance, that Mrs Weasley, at the end of GoF asked Dumbledore if Harry could go straight to the Burrow instead of back to Privet Drive.

The lack of information reaching Harry throughout the OotP is because Dumbledore knows that Voldemort has access to information via Harry. Over the preceding summer, all Dumbledore has to do is tell the Order that they cannot owl Harry because it is not safe, and that's what they do.

I know I am far from alone in wishing Dumbledore had found a better way around the whole Harry-crux issue - I'm sure there are whole swathes of fanfiction created specifically to "fix", or at least less frustratingly address, all the communication issues in OotP. But Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard of the age, the Big Good, and The Only One He Ever Feared, so it's not exactly a fair criticism of Molly Weasley to say that she trusted instructions Dumbledore gave.

I suspect that, because Dumbledore strongly believed by this point that Voldemort had a means of obtaining information via Harry, that he would have asked the Weasleys not to contact Harry - for his own safety. And the Weasleys, wanting to keep Harry safe, and trusting Dumbledore, would have done as they were asked.

You're telling me Dumbledore, with all his years of experience, couldn't figure out in about that same amount of time? I mean, the 3 major creatures that can cause petrification or death via its eyes are the gorgon, the cockatrice, and the basillisk. The gorgon is out as it would have had to be illegally flown in from Greece where they typically make their homes so that leaves the two serpent-like beings. Potter is able to talk to snakes, a fact that Snape most definitely shared with Dumb-as-a-door, and the messages were in relation to Salazar Slytherin whose symbol was a snake. So, a creature is going around paralyzing students but leaving no mark so a cockatrice is out as it has a sharp beak and claws/talons and the boy that can speak to snakes can hear it.

Hermione making the ABSURD leap in logic that the basilisk's gaze is being diluted by reflections and, instead of maiming or causing internal damage to the students, petrifies them is one of the least believable parts of her character.

Knowing what the creature is is fantastic, and as far as I remember there's no reason to think Dumbledore hadn't also worked it out by the time he was forced from the school.

But what can you actually do with that information?

It's only because Harry a) made the leap that Myrtle had information about the Chamber's location and b) could speak parseltongue to open it and c) rather luckily summoned a sword from a hat, delivered by a bird /that was quite probably sent to help him by Dumbledore/ and was able to get a lucky stab at the basilisk's face that he succeeded.

We don't know what Dumbledore was planning, but it probably wasn't "I'll sit on my hands and see what Harry does next" - more likely he had intended to use Fawkes himself to get an advantage over the basilisk, but wasn't able to find and/or access the Chamber in order to do so.

People seem to assume that because Dumbledore is a very clever character and manipulator that therefore everything that happens in the books must have been according to Dumbledore's master plan... not leaving any room for him to be mistaken, run out of time, have his plans scuppered, for anything to happen that he didn't predict.

But at the same time as thinking he has a grand scheme which accounts for all these twists and turns, so that everything ultimately follows his designs, they argue he's "dumb as a door" (which I like, by the way).

Unless you can find and access the chamber, you can't rid the school of the basilisk.

Let's say around about the time Harry and Ron discover Hermione's brainwave, and deduce that none of the victims die (what you'd /expect/ he victim of a basilisk to do) due to the power of reflection, that Dumbledore has also just added it all up.

Suddenly, he's forced out of the school.

I agree with a lot of your points but not about this. You're doing a disservice to Sirius. He has many flaws but his friends were 20/21 when they died. How many people can say with complete honesty that they were masters of themselves at that age? His friends were just murdered, and his other best friend was the one to sell them out to Wizarding Hitler. You're damn right he went after Pettigrew. He's 20/21 years old and you people want him to be the picture of self control.

The other thing is that he gave up use of his own home for the Order. He was then imprisoned there - yes IMPRISONED - in the very place where he was abused by his own parents. It's canon that he ran away from home as soon as he could. It can take years for victims of abuse to get better and Sirius was sent to, essentially, hell on earth when he was 21. So yeah he escaped prison, only to be put into another prison immediately after. He came back to England and endured it all for Harry. Molly has no excuse for the things she says to Sirius. What she said was cruel and petty.

​

Keep in mind that I can certainly see things from Molly's PoV in that fight. She was traumatized by the death of her brothers, who were supposed to be powerful wizards in their own right. I can definitely understand her reluctance and need to protect the kids from what's going on. But what she said to Sirius crosses a LOT of lines that she had no business crossing.

*** Yeah, read or write whatever you want, I don't really care in general (there are some topics I do care about, but I won't broach that here). The one thing that people shouldn't do with bashing fics is recommend them as quality fics. That's very disingenuous. Say that they're a good bashing fic, say that it's one of the best guilty pleasure fics, whatever, just don't pretend that they have respectable quality. It's the one thing that drives me nuts about them, that people recommend them without disclaimers. I think bashing fics can be great fun, like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion), but people, please don't just tell people to read Sinyk or Harry Crow without disclaimer.

** Just because she takes care of her kids, doesn't mean that people can't point out her flaws. Bashing fics exaggerate the characters' flaws but they still exist even the the books. Molly is very overbearing and crosses her boundaries a lot. She had no business treating Hermione so harshly in book 4. And she can't forbid Sirius from sharing information with Harry. Harry is not her child. She went too far in her argument with Sirius in book 5. The Weasley parents didn't even bother buying Ron a new wand for his first year. How could they forget that a wand is very important to a wizard? They could have focused on buying Ron a new wand and could have bought Percy's new owl a few months later, with some savings.

** She crosses a line with the howlers. Good plot device, horrible parenting.

She tries to shelter Harry from bad news. Sounds good, but not really. Knowledge is power, and lack of knowledge killed Sirius Black.

Forcing children to clean a house filled with dangerous pests and dark artifacts, without magic. Which doesn't at all mesh with her advice to Harry to...

... leave everything dangerous to the adults. So, when are the adults going to handle it? I'm at a loss to see how any adults handled anything in books 1-5 (books 6-7 doesn't exist, they were never written, they're a figment of our imagination).

Sweaters. Why did she make one for Harry? Because she's enamored with the Boy-Who-Lived hyperbole. She turns Ginny into a fangirl. Why didn't Hermione get one? She's Ron's friend too. Maybe it's because she's a /girl/. Girls shouldn't fly on brooms.

She's a hypocritical prude. "Scarlet woman"? Really? She gave Arthur a love potion, and then treated it like a joke afterwards.

She wants her children (and Harry, and probably everyone else) to conform to her narrow worldview. She can't accept long hair, or a fanged earring, or wanting to make a career outside of the (immensely boring and corrupt) Ministry.

She may mean well, but she's unable to follow through.

You need to re-read the books.

There's not a shred of evidence Molly turned Ginny into a fangirl, and in fact told Ginny off for wanting to go onto the train to see Harry again.

Furthermore, she does too give Hermione a hand-knit sweater. This is mentioned in several of the books.

And with regards to Ginny being prevented from flying, that was all on her big brothers who didn't want to play with a girl. We never see Molly prevent Ginny from flying.

** What always struck me as funny is that quite a bit of "Molly Bashing"* is *not even intentional*, but occurs as direct consequence of changes made to other characters.\\
*note the " "

Molly Weasley is good, kind, courageous and generous person. She can also be quite stubborn and rash. All of those traits are part of her and quite necessary - while raising 7 children you can't allow yourself to be distracted or swayed on important matters, you have to act quick before the kids make a big mess (especially with magic), ensure they all have what they need, be there when they need you, cook, clean...

As a result, we have a curious Gryffindor-Hufflepuff hybrid that is not used to being told no and shoulders much responsibility, especially when it comes to matters of the household. Arthur Weasley might provide the money, but it's Mrs Weasley that makes it last.

This naturally leads to sparks flying when in contact with independent characters, or outside her remit. We see it at Grimmauld Place, where Mrs Weasley arrives and immediately assumes the duties she is used to. Obviously, Sirius is not happy about her claiming ultimate authority in his house, or over his godson. He might have limited means due to the injustice system of magical Britain, but he still does his best and dislikes having that thrown in his face.

*On to bashing:* One of major issues fans have with Harry is that he's kind of reactive, and a bit of a doormat at times. Hermione catches flak for authority worship and occasional no-fun attitude. Ron, for being lazy and ambitious and not book smart.

When those traits are changed, with Harry acting for himself, Hermione diversifying her interests and abandoning her post as Avatar of Rowling, Ron starting to work at actually achieving his ambitions (even if it's just Quidditch or noticing Chess tournaments as an opportunity)... They suddenly need a mother figure less. The influence of Molly Weasley, once welcome, starts to feel constricting. Coddling. Confining.

You can't really test your limits in a padded room. It's soft. It's comfy. It's safe. You are provided for... And you die inside. So, they try to leave, to grow up. Make some mistakes, learn from them. Find their paths on the crossroads of life.

Of course, Molly likes that not at all. In her opinion the young birds are too small and weak to leave the nest - and that is not taking into account the fact that Bill is in Egypt, Charlie in Romania, Twins do their own thing, Percy is lost to the Ministry, Ron and Ginny away at Hogwarts for most of the time... All her children, so far away.\\
This leads to conflict of interest - the children want to grow up. She wants them to stay with her, accept her care and never leave.

That leaves the Author with 3 options:\\
- Write Mrs Weasley out of the story\\
- Change her to eliminate the problem\\
- Keep her original characterization and regularly remove "Muh bashing" messages from the inbox.

I am, of course, not including explicit bashing like Potion!Weasleys here, but only part of the whole that is Weasley bashing.

Being overprotective is in the job description.

I am also concerned by the fact that some people think Molly's behavior is toxic and uniquely horrible. Have... have any of you ever had a mother? Because I know for a fact that of the woman who birthed me would not hesitate to dropkick any mf who is not up to par. Yeah there's arguments and disagreements about what falls under “up to par”.... that's the whole point.

Anyway, I'm just sick of people bashing characters because of singular mistakes and then exaggerate their personalities to fit their narrative. Characters are supposed to be flawed, not black and white.

She's allowed to have faults and failings. Because she's a "doting mother" doesn't mean she has to be written as a flawless character. She'd be boringly one-dimensional if that was the case. In many fics I generally skip over her parts unless there's something new and interesting an author has brought to her character. Her being a scheming manipulator can be refreshing if written well. If that's an interpratation of her character you dislike, then drop the fic in favour of another that caters to your preference.

The books are set in the 90's, and the Wizarding world is behind that in some ways. Being a stay-at-home spouse/parent is perfectly acceptable in that time period.

Arguably, her kids having magic makes a stay-at-home parent /necessary/ at least until Ginny goes to Hogwarts - there's no mention of Wizarding pre-school, which kinda brings me neatly to the next section.

#+begin_quote

Okay, this is just creating slights out of thin air. Her kids can read and write, and have a working knowledge of the Wizarding world - all of which they have to have picked up from /somewhere/. Since sending Wizarding kids to a Muggle school is a Statute of Secrecy breach waiting to happen, the most likely answer is, in fact, that Molly was homeschooling them.
