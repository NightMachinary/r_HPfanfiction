** 1. Get rid of the authors note at the start. You're right in it that it does make me run for the hills, and even if it was to my usual taste it gives away major plot points. Perhaps beef up your summary a little with allusions to what's to come, but otherwise let your readers enjoy the journey. They'll figure out pretty quickly it's AU.
2. I'm sorry I just find the prophecy bit super cheesy. When we hear prophecies in canon, we've had a lot of build up to the world. To be faced with it immediately just feels a bit jarring to me and it doesn't feel authentic. It feels more natural, from a story telling perspective, for the hero to find out about a prophecy /with/ the reader, some way in.
3. You have some basic grammar mistakes, including confusion over there/their/they're (it should be their doom, not there) capitalisation (thousand should not be capitalised unless it's the start of a sentence, for example), forgetting question marks and many others. Learn your grammar rules and then proof-read carefully - printing it out can help, or reading it backwards.

#+begin_quote
  Vernon Dursley pinned His nephew to the kitchen wall in a rage. He couldn't believe how disastrous this trip turned out to be. This, this freak had the nerve to ruin his sons birthday! That snake could have kill him! Vernon thought. Spluttering in fury. "How dare you set that snake on my son! You freak!" landing a solid punch in his nephews gut. Harry's eye bulged in pain as he vomited on the pristine kitchen floor. the crazed look in his uncles eyes was terrifying. Sure, his uncle had hit him before. But this was something entirely different. It was like his uncle was actually trying to kill him! In a panic, Harry hurriedly shoving at his uncle try to get the big man off. Suddenly a feeling almost like a wave of heat blast out from the palms of his hands. sending Vernon flying across the room crashing against the kitchen counter. stumbling back Harry shared, transfix at his hands. "What is going on? How in the hell did I do that?" Hearing loud running steps coming his way. Harry quickly glanced up from his hands, there was nothing he could do to stop uncle running at him. Something long and silver glinting in his fat right hand.

This is way too rushed and melodramatic. Slow down. I think generations of writers have been ruined by being told they need to start with a bang, but this level is just a bit ridiculous. Scale it down, don't go over the top. Also remember that lines of dialogue from new characters need to be in their own new paragraph. 5. You're over powering Harry and I know that's something that some people like but pacing is really important in a story and it just feels like you're trying to do everything at once.

Onto good stuff, because I like to make sure all crit comes with positives:

1. I like that you're bringing in some Ministry workers and having them respond to the crisis rather than Dumbledore, who is more commonly used in these sorts of stories. It makes more sense and gives you more potential for world building.
2. Your dialogue definitely could use some work, but generally feels natural for a first time writer, and that is a really tricky part of writing for lots of people.
3. I like how you've interpreted how the Ministry would monitor underage magic.

*** Thanks for the feedback. I really Appreciate it.

1) The first chapter was supposed go that fast it's not being rushed. It's to reflect the urgent nature of what's going on. The story slows down a lot in the second chapter. That's the primary reason I stopped where I did.

2) As for overpowering Harry. I completely agree with you. What you see in this chapter is not his Power at all, more like cause-and-effect. Which is explained in the next chapter.

3) On the grammar side I'm still learning and not the best at all. But I will say the random capitalization is my keyboards problem. The shift key randomly likes to go off. I thought I had fixed them, all my bad.

4) As for the prophecy it was really just an intro. Loosely based on the Karaethon Cycle from the wheel of time. No real story impact.

5) I always really like when authors put notes at the beginning. It keeps people from wasting their time on stories they won't like. Like if the story has a pairing you don't support or a theme you don't like. Or is it something a lot of people don't like? It's only there the help people if it's bugging them I will take it down.

Any advice better dialogue or will that just come with practice?

**** 1) There are ways to create a sense of urgency without skimming over important details. Think about the climax of OOTP. Harry is urgent and desperate to rescue his godfather. You can feel his frustration and panic. But Rowling makes sure the reader knows what's going on. At the moment, you've over done it so much that actually the reader doesn't really feel invested, because despite your intention it feels more like you can't be bothered to create a context for anything that's happening. Take the time to add description and pacing, it really pays off and doesn't need to detract from the tone of the story.

2) Hmm, ok, but still feels off to me. This is not at all my usual type of fic though, so YMMV.

3) It's ok to still be learning, I briefly worked as an English teacher and still make mistakes. Grammar is boring and hard. You're certainly not as bad as many people we see. But this is why proof-reading is so important.

4) If it has no story impact, remove it. It's distracting and unnecessary. I haven't read wheel of time so perhaps it works there, but it certainly doesn't here.

5) Use your summary to signal what sort of story it is. You've already put the pairing which is a good start, and that in itself lets the reader know that it's AU. You also suggest in the summary the point of canon divergence which is helpful info for people. Perhaps slip in a line about Harry discovering unique powers and distinguished ancestors or something if you want. All the authors note does is turn people off - like you've said in it, you're not going to leave something out just because it's a cliche, and that's fine, but if people aren't expecting it they may be surprised with how well it's written.

In terms of dialogue, it's the same with the rest, really, just slow down a little. It will come with practice. You're in a good position in that unlike many new authors you don't have bad habits like overuse of names in dialogue or awkward robot voice, and we can even start to see the development of unique voices for all the different characters which is really good stuff. But you definitely overuse internal dialogue and there are a few moments where the dialogue feels contrived/expositiony, like here:

#+begin_quote
  "Could it be a Obscurial, no that's impossible the detector had a color for Obscurials. What's going on here? Dudley Dursley that name sounds familiar and Harry Potter's cousin." Amelia though frantically, suddenly the truth hit her like a Ton of bricks.
#+end_quote

I know in real life people often talk to themselves in a rambling sort of way like that when they're trying to figure something out/remember it (and it's really good that you're replicating how people talk in real life), but it doesn't read well in fiction. This sentence is also riddled with grammar mistakes so it's quite hard to figure out what on earth she is talking about - again, realistic, but not good for reading.

***** Hmm, I see what your saying. How to fix it, Is the question? Maybe tone back on the Dramatic description and add the car ride home for the zoo. That way it not instantly into the action.

As for the dialogue. That supposed to be inner thoughts, not out loud. Apparently I need to make that more clear. In fact that whole scene needs a update. I don't like how it reads.

I will remove the authors note and the prophecy. That's not a problem.

As for his power again it all comes down to the explanation next chapter.

****** I think it's just a matter of taking the time to give description - let things slowly escalate rather than suddenly exploding. In my fic, there is actually an explosion that takes everyone by surprise, but I still make sure that I describe the surroundings and characters first - I give them reactions and allow the reader time to process what is going on. It's a tricky balance to get right, but in essence you shouldn't be tring to force your reader to read quickly - they will do so anyway if they want to find out what happens.

Yes, I was aware that they are inner thoughts, but you're still over using them. They need to be incorporated into the prose and very sparingly used in the same way as dialogue. It's a bit... corny? Cheesy? To hear inner thoughts in this way.

**** In terms of dialogue, I agree with FloreatCastellum, in that your dialogue is actually pretty good for a first-time writer. To improve, many people on Reddit have suggested to read your dialogue out loud and see how it sounds. Is it natural? Are the characters talking at each other, or are the characters talking to each other? Does it sound...normal? Some authors have a natural flair with their dialogue, while others need more work. With practice, you'll have it well done in the future.

The story overall has an interesting premise, but I definitely recommend proofreading your work, at least two different times. Grammar seems to be one of your biggest downfalls, but again, that's something that can be fixed.

***** Thank you. I'm working on a mass update for the first chapter. Slowing down the pacing, cutting the authors note, rewriting a few scenes and fixing all the bad grammar I can find. Oh, and making sure readers know when dialogue is supposed to be in the characters head and not out loud. That seems to be a problem.

****** Something I noticed while reading was you used lots of short sentences in a row.

#+begin_example
  Sure, his uncle had hit him before. But this was something entirely different. It was like his uncle was actually trying to kill him! 
#+end_example

And your longer sentences feel rushed as well:

#+begin_example
  Suddenly a feeling almost like a wave of heat blast out from the palms of his hands. sending Vernon flying across the room crashing against the kitchen counter.
#+end_example

An easy way to fix this is to combine the shorter sentences to draw them out, and to add commas to the longer ones, slowing them down a bit. This makes them easier to read and you can shape the sentences to emphasize them.

For the two examples I shared, I would rewrite them like so:

#+begin_example
  Sure, his uncle had hit him before - but this was something completely different, it was like his uncle was actually trying to kill him.

  Suddenly, a feeling almost like a wave of heat blasted out from his palms, sending Vernon flying across the room and crashing against the kitchen counter.
#+end_example

One way you can indicate thoughts might be using 'asdf' for thoughts, instead of "asdf" which is used for dialogue. This isn't standard, but many different fanfic authors use different techniques like this to indicate thought. Other than that, just be mindful of the verbs you use for framing the inner dialogue.

I think you have some good ideas in this fic, and if you dedicate a bit more time to editing I think you will be able to write something you can be quite proud of! Good luck. :)

** Just by giving the chapter a quick read over, a couple things stood out to me were a little bit of a turnout. Luckily, most of them are easy to fix.

/1. Formatting./ I highly recommend using the bold, italics, and horizontal line options to better format your story to make it more visually appealing for your readers. The biggest case would be your author's note (more on that later). I suggest using the bold function for your author's note text to help make it clear that it isn't a part of the story. Another suggestion, especially for clarity here, would be the letter Amelia Bones sent. At first, it's really unclear if it's dialogue or something else. By putting it in italics, you could help make it more clear that it is a letter.

/2. Spelling and Grammar./ There's a couple instances of capital letters cropping up in the middle of sentences. Make sure to proofread (or use a spell checker) to eliminate these as simple mistakes like those are turnoffs for many readers.

/3. Author's Note./ Like the other Reddit-er, I agree that at least some of the author's note has to go. I understand where you're coming from with wanting to keep it, but some parts of it are a little unnecessary. If you really want to keep it, I'd say you can keep your first little intro and 2, 3, and 6. Even 2 is a little unnecessary though because you can put it in your initial description.

/4. Concepts./ While some parts feel a bit rushed (Vernon beating up Harry, the jumps between the Ministry departments) I think you have some really interesting ideas that could turn out quite nicely. One thing with the prophecy though...if it has no real story impact, then why include it? It sounds kind of cool, but if it's not going to have a major impact, you probably don't need to include it in chapter one. Or, if you do include it, you could omit your first line where you have information describing the prophecy and instead jump right into the prophecy itself. It could add a little extra mystery to the story.

Happy writing!

*** The author is gone i'm just still polishing up the update that takes it out. About the prophecy when I said it has no real impact on the story. As in the characters will never find or read it. I put it there to add a bit mystery to the story and to act as a very vague plot outline. So when something big happens they go cool that was in the prophecy.

*** Question, you said the I was going to fast when jumping between ministry departments. How would you fix it? I mean fixing the fight with his uncle is easy. They're reacting to a crisis situation of course it's going to be fast-paced. I guess, I just don't get what you mean on this point.

***** The first chapter is turned out kinda like a prologue. I had to make a decision when I was writing it. Stop there or have a crazy long like first chapter. The second chapter which is in the works. Is going to be long and have a ton of plot development. For example here is just some I have to get done next chapter.

1) The aurors getting Harry. That will only take a couple paragraphs. 2) Wizengamot most decide on what to do with Harry and explain what happened with his magic. A couple of other things as well, 3) Introduce the readers to the Greengrass family and their struggle. 4) Implement the ministries decision. That will take a while. 5) Have Harry wake up in the hospital. 6) Harrys new living arrangements and character introductions. Not the Greengrass family of that's what your thinking. 7) School supplies. 8) The train. Maybe I'll go all the way to the sorting but I doubt it.

** It seems very dangerous to me to have so many fast PoV switches. Multiple PoVs can be done right, but they can also be a lazy excuse to justify excessive head-hopping. Is Vernon going to be a recurring character? What about that Boris Cromwell guy?

If this is just a one-off scheme for your introduction it might be okay though.
