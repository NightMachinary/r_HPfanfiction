How do y'all feel about Dumbledore raising/manipulating young Tom Riddle into defeating Grindelwald and then taking credit for it? And then doing the same to Harry to kill the dark lord he created.

Seen it done well anywhere?


** How well it was done is up to the reader:

** That seems like it would be really hard to do well. Maybe if you treated it like a murder mystery story where Harry slowly uncovers the truth it could come out okay. Most likely without a professional editor, though, you would end up with a million words of nothing. I would at least..
