So I think there's a short story of Fleur agreeing to go with Ron to the Yule Ball, but I'm thinking on a longer story. So here are some points:

1. Ron goes with Fleur, he is still shocked to see Hermione's new look at the Ball
2. Hermione and Ron may or may not have a huge fight at the common room after each one passes an acceptable evening with Krum and Fleur respectively
3. Without a wingman, Harry doesn't go for the Patil twins. But everyone else is taken. And Harry is a champion. Either Harry goes alone and people laugh at him, of Ginny suggests Luna, and people laugh at him. He could take somebody else, but with his terrible dancing, his friends apart and no Ron to lean on has an even more awful night than in the original.
4. Hermione and Ron are of course jealous of each other, so you can get an HBP kind of plot around them, but two-way.
5. Since Gabrielle didn't make the trip to England... You get Ron being Fleur's important person for Fleur and Hermione is for Krum. And without them, Harry has to rescue either Hedwig from the Lake (where Dumbledore announces to everyone that he couldn't find another student who meant more to him than his owl). Or Hagrid, who is too heavy for Harry to pull out of the Lake.

Edit:

Bonus points if the Dursleys are made to go to the stands of the Third Task and just keep telling everyone how they think their nephew is going to lose because he is a whiny little prat. Petunia hears of the goblet and tells everyone that she totally believes Harry cheated to put his name there. Vernon asks where he can bet against the boy, puts a lot of money on Krum because he looks like a tough boy.


** But of course, since Harry isn't going with one of the Patil twins that just means that Daphne/Susan/Tracey/Pansy/Hannah/Aragog has to approach Harry with some excuse to go to the Yule Ball with him, he accepts, and they all live happily ever after.

Ummmm. These are the people that thought it was a good idea to stare at a lake for two hours. And a hedge for just about the same time.

Them actually thinking about anything would break canon too much.

***** Reminds me of the Cupboard Series. Harry goes to a different school 4th year and they're deciding whether to attend the second task as guests when they get details on it, "You want us to sit outside and stare at the black lake for a few hours? In January? We'll pass. Thanks you, Albus."

** Want to really open a box of trouble?

After the ball Fleur takes Ron back to her carriage to give him a private good night. All of Ron's underlying envy concerning Harry's perceived wealth and fame is flipped on its head when people start talking about how Ron is the first guy in their year to score and he did it with the hottest girl in the castle no less. What actually happened in the carriage was probably /far/ less than what the other students have imagined (and probably very embarrassing for Ron) but that's not going to get in the way of him basking in his new reputation. Or 'Ron becomes an insufferable prick'.

*** Turns out Fleur also really enjoys chess.

so she and ron had an amazing night where they played chess and talked and ron opened up about his inner insecurities and fleur opens up about her own which are quite similar to harry's. and then for the next week everyone keeps talking about him and fleur and how he scored with her.

and ron completely hates it.

Methinks fanon is bleeding in.

Ron did have elements for bragging (after the second task for instance that lasted until early March or so; see chapter 27 of book 4 for proof) but I don't think it'd go /that/ far. I don't think Fleur would tolerate rumours like that going around and that would put an end to any future relationship between the two, platonic /or/ romantic.
