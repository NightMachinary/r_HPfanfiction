I assume a fic with this concept exists but I cannot remember any specific example of it happening.

Basically, I'm looking for a fic where Ron/Hermione still end together but Harry still is in love with/likes/wants to bang Hermione. This can either be a side-plot or the central focus of the story. I would prefer Harry to be the central character, but if the writing is good I'm not fussed. Slash is accepted as equally as Non-Slash.

I don't think any of the characters came off sympathetically at all but it's the closest I can think of that meets your request.
