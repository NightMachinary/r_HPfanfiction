Also, something's off with his pet rabbit.


** Tim also pays attention in Care of Magical Creatures:

--------------

Malfoy: "Ha! If Potter can ride that overgrown horse, then it must be a pushover. Out of the way, Tim. I'm going to show everyone how to really treat a hippogriff."

Tim: "You may go past. BUT! ONLY IF YE BE A MAN OF VALOR! For when insulted, that hippogriff can become a creature so wrathful, so cruel, that no wizard has stood before it and lived! Bones of full 50 purebloods lie strewn about its lair, so, Malfoy, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for DEATH awaits you, with a nasty big pointy beak!" (pantomimes)

Ron: "...What an eccentric performer."

Tim: "Listen, that hippogriff's got a vicious streak a mile wide. He's a killer!"

Malfoy: "Get stuffed."

Tim: "He'll do you up a treat, mate."

Goyle: "Oh, yeah?"

Tim: "I'm warning you!"

Crabbe: "What'll he do, peck at your bum?"

Tim: "He's got huge, sharp- he can leap about..." (holds hands apart) "...Look at the bones!"

Susan: "What?"

Malfoy: "Go on, Goyle. Ride the thing."

Goyle: "Right. Silly little bleeder. Horse-chicken stew, coming right up."

Tim: "Look!" (Buckbeak attacks)

Malfoy: "Merlin's beard!"

Tim: "I warned you! I warned you, but did you listen? No, oh no, it's just a silly little bird horse, isn't it, now? Well, it's always the same thing, I always tell them. Do they listen to me? No!"

Malfoy: "My father will hear about this!" (Runs while Tim laughs)

*** Fun fact - Tim was actually supposed to have a ludicrously long name, which was going to be the main joke in the scene, but John Cleese forgot it, so he called himself 'Tim' off the cuff. The other actor's nonplussed reactions sold it for them, so they made that the actual name.

** I definitely thought this was a reference to Tim the Toolman Taylor as a muggleborn, which I would also greatly enjoy. Sort of like Seamus, but with more product placement and wholesome messages.
