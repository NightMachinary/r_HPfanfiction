After binge reading the stuff on my last post. I decided I should continue the trend. Looking for some some well written depressing fanfics that can include a suicidal Harry, or one without a happy ending, or ones that that will make you cry. It could also be one where Harry kills himself, who knows?? Maybe romance to make it more tragic and sad, but if they do I would prefer Harry/daphne or harry/fleur. They just gotta be well written and sad. Thank in advance


** Harry's dead before this one even starts. It's beautifully tragic:

If I may recommend one of my own, this one makes readers cry:

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

** Oh yea, “without a happy ending” can also mean Harry doesn't get the girl

** /Friends/ by /the psychotic house elf/ (formerly glue and tar) on ffnet

Summary from ffnet:

#+begin_quote
  Instead of making new friends on the Hogwarts Express in 1995, Luna loses the only one she has. In the lonely year that follows, she discovers just how well the name 'Loony Lovegood' fits her. Insane!Luna. Very dark.
#+end_quote

It's dark and sad, but as it's only 21k words, it's a quick read.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
