I feel like I'm running out of new things to read, and OC fics are something I've always had a hard time letting myself give a chance to. So, with that in mind, does anyone have any OC Harry Potter stories that they just love?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098062/1/The-Red-Witch-and-the-Nightmare-Queen][The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen]] follows an entire cast of OCs and is set some time long after Harry's generation is grown up.

The fic incorporates interesting worldbuilding about Irish mythology interwoven with intense action and a suspenseful plot. The author has written some of the best magical duels that I have seen in fanfiction.

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.

** I really like kmbell92's tightly knit series. It's on wattpad but its well written. They wrote a number of fics that are interconnected but focus on different characters.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
