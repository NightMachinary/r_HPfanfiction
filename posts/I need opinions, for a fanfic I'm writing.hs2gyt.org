I am thinking of writing a HP fanfic, but it will be a little controversial, because I want to show the death eaters side. why they joined the dark lord.

It would tell the story of Isabelle Lupine, Remus' twin sister, where she is drawn to the Slytherin, and there she meets Bellatrix and Avery and begins to be influenced by ideals.

Bellatrix reveals to her that some Muggles know about the world of magic, and try anyway to draw the blood of wizards to study, and Lord Voldemort finds out that his own father was part of it, and then decides to gather a group of people to discuss strategies to rebel against the magic ministry and then hunt and retaliate the muggle murders, and be selective in whoever enters Hogwarts, as more and more Muggles were finding out about the world of magic and that was indeed dangerous for the wizarding world .

But muggle-loving Dumbledore thinks he doesn't have to fight back, just take more steps to keep from being discovered.

And Isabelle wonders, why should they always be discreet? They could not be who they were for fear, fear of Muggles and "witch hunters"

The ministry itself subdued magical beings like giants and house elves, hiding and treating them as a sub-category. But Voldemort thinks that they don't deserve this treatment and because they have magic blood they deserve more respect.


** Why this OC though? There is a wide range of death eaters to choose from, and, in doing so you might keep with canon.

** Go and write your story, but be sure to have written enough of it (meaning the best would be all) before you publish it, because writing negative character as your main persona is extremely difficult. C S Lewis wrote somewhere that The Screwtape Letters are so short mainly because he just couldn't stand to write Screwtape character any more, because the disgust would choke him.
