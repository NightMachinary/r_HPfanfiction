#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** This one with fem!MoD!Harry is awesome: linkffn(10131514)

This one with fem!teenager!Harry is awesome too (I especially liked the running gag where oblivious middle-earthers kept assuming she's a boy because of the wizard robes): linkffn(10055643)

There's also this HP-Hobbit crossover with male-turned-fem!Harry: linkffn(11154214)

I really like fem!Harry fics too for some reason. It's so hard to filter out the ones that are done well though

*** I was reading back to the beginning and then it got to Harry apparating and it broke it's self for me. That's the hardest part of lotr crossovers where Harry keeps all of his abilities. If he is in the know about needing to destroy the ring, he has the ability to do so, and then people would have to get creative with plot.

**** If you read further, theres a reason why Harry can't just apparate to Mount Doom and easily destroy it, actually. But I can see why such an OP Harry would turn you off.

  The Valar chose many companions to help them create Arda... save for Námo. The Judge of the Dead chose only one companion, who eventually pled for eternal rest. Too bad Námo had different plans. Eons later, Harry Potter woke up in a field of grass. "Sodding dreaming potions..."

** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1][Not Quite A Maia]] is pretty good. Fic's taken off FF.Net, but it's still up on Fictionhunt. In this story it's not Harry who goes to Middle-Earth, but Neville. And Molly Weasley. It's a little goofy, but I really like how it presents the contrast between HP magic and LOTR magic: HP magic is quicker, easier and flashier, and HP wizards use it a lot more freely, so they come across as hugely powerful to the Middle-Earth people. However. LOTR magic is on the whole stronger; it takes longer and is harder to build up properly, but when it strikes it strikes HARD.
