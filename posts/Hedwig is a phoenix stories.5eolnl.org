After reading Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194), Hedwig is reborn as a Phoenix and I find myself really liking this. Does anyone know of any stories that Hedwig is a phoenix or become one. Looking for longer fics but will look at any with a few exceptions. No crossovers please.

  YEAR ONE COMPLETE! Harry often wondered how he was supposed to raise a baby Phoenix, live life as a game, learn magic, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, and dodge political manipulations all while trying to make it through Hogwarts alive.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
