There was also a fic that I really wanted to read because it was popular (I think?) and looked good, but i couldn't get over the fact that Harry was called Izar.

Also! The amount of timetravel fics where the opening scene is Lily or James or someone explaining that Dumbledore was evil and Molly Weasley was slipping love potions.... /shudder/

And I just don't like the name, at all. It's dumb, it sounds stupid, and if you're looking for familiarity, then a fem!harry story isn't your cup of tea anyways.

As for names, I like ones which actual people would give their children. So Holly, Rose, Iris, etc. Just normal names like everyone else has. "badass" or "quirky" or "unique" names aren't half as cool as authors think. They usually just destroy my immersion.

** I avoid "Smart/Independent/Grey Harry" fics in general. I've read too many examples where it's synonymous with all the worst Dumbledore-bashing and Lord-Potter tropes.

Extra levels of avoidance if "Harry" is shorthand for Hadrian, Harold, or any number of faux-aristocratic names, paired with way too many last names.\\
Or if, in the first chapter, it becomes clear (inevitably through Goblin help) that Dumbledore has been committing all sorts of atrocities to keep Harry loyal.

Also, certain pairings. I would literally rather read Harry/Whomping Willow (and yes, that exists) than Snape/Hermione, Snape/Harry, Draco/Harry, or Voldemort/Harry.

Side note Biggest pet peeve. Not building up to bashing. I understand there are certain characters people don't like. It's fine but if you're going to bash them you can't just have harry or main character out of the blue be like i hate them now they are terrible.

**** Snarry time travel: I can think of several Snarry fics that would fit and that are not crap.

Another good way to deal with the age difference in Snarry is when you pair a 40+ year old Harry with a 60+ year Snape.

If you have never read Snarry before I would recommend "The most powerful magic" by cjr2, linkao3(2457953) . It is 40+ Harry with 60+ Snape, slow burn and canon-compliant.

Some "time" travel fics I can recommend

My Name is Cameron Sage by thesewarmstars, linkao3(1648439)

Escaping the Paradox by Meri, linkao3(2060)

Nature's Changing Course by Durrant, linkao3(872260)

and finally, Fate is a four letter word by Philo linkao3(4267422)

** When the fic has Manipulative!Dumbles(written that way), and instead of an interesting character it's some caricature with an evil laugh and/or totally cringe-worthy self monologues.

When people refer to Voldemort as Moldy Shorts or other stuff like that constantly, I can get it once or twice to break the ice and reduce their tension with some levity. I have no problem when french people make fun of his name or when people refer to him, as that Coward, Monster,etc...

When Harry has a single event at 14-16 and instantly turns in another person, gets a powerup(because it's not like he was already uncommonly capable in canon), some 12 or so Lordships and one to three beautiful and willing wives in one single visit to the local bank(I wish my visits to the bank ended that way,lol)

Large Blocks of text, just no, I can get some three or so lines, but it's not only bad but functionally hard to read.

Bad formatting.

A pet peeve, but when the author necessarily drags the shipping angst on and on and on up to a point you just start skipping or leaves altogether before it becomes boring.

More often than not, when there are several exclamation points tied to names in summary. Something like Dark!Evil!Powerful!Harry, Evil!Manipulative!Thief!Dumbles.

I have only seen /one/ believably made Evil!Harry, that had him gradually become evil and later become a Death Eater in a believable way, and guess what, there was no Evil!Harry on the summary!

He was raised in an orphanage and kind of mirrored Tom Riddle, just without all the hurting animals psychopath stuff, he hurt whoever hurt him and grew up hating muggles(as he later learned). He then has the distinct luck of meeting a smart Lucius who wants to convert him and gives him books with Dark and Ritualistic Magic, he starts delving in those and gradually wanting more power to protect himself(a la a Sith), it starts derailing from there.
