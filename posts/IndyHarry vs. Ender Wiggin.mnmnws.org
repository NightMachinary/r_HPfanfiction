** Indy!Harry is more like Bean/Achilles, more often than not.

Comes from a broken background. Desires to never be in that broken state again, and strives against returning with everything he has.

Good Indy!Harry comes off like Bean--accomplishing more and setting the world straight.

Bad Indy!Harry comes off like Achilles--turning against those who "helped" him, and self-centeredly attempting conquest.

edit: I want to add--because this is a fun topic and I've been thinking about it all day--that the trope!Harry that I would say Ender is closest to is probably MarySue!Harry. Ender is beset and pushed to his limits, but he is also shown to have almost no weakness. He is up to and better than any challenge.

As much as the books feature him as the main character, the events sort of happen around him, and what's interesting about the stories are the other characters, the settings, and the exploration of ideas.

*** I'm glad you like the topic! I've been mulling it for days but don't know the tropes firsthand so you have way better input. I guess with the Bean comparison then I'd say that it sounds like his background has more in common with Bean but his present is more Ender in terms of being the chosen one and how that's portrayed? Never thought of the Achilles comparison at all. I'm drawn to Bean and Ender for him because they're very well done depictions of gifted children.

I think we see some flaws of Ender in terms of his obsessiveness with the computer game and his inability to form real connections with his peers even though that's largely manufactured by the staff. It's interesting though, I usually hate flawless characters but adore Ender. OSC just really made him work for me.

** Damn, that's the first time I see this comparison and it makes a ton of sense. Never thought of it like that, it's very interesting!

** It's worth mentioning that /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by /Less Wrong/ is probably the most well known fic to directly make this comparison (only one I've heard of, but I don't read much Indy!Harry).

It's a very polarizing read, people tend to either really love it or really hate it. Regardless, it does fit the bill of unnaturally smart children, if nothing else.

*** That comparison makes sense. I always got the feeling I wouldn't like MOR because I'm in STEM but love fantasy so I don't like the idea of an author using STEM arguments to poke holes in fantasy. I think magic should make sense following the laws of magic but it's outside the realm of science.

**** It's quite hilarious watching Harry come to terms with the fact that magic /is/ outside the realm of science. Definitely would recommend it, I think the turn off for some comes down to the characterization more than anything else. I would argue it's one of those fics that gets better the deeper you dive.
