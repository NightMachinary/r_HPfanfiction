** I don't know if it's common, but it's definitely something I've seen in a few fics: Lockhart was a paedophile who used his skills (especially with Memory Charms) to prey on the students.

** I'm not sure if these would count as "conspiracy" theories, but:

- The students were petrified and not killed because Ginny was fighting Tom's influence.
- The students were petrified and not killed because the basilisk was fighting Tom's influence (for example, basilisk's purpose isn't to kill muggleborns but just to protect castle, so orders were contrary to its nature, but it is forced to do so).

Can you number your theories for easier discussion?

You could argue that they were intentionally written to rile up the school or induce paranoia (I've seen them used that way in fics where Riddle has a concrete plan besides merely returning to life). But yeah, in canon it would not be a smart move at all for Riddle to warn his opponents that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened.

****** Oh definitely. Don't wanna give spoilers, but the fics I was referring to above, Riddle had some secondary goal or purpose that specifically needed the messages written.

I completely agree that without these extra goals, the optimal move would be to just not write messages (and just randomly kill/petrify students).

******** Off the top of my head, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]] does it because [[/spoiler][Riddle knows Dumbledore knows Salazar Slytherin wasn't actually a blood purist. Blood purism started as a relatively recent political movement, so Dumbledore assumed the messages were a red herring. To keep leading Dumbelore astray, Riddle petrifies people that aren't muggleborn]]

Another (which I can't remember now :( since i read it a long time ago) involved isolating the Slytherin house even more so that when he came back he'd have a bigger base to recruit from. So he wrote the messages to encourage Slytherins to band together when other houses turned on them.

It's worse than that. Surely Tom's /primary/ goal wasn't to kill muggleborn, but to get his body back. If he hadn't been terrorizing the school all year, then Ginny would have just quietly disappeared one day and Riddle would be alive again.

** Dumbledore knew Myrtle was the victim, he knew her ghost haunted that bathroom, and he knew Hagrid was innocent. And yet, he never bothered to ask Myrtle a single question, even if for the purpose of finding out what killed her and where the monster might come from. Perhaps he did, and he had known for a long time what the Monster was and where the CoS entrance was, but kept the secret for 'you-know-what' reasons.

*** Actually, I have yet to read a good explanation for this one.

Why is it (ignoring the fact that its a childrens book that needs the children to be the heros), that not one of the professors figured out that a basilisk is slithering through Hogwarts?

If anybody knows a fic that explains it, I'd love to read it.

**** I can't remember a fic with a good explanation, but none of the professors realising that it's a basilisk is somewhat more convincing if you take into account that they have less information than the reader. The only thing they really know is that /something/ has been petrifying students.

The chamber of secrets is widely believed to be just a legend, so there's no reason to assume that the cause has anything to do with Salazar Slytherin. If you're convinced that the chamber is just a legend, the message looks like someone trying to spread fear and cover their tracks.

Also, the teachers don't know that Harry (a known Parselmouth) has been hearing a voice. They might not know about Hagrid's roosters being killed or assign blame for that to a fox or something else from the Forest. They probably don't know that all the spiders were fleeing the castle, Harry and Ron only noticed after Hagrid told them. Hagrid was told by Aragog, but he might not have shared that information with anyone.

Dumbledore already knows that Hagrid is innocent (and he probably also knows that Hagrid's monster was an Acromantula), so he has no reason to think that "Follow the spiders!" would tell him anything new. Dumbledore is probably also pretty sure that Voldemort is not inside Hogwarts again, so while he cannot rule out his involvement, he doesn't know how the chamber has been opened. In canon, he's not overly fond of telling others about his hunches before he has to, so it's likely that he didn't share his suspicions that Voldemort is involved with the other teachers.

**** I know of none that do it without adding some serious AU elements. I wrote the Chamber arc so that the Basilisk was put under a Fidelius, which was why the teachers didn't recognise it. I'm pretty sure I've read a couple where it's said that there were too many creatures and spells that had the ability to petrify for the staff to narrow it down. Many other fics just prefer to straight up call the staff dumb.

Its easy to just condemn Dumbledore as this bad/stupid man. I'd be much more interested in a fic that would show why Dumbledore made those decisions with the best of the school in mind (even if it may include mistakes on his part out of ignorance or unknown risks).

*** It is only co-incidence that the place of Myrtle's death turned to be near the entrance of the chamber. There were students petrified in other places (Hermione was petrified near the library, for instance) that weren't near Myrtle's bathroom. Dumbledore would have questioned Myrtle as well as the other students petrified (and then cured) the first time the chamber was opened. There was no reason to believe the positioning of Myrtle's attack was more significant than the others.

**** Surely her story of how she died would be enough to at least give some suspicion of the basilisk. "I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away..." It might not give the location of the Chamber, but it seems enough to make a well-educated man like Dumbledore figure "eyes + sudden death = could be a basilisk".

The only thing I can see is Myrtle being too distraught when she first becomes a ghost, or too intent on her vengeance against Olive Hornby, for Dumbledore to properly interview her, and then by the time she calms down/is forced to leave Olive alone, he figures it's been so long there's no point. (But even then, I feel like he's the kind of guy who'd try to find out everything, even if it's several years after the fact.)

***** Yeah, but a basilisk wouldn't explain the non-fatal petrifications. It would, if someone could connect to the non-direct gaze, but I doubt that depth of research has ever been conducted on Basilisk, not when one hasn't been seen for 400 years. Plus, the very idea of a basilisk (which can grow upto 50 feet in length) staying at Hogwarts is counter-intuitive.

(btw, Dumbledore in canon seemed to think it was wizard imitating a monster and doing it, given that he identified the attack on Miss Norris as one of dark magic of the most advanced kind, which seems to be the most likely conclusion given the facts known to him. I'm not sure he ever gave much credence to the idea of a creature instead.)

** Duelling Club incident was staged by Draco/Snape/Dumbledore to intentionally out Harry as a parselmouth for reasons.

Lockhart uses potions/ enchantments on the pages of his books that induces all women to love him/ believe his stories.

Fawkes came because Dumbledore couldn't be bothered to do anything himself.

The sword now magically belongs to Harry, but Dumbledore takes it to keep Harry from his legacy as Godric's descendant, true hero, whatever.

Dumbledore influences Dobby away from bonding to Harry to keep Harry down.

One of the Masons was a squib who recognised Harry was being abused and rescued him. End up being related to the Bones.

Dobby wasn't actually treated that badly, he was just mentally ill.

The Basilisk is just lonely and so desperate for company she was easily controlled by Tom. After Harry asks for her name, she turns on Tom, and becomes totes besties with Harry and Hagrid. Lives in the forest.

Dumbledore told Mr and Mrs Weasley the boys misunderstood or made up the bit about the bars on the windows to stop them from making a fuss over Harry's home life.
