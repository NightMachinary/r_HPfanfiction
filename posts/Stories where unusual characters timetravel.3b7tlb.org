We've all read at least one timetravel fic where Harry saves the world with his previous knowledge, but what about other characters?

Sirius going back in time, Remus going back in time, Snape, Albus, Luna, Minerva, Background character no. 27, anyone!

The longer the story the better.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  In 1998, Severus Snape was given a second chance. In 1976, he has to figure out how to take it.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

#+begin_quote
  Last year, Dudley Dursley, formerly a father in his late thirties, woke up as an eleven year old wizard. After a year of panic attacks and near-death experiences, he'd been looking forward to a nice, calm summer followed by a nice, calm year at Hogwarts. Instead, he got a house elf stalking his cousin, a mysterious journal, a rumor about an eyeball, and a haunted toilet.
