Curious on your thoughts on how this is dealt with in the WW. Do trans people pull a Barty Crouch and drink polyjuice constantly? Are there spells you can try?

Somehow I've never seen this in a fanfic. I've seen gender-swapped, but never any actual trans characters. I'm sure it's out there, though.

** There are some fics out there with trans characters and they're a bit meh. Usually just the standard coming out/coming-to-terms fic with some magic pasted on top ... which is super boring to me since I don't really think that wizards wound be all that concerned by it, and therefore wouldn't have the same issues that Muggles do with trans folk or transitioning.

** They could use Human Transfiguration to change their appearance. Its what Hermione does in DH to disguise Ron for the Gringotts break-in and its also what Grindelwald did in Fantastic Beasts to disguise himself as Percival Graves.

Transfiguration is a permanent change, contrary to what many believe. Its not temporary. It doesn't fade after a set amount of time and on a semi-related note, duplicating something inedible into food has no consequences. If you took some food and duplicated it, it would have all the same qualities as the original. It doesn't lose nutrition nor does it lose anything that the original food had. I figured I mention that, since Transfiguration as a whole has several major misconceptions in fanon. Ultimately this means that using Transfiguration to become the opposite sex would be permanent.

The fact that Hermione can do Human Transfiguration set the bar pretty low for how relatively easy it would be to do it, since it means anyone who took NEWT Transfiguration could do perfect Human Transfigurations (i.e. Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts) by the end of their sixth or seventh year, and Transfiguration would be a fairly common NEWT subject given its needed to be a healer, highly recommended to be an Auror, and is useful in general. So a trans person wouldn't need to even remotely comparable to Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald to permanently change themselves. At the very most they'd need to be NEWT-level in Transfiguration.

Also for a Metamorphmagus like Tonks, she could transform from female to male and back without much problem. Since she could change her entire body, then she could do all sorts of things. So if a Metamorphmagus was trans, they could change their body to match their gender identity. If they strongly identified as the other gender, then they could transform into that gender and they would pretty much stay in that form unless overwhelmed by depression/despair (i.e. Tonks at the start of HBP).

*TL;DR: Basically anyone who ever studied NEWT Transfiguration (i.e. well over a third of all wizards at a bare minimum if McGonagall's class in HBP is any indicator) could permanently change their sex if they wanted with Transfiguration. Any Metamorphmagus can change their sex even easier. In-universe, Transfiguration is more difficult than Charms (and arguably Potions) so most wizards would be shit out of luck if they wanted to change their sex themselves since they'd lack the skill to do it properly and safely.*

*** I dunno, I disagree a bit. I see transfiguring internal organs as being a bit different from transfiguring externals. Grindalwald was a very talented wizard, on Dumbledore's level, and Hermione is a very gifted witch. So yes, a talented NEWT student could probably give themselves a penis or shrink it....but I'd be concerned about the medical viability of it. Hormones? Transfiguration won't help with that.

I suspect the body would not be able to cope with a sudden transition. Hormonal treatment would possibly have to happen over a period of time. Is there a gender reversing spell? Who knows. Up to an author. I don't believe so....not one that leaves you still fully functional and fertile. Perhaps a potion. Perhaps a combo. But I can't see an instant, complete transition as being healthy.

  We got into a pretty interesting discussion on the nature of magic and whether magic can detect your inner feelings or merely detects your physical form.
#+end_quote

Well, I would say that the answer is probably “kind of but not exactly”. I mean, I'm pretty sure it's impossible for anything to make a full scan, so I doubt it has anything to do with one's soul, but at the same time we have stuff like the (unique, but still) Mirror of Erised, which without any issue scans people and not only sees a whole aspect of themselves but also gives a response to it, or Boggarts which are living creatures that can do the same but with a different aspect. And, as easy as it is to assume that the spell/enchantment was cast/done with just the genitals in mind, I'm sure even in those times there was awareness of the fact that a man who has his penis cut off is still a man, and we know changing one's anatomy with human transfiguration is not quite that hard so it would be a well-known issue, as such I think the spell had to be in some way based on both so that a man without a penis, a man who still feels that he is a man, not in the vague “well, I guess I may be a man” way but more “I know I am a man, and I live my life as one”, would still make the stairs change into a slide, you could say that they have an innate awareness of being a man that affects the enchantment. Following that train of thought, I feel that if you had a trans girl who was questioning herself the stairs would change into a slide under her, but once she accepted that she is a girl and decided that she will live as one and others be damned the stairs would let her go up because she'd have that innate awareness of being a girl, it would be a part of her identity rather than something she is just thinking about or feeling in secret.

And you could actually take the other two enchantments that we know of that had restrictions to support this train of thoughts. The age line that Dumbledore set up could have rejected the twins because despite maturing their bodies they did not have an innate awareness of being that age, they knew it was fake. Likewise, for all that Harry thought himself capable, a lot of stuff revolved around him not being a fully-fledged adult wizard and him being painfully aware of that fact, so at the time of their trip he would have an innate awareness of not being of age, of being in some way worse than an adult wizard because of it.

**** Thanks for the thorough response; that was really good. In that thread I mentioned, one person remarked (quote marks mine):

#+begin_quote
  I don't think the spell would care about your feelings. If you're a "girl", you can get up the stairs; if you're a "boy" you can't. I doubt whether you actually feel like a boy or a girl has anything to do with it. It reminds me of the spell on the boat in HBP. Dumbledore said that the boat could only have one wizard in it, but the spell didn't recognize Harry as a wizard because he was underage.
#+end_quote

To which I responded:

#+begin_quote
  My thoughts too. Magic, in the HP universe, doesn't seem precise enough to actually detect people's innermost feelings. And the boat spell is actually a good comparison. We could also mention the age enchantment placed around the Goblet of Fire as another example.
#+end_quote

Although looking back on it now, I might revise that statement to say that it simply depends on the spell / creature. Some elements of magic tend to respond more to the body, and some more to the soul. Good point bringing up Boggarts and the Mirror of Erised.

Dementors might be worth considering as well: can they detect the "gender" of the person they are feeding on, or can they only detect the positive / negative energy of that person's lifeforce? We know they were under specific instructions to capture Sirius Black in PoA, but would they actually have been capable of telling him apart from any other wizard (or witch)? Was Fudge really just telling them: "Find whoever you can sense; just make my PR problem go away"?

***** Well, Dementors clearly can communicate (in a way that does not involved eating the other party's soul, that is), which implies that they have a way of identifying the person they are interacting with. It cannot be based on someone's fear, because those can change and on a certain level they aren't really unique, nor can it be based on someone's memories because those too do change. Personally, I think they see a person's ... thought energy, if you could call it that, think a brain scan, a pattern unique to every mind, the closest thing to a soul that is not it (also, probably what you meant with “lifeforce”). Now, we do know that people of different genders do tend to have different patterns when it comes to how their brains work, that's part of our sexual dimorphism, but with Dementors being creatures that do not show any sexual dimorphism nor any sexuality I do not think they are capable of linking the occurrence of specific patterns to one being of one gender or the other.

As for the Fudge bit, I think the Dementors were capable of recognising Black but Fudge still meant just that.

******* *Qi*

In traditional Chinese culture, qi or ch'i ( qì) is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living thing. Qi translates literally as "breath", "air", or "gas", and figuratively as "material energy", "life force", or "energy flow". Qi is the central underlying principle in Chinese traditional medicine and in Chinese martial arts. The practice of cultivating and balancing qi is called qigong.

*** I think considering souls and the actual afterlife are real things in the harry potter universe, they would go off your maybe your soul's gender and not your physical sex, so it would not even be a problem. Also there are so many options with magic for changing your physical sex that that would be no problem either. Like metamorphagus and potions and transfiguration, which in canon is permanent and has no bad effects, unlike fanon always seems to write. Maybe because they hate a world without limits?

Anyway, in my magical world stories I make the magical societies decades ahead of the nonmagical ones in terms of things like sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender roles, and even nudity. Because yes at least SOMETHING has to be good about it besides the terrorists and the horribly corrupt Ministry that JK Rowling wrote in canon!!! :( I do not like a grim dark corrupt evil world with nothing good in it. So yes I give them progressiveness on these issues.
