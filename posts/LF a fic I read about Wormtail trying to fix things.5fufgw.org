The fic features wormtail using (I think) bits of lily and James and himself to go back in time and fix things. I have tried Google and I can't find it. Help?


** I think you might mean "Old School", Chapter 108 in linkffn(Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot). Peter does the back in time thing, but he actually sends James.

  Odd little one shots that may or may not be turned into their own stories.

*** That is very similar but the one I'm remembering includes the ritual he uses to send them back and some of his motivation.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...
