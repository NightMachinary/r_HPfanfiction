Really anything to do with Lovecraftian demons or Arkham or Innsmouth. Only, you know, with Harry Potter


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod][Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod]] is a pretty bloody good Lovecraftian thing even if it is depressingly short. Can't say I can remember anything else off the top of my head.

Bonus points for Harry/Padma.

*** It could have been at least twice as long but I enjoyed the concise nature of it in contrast to a LOT of fanfiction, which ends up dragging and feeling bloated.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]] (Ch13 of Adventures in Child Care and Other One Shots by Perspicacity) was really good.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hallowed]] seems to mix Lovecraftian themes with the Hallows story, and it's supremely well written.

Sadly, the author also seems to have abandoned it 11 chapters in, but what's there is good.

** Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool integrates some of it.
