As stated in the title, Vernon doesn't hate Harry. He sees him as something of a burden on the family at first, but given how much Vernon seems to care for Dudley, Petunia and even Marge, his convictions about family supercede his seeing harry as a drain on his resources. But if he's going to raise Harry, you can be damn sure he isn't going to waste his time.

And so, instead of hearing that he's worthless from day one, Harry is told that he needs to make something of himself from the very beginning. Certainly not the healthiest outlook on life for a child to have, but it leads to a close bond between Harry and Vernon.

While Dudley is inhaling all the sweets this side of the english channel, Harry is having the rewards of hard earned labor instilled into him. While Dudley is breaking toys, Vernon is teaching Harry to work with his hands making things via carpentry. While Dudley is busily inflating to Whale-hood, Harry is being indoctrinated in the importance of physical fitness. While Dudley is busily frying insects with a magnifying glass, Harry is studying elementary level human anatomy and first aid. While Dudley is gallavanting with his friends, Vernon is telling Harry the truth about how his parents died, and teaching him the importance of duty, order, justice, and of not letting evil go unanswered.

By the time Harry gets his Hogwarts letter, he is driven, focused, determined, and as skilled in exercise, sport and academics as an eleven year old can be. Instilled to the point of indoctrination with the values of hard work, self reliance, order, and Vernons own desire to see anyone who would threaten the established order of the world utterly annihilated.

Yes. If Vernon Dursley is going to raise a wizard, a wizard who isnt even his, he is certainly not going to waste his time...


** If Vernon isn't going to be antagonist to Harry I doubt they would treat Dudley the same as in canon, that was a form of abuse too. Not to say that Dudley wouldn't still be spoiled, it just wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as canon.

** Proud has a widower Vernon who takes care of Harry out of duty. While he still favors Dudley, he tries not to show it and Vernon genuinely wishes to do the best by Harry, if only to honor Petunia.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.

** I like the general idea but most of those qualities aren't qualities of Vernon so I don't see the idea of Venon teaching Harry these things. However it could be interesting if Venon and Petunia treated Harry more like they did Dudley but with Dudley still being the golden child. Then Harry ends up driven because he is trying to earn his aunt and uncles approval and love (trying to "beat" Dudley at every so he can the kind of affection Dudley gets).

*** This fic kinda has that plot, but in reverse. Harry tries to be as "normal" as possible so his family likes him, becoming manipulative in the process - linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal]])

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

Aside from not being trained by Vernon, Harry in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) are all these things except being skilled in sport, unless you count calisthenics as one.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
