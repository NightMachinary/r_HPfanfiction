on another note, my own recommendations are

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4724522][Lokison]]

both of which got me totally hooked on loki being harry's dad

i also love the idea of either being protective of the other oof something about these two just makes me happy at seeing them interacting in whatever capacity

lmk if i did smth wrong with this post oof thanksss

(have a nice day yall and please stay healthy)


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17926664/chapters/42330374][On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads]] is in the same vain as the ones you mentioned, Loki is Harry's dad. A bit mean towards some of the Harry Potter cast, as in this Dumbledore deliberately lied to Loki and said the boy was dead in order to keep to the prophecy, but it's a good fic.

** linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis by Enigmaris) - a girl!Harry with no provable muggle skills takes up the job of maid to the Avengers. Loki has in-story reasons to favor wizardkind, and it's also quite Loki-apologist, but if you can swallow that, it's rather fun. Still updating.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

** *Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe* linkffn(13326497)

Harry is dumped into the MCU. Pre-Avengers movie. After the Battle for New York, Harry gets friendly with Asgard (him being immortal because of the Master of Death thing is helpful here), he ends up fixing the relationship of Loki with his family. Ends up in a brother relationship with him. They have a prank war going on.

Harry isn't super OP at the start (it builds up), and he does change events considerably.

** Here are a few that haven't been mentioned yet. Most of them are "Harry is descended from Loki," rather than "Harry and Loki are buddies/antagonists."

linkffn(Deus Ex Machina by The Plot Bunny Whisperer). Crack one-shot, but personally, I didn't find it that amusing.

linkffn(Green Eyes and Red Hair by fringeperson). James Potter was a "bound" Loki. I don't remember how much interaction "Harry" has with him.

linkffn(9931052; 10379729). Two by savya398. In both of them, an amnesiac/bound Loki was Lily Evans. In both of them, Loki looks up Harry.

linkffn(Finding Family by Nemainofthewater). Harry is Loki's son. I don't remember how much interaction they have; it's a crossover with Thor rather than Avengers.

linkffn(Loki's Family by darkoraclegirl). Harry is Loki's grandson through Lily.

linkffn(The Unknown by LostGirlInTheForest). Dahlia Potter is Loki's daughter.

linkffn(A Fallen God by Hostiel). I think it's a good story, but I didn't care for it. Loki ends up in Harry's scar.

linkffn(Potter? Black? Lokison? by fringe person). Crossover with Thor. I haven't read this one yet, so I can't say anything about it.

linkffn(7009094). I haven't read this one yet, either.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** linkao3(11244792). Harry finds a very large family. Even beyond all the wives.

I'll second On Punching Gods. It's good, if occasionally a bit saccharine. Unfortunately the author has implied it's going to end in Drarry. It hasn't become overt yet though.

  Newly emancipated 15 year old Harry Potter decides to get out of Britain for the summer and head to Vegas for his vacation, bringing along Tonks and Remus to keep him out of trouble and things he shouldn't be doing. Two days later Harry wakes up in a hotel room in bed with Tonks and a mystery woman, another mystery woman in the bathroom, Remus is missing, and next to no memory about what happened during the last two days. Want to know the whole story? Join Harry on this crazy ride to learn just what happened to Harry during those two days and what happens as a result of it all.
