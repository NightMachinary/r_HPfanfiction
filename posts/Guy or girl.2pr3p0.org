Very popular for some reason.

Aaaaand there's why.

You making an infograph or something OP? I would think this subreddit contains a fair amount of guys for a fanfiction reader base since most fic recs here have Harry as the main character.

That depends. Do you read them for the smut--which would suggest you're into lesbian porn--or do you read them for the story? Maybe you're just trying to experience/understand the world from a female perspective.

**** Both honestly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and it's sequel (which is ongoing!) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]] really got me into the idea!

*** Not so much into any kind of slash, but you're certainly not alone in being a guy and liking fem!Harry (hell, I'm writing such a fic as we speak). I've actually always preferred female protagonists, no idea why.

** I'm probably the only one who cares about this, but being new to the sub I have a question:

Should this be 'Discussion' as we're discussing our demographics?

Or 'Meta' as we're talking about ourselves and not the fics?

Also, I'd like to second [[/u/wordhammer]] 's answer of Yes, but I concede that rewriting the question to preclude this particular bit of snark is more difficult than it would appear at first glance.

*** I probably wouldn't have been snarky, but that the question had no context- why ask? What difference would it make to the OP? Are the people who say they're girls going to get a deluge of 'hurr durr yoo iz pretty' messages?

Wouldn't it be more interesting to ask a more complicated question like 'As a person identifying yourself as a gender, do you prefer stories centered on a character with similar gender or a different gender?'
