** It's horrible! Now I can't get this out of my head. This could end in tragedy for the people of Magical Britain. (This could be a very interesting idea for a fanfic about the relationships between terrible characters)

** I know this isn't strictly canonical, but I always read her as being probably blood-purist sympathetic.

In what world would she ever go for a squib?

***** Mmm, don't forget Filch is into the punishment as well, I see them both doming Fudge. Maybe getting whipped and chained by a squib is part of his humiliation kink?

** No no no, It's the love triangle between Filch, Umbridge and Madam Pince. I'm pretty sure there was a rumor about them having an affair in the books. In fact, in Dumbledore's funeral(? Somewhere after his death though) Harry notes that they are standing together.
