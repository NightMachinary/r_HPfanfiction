:END:
Lily and James fake Harry's death. They figure Death Eaters will just chase them down if they run, so they fake his death and stick him in a French orphanage thinking the war won't last that long...but it does. One of the few "Lily and James" abandon their kid fic that doesn't come off as making them comically evil even if you disagree with their actions. Harry goes to Beauxbatons as a muggleborn and its is impacted by Voldemort's reign---things are a lot worse---and the school closes and Harry has to drop out and ends up working as a bartender, does drugs, etc. Basically, a 18 year old party animal. For some reason, Sirius and James go looking for Harry and then all hell breaks lose. It's like 1-3 chapters long?


** They certainly hated Harry, or else they wouldn't leave him at a french orphanage.

*** Yeah, only a monster would give his child a taste of paradise before dragging him back to hell. He probably did drug to try to remember the warm of the sun on his face, or the taste of the food they served him there.

**** Lol, if its another island, why not go directly to asia. And all honesty it wont make sense running it just to the next island. And an orphanage for Pete's sake. Why not with another friend and pretend the parents are out of country. They didnt even think of it in canon so why?

***** Well for maybe they are unsure of which friend to trust hence the fuck up with the secret keeper biz. So the best possible thing would be to stick him with a friend in another country. But who would they know outside of the UK? Would they even be able to safely transport him outside for that matter?

****** Lol, putting him in an orphanage would just make him more vulnerable and you just contradicted your own comment. If they dont know anyone outside so why'd they put him there? What guarantees he wont be abused or killed on another reason? Or run away in his own accord and get killed in the process. If you're telling me theyll be sending someone to guard him in there, why not send someone to be his guardian and just grow up decently in another country? Lol

******* How did I contradict the orphanage comment. Aside from the difficulties of transport. If they are gonna go through that much trouble what's to stop them from putting a few charms and compulsions to aid their son's survival? And still you're not addressing what friend will they fully trust. From that stand point charming the staff of a normal orphanage would be more safe. It'd be anonymous.

******** Youre contradicting on the time you said howd they know someone there. Do they need someone to be already living there? Ofcourse not and how will they send harry there without someone bringing him there. now your telling me theyd charm the staff for it isnt even legal from magical ministry point. Same time French ministry will be mostly alarmed with magical charms placed in their country and will alert them for sure.

********* That's a lot of assumptions. Why would you care if something is legal when you're trying for survival in a time of war? And if the French ministry does do an investigation. What are they gonna do about it? Send a boy back to a war torn country? Try to locate his parents who may or may not be alive by then? And when I said who would they trust I mean who would they trust to take him in? I thought you meant a friend already in the UK that will take him to another country. You need to clarify more as do I. I never said they'd know someone already there.

********** Lol, im just saying implications. Im clearly just asking but you decide to be sarcastic with me so hence im dropping you decent details you're clearly missing.

If they will be alerted, more so theyd be assigning anyone to guard the boy same time if they find it dangerous, more so theyd send him back surely. I think you dont know how politics work not to think to this extent.

Why france, not same country? Given they have more people to secure him in the same country and same time French ministry will highly be alerted with this actions. Either theyll help hiding him or will send him back. They wont even be able to bring Harry in france without notifiying its ministry unless ofcourse illegal ways which i highly doubt they will do or can do. Same time you mention how'd they transport, so back to you how should they transport him to france then?

Same case if theyd be able to send him to another country with some help, and if French ministry will help, its safer farther so why not somewhere farther? Japan has a decent magical school and is decently far he could get schooled there with help fron their ministry.

Case with him in an orphanage. How safe will he be? He gets charmed sure but what guarantees he wont overcomplicate things running away from orphanage. I think you can search enough that there is a high number of children who runaway from orphanages, gets abused in and after adoption.

And for asking why i care, i write few short stories in publication (although in another language) and a few fanfiction and do research before writing hence my question. But seems like you dont do much critical thinking. Lol

*********** I wasn't being sarcastic. I'm was actually curious how we would go around these things. And in the implication that they do charm the staff. What's to say they don't charm their own child to stay at the orphanage. Even yet place a protection that prevents certain malice around him?

I was using France as an example never said we couldn't pick any other nation.

And when you say send him back. Would another nation really risk sending their own to transport an orphan back to their country in the middle of a civil war? I would assume they wait it out. But then that begs to wonder what would happen with voldemort since harry is no longer there to rebound the curse. It pops up a long of questions. Where people just through in WBWL to at it. But in this case would Voldemort be the ruler or would it still be a draw between him a Dumbledore?

Some fics I've read had them already make a port key to another country before it got really bad. Even then, what's to stop them from discretely taking a ship or a plane? But then at that point. What's stopping them from staying in another country as refugees or saying that they are on an extended vacation?

I still don't know why you keep saying abuse or running away when I made it clear that they could use magic to stop that.

************ I think you should redefine your own understanding of sarcasm.

Also saying he'd be sent back, first how do they send him first. Portkeys distanced in separate countries are clearly illegal but incase theyd be sending someone there with him to bring him. Next, muggle transpo, they'll need t be changing their names to travel and ofcourse with someone to bring him there, but who? If you've watched fantastic beasts, you'd clearly know travelling even in muggle way will still notify the ministry. Same thing with why settle on orphanage if that person who'd sent him can stay with him? And if he gets figured out, you clearly dont understand that certain ministry would like their business from themselves and not involve another unless completely agreed by both ministries.

For magic, you should clearly remember harry running away on book 3. If the bus didnt show up, who knows where harry would have been. Same as charming, howd you expect a charm for him to be forever protected and what charm would that be? Even dumbledore didnt think of that even with him in the dursleys.

************* Well why can't we have a charm work for long lengths of time? We have Fidelis. The original blood protection harry had. The curse on the DADA position that lasted decades. You also keep confusing illegal with no ability to do. Death Eaters themselves can have portkeys even though they are supposed to be regulated. So really what's stopping them from making a portkey anywhere aside from legalities.

Dumbledore put a lot of stock in the Blood Wards being full proof. Maybe he thought if he added charms of his own it might interfere. Maybe he thought his own relatives would care for him like they should. Dumbledore didn't even bat an eye or ask Harry about life at home. So either he was very trusting of the Dursleys or he just cared that he was only alive and nothing else. This is the same man that thought it was better to fly a broom to a meeting instead of take the floo. The only real answer is JKR didn't think that far and this is a children's book.

I've never watch Fantastic Beasts. So as far as my own head canon is concerned it does not exist in this scenario.

************** Yes, portkeys are usable and illegal which i did explain that maybe another way but same time who will be bring him there? Which puts us into an explaining for the other details.

Fidelis isnt a protection charm. It is a concealment charm that no one will know the secret unless divulge by the keeper.

For that charm dumbledore did was just another enhancement charm ONLY to add to the already existing blood of bond. Also you are over powering that charm. The charm dumbledore used with the dursleys was only for additional protection on the blood of bond which already exists in the first place after petunia accepted harry into their home and only adds protection to the home. Not Harry, only the house. Harry wont be harmed by death eaters within those 4 walls as long as he treats it his home for 17 years. It prevents death eaters going to their doorstep but it doesnt precent him from non death eaters like magical creatures, other wizards or even muggles killers.

At the same time, blood of bond is an ancient magic which requires a sacrifice of life in which lilys had to be sacrificed for that to happen. In this case, someone who loves harry deeply has to die for it to even happen. Unless ofcourse him being given in france also requires lily or james to kill themselves for it to happen.

Dumbledore also knew how abusive that home will be, he only chose it for the bloodwards nothing else.

Pretty much you should watch fantastic beasts for additional knowledge. You are lacking quite the details there. Lol.

*************** Dude where does it say he put the Dursleys under Fidelis. We just establish that Dumbledore let it only to the blood wards and nothing else. I'm fully aware of what Lily's blood sacrifice does. I was using it as an example that we shouldn't be limiting the capabilities of magics. All those magics I had listed were examples of why we shouldn't be limiting it. I know Fidelis isn't a protection spell, never said it was. I was just point out that the charm could last for eons. So I ask again why wouldn't a protection charm last at least a few decades?

Back to the detail of who would transport him. We both established we don't know who would they trust. So since this is fanfiction we could say they could have a multitude of friends and or family in various parts of the world. The author then would have to establish why they are trusted with this role.

I had just said I don't consider Fantastic Beast canon. Why would I want those details like Nagini the snake woman? I'm sticking to books at the moment.

**************** Ahahahahah you should fix the way you commented then, its confusing. Same time as to why wouldnt a charm last long, there is but no such thing as forever protection charm. If it already exists, then they wouldnt have needed to put harry hiding in the first place.

Same thing if the author will put to bring harry to the orphanage, if such will ever exist, why put harry into an orphanage, not bring him and raise him decently while hiding.

Also if you dont wanna consider Fantastic beast canon, thats fine with me but even if the story is mutilating some facts, you can learn about cross ministry business and precautions for witch travel. Then you'd understand most of my point. XD

***************** You still haven't answer why magic protection wouldn't last that long. If you're so keen on details. Where does it say there's a limit on how long a protection spell could last. If any spell could last at least a few decades. I never even said it had to be forever.

And still just because I don't consider Fantastic Beast canon doesn't mean I'm missing a few details. It's in the same vein as people don't consider the Cursed Child canon. I enjoyed the books and the original movies. That's all the information I need for the stories I seek.

****************** Lol, i told you in the previous comments, you are overpowering protection charms. Certain other charms may be long, but its not fully to protect the person. Rarely the person. Now lets get back to your example, shall we? Blood wards doesnt protect harry, but home. Fidelis, secret, not harry but knowledge. Curse on the DADA, not person. For stronger charms, theyre usually shorter and abrupt, leaving the charmed in an after state after the spell is cast. Now if you are telling me such protection charm, will ever exist to protect harry prolly enough for a decade, then you should prolly look for another life to sacrifice for it. XD

******************** Ahahhahahah which point? I pretty much think yours is drowning than standing. I never sited charms or jinxes itself wouldnt last long, i cited that if there was such a protection charm that could possibly last long, dumbledore would have put it with harry or Lily and James would have put it with him in canon. Even bloodwards from bond of bond was limited.

As for my previous comment: " For magic, you should clearly remember harry running away on book 3. If the bus didnt show up, who knows where harry would have been. Same as charming, howd you expect a charm for him to be forever protected and what charm would that be? Even dumbledore didnt think of that even with him in the dursleys." If you are referring to this comment then you plainly assumed by yourself without fully understanding the context here.

Im saying it never was an option in canon so how'd it be in FF? Im stating facts here however you're fully ignoring all my discussions cos you think i said such. XD
