Most of us have read smut at some time or another. It's a fact of life that, even moreso than regular fanfic, smut is generally terrible.

But sometimes... sometimes you get that wonderful prose or amazing characterization or exquisite plot. Give us the stuff that (pleasantly) surprised you with its goodness!

To start us off:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6178][Venus & Adonis]]

Oliver Wood/Minerva McGonagall, 15k words.

The pairing is way, waayyy out there, but the prose is wonderfully descriptive, the smut develops slowly and it's such a bittersweet story.

Author warning (I lol'ed)

/Age disparity like whoa. Oliver is jailbait, and McGonagall is a total cougar. Includes sex! And boyishness! And excessively long paragraphs!/

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/142763][A Love Song Like the Way It's Meant to Be]]

Harry/Pansy, Rose/Scorpius, 29k words

This is the epitome of feel-good stories for me. There's little (real) conflict, but the characters are believable, the drama level is exactly right (not too angsty, not too light) and the development is just /sweet/, without becoming overbearing. Also contains my absolute favorite portrayal of Hugo ever. Ever, ever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5485394/1/A-Boy-and-His-Cloak][A Boy and his Cloak]]

Harry/Hermione, 10k words

This is pretty well known and for me, one of the very, very few believable Harry/Hermione stories. It just captures the situation perfectly: two long-time friends, discovering each other. There's humor, awkwardness, hesitance and tenderness. Just the best example of teenage intimacy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10938984/1/Heterochromic][Heterochromic]], linkffn(10938984), is my favorite in this category.

** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels). Kind of smutty (in the beginning at least) marriage law fic with some strange concepts. Has one of the best characterization of Snape I have read though, that's just very raw and realistic for him. Its quite interesting to see him portrayed in a romance fic that does not ignore his serious flaws and his struggle to connect to people. Where he is not a sex god in bed, where he is not all of a sudden nice and caring and romantic and where he can not get past his issues or his past easily. Really explores his character well here. Has great characterizations of everyone else as well.

It has quite a bit of dub con smut and unheathly relationship and Snape not being a nice person (although he isn't evil or anything like that either) so I would stay away if you don't want to read that. It really does have some really great writing and a really well thought out plot line that slowly makes sense of a completely weird plot line and events in a very logical way. Somewhere in the middle the fic just becomes an enjoyable AU fic with humour, worldbuilding, characters and action scenes that are quite good.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

*** Oh, god, the Snape in this is just /too much/. I'd like to say I hate him, because he's categorically awful to Hermione from Day 1, but on the other hand between his issues and her issues, neither of them are exactly in a place to make the whole situation easier on each other.

Personally I prefer a Snape that's more like Teddyradiator's linkao3(Lay me Low by Teddyradiator) who is so explosively emotional, but this Snape is also an excellent version of the character. Ironically, I initially stopped reading LmL because the Snape was too emotionally open for me, but when I did eventually read the whole thing I ended up completely converted to emotionally vulnerable Snape.

Still, Intended Vessels' Snape, much as I don't actually /like/ him, is a completely plausible version of the character (except for the choking scene, which is just...no.)

I'm not sure if I agree with you wrt Intended Vessels being smutty though. I mean this is just personal opinion but I do believe that for something to qualify as smutty /someone/ has to at least be enjoying it...

  An AU story of what might have happened, beginning mid-way through The Order Of The Phoenix. Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione raises questions about his own feelings towards her. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust.

It was recommended to me by someone on the forum, and I read it mostly out of having nothing better to do. Annnnd now I'm impatiently waiting for updates.
