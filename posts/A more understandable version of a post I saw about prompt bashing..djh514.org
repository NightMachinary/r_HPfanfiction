** Is it bashing to suggest OP's make an attempt to write their own prompts, if no one has responded? We have had problems with users reposting the same prompts again and again, because there wasn't anyone interested in it, except for the OP.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bvjj88/prompt_a_horcrux_accidentally_got_most_of/epppuax/][And example is one prompt that was reposted three times]]. For some reason, people were outraged at the idea of the OP writing their own plot bunnies. I don't understand why, because the entire situation of asking for unpaid volunteers to write your story idea is basically [[/r/choosingbeggars][r/choosingbeggars]] with extra steps.

*** I think it comes down to delivery. "Stop posting this again and again and do it yourself" is rude, "Have you tried writing it yourself?" is an invitation to open a dialogue with the OP.

**** That's what I posted in the thread, and got downvoted for it. üòè

** Let's be honest: no prompt thread has ever resulted in a person going away and writing a fic. They are in effect discussion threads under a different name. At best someone might write some very short drabble which is little more than a discussion post in narrative rather than analytical prose.

The only reason why prompt threads have any value to the community is because they sometimes generate interesting discussion. If we get rid of that, we might as well get rid of prompt threads altogether.

** You know what /I/ do when I see a prompt I don't like? I move on. I don't reply to it, I might not read it all, or I might not even open it to begin with. I just say "Not for me" and go to the next one.

Also, on two of the "reasons" you gave...

#+begin_quote
  They are unrealistic
#+end_quote

Not really a problem for a good writer. A good enough writer can take /any/ prompt, no matter how silly or "unrealistic", and make it work.

#+begin_quote
  wizards aren't stupid
#+end_quote

Depends on what metric we're using to define "stupid".

**** Exactly. If you're going to come in and comment about a prompt, or at all really, than you should make sure that what you say is worth reading.

** I haven't seen any bashing so far but that might be due to ne next t clicking on eg super unrealistic prompts. I do however sometimes comment if there is a problem with the basis of the prompt - eg ‚Äúinstead of x the mc does y‚Äù and I'm like ‚Äúbut no one in canon did x‚Äù

I think some people use the prompt flair incorrectly and they actually have a request and not a prompt. A prompt should spark something inside of you. It should be an interesting premise and open for interpretation. If it is like in the example someone else here gave (the person posting a prompt several time) - it's too specific. ‚ÄúWhat if one of Voldemort's Horcruxes developed a life of its own‚Äù it would be a nice prompt and I have plenty of ideas on how to realize it. But then saying ‚Äúhe has a dark lordship and is barman Tom‚Äù is like the whole story already and someone just wants someone else to write exactly their idea.

Other than that, I agree that a good writer can make the most unrealistic prompts work. They are written so well you start to wonder why the weird crack idea wasn't canon as it makes so much sense.

** Mods, in case you're reading this a day later and are thinking of taking action.

For what it's worth I strongly disagree with this idea, as I do more generally with rule 9. But particularly the spreading of this idea of /only/ non-contradictory digitzed thought being acceptable.

The examples of "bashing" do not fit any definition of bashing that I would agree to (particularly of a personal kind). Traditionally the inverse, if anything, would be bashing. ie. "Wizards(/Muggles/Weasleys) /are/ stupid"

What if I post as part of the prompt "Hermione is stupid" or 'Harry devours the Dursleys in a cannibalistic magical ritual' Is it bashing to say "Hermione isn't stupid"? That she got Outstanding grades? or that "[Harry] would never do that"? Can you even be sure if I'm dead serious or if this is crack (I've read things that come close), and thus what is an appropriate response? You can call them at a stroke unwanted, complaining, and unhelpful, but they should NOT be against the rules.

A public post should expect and accept comments, and there can be nothing so mild as cannot be opined on or disagreed about (or, it seems, labelled as bashing). I agree with taure that discussion, albeit taken different form, is the name of the game even in 'prompt' threads.

Basically if the rule spreads then you will have little sandboxes where only those willing to play to the dictates of a given poster are allowed. Children need to learn to play together, I don't think it is asking too much for adults (or teens) to either.

To take it further, what is the purpose of a Prompt? Is it an open post to the community at large to engage with an idea, or a form to be filled by card carrying members of a particular club?

/Good/ prompt threads to me seem to be an amusing idea/plot bunny that is there to be shared, and the best would include their own, be reciprocated, and have feedback and discussion.

But there is a bad. Its selfish, revealed in the desire not to share, discuss, and amuse one another but to have done what I am unwilling to do, to fulfill my desires, in the way I want, without (counter or even somewhat differing) opinion or discussion.

A spirit of understanding is required on all sides. To take the 'Harry devours the Dursleys in a cannibalisitc magical ritual' example, to respond with a 'Eww' 'nope' or "[Harry] would never do that" is natural and should be expected. So should a response of 'I know, but go with me'.

But what if someone responds with 'thats absolutely disgusting, what's wrong with you'? They may have a strong sensory imagination and found to be reasonable when further engaged. Or, they may very well be a bad actor, in either case I trust the common community to recognize it as they do insightful, humurous, malicious, and pointless comments, and (down)vote or (dis)agree in turn.

As in life there are unwanted, unhelpful, and hurtful comments. I don't think we have an excess of the latter, and they should not be misconstrued with the former. Please allow discussion by allowing for judgement (generally first and foremost by the community) to naturally occur on a comment by comment and thread by thread basis. Thank you.
