It turns out that placing on highly magical artifact inside of an ancient, more mysterious artifact was a bad idea. A very bad idea!

The Mirror, fueled by the magic in the Stone, begins to bring the desires of those seen by it, albeit in a warped form, to life. Worse still, it somehow keeps moving around by itself, much like a Weeping Angel, no matter how hard Dumbledore tries to stop it, allowing new victims to peer into it.

Harry's parents? The Lily and James are the idealized version of his parents in his head: unfortunately, they're also twisted revenants based on a naive 11 year old orphan's viewpoint.

Ron's view of a more successful him? The doppelganger tries to take his place in his life as the "better Ron" and tries to murder him. It's justification? "I'm the better son than you. I'll make our parents proud."

Dumbledore? Ariana, returned to life healthy and whole... except she intentionally or unintentionally undermines him, psychologically tortures him, et cetera.

Cho, after Cedric dies? Cedric returned, healthy and whole... but it's the Cedric she had in her mind's eye with a possessive/jealous twist to his character that begins to frighten her/abuse her... and in the corner of her eye? That she can never focus on? She guiltily sees a dead Harry in Cedric's place. Or, she feels torn by having "Harry" and "Cedric" competing for her attention.

Luna? Friends. Lots of friends... that never leave her alone. Ever. She's constantly badgered, cannot do schoolwork without their interrupting, sees the bullies that torment her get seriously hurt (and which is blamed on her) by their provocativeness, and she's can't indulge in her hobbies because they keep harassing her. It's slowly wearing her down.

Snape? Lily Snape. Except that this sickeningly perfect caricature of Harry's mother/of who she was when they were still friends is too perfect that a permanent uncanny valley effect sets in, and he begins resenting her.

Voldemort? Eternal life. Except Eternal Voldemort is eternally suffering in some way, every time he sees him. Alone at the end of the world, in constant burning agony due to the sun expanding? Loneliness causing him to snap? Every possible depiction of Regretful Immortality haunting him.


** Dumbledore? His wool socks have holes in them.

** This is so unsettling. I wonder how they'll be able to stop the mirror? I bet trying to smash it would curse you and your family for at least 1000 years. Not to mention, tracking it down would be a pain. Would everyone have to work together to try and hunt it down, or would they have to fight each other, while trying to track down the mirror? I wonder if some of the people would be against stopping the mirror, because that means that their deepest desire would be gone? Would Harry still want his parents? This is such a fantastic idea.

** Hermione? House-Elves are free. Unfortunately, they are still compelled to help---the way Dobby helped Harry in GoF; and they get very angry when snubbed. Wizards huddle like survivors of a zombie movie, having to sleep in shifts to guard against the teleporting imps.

*** Well according to Rowling, Hermione's Mirror of Erised vision would be her and the boys happy and unscathed with Voldemort defeated as well her being "closely entwined" with Ron so I wonder how that'd get twisted

***** Hermione politely but firmly rejects her Ron in favour of the real one.

Erised!Ron keeps the same big loving smile he always has for her but his eyes go bloodshot and tears run down his face as he tells her (in a totally calm tone) that she'll change her mind, eventually......

*** "That's impossible! I destroyed you!" Dumbledore blindly groped for the toilet paper, unable to look away from the Mirror that had somehow appeared between blinks, unscathed from the inferno it had been bathed in an hour before.

** Neville's parents are cured and fully functional, and they love him. Only, their outlook is quite similar to Augusta Longbottom's and Uncle Algie and everyone else, and they love their son and are terribly disappointed in him, and want him to man up. Cue Frank constantly deriding Neville's ability and talent with Herbology and plants, and Alice agreeing with Augusta that Charms is a "soft-option" (HBP, I think). Frank buying Neville a new wand, but only because he doesn't think that his son is good enough to wield the wand he wielded. Alice being unhappy with Neville's lack of confidence, and deciding that it is a personality trait which she finds unappealing in her son.

*** Additionally, for Luna, it is her mother saved from the accident that killed her and that her parents and Luna are happy together. But in reality, her mother had cast some last minute magic that protected the rest of the house, knowing she would die. So now Luna's mother is alive, but Xenophilius and Luna are dead, and because they have to be together, the father and daughter are ghosts and her mother is unhappy about being dragged back to the living.

*** *Mirror Mirror*

The Mirror of Erised is quite a cursed object.

Harry unfortunately finds it in fifth year using the room of requirement.

Everyone gets to see the thing they desire the most.

That is a truly hellish thing.

Sweet young Luna Lovegood goes and looks, and comes out looking even more out of it than usual.

“Oh” she said, “I find I have somewhere I need to go.”

Filch interrupted dinner to tell the headmaster something.

Luna Lovegood, it transpired had taken a swan-dive off the astronomy tower.
