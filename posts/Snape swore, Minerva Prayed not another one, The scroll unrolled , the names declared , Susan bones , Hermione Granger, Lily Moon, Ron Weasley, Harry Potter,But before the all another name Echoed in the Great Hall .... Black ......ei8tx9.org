A Black walked the halls again

I am looking for fanfiction where Sirius or Regulus had a son or daughter that went to Hogwarts with Harry Potter.


** Why are their names being declared ? And why is some rando mentioned less than Daphne included ?

*** Lily Moon is a canon character mentioned (once) during Harry's sorting.

**** Daphne is a rando too, tbh.

Also, given the names are alphabetical, a Black comes before everyone else there, including Susan.
