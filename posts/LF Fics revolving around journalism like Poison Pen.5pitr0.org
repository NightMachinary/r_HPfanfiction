  Draco Malfoy was still slightly amazed that he was standing on the doorstep of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. He never would have thought that Harry Potter's very public and very ... sweary, emotional explosion would have led to him offering Draco, of all people, a job.

  "Potterwatch was legitimized by its dedication to truth, capacity for serious discourse, and avoidance of reverse-propaganda. This separated it from other rebel media, such as the short-lived radio programme Up Voldemort's Arse which spent several months insisting that Harry Potter was raising an army of dragons in Romania." - Snackleholt, Bingsley. "In A Time of Great Need." Wixen Politics Weekly 24 May 2002. Print.

** I read one but can't remember the title. It involves Harry, Hermione and Ron as well as a reluctant Draco Malfoy. They're joined later by others like third and second years from other years and houses. I know that Neville, Ginny and possibly Luna also help. Draco writes an article about himself. It's Draco/Harry. Anyone recognizes it?

** [[http://curiouslyfic.livejournal.com/7884.html][Fear and Loathing at the Phoenix]] Totally cool Hunter S. Thompson homage. Harry writes a regular column for the Quibbler under the pseudonym Regulus Black and Luna makes him cover a convention celebrating the ten year anniversary of the battle of Hogwarts. Pretty funny and very well written. There is some Drarry but it's not really the focus of the story if I remember correctly.

linkffn(9910838) This one is just a one shot but still one of my favorites.
