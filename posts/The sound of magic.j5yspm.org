From the moment Harry enters some important place in the magical world (diagon alley, 9 3/4 platform, Hogwarts) the amazing harry potter music (Harry's Wondrous World probably) starts to play as if a background music and every magical being can hear it.

It is nice at first and everything else goes like canon, but after a few days of ininterrupted music at Hogwarts everyone is already very annoyed. They decide to go to Dumbledore for advice.

When they get in his office the headmaster listen to their story (while humming the song) and then startled open one of his cabinets where there is a distinct magical looking music mixer table and says something like "Sorry, I forgot I let those on. Would you like me to turn it of, or just turn the volume down?"
