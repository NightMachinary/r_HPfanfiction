** "Dresser" is fine. Alternatively, "dressing table".

Chest of drawers is slightly different - more blocky construction, just a tower of drawers, whereas a dressing table is all about providing a lot of surface area on top (usually with a mirror attached). A dressing table can have drawers underneath, but rarely all the way to the floor.

** 1. Dressing table
2. Looks like a semi-detached to me. Just 'house' is fine for referring this normally

** 1. That's a semi (semi-detached house). In cities and commuter towns it's not uncommon to find houses like these have been turned into flats, with one self-contained flat on each floor often sharing the front door or having a separate entrance at the back.

** 1. "Chest of drawers" to say an item is "on top of the drawers" is actually fine in my house... I don't think I'm mad atypical! A "dressing table" is a more specific piece of furniture that is associated with having a mirror on top and being for, like, jewellery, perfume and makeup and getting dressed up for something formal. Not for throwing on jeans and t shirt that you grabbed from your drawers.

2. What you have there is an end terrace. (I.e. there's a row of terraced houses - which are all connected to each other - and this one happens to be on the end so isn't connected on the one side). It's quite a traditional one as well, and the colour of the brickwork reminds me of little estates in Alnwick, Northumberland (though I guess it's not exclusive to the North).

Edit to add: I think it's really wonderful that you're obviously trying to create something authentic by using the right kind of language for the existing series. This kind of dedication really makes me happy!
