Other than Bill, Charlie, and Nymphadora, do we know anyone from that interlude between the Marauders era and Harry?


** This era is actually difficult to find now that I think about it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12624450/1/Fire-of-a-Weasley][Fire of a Weasley]] by Ajtheduck) Sounds pretty good so far. And more catered to your criteria.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11729812/1/Ares][Ares]] by persephonella) I've read this whole fic and definitely found it an interesting read. This is a very AU kind of story though. It's mainly centered around Percy. Also, it may seem like it's bashing some characters (which had almost made me stop reading the story all together), however as the plot move forward it becomes more insightful. I really don't know how to describe it, but you'll get angry at a lot of characters from the start. Then you'll start liking them.

I honestly can't recall anything else at the moment, but I'll try to find more anyways later.

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
