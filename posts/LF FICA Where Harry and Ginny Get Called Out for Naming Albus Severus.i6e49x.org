As well as Harry's friends calling him out for defending the Malfoy's. I would especially love it it Harry and Ginny's friends cut off ties to them.


** I actually prefer to think that [[https://wingedcorgi.tumblr.com/post/188173420546/a-man-of-his-word-on-twitter][this is canon]].

** Two of the Malfoys literally saved his life, and Albus and Severus, while major dickbags to Harry's interests, were /instrumental/ to the victory.

Also, this is your daily reminder that Dumbledore bashing is non-canon and makes you look like a petulant child.

*** While I agree with your opinion of Snape, I'm not even sure I would call Dumbledore a "major dickbags to Harrys interests".\\
I mean, he may have done some questionable things (especially the putting Harry with the Dursley), but each of his actions were made with Harry protections (or at least survival) in mind.\\
Technically, without the Dursleys, Harry would have been killed by Quirell at the end of Ps, and even his long ass plot during DH was to give Harry his only chance to not die with the Scarecrux.

The guy does deserve to be honored, and nobody outside of Harry would have any reason to discuss this choice. Snape sound more like a political statement ("I tell you he was one of the good guy, see I even honored his name with my son").

**** I'd agree with you on Dumbledore, I mostly grouped him together because he exemplifies the philosophy "do what is right not what is easy". He proves he knew about Harry's "childhood" with the "ten long and dark years" quote, but as you said, it was necessary. It was the hard choice, but also the right choice.

I wouldn't go so far as say it was a political statement, just a honoring naming. Snape is a tragic figure, and based on all Harry knows once his first is born, naming the kid after him seems like a reasonable thing to do.

I still don't really agree with the whole thing though, I think children should have their own names to grow into instead of having the specter of someone else hanging over their heads - Harry should have given his kids normal names instead of those of dead people. I've always been partial to the names Martin, Samuel and Vera, with their second names being honorings, if anything. Giving your kid the same first name as your parents is really weird.

***** While I'm personally not a fan of it, I don't really have a problem with the way Harry named his children.

I think giving your children the name of dead people you want to honor is a personable choice. And it's not like it was an unacceptable name like Voldemort would be in the magical world, or even a socially questionable one like Tom would be. I mean, in the real world, you can name a child after your grandfather, but you can't call him "Hitler" (at least in Europe), and calling him Adolf would raise some question ("It stands for your German grandad, or that other guy?").

****** Still, kids should have their own names rather than be living memorials.

*** Because Snape is a child abuser and Harry naming his kid after Snape is like a slap in the face to those kids who were bullied by him.
