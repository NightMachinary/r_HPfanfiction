Share a "holy shit did that just happen" moment from a fic that you've come across. Can be anything, no real rules here. Try not to spoil a whole fic though. Probably helps if you remember the fic, but since I don't I won't hold it against you.

My HSM was: Lucius Malfoy murders Dobby. Pretty sure he snap AK'd him. I totally didn't see it coming, and I never came across it before. I was shocked. Then the author turned out to be George RR and mercd his way through half the people in the story. So it made sense later. ... ish.

(dis)Honorable mention - someone claims that Harry ate Hedwig in a fic. Which is just not okay. That's second hand/reddit info though. I ~DID~ read a fic where he had sex with Hedwig though. AS AN OWL. If that makes it any better.


** That fic where a Slytherin!Harry straight up murders Sirius in the shack, after learning of his innocence. Cuts his head right off for some convoluted deal to get revenge on Pettigrew. I stared at a wall for 5 minutes out of shock.

*** Remembered the fic in which 11yr old fem!Harry is led into creating a Horcrux..by murdering Snape. The scene goes something like this:

"You promised to protect me?", she whispers.

Snape nods tiredly.

/Proceeds to kill him with a knife to achieve immortality./

One of the darker scenes in the fandom. It isn't a crack fic or edgy Harry. She has to live with the experience. Linkffn(Devil Take Hindmost)

**** Is it good?

I mean, I like slythering!Harry and also fem!Harry, and dont mind the gritty stuff. But it's also a ship fic with Voldemort, and I suposse not even the young Tom from the diary, but the actual snake-face Voldy, and that's just another thing all together.

***** It's not Tom from the diary, it is Voldemort's consciousness in Harry but she grows up with him in her head and knows him as Tom. Even when he gets resurrected he's not snake-face Voldemort, he's still the same man who killed Harry's parents but in his old (human) body.

As for the quality, it is well written and Harry's character development is done really well. She's still sweet as a kid but as she gets older you can see the influence Tom has on her and her on him. Their relationship is really sweet especially when she's younger, after that, you begin to see the dark influence Tom has on Harry.

Only thing I don't like is I didn't realize the author was going for an eventual Harry/Tom pairing (I completely missed that in the summary?) and I thought it was kinda weird because I LOVED Harry and Toms relationship that I cant imagine anything romantic between them that's just weird he knew her and looked after her since she was a baby.

Good!Harry gets mistaken for him, gets put on trial at the ministry, with Narcissa showing up as his attorney. She turns to him and whispers something about waiting for Voldemort to get him out.

And then shit starts blowing up and a massive fire monster crashes through the wall. What happened? Voldemort got the Ministry's army of Heliopaths on his side.

** The 1st time I read a "James and Lily survived, abandoning Harry" story, I was stunned, although it was pretty mild.

There's one where no Weasleys survive, and most of them go out nastily (two change their names and survive); another where incest is common (Molly was born a Weasley; Prewitt is just their cover name) and Ron & Ginny are fated to be together. Family Magic; linkffn(13370792) for the first, can't remember the other.

And then there's Watch; linkffn(12743765). Nothing went how I expected.

Harry killing Bellatrix, struggling with that decision, and then coming across Pettigrew later on. My buttcheeks were clenched.

For the life of me I can't remember the fic or anything else that happened, but Voldemort had murdered a bunch of Slytherin students and arranged their heads on Hogwarts lawn. That imagery has stuck with me for years.

***** Edit: stream of conscious rants are rarely cohesive and almost never help anyone, they are cathartic though

​

i'm enjoying it so far but i'm getting real tired of all of the blatant sexuality. They are prepubescent children, the level of sex jokes they should be making should be more like laughing at the word dick rather than suavely teasing each other about sex. I mean honestly, "You know, if I were older it would be a real treat to have two girls on my bed. But i'm only twelve and I'm really tired." If he's only twelve, make him fucking act like it.

they introduce the story with harry overhearing Luna asking Ginny if she's had sex with him. There are some feasible reactions to that. Severe embarrassment and the like. Luna isn't feasible, though, they lobotomized her so they could have a character who's wiling to be sexualized at any given moment. She'll strip at anyone's behest, even when a man (in his thirties?) tells her to. She's 11, that's not okay. It's also not very well rationalized. She has no emotion, is psychopathic, why does that mean she has no will? I feel like people like that are more likely to reject other's suggestions, not less. I don't know, that's something I can't really speak on.

Just read a little further, apparently Luna's mental state means she's going to try to 'sexually imprint' on Harry and Ginny when she's 15/16. So glad that a child's trauma is being used to justify sex. I'm sure the expectation will be that Harry and Ginny oblige because 'sex is good.' I'm sure it'll probably happen in the next chapter while they're all still 11 or 12.

I want to force these people in front of a 12 y/o and show them how children actually are. Of course, these people might not be allowed to be that close to children, legally.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

I tried to take from a Slytherin what she was not willing to give. For this I deserve to die,” in his own blood, and then hang himself on the Astronomy Tower.

Definitely one of the darkest scenes in this fic, but it's stuck with me for years. The cold justice of it all.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Another one was how all three Dealthly Hallows subtlely influence their owners into lethal activities. The Invisibility Cloak makes the wielder more reckless and likely to head into dangerous situations when not fully prepared. That same fic also has an epic battle where Tonks fights Voldemort while holding her own. The Aurors in this fic are the super elite instead of just petty cops.

** I forgot what the fanfic was called, but it took OP!Harry and Manipulative!Dumbledore to the very extreme. Worst part is, it isn't even a crackfic.

Basically, Dumbledore's arm blew up, and the way he fixed it is by making Snape take his HORCRUX, kill him, then do some dark ritual to fix it. Bam, plot twist: Snape gets killed by pissed students so often that Dumbledore actually does that ritual TO SNAPE almost every two weeks. It might be in the same fic, but Bellatrix was for some reason listening to Harry pretending to be Voldy and polyjuiced as Filch. Then she killed Snape /again/ with an entrail expelling curse.

In the same fic, Harry, Hermione, and Luna somehow absorbed a shitload of fairy magic and needed a new fairy body with bullshit explanation.

That was one of the only fanfictions I've ever quit reading.

  Her father nodded as she began to understand. "Sending trains through the Lands Below was only one of the cruder uses to which it was put. The purpose of the Deathly Regiment is to power the machinery of the Confederation. To preserve the magic that sustains it. To keep it hidden, keep it running, keep it secret and safe. Wizard schools atop gates, in the middle of Muggle cities. Wizard rails running through mountains, across the continent."

*** I think the best part of all of this was the fact that the books had been building for years to this point. The big secret so many people know, but can't talk about, the reason for all the fighting, the discord, the casual murders, the jockeying for position, it's all been to protect the rotten secret propping up the entire society of the Magical Confederation. And then boom. Shown as pages in a book, completely justifying the civil war of the anti-hero father and validating the Sisyphean struggle of the protagonist to be free.

I want to say, this moment overshadowed several crazy ones in that last book.

1) Alex beating the life out of the dude in the school when he finds him torturing a student 2) Alex absorbing the power of the entire Unworking from the Ozarkers, gaining the power to fly, literally unwork a mountain, and then teleport into the middle of the Jubilee without thinking about it too hard...holy shit! 3) Killing the Jumplicute! 4) Stepping through the world away to jump prison, releasing two higher demons imprisoned there 5) Discovering the seven league step boots actually are correctly named

Honestly so much more. Alexandra Quick and the World Away was literally the best single entry fanfiction I have ever read and it was a serious pleasure to get there after the prior books had opened so many doors, asked so many questions, but never bothered to answer them until that book. 10/10.

For real, this book alone justifies reading all the previous ones. I have said to the author before: it's an actual tragedy that he is writing within an established universe, the world he constructs stands on its own so well.

I'm fairly certain what finally got me to read slash again was Teen Wolf and from there I decided to try a few Harry Potter slash fics and now I don't care if the pairing is slash or straight.

When I'm in the mood for some more graphic or touchy feely smut I tend to read slash because slash smut is very different than straight smut and most of the time it tends to be more well written or at least the well written slash smut out numbers the poor quality slash smut.

I'd discovered FFN by reading a fic on Wattpad that was crossposted and then figuring out what FFN was. I'm not fully sure when I discovered what AO3 was but I think it was when I first joined this subreddit. I actually started using AO3 sometime at the beginning of quarantine, back in March of 2020, when I finally figured out how to change the font size. I finally broke down and googled it. While I still don't use it as much as I do FFN I still use it from time to time when someone recommends me a fic on AO3. Back in either October or November of last year I finally started using the forum sites, Space Battles, Questionable Questing, and Sufficient Velocity because I got into Worm and they're where most of the Work fics are.

These days the main two fandoms I read slash for are HP and Teen Wolf, there's the odd one shot here and there for other fandoms but I don't count those too much. I'm not sure exactly how to describe the difference between straight and slash fics but it's definitely there. The main differences I can think of are in slash fics there's a bit more emphasis put on a dominant and submissive role unless you're dealing with a bdsm straight fic but those aren't too common and usually the characters in a slash fic are more possessive of each other but it could just be that the pairings I read have that.

I have a couple Remus/Harry but Remus always seemed more a father figure than Sirius to me so it's kinda weird for me. Also Supernatural (Sam/Gabriel and Dean/Castiel), Walking Dead (Daryl/Rick).

*********** With me I don't fully enjoy AO3 I just read fics that are recommended to me and check out the author if I enjoy their fic and read some of their other one's. My main HP slash pairings are Harry with either Voldemort, Tom Riddle, or Draco. I included Tom Riddle because to me Tom and Voldemort are 2 different people. I haven't read any Harry x Snape or Lucius fics recently to know how I feel about them. I don't see myself really liking either Harry x Sirius or Remus because to me they're both family to Harry and it's just not something I find appealing. With Teen Wolf I really enjoy Derek x Stiles and if it's an xover with HP I really like Harry x Derek or Harry x Peter.

My favorite slash author is likely Debstheslytherinsnapefan just because they have several HP x Teen Wolf xovers and they're well written. I don't read Supernatural or Walking Dead fics just because I don't know much about either show and while I want to watch them both I just don't have the time. I have still yet to read a fic from either of the fandoms as well even though usually I have no problems with reading fics without knowing about the fandom, that's how I got into the Naruto, MHA, Worm, and a few other fandoms that I don't recall exactly. I'm gonna have to take a look at some slash fics for some of the other fandoms in a part of.

** There was a Warhammer crossover, and in one scene Barty Crouch is served tea by Barty Crouch Jr., who was turned into a servitor. He had to witness his own son turned into a lobotomized cyborg slave by an Inquisitor Astartes Harry Potter who was raised in the 41st millennium.

There were a few other great moments in that fic, like Hermione Granger wielding a featherweight charmed minigun in wartime Yugoslavia as part of her Summer internship. Or a Durmstrang full of zombies getting purged in Bolter shell and Fiendfire. Or Godric's hollow becoming a magic-muggle utopia thanks to the local munitions company, Aquila industries, stomping all over the Statute. Or Cedric Diggory becoming a Space Marine. Or the Moon Base.

Or everything about the 3rd Millenium god Emperor of mankind, who on one hand is kind of annoyed with this big man-child who worships him, but on the other hand is really excited by all this science and the fact there's a magic society he almost missed. He can do magic with a pencil for a wand.

It's the sequel to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62041/1/the-god-empress-of-ponykind/nostalgia][The God Empress of Ponykind]]. Basically its whole premise is "what if Princess Celestia was actually a reincarnated God Emperor of Mankind all along?". It's really good. Its sequel, which I prefer, has Celestia returning to her old domain, bringing Twilight along, in order to finally set things right. Join Tara, the student of The Empress, as she travels the galaxy finding returning Primarchs, making friends with Sororitas and suspicious Inquisitors, and facing down the worst the galaxy has to offer. It's a really good 40k story, Emperor's gender aside.

Doesn't make him any less of a psychopath. Harry and Tom are together in their final Hogwarts year and Harry is losing control over his magic because without the Horkrux his magic is no longer suppressed and so on...

Tom decides to help Harry so he doesn't go batshit crazy without control over his magic. They met in the Chamber of Secrets - and when Harry goes down Tom is literally raping a girl - he has her under imperius and forces her to give him a blowjob. It doesn't stop there. After Tom let's the girl go Harry put's Tom under the Imperius and does the same to him. I quit the fic after that chapter.

** A horrible fic I had to stop reading where Hermione was getting tortured by evil!Harry from an AU and it just got disturbingly graphic, to the extent that it kinda felt like the author might have been enjoying writing about it a little too much.

I believe it was just violence, not any other kind of assault, but it was really detailed and descriptive and sadistic, and it threw me out of the story. I imagined that it would only get more so from where I had reached.

** This might spoil the whole story, but as I don't remember the name of the fic i don't think it matters a lot Harry time travels to Marauders era, it becomes a Harry/Sirius pairing, pretty dark story and really long, at the end everything thing seems to be getting okay, at the end Harry's adopted brother dies, Harry becomes obsessive, last scene time travelling Sirius kills Harry I'm not telling the story really well tbh, but at that time it fucked me up, like a lot, no other fanfic impacted me that much

** There was a next gen fic written immediately after DH. Voldemort manages to survive because there are some crumbs of his soul that got attached to his wand during his killings. He abducts Albus and attracts the trio in his trap. He wants to duel Harry and win in order to move on so in order to resolve the twin core problem, he kills Hermione and takes her wand and forces Harry to kill Ron (or else he'll kill Albus) and take his wand. Since it's a fair duel, Voldemort defeats Harry but I believe he lets Albus go. I don't remember the name nor could I find it based on key words. If anyone read this fic and remembers it, that would be helpful.

** Don't remember the name of it and I feel like this is the darkest fic I've read in my decade long reading career but highlights include:

-HPLV dubcon (super super dark)

-Harry got tricked into killing Dobby to make into his horcrux

-got so bad that HP inner horcrux of Tom came to life and try to save him

-voldie is left as a limbless being for eternity in a cage

-HP lost his memory of this entire ordeal in the end but is now essentially immortal without knowing why

It really left an impression

***** Tried to find it. Thought it was the Harem War, but turns out he only bangs humans in that one. Like ALL OF THEM, but still.

One last search... nope. Just too many damn fics. Here's shit I remember about it, and I'm spoiler marking the whole list because some of them are just awful:

- he bangs at least two dragons
- he bangs like 900 werewolves
- there are multiple "dark lords" the second is Chinese
- he bangs like 900 vampires, including basically "Lillith" clone
- Oh! two biggies... a couple of royal daughters are in his harem
- the killing curse doesnt affect him at all
- and he's his own justice, kills everyone in a big stadium and takes their land and women

And I'm sure I missed some crazy aspects of it. You need really thick skin to read that thing. Wish I could remember which story it was, but the above should give someone the clues they need.
