So many time travel fics just start a completely different timeline where anything can be changed, which is completely overpowered. I'm looking for time travel where things that happened for sure can't be changed, but things that could or could not have happened can. Like future-Hermione can't change the fact that past-Hermione heard an axe sound since that already happened, but she can change the unknown reason behind it and rescue the Hippogriff. I've already read HPMoR which despite its other flaws does this self consistent time travel quite well, and Cedric's eight and Concentric Wavelengths did it too, but those can't be the only ones?


** How is this consistent? Either your time line is a closed loop in which everything that happens happens exactly as it did the first time around, or your timeline branches off in an alternative timeline. It sounds like you're asking for some sort of weird Barry Allen hybrid monstrosity.

*** It is a closed loop. Everything the time traveler did already happened before they traveled back, they just didn't know it yet.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
