** how about *Breakfast In New York*

The first chapters have a bit of drama and focus on the romance part. In the later chapters are about the whole family.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

** Those are really rare... and most that I can think of aren't super happy:

"Angelica" - Hermione raises their child, Harry is absent for plot reasons:

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056]]

One of the saddest fics ever, written from the POV of their child, but Hermione is dead:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12192798/1/Don-t-You-Worry]])

Picnic Panic has a really sweet familial vibe, but it isn't their child:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/Picnic-Panic]])

They raise a child together in "The Augurey", which is really well written, though a bit angsty:
