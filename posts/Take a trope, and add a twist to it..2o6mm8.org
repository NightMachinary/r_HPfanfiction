The challenge is exactly what it sounds like. If there is a trope or a detail you are sick of seeing over and over in fics, rewrite it to make something new. You can even pick a trope you like, as long as it's one that appears frequently in fannon. It can be funny. It can be serious. It can be whatever you want it to be. The only thing I ask is that you breathe new life into old plot devices.

...Examples include...

Harry finds a magical trunk with a secret room inside that solves every problem...unfortunately, it is all an illusion. Being in the trunk actually makes him weaker, or dumber, or is addictive.

Hermione's parents are named Dan and Emma...but they're not her real parents. They adopted her, or kidnapped her, or were confounded into thinking she was actually theirs. Hermione's real parents don't have to be magical at all. She can still be a muggleborn. She only needs a different set of birth parents.

Dumbledore is secretly evil...except for the fact that he is not actually Dumbledore. The headmaster was posessed at some point, or he is an imposter. The real Dumbledore might be dead or held captive.

Ron is mean and stupid...because he is not actually human. The real Ron Weasley died soon after he was born. Molly was so distraught, that she transfigured an inanimate object (or animal) into a baby. It started out as a way to ease her pain, but she could never bring herself to let 'little Ronnie' go.

If you can think of other examples that might be fun, add them in the comments.


** I always thought a good one-shot idea would be Harry going to Gringotts and the goblins being super helpful, telling him about all kinds of contracts and laws that he had no idea about, showing him the Potter Family Vault (tm) full of magical items and tearfully prescient messages from his dead parents...

... and then it turns out they tricked him into signing a bunch of papers that put him into indentured servitude or something.

You'd definitely want to include a scene where Harry recognizes Griphook and bows to him, and then the goblin says, "That's not my name - do you think all goblins look the same or something? Racist."

#+end_quote

One-shot attempt below.

--------------

--------------

--------------

It looked like an ordinary trunk at first sight.

Ignoring the curious fact that it was the only interesting thing in the Room of Requirement, the only negative thought Harry attached to it was that it was something interesting in the Room of Requirement.

It could almost be considered enticing in its design. Looking at it from where he stood he admired the prominence it held over the ordinary junk around it, a gaggle of uninteresting and mismatched furniture.

/The trunk is different,/ he thought to himself, a self-satisfied mental nod following the deduction, /just different./

/'Just' different in the way you insist yourself being?/ an errant though supplied.

...

There was something different about the trunk, good or bad he didn't know; and only slightly cared about the answer...a case-study show of Gryffindor idiocy if ever there was one.

/If it's anything bad I'll just let Dumbledore deal with it,/ he swore to himself, opening the top of the trunk felt like popping the protective caps off a pair of binoculars. As the lid opened the escaping air seemed to emit a sigh of relief.

The entire build-up to the present moment was for nothing, and he admitted to himself it was better to be disappointed with what he found... his prior life experiences proved him right in that.

All that was inside was a room-like box, perhaps twelve-foot by twelve-foot and maybe ten foot deep. The floor of it looked... squidgy... and rolls of parchment leaned against all four walls like a barricade... or maybe spartan decoration, as every square inch of wall had rolls of parchment resting against it up to waist height..

He didn't know what prompted him to go beyond peering inside but he climbed down the ladder that hung, rope-like, from the back of the lid to the center of the room.

He remembered, mid-way down the ladder, the overwhelming unease his existence embodied as the lid shut above him, followed by a relieved sigh when it opened it as he punched it in an all-consuming panic.

The lid shut above him again, he didn't think about what lighted the barren room at that moment, who do you think he was, a Ravenclaw?

--------------

--------------

--------------

He'd searched inside the trunk for what felt like hours, there were dozens of interesting scrolls bound in leather wrappings, when he got them out of their wrappings he saw they weren't on his favourite subjects but they were still fascinating, in that unexplored corner of his mind everyone has, allowing them to appreciate things beyond their comprehension.

He must have been unrolling his sixth or seventh one by now - each one detailed some archaic ritual, diagrams of bodies and Olde English scripture, he made out few words but a few basic concepts; spirituality and hypnosis and so on were easy to decipher.

He recalled /acutely/, that original fear - when he looked back to the ladder and found both lid and ladder vanished.

Time passed, he'd tried everything he could think of, he approached the problem in new and novel ways - perhaps the lid would reappear - just for an instant, if he was naked? If he thought like a Slytherin? If he spoke parseltongue to it?

He cast his first forgivable in the box.

It was inevitable that he'd give up.

He decided to starve himself.

...and learned he couldn't feel hunger - nor much of any feelings innately human beyond boredom.

He didn't thirst.

...nor could he sleep.

The fear turned into resignation - it must have been months by then. He thought he was a relentlessly driven individual when he had a mind to be, and being trapped provided excellent motivation for ceaseless activity.

He remembered developing that sustained iron-strong will to practice his magic.

...And the euphoria that bordered on ecstasy when he discovered freely supplied blank parchment and writing implements; he penned a sentence.

#+begin_quote
  /MY NAME IS HARRY POTTER/
#+end_quote

The words didn't seep into the parchment this time.

As he wallowed, he learned more about himself.

...His failings as a person before, and the truth of who he was to the public, and what they would do without him. He'd played over and over in his mind what they'd think happened to him.

Occasionally he'd have "fun thoughts", known realistically to be misplaced imagination:

...That maybe he was a carbon copy of his true self that had left the trunk earlier

...Or perhaps there was a carbon copy of him walking up above, a living lie of himself.

...Or maybe they knew he was inside, and had been having the same problem he had.

...Or maybe they knew he was inside, and were responsible for the whole mess.

...Am I being watched?

--------------

--------------

--------------

He learned more of his magic - in fact, he learned more playing with his magic than he'd ever learned at school - though it was a well-versed joke to any that would listen that he was still /"at school."/

If he was honest, his main reason for practicing magic was so he could kill himself, but the thought of leaving the box in any fashion was fleeting when it arose, and it arose less frequently each time it cropped up.

Eventually the need to leave the box waned and vanished.

--------------

--------------

--------------

Years probably passed, he had no mirrors so he couldn't see himself, but his hair didn't grow, neither did his height, his skin felt soft and it had definitely paled; /no one/ could be paler than he was.

He hoped the paleness meant he was ill, he hoped it killed him.

His skin became healthily tanned overnight, he received no answers.

When the sound of a lid opening was heard and another gasp of escaping air hit another's ears a great many years later, he had long-forgotten whose face stared down at him.

Harry looked at the lid for a long while. Delusions... cruel, cruel things that they were had tormented him for a period of weeks, and then never occurred again.

And then their eyes met.

A historic span of time passed as Voldemort looked down at him - and in an unforgivably foolish bout of thoughtlessness, floated himself to the floor.

The trunk lid shut.

--------------

--------------

--------------

"My, my Harry, of all the places to have hidden all these years..." the man mocked, "And all I came for was Rowena's Diadem..."

Voldemort flicked his wand and Harry identified the spell as it hit him; far within his ability to get himself out of, a perk earned through months spent immobile under his own spell.

He didn't think in human timescales by then, he thought in terms of projects he'd set himself and overcome.

"...and you haven't aged a day."

Harry pretended to be still; he couldn't still be certain this wasn't another test from the box or another delusion.

"Where did the door go?"

Silence.

A legilimens probe entered his mind. He let it. He'd developed a keen awareness of his mind from filing all the clutter inside.

/A crueler fate than death,/ he sent mentally, /...to be deprived of both death and outward influence./

Curses exploded on the room's ceiling and walls, in the activity the man didn't see them bending around Harry.

The room didn't budge - not even a burn mark marred the walls.

A wand was pointing at Harry now, and raging tones demanded answers that were unanswerable. As Voldemort raged his magic swelled, and it was an impressive thing, all constrictive and oppressive and roiling like a caged beast.

And Harry could admire it...

...but it didn't compare to his own magic. There was no smugness; only a welcome observation - there was less danger if he was the more powerful one.

Harry didn't know much of magic outside of what he could do in his immediate surroundings; within the box he was the undisputed king... or pawn, depending on his mood.

Voldemort simply exploded, there was a slight widening of the eyes and disbelief had wormed into his mind the same instant Harry's magic erupted impossibly fast to tremendous proportions.

2025 was the year strips of flesh and fragments of bone joined the rolls of parchment now, now slick with blood, in sparse decoration.

Harry breathed out once, wary of a false promise.

The lid opened.

He frowned... unusual, but he'd learned the value of patience long ago.

A draft licked across his face.

...

He almost smiled as his eyes reached above the brim of the trunk lid, marveling at his exquisite sense of touch on the ladder.

...he was back.

** This is actually a very popular way to come up with story ideas. Myself, I've subverted the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/5/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots]["Ron is a chess master" trope]], the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/6/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots]["Severus is Harry's father" trope]], the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love]["Harry and Ginny are soul bonded and everything is awesome" trope]], the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/10/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots]["Harry receives 'the talk'" trope]], and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots]["Harry has a powerful magical animagus form" trope]], to name a few.

Perhaps the best deconstuction of a trope would be by a fellow Alpha Fight Club author: IP82's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666565/1/The-shortest-Severitus-story-ever][The Shortest Severitus Story Ever]]. Another master of the trope subversion form is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]].

A few such ideas off the top of my head:

- /Animagus subversion/: After much focused study, Harry discovers his magical animagus form. Unfortunately, it's completely useless--flobberworm, bowtruckle, flesh-eating slug, etc. (Bonus points given if this otherwise useless form proves to be the "power he knows not.")
- /Indy!Harry subversion/: Upon reaching his majority (age seventeen or otherwise through whatever machination the Goblins present), Harry is quick to sign up to inherit all his hereditary titles and such going back to Peverel, Gryffindor, Merlin, etc., only to realize that in doing so he inherited all of their debts and outstanding liens. He is ruined financially, politically, and is forced into debtor prison.
- /Wand subversion/: "The wand chooses the wizard." Because of Circumstances, Harry cannot match any wand in Ollivander's shop so he must have a custom wand built for him. Unfortunately, rather than be a demon-scale-cored überwand, his custom wand never works right and in fact cripples his spellcasting.
- /Hedwig subversion/: Harry believes that he has a familiar bond with his pet owl allowing her to understand his needs far more acutely than the average post owl. One summer evening, Death Eaters/Vernon/Torries attack and he sends his trusted companion out for help, which never arrives. (It turns out she's not even a good post owl.)
- /Japanese subversion/: Harry studies at a special Japanese magical school and learns Oriental magical arts. Said arts turn out to be inferior, hampering his ability to learn Western spellcasting. And Harry's penchants for wearing traditional Japanese clothing and using Japanese suffixes ("Dumbledore-sama") are considered by everyone to be really weird.
- /Wandless magic subversion/: Harry spends all summer at Number 4 learning to cast wandless magic, even managing a few spells (albeit, not as effectively as if he uses his wand). At the end of the summer, he realizes that his wand has taken offense at this and refuses to work with him ever again. (In other words, there's good reason why wandless magic is so rare in the magical world.)
- /Letter from parents subversion/: Harry visits his vault and receives a letter from his parents. It turns out that they really were very vain, pettty people who never truly loved him and, in fact, blame him for destroying their lives. (All the hagiography from people he encountered was just done to spare his feelings and to avoid speaking ill of the dead. In other words, Snape was right about James all along.) Lily is particularly gleeful at sticking him with her sister and she hopes that if he's reading this he's had a very shitty time of things. (Petunia always was a spiteful bitch.)
- /Final battle subversion/: Ron is without a doubt the best chess player to ever grace the halls of Hogwarts, so he is the obvious choice to coordinate Hogwarts's defenses during the final assault. Unfortunately, being good at chess means diddly squat when it comes to military strategy. He loses in spectacular fashion and the wizarding world falls to Voldemort.
- /Quidditch subversion/: It turns out that being able to catch a Rememberall is, in fact, a far cry from being able to play the most challenging Quidditch position competently. Harry's pitiful losses continue until he's unceremoniously booted from Gryffindor's Quidditch squad.
- /Harem subversion/: It turns out that trying to maintain polyamorous relationships with a bunch of hormonal teenagers is, in fact, /not/ a recipe for happiness or bliss. Who knew?

** Hermione and Harry fall in love, and Hermione (as always happens) happily becomes a supporting character with no will of her own. In point of fact, she's effectively cast Polymorph Any Object on Ginny, who wants as much position and prestige as possible assuming Voldemort dies. She's dosed herself with love potions because she's too ethical to use them on Harry and thinks that will help her chances with him -- and she's right.

Meanwhile, an incognito Hermione takes her parents to America, where they have things like health and safety, teaching standards, and law enforcement. At least by reputation; in point of fact, their marketing agency is the only thing that functions well, and that because they contracted with a Muggle firm. Really, they've got more dark lord problems at once than the UK has had in any fifty years running, and this is business as usual for them.

Distressed at her findings, Hermione returns to England, where she's captured by Voldemort and eventually manages to become his dark mistress. She doses him with Draught of the Living Death and takes over his organization, using that power to drag the wizarding world forcibly to modern standards.

During this process, she reforms Hogwarts to fire most of the staff. Lady Hogwarts appears -- and instead of enforcing Hermione's sensible will, she fights back, refusing to let some interloper destroy all she's worked so hard to create.
