Hi all. I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago. In it there was a lesson (possibly Defence, possibly with Moody?) where they learned about the science of Apparition. The general idea was that when you Disapparate, the spaces between the particles of your body become huge, miles apart (so you effectively disappear), and then you can appear in another place by making those spaces normal size again, but with a different focal point somewhere else. Sorry if it's a bad explanation. In the fic it was a lot more eloquent than that! I really hope someone can help, I would love to read it again.

Thanks for your help! :)

Edit: Found (elsewhere) - it was James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing in case anyone was curious.


** Never heard of that particular method (or the fic in which it might be contained). Also, that method seems extremely wasteful energy-wise.

Imagine you are a ball that can apparate. You are at A, and want to go to B. Imagine that you have three points on your body: 1 (on the left side), 2 (in the middle), and 3 (on the right side).

If you expand around point 2 until point 1 touches B, point 3 is now the same distance in the opposite direction. Thus, point three has to move 3x as far (Wrong way, back to start, then to B).

I'd imagine that they could induce quantum tunneling more easily than that. Matter can teleport by itself naturally (waveform collapse), so magic could simply control the destination (which would also explain why a lack of focus leads to splinching).
