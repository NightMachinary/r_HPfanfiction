How did magic evolve in different parts of the world (in prehistoric times, during the agricultural revolution and such)? How is it used from culture to culture (how Asian wizards do magic vs. European)?

I'm creating a wizarding world that attempts to be internal;y consistent, realistic, and above all else, culturally appropriate. This world will have multiple cultures doing different forms of magic, a rich history, and magical subjects will be greatly expanded upon. In essence. I'm attempting to do what [[/u/Taure]] did, but in my own way and on a much grander scale.

This is in preparation to write a fanfic that doesn't follow the Stations of the Canon. I'll be making my notes on worldbuilding public.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.


** Generally in real life, culture and tradition begins with what you need, then grows to what you want. So, I would say that an internally consistent magical world would really depend on where you think magic came from - and there are so many ideas for that that I don't want to suggest one. Instead, I'll throw you some links I've used in my D&D games that can help inspire some ideas.

Work out where you want Magic to start (eg. Did it evolve like limbs and intelligence, did some ancient human eat the wrong space-rock, did some classical Roman fella invent a thing that gave them magic, did an 'Event' happen that gave magic, did another species with magic breed into humanity, did it happen in one place or many, etc?), then what Magic would need to be maintained (ie. what the first practitioners would need to keep doing their magic: are focuses like rings and wands new, do they need them to start with?, if so they'd need stuff to make focuses), then what it would need to grow (what the first practitioners would need to learn more magic and what they'd need to teach others), then what it would want once it's position is secured (ie. how the practitioners would make themselves comfortable).

I can give more specific ideas if you want, but D&D habits demand I try give you a framework for your own ideas first. :D
