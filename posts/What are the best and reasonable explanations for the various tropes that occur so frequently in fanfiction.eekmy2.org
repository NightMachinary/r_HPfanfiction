** Here's an excerpt from the Philosopher's Stone.

#+begin_quote
  "Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once."

  "He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"

  "Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --

  "But this is important."

  "Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?"

  "Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --"

  Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.

  "How do you know --?" she spluttered.

  "Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."

  She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. "Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  "I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say."

  "You got there? You got Hermione's owl?"

  "We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you."
#+end_quote

We do not know the context of the "urgent letter" he received from the Ministry. It may have necessitated that he fly. For instance, if the Ministry requested he deliver something to them that couldn't be transported magically (outside of brooms/thestrals etc). But that's just conjecture on my part. The information we /do/ have is that whatever is requested of Dumbledore, it will require him to be away from the castle for the night.

--------------

If it eases your conscience to have a plausibly valid reason, how about something like this:

#+begin_quote
  External to the canon storyline, Lord Voldemort had planned to have Dumbledore called away /far/ in advance. Voldemort had weakened some key Ministry of Magic protective enchantments that he knew Dumbledore was uniquely responsible for upkeeping. Voldemort also knew that fixing those protections would require specialist magical artefacts that Dumbledore owned and kept in his office.

  With this information, we can assume that Voldemort "triggered" those enchantments to collapse on the night he wanted to steal the stone. This spurs the Ministry into sending an urgent owl to Dumbledore (as to why they didn't use the Floo Network to inform him. Let's just say that's against protocol for contacting Dumbledore on something as seemingly harmless as a deteriorating enchantment).

  Dumbledore leaves Hogwarts. Lord Voldemort knows when this happens (assume he has his ways), and then begins his plan to steal the Philosopher's Stone.

  Dumbledore /doesn't/ receive Hermione's owl. Instead he finds the protections tampered with subtly. His mind is immediately drawn to the Philosopher's Stone, and he realises he's been lured away. He instantly apparates or uses Fawkes to travel back to Hogwarts, and arrives just in time to pull Quirrell off of Harry to stop the Stone being stolen.
#+end_quote

So... if we take this as canon... Voldemort's plan was /nearly/ flawless.

** I... can't really tell if you're looking for actual explanations of why certain events happened or just the reasoning behind common tropes used in fanfic storytelling.

Since wordhammer gave a pretty good explanation of events, I'll go for general tropes. Well, tropes are basically everything about a story that's been done before. They're the patterns, archetypes, reoccurring themes, etc, that your story is built upon like a house is built upon foundations. However good or bad a trope is, you can't write a good story without them, just like you can't build a good house without a foundation. They tend to fall down in brisk winds.

A story without tropes gives the reader nothing really to hold onto or buy into emotionally while you go about your plot. Harry 'leaving the farm' to go to magic school is a trope that introduces us to the world with a sense of child-like wonder and gets us to 'buy in' quicker. Without a trope like that, you just get a rote sense of obligatory education, which would make her world introduction kind of dull or some culturally unfamiliar viewpoint that would make the scene impossible to relate to.

So, yeah. That's my explanation for general tropes. They're used because they give us emotional involvement into a story without having to get our heads around something completely unfamiliar or uninteresting to us.

If you want explanations of why common tropes are used - Lord Potter-Black-Emrys-I-write-Sins-Not-Tragedies-Montpellier-Jones or Be nice to a Goblin and he'll give you everything he owns - that's something someone who has actually used those tropes would be better placed to weigh in on. I've never written a HP-fic, so my opinion would be second-hand observation only.

** There are two types of explanations for such things; in-universe and real-world. If you wish to criticize the authors and editors and such, feel free to come up with real-world reasons, but

#+begin_quote
  "Fanfiction is, arguably, largely a Watsonian pursuit. That is, we commit fic, often and in part, to solve issues within the canon as if they are true things within the canon (not a matter of writer error or external interpretation)."
#+end_quote

Source for the quote: [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Watsonian_vs._Doylist]]

So the Watsonian/in-universe explanations tend to be valued more around here. Why did Dumbledore fly on a broom to the Ministry on the night the trio and Quirrel went after the Stone? Because Dumbledore was annoyed with Fudge for calling him constantly asking his advice for every little decision he needed to make, and being on a broom for several hours kept him blissfully out of contact during the ride. Alternately, he knew Harry was meant to confront Voldemort over the Stone and felt it best to give Harry the chance to meet his destiny.

** u/AutumnSouls:
#+begin_quote
  Why Dumbledore flew on a broom to the ministry when the stone was friend? I think it's simple because JK and not come up with Floo or Apparition yet.
#+end_quote

Apparition was heavily implied in the first chapter of the first book, when Dumbledore appears "so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground."

But as for why Dumbledore flew on a broom to the Ministry, well, McGonagall says he "flew off to London." She could mean this metaphorically. Or Dumbledore used a broom to fly to the edge of Hogwarts wards and then Disapparated from there. Or, the dumbest but my favorite, she meant he Floo'd.

Though I'm fairly sure Dumbledore later implies he did fly. So maybe he had to transport something big. Maybe he just felt like flying. Maybe he was irritated with the Ministry and wanted to take the long route. Maybe he used something much faster than a broom like a thestral. Who knows.

** I can't remember the name of the fic where it appeared, but I remember a scene where Harry, in the Hospital Wing after his confrontation with Quirellmort ask Dumbledore why he flew rather that Apparate or used Floo, his response was just "Sometimes, I feel like flying".

*** Must have missed that part in it. But I call BS, as Dumbledore was the strongest of that generation. A simple confundus from the likes of Quirrel wouldn't work on him. He flat out later admitted that he wanted to jumpstart the prophecy.
