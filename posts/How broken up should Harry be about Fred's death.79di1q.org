I've been on a post-DH story kick lately and I've noticed a disturbing pattern, of Harry being torn to shreds by Fred's death (and what it does to the Weasleys). In many stories it takes whole chapters of conversations and drama.

Isn't that kind of excessive? I mean he liked the guy's jokes, enough to give the twins 1000 galleons. But they weren't close by any stretch of the imagination. And I don't really see Harry picking up the Weasleys' grief by osmosis. I feel like Harry has a lot of other people (and things) to grieve for before giving a thought to Fred.

Thoughts?


** I think that Harry seems to romanticize the "perfect" family that the weasley's represent and that Fred's death shatters that image. Or at least, that is sort of the impression I got. I think that fanfiction magnifies that and embellishes it for whatever reason.

*** Ah, I like this explanation. Children who raise themselves are often quite self-centered. Fred's death being a catalyst for the shattering of Harry's dream of fitting to the family he's always wanted makes much more sense than true grief or guilt.

** Call me callous or insensitive, but I think the Weasleys got off way too lightly considering many families with far less involvement were decimated or destroyed. It could have been way worse for them. In fact, I would be perfectly happy to trade a couple more Weasleys for Remus or Tonks.

The Weasleys probably knew that themselves and might actually suffer survivors' guilt to a certain degree. Of course, they should still be very upset about Fred and would go for some serious retributions after their hard won victory. George, however, was the one I see truly torn up over Fred. Perhaps his trouble was the main reason Ron gave up his auror career and moved into his shop.

*** Yeah there's no doubt that the Weasleys got off lightly. I mean some families were almost completely wiped out.

Survivor's guilt is an interesting idea I hadn't thought about! My thoughts centered more towards Molly being inconsolable (loss of a child, reminder of the loss of her brothers). It's a well accepted fact that if the mother is miserable, the whole family suffers - so not only do the Weasley children have to deal with Fred's loss, but they also have to handle Molly's grief.

**** As for Harry, he got a glimpse of afterlife and it looked pretty good. Dumbledore also mentioned death was preferable to a loveless life. Harry was even offered the option to go to heaven with Dumbledore.

However, he turned it down so he could finish his job and get back to his friends.

I'm not sure he would feel all that bad for those good people who had died.

**** Percy obviously, but I wouldn't mind having George joining Fred in afterlife, if it means Teddy could have a mother. Poor Andromeda also deserved better than losing BOTH her husband and child.

** Harry's time spent with the twins is off screen. They were in the quidditch team together for years. They trained 3 or 4 times a week? That's a lot of time even if you aren't talking the whole time. In some ways the Quidditch team is Harry's closest bunch because they're the first people to recognise him for his skills rather than his name. Combine that all with Harry's tendency to feel guilty for every action made by Voldemort and his followers before Harry stopped him and I could see the authors not being too far off.

** Assuming canon levels of self sacrifice/guilt from Harry it makes for Harry to be pretty broken up about Fred & the other deaths at the Battle of Hogwarts, considering he already has problems with people (in his view) dying for him (parents, Sirius, Dumbledore). Fred's death (and Lupin/Tonks) would probably be the worst for him considering he personally knows the people that will be most affected by this, the Weasleys and Teddy.

On the "Harry has more people and things to grieve", I think Harry's problem wouldn't necessarily be grieving Fred, it would be more feeling guilt that he died. That being said I do think they were closer than you described, Fred and George were also part of Harry's Quidditch team for 5(ish) years, and they gave him the Marauders Map.

Does DH contain that much of those two? I know the earlier books contained a fair amount, but you'd assume at some point Harry would get over his self-centeredness; he didn't cause the war. Almost every person who died chose to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. Hell, Harry himself walked to his death willingly. That, at the very least, should cure him of most of his misplaced guilt.

**** I honestly don't remember, I haven't read books 4-7 in years. I think he was completely numb when he found out people died? I can't remember much about Fred's death besides Percy just turning good again.

I think the fact that he walks to his death shows that he has a ton of self sacrifice in him. I also don't think it would be... idk feasible to show much grief in DH, Fred dies in a small skirmish just before the Battle of Hogwarts (if I'm not misremebering), kill the daidem & cup, Snape dies, Snape memories, Harry walk to his death, then the final battle, and the 19 year timeskip. There wasn't much time to process anything "on screen".
