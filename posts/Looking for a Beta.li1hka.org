I am not 100% sure if I'm allowed to look for a Beta in the main thread, but I did a search and saw some other people doing it so I decided to give it a shot. Please let me know if I posted this in error and I will immediately take it down.

*Looking for a Beta (Long-term)*

*Fandom:* Harry Potter

*Title:* /When Spirits Call/. I have two other WIPs, Sundering Seas and The Black Fortune, but as I will be focusing on When Spirits Call for now I will not ask anyone to commit to betaing all three.

*When Spirits Call Summary:* There's a talent that some wizards can manifest - that of an elemental. They can control one of the six established spheres of control: earth, water-ice, fire, air, spirit, and light-darkness. Spirit elementals have been persecuted since they were discovered because their powers also confer upon them the ability to control life and death. Since the Ministry of Magic was established, Unspeakables have been culling the population of spirit elementals until none remain. As the ability to control one element or another is genetic, they believe that they have gotten rid of any bloodlines that could hold the spirit elemental genes. Until Harry.

*Fanfic Details:* Harry/Blaise/Dean, nothing explicit, Slow Burn, currently 38k and 14 chapters in.

*Links:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25161265/chapters/60971101][AO3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13639284/1/When-Spirits-Call][FFN]]

*What I'm Looking For:* Grammar, syntax, and typo edits. Plot and characterization discussions. Constructive criticism basically.

*Update Frequency:* I have not updated in a month since I've run into a bit of writer's block, but I aim to work up to one chapter a week.

*Offers:* I am willing to beta your work in return! Fandoms I can easily beta for are Harry Potter, Twilight, Les Miserables, and Throne of Glass. Fandoms I can beta for but would have to brush up on are Hunger Games, Divergent, Percy Jackson, and Avengers (I will admit that I've only watched Iron Man and Black Panther, but the sheer amount of HP/Avengers fics I've read have indoctrinated me into the Marvel Fandom). I can leave a review on your posted chapters as well.

*How to Contact Me:* My PMs on Reddit and FFN are open.
