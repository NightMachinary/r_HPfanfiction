why... why are they so overused in fics. the biggest cliche trope. they are so rare IRL yet every second fic has it. ugh.

mentor Snape fic? make Harry have an attack so Snape can give him a calming draught.

drarry? make Draco have an attack so Harry can start to have feelings for him.

and of course Neville has panic attacks during potions, because that totally happened in the books.


** Anxiety disorders and panic attacks are not all that rare. Though I will say most writers don't seem to do research about what panic attacks and anxiety disorders really look or feel like before they write.

** Statistically, a tonne more young people have anxiety than ever before, and generally a significant proportion of fandom is young people. Some of them wanna explore what they're feeling through writing, others just write what they know and/or want (ie. someone to come along and help when they're panicking).

*** Statistically - please show your working in which you demonstrate that more young people have anxiety than ever before, and that more records of youngsters going wibbly isn't due to over diagnosis or previous under reporting.

** This trope would bother me a lot less if the writers actually knew what a full blown panic attack looked like.

I get that "comfort the Woobie" is a nice easy setup for an adoption-fic or a romance. It's an entire genre of fics. I'm not going to go into how much Sturgeon's Law applies to the genre. But 99 times out of 100, what's shown/described falls /way/ short of a panic attack, and it's a little irritating that the author still chooses to call it one.

** Panic disorder is incredibly common and literally millions of people have panic and anxiety attacks on a regular basis.

And considering Snape is Neville's actual BOGGART, it would have actually made a ton of sense for him to have an attack in potions class in canon.

As always, I stand by the thought that if you don't like the way someone writes their story, find a new goddamn story to read.

*** It's not the issue of "too many panic attacks", but that they're overwhelmingly used as a cheap plot device. Yes, it's realistic that these fictional characters experience panic attacks. No, it is not realistic for the characters to abruptly forge deep bonds just because one helped the other through an attack or simply witnessed it.

** Two people I know get panic attacks, and I don't know that many people. I assume that these canon-traumatized characters would have a lot of psychological problems, including panic attacks.

** Coming from someone diagnosed with anxiety disorder and that has frequent panic attacks, they're not uncommon at all. If you ask any mental health professional you'll find out that they're actually quite common. The issue is when authors don't understand what they are and how they work.

** I'm gonna refer back to this thread in a chapter or so time where I intend to have Hermione have a panic attack on a crowded shopping street. Oxford street, London to be precise. It's stressful at the best of times, believe me! Much less when you feel like you're being hunted by snatchers.

But I will do much research. It's not something I've experienced myself and I want to be accurate.

*** Panic attacks are pretty personal (as far as what they're like) so you have a bit of creative breathing room but a few common symptoms include: pounding heart, shortness of breath, headaches, "feeling in the pit of your stomach", crying, feeling trapped, negative self-talk, and racing thoughts.

Be grateful for that and hope you never do!

The first time I had one, I legit thought I was having a heart attack. It felt so real that I called 911 and the EMS came.

God was that embarrassing once they assurred me that I was not, in fact, having a heart attack.

*** I wouldn't mind them in fics about the post war trauma, shell shock or what not. but writers use them in romance fics just to get two characters more together. or as a cheap plot device. it is very overused and even fics not set after the war have them just to get the character pity points.
