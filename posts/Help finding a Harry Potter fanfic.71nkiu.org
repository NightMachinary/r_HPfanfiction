I believe it was originally posted on FanFiction.Net, but for the life of me I can not remember the title and I can't find it with my normal methods. The main characters of the story were Harry and Snape (not slash). It was sometime after the war and Snape shows up on Harry and Ginny's doorstep and he's brought his newborn daughter with him. The child's mother, whom he met at a brothel, died. He leaves the child with Harry and Ginny for a few months while he gets things settled. I don't remember too much else, but if anyone knows what story I'm talking about it would be awesome!
