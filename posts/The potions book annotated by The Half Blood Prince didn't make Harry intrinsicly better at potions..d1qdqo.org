So, I had a thought, a bunch of people seem to believe that the annotated potions book suddenly made Harry good at potions. Let's discuss:

So up until Harry's sixth year, the way Snape taught potions was basically, "The instructions are up on the board, begin." Now, a lot of fanfiction either have Harry: Taught potions by 'a proper teacher', suddenly become a potions prodigy because there's no Snape, read the half blood princes book and become amazing or be forever abysmal at potions. These kinda confuse me.

The book is just an edited/improved list of instructions on what to do for the potion. He would still have to have the necessary skills in potions to follow the recipe correctly, prepare all of the ingredients properly (even if their preparation is different) and place everything in at the proper time to avoid it messing up (taking the cauldron off the flame before adding the quills for example). If Harry was bad at any of these then a different version of instructions aren't going to improve his brewing skills.

It's like Neville, I think some of the fics where, once Snape is gone, he starts to improve and learn are believable, because he no longer has a person that truly scares him breathing down his neck and belittling him. Not Harry picking up a book and becoming a genius, there was one fic I appreciated where although he had the book, he took the time to research all of the changes and how they would affect the potion.

Another side note is Hermione, there are so many instances where she has a go at Harry for using the book (even in cannon) but to me it would seem silly NOT to use it. Not just because it works, but that it improves the potion overall. I'm sure that if Hermione found a method that improved the potion she wouldn't let it go until the recipe was changed to reflect the better method. Which is something one would do anyway, if the new method improves the result then why would you use the lesser one? Again, I'm sure Hermione wouldn't have said anything if a new revision of the potions book showed an improved method, but just because someone changed the 'approved' method means she turns into a jeleaus monster.


** Canon makes it clear prior to HBP that Harry was not incompetent at Potions. While it remains unsaid what level of influence Hermione had on this success, the fact is /both/ Harry and Ron were able to acquire an E in their OWLs. What Harry lacked, that he may have possessed when it came to defense, was the spark of creativity or brilliance that causes things to 'just click,' to use a turn of phrase.

Frankly, I have no idea how the grading scale is actually 'determined' by the administrations and Hogwarts. Frankly, a lot of it seems highly subjective and prone to biases (ex. Tofty giving Harry a 'bonus point' for his Patronus). What level of competence does say an Acceptable merit over a Poor? We have no idea in canon, but at a guess I would say that everything except the best and the worst is usually fairly fluid in terms of what grades they merit.

And finally, I think what needs to be stated is the real difference brought out by Snape's methods. Snape was a 'deft hand at potions', to paraphrase Slughorn, and Harry's success comes from getting the advice of someone who was a truly brilliant potioneer. This is in comparison to Harry's own methods, which were perfectly functional but /routine/. Snape had a better understanding of the mechanics behind the formula, so to speak, while Harry merely knew the numbers, order and expected results. Its a difference I think between an A student in Algebra and the Teacher. One can repeat the process, but the other understands.

*** A Patronus is beyond NEWT level defense, though. It'd be like if in a high school home ec class, you created a restaurant-worthy 3-course meal when the minimum to pass was to cook a pasta dish with a homemade sauce. I do think there's bias in the Hogwarts grading, but it seems like there's actual standards for the OWLs and NEWTs that are graded objectively, with a bit of extra credit granted for extraordinary skill.

*** I know that AP classes are definitely not known by everybody but their tests are a 1-5 scale and it felt sort of comparable to this grading system with an outstanding and 5 being exceptional and a 4/ Exceeds Expectations being a great accomplishment on its own despite not being the top. It clashes with an A or a B where the difference is a perfectly completed and a lacking in some way .

** It mentioned it the earlier books a couple of times, that Harry misreads the instructions due to his glasses fogging up and not being able to see. Obviously having them written down in the book helped.

Also, Harry got an E in his OWLs - he was always good at potions.

**** I feel like canon makes it clear that he's passable at potions, but that the instructions in the book are the ones that make it /amazing/. Perhaps part of it is that the way it's taught in the classes are poorly done, with seemingly little focus on the theory of potions. But it's not like he seems to actually do anything different before and after the book - he just follows the instructions to make the potion.

IDK, the results are better because of better instructions, but I don't get the feeling that he /understands/ potions more than to be able to follow instructions. Which is why an actual PotionMaster type story would be interesting if well done!

***** I can't find it, it's been a while and I don't remember which fic it was but it was one where Harry had transfered the annotations to his own book and made it look like he'd added them. Hermione gets jealous in class and when Slughorn says that he did good Hermione is like "well, are you sure you didn't have any help" and then Harry basically explains some of the theory because he actually took the time to research all of the changes Snape made. I don't remember much else but it might have been a fic where Harry becomes independent. It wasn't a Hermione is stupid one though :D

Edit: another comment reminded me of something else about the fic, when they're asked to brew an antidote to something Hermione acts smug, thinking he can't make an antidote but he uses the theory he has researched to come up with the idea of grinding down a bezoar and adding it to neutralise the poison. He states that Slughorn wouldn't have picked a rare poison that a bezoar wouldn't neutralise because they need rare ingredients to create a counter, which wouldn't be a good idea to waste in a class of 5th years; if that helps to find it.

** Was Harry much better at potions than in previous years or was he just better compared to his classmates? I always assumed Snape used his own instructions on the board and not the ones from the book, which was why everyone did worse when Slughorn came. Then everyone struggled and only Harry had an easy time with the improved recipes. And he wasn't bad at it before, he still managed an E and he had trouble reading the board. I think if Harry were intrinsically good at potions he would have been able to understand and come up with the improvements himself. Potions seems to be a subject in which you really just need to follow instructions and work carefully and precisely. Those who are good at that have an easy time with it and manage to get the results that were expected.

If we compare it to eg baking, I'd say it's very similar. A clumsy person won't care if there's a bit too much flour and one egg lacking, but the results will be a disaster. Someone following the instructions to a t will have an amazing cake but it doesn't necessarily mean they are intrinsically good at cooking. When you realize you have no eggs at home but understand what the eggs do in the cake and what other ingredients you could use to the same effect instead and end up with a delicious cake, then you have understood baking and are intrinsically good at it.

*** I agree, that's why it's so confusing when fics suddenly have Harry become great at potions when they've stated earlier that he was bad at it. It annoys me because the potions book is used as a sudden way for him to become good at potions or how he suddenly improves when he would have already had to be good at the processes of brewing like canon Harry does.

That's an interesting take. It may also be that Harry wasn't the greatest at theory, leading him to only get an E on his OWL.

** The book did make Harry somewhat better at Potions, if only because he read the notes many times and was bound to pick some extra information. But blindly following the recipe without understanding how and why everything works wouldn't teach him much.

I absolutely see Hermione's point in that argument. The point of potions class is not to make this or that potion best, but to learn to brew many different potions. And when Slughorn asks the students to brew their own antidote, Harry is completely out of his depth without a ready-made recipe.

That's said, Harry is not that bad at Potions either. After all, he got an E on his O.W.L., the same as Transfiguration. In fact, McGonagall says to him in the OotP that he has to work hard to get that E, but nobody cries that he's abysmal at that subject.

Also, Snape's incompetence as a teacher is often overrated. It's true in case of Neville and Harry specifically, but 10 people in Harry's year managed to get an O. Probably more students than Harry and Ron got an E, they just didn't need NEWT Potions.

From a learning standpoint, as someone else said, just following someone else's tips and tricks isn't the same as learning how to do something.

** There is something to be said where SUDDENLY a character is super great at a skill they were bad at in canon is concerned, but in this case I don't actually think this is one of the problem areas. Harry was never terrible at potions, just not quite good enough to be great at it. And then the annotated version comes along and he does vastly improve suddenly in the books because he actually has all of the correct instructions instead of snapes generic ones on the board.\\
Basically we know he knows how to read and follow the directions, he just doesn't think beyond the exactly what the directions say to do. So if snape's board instructions are

#+begin_example
   1: stir clockwise 3 times
   2: add pinch of pixie dust
   3: apply heat
   4: stir in chocolate frog powder
   5: let simmer for 2 minutes then stir twice anti-clockwise
#+end_example

That's gonna be the exact thing harry does, /maybe/ missing a step or doing something wrong because he's human and not some potions genius.\\
While having a teacher (or book) who gives him more indepth knowledge on how things work/better instructions on what to do, he will follow the instructions and actually do better.
