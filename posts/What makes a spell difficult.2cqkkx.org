I'm trying to build Harry up magically but I want to make it as /organic/ as possible. For a magic core system it just has an MP cost to spells but I don't want to use this particular system because this fics always sort of ends up going the super Harry route.

What other ways have you come across or systems that you've use/thought about using to scale spells and their difficultly to master?


** This is an issue I've spent a good amount of time thinking and writing about.

Spell casting appears to have two/three active elements which affect the outcome of the spell. The first two are incantation and wand movement, though incantation can be made non-verbal and wand movements appear to disappear with experience (perhaps, like incantations, they shift to a mental representation). The third element is a mental component, requiring you to focus on a specific thing, which only appears necessary for a small number of specific spells.

It seems clear that these active components are insufficient to explain the massive disparity we see in ability between wizards at the very top like Dumbledore and wizards in the middle like Ron. There's a limit to the extent to which one can perfect the pronunciation of a word.

I'd propose that canon provides a fairly obvious passive element to spell casting. By passive I mean something which you don't have to actively do or think about while casting spells, but nonetheless has a significant effect on the result of your spell. This passive element is knowledge of magical theory.

There are quite a few reasons to think this:

1. All the greatest magic users - those capable of casting the most powerful and more advanced spells - are praised for their academic brilliance and intelligence.

2. We have never seen a stupid wizard who could nonetheless cast powerful magic.

3. Professors, who are experts in magical theory, are consistently among the top tier magic users. McGonagall and Slughorn were the ones to face Voldemort with Kingsley, not other Aurors.

4. While Harry would probably win in a duel thanks to non-magical factors (such as reflexes and sheer nerve), it's fairly clear that Hermione has superior spell-casting ability to him. And it's definitely clear that this is the result of Hermione's knowledge of magical theory. Hermione studies hard, and is shown to be able to cast advanced magic as a result.

5. The very existence of a school of magic implies that there is something to be taught. Wand movements and incantations are not sufficiently complex to require a formal school.

6. The size of Hogwarts library implies that there must be something to write about in extensive detail.

7. Early on in PS it is said that there is more to magic than wand movements and incantations.

8. Magic appears to be a transferable skill: learn how to transfigure one animal and you can also transfigure other animals of the same class without having to go through the whole learning process again. It's the theory which provides the link.

I think this is all fairly convincing. This is one of the reasons why I hate all those fics where Harry gets /introduced/ to magical theory post-OotP. Er, no, he's been attending Hogwarts for 5 years and gets pretty decent grades. He already knows magical theory -- he has to in order to cast spells. It's just the reader doesn't get told it.

So, knowledge of magical theory is an important component of being able to successfully cast a spell, and the more advanced your knowledge of theory, the more powerful spells you can cast. But this is just part of the story, because we know of situations where wizards have been able to develop magical abilities without access to theory, such as Tom Riddle's early control of magic.

I would say that the importance of magical theory points towards the answer to the greater question. Magical theory, after all, is a description of magic. So understanding magical theory is a route to understanding magic. I'd say *this is the key passive element of spell-casting: understanding magic*. Both magic in general and the particular spell you're using.

Magical theory is the most common and comprehensive route to understanding magic, and likely an absolute prerequisite of casting advanced magic, but perhaps more simple magic could be successfully cast without extensive knowledge of theory. A rudimentary understanding is enough, perhaps acquired through some other means.

This is where practice comes in. We've seen many times that practicing a spell increases your ability with it. I'd argue that what's happening there (in addition to perfecting the active elements) is that you're improving your understanding of the spell through a route other than formal magical theory.

This idea of general understanding of magic backing up spell-casting power also explains why we see so many powerful generalists. Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, even Hermione... all of them are shown to be non-specialists, highly competent in all areas of magic. This makes sense if your general understanding of magic backs up everything you do.

As far as this all relates to your fic idea... you have some problems, because Harry is not the most academic of guys, and the later you're picking up the story, the later it is for Harry to suddenly develop academic ability. A complete AU starting from the beginning can pull it off, and I've seen it done well in Forging the Sword, which starts post-CoS, but if you're going for a post-OotP divergence then really it's too late for Harry to develop believable academic genius without some kind of mind-dump.

Assuming you're not writing a genius Harry 7 year AU, and assuming you don't want to mind-dump, I'd recommend you focus on the "other routes to understanding magic" idea. Harry is a talented guy, but he's a hands on type of talent. He learns by doing. He can master some pretty advanced stuff when he's motivated and learns in a practical way, like the patronus charm. I'd recommend:

1. Don't try to make Harry a genius generalist like Dumbledore. It's too late for that to be believable. I'd say the absolute latest divergence point where this could be done would be post-PoA.

2. Have Harry develop impressive ability in a handful of spells/abilities that are useful, interesting, and have a depth of application. That is: make him a genius specialist.

3. Have him learn these skills in a hands-on, "sink or swim", practical kind of way.

4. Feel free to give him a general work ethic boost and have him increase his general ability in magic too, but don't overdo it to the point that he's a mini-Dumbledore.

*** Thank you, and fics are awesome!

The only thing that I find a bit questionable is "the later you're picking up the story, the later it is for Harry to suddenly develop academic ability" if my experience of academia and students has taught me anything its that someone disinterested in their first half of school, college or university life can suddenly excel init the latter half if they have the motivation and the guidance.

To me Harry has always had the motivation (and that it was at its most in his 5th year+) but his guidance was lacking because Umbridge, Snape and Dumbledore. If he had a mentor in that crucial time I think he and the gang would have be capable of some pretty impressive magic.

**** Well, it's a matter of degree. To a certain extent, Harry could be an academic late bloomer, yes. He could definitely improve significantly in his academics, perhaps even in a short amount of time. I don't know if you've ever gone back to look at your school materials age 16, but it would only take a few weeks for a college-educated adult to learn the entire syllabus of years 1-5 of senior school.

What I don't think is possible is Harry suddenly developing into a genius. There would have been signs of prodigious talent well before fifth year if Harry had it in him. Riddle was controlling magic consciously before Hogwarts, Dumbledore had invented new magic by age 16. Being at their level of magic use seems to be something that has early signs.

***** I don't know, a lot of the reason syllabus for younger children is easier as an adult is partly because you've already learned it to an extent. Also, there's the whole drama of highschool, growing up and puberty to deal with, on top academic learning. In collage and uni that pressure drops off.

I don't like the idea of Harry as a genius either, mostly because I don't think I'd be able to write one without Harry coming off as a douchebag. If i was going to do something like that I'd give him specialized knowledge/understanding that all wizard know about, but not all wizards know. For example, computers, electricity, cars or the economy everyone uses them but only very few people know how they actually work, and even then there are massive rooms for error.

**** Incidentally, I think this also explains why Harry was able to cast Sectumsepmra successfully when he had no idea what it did and had never practiced it. Harry is the top student in his year at DADA, which presumably involves understanding the Dark Arts in order to counter them. Sectumsempra is Dark Arts and though he knew nothing of that particular spell, his understanding of the Dark Arts was sufficient to cast the spell.

Look at the courses. Spells, fighting, converting objects' forms and materials, divination, divination with numbers, an ancient language, potions, animal husbandry, plant husbandry, stargazing, history, and dealing with the 99% of the world that can't use a wand.

Only three of those need a wand. Defense Against the Dark Arts is a specialized hybrid of Charms and Creatures, for the most part, with some practical fighting experience in there; you could probably do well in most fights with only knowing fifteen or twenty spells. Charms is about learning spells. Transfiguration may be a specialized branch of Charms, though it would be odd to have a unique, hand-crafted spell to turn mice into snuff boxes.

So, it looks like the Hogwarts teaching staff agrees that wand movements and incantations are not all that a proper magic school would need to teach. Not that the somatic components of spells are sufficient to explain the magic system in the series -- it seems to take a long time for anyone to learn any spell, whereas we would expect people in fourth year to get most spells right on the first try, if there are concrete and precise ways of describing the somatic components.

*** As I like your piano analogy (especially with respect to dispensing with the whole [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2cbdqp/major_cliches_to_avoid/cjflxpl][magical core folderol]]), I'd propose that it's possible that magical theory is introduced in stages, much the same way that musical theory is introduced in stages to an aspiring pianist. In piano, only after one has a mastery of theory can one appreciate and play, say, the chromaticity of a Schumann fantasie. The very best pianists and composers do, which enhances both their understanding of music and their ability to perform and compose it properly.

** Some spells are tied to emotions (happiness for Patronus, desire to cause pain for Crucio). I have no idea what kind of training one would need to do in order to be able to call up an emotion on demand, but it might be interesting.

How about precise pronunciation and wand movements? The requirement for the former is something I've never encountered in a fic, but it would be interesting to read about students who have trouble with pronouncing Latin correctly, and have to do various exercises. Or how certain kids have an easier time because they did singing or whatever during childhood. Of course, it wouldn't matter as much when they start learning nonverbal casting, but the wand movements would stay the same.

The most powerful spells could have complex wand movements, and making a mistake could have dire consequences. The strongest wizards would be able to perform the "somatic component" extremely fast without losing any accuracy. They would also be more efficient in their gestures, e.g. if a spell calls for a circle, a more experienced wizard would draw a very small one, thus being faster (as well as concealing the spell they're casting from their opponent).

** The first thing that comes to mind is simple practice and dexterity, like that of a piano player or guitarist.

There are several songs, I /could/ play on a piano, but I will never play Carnegie hall.

I think the problem with that in most fictions would be that it simply takes time and practice, and some people will be better than other.

For example, there is a girl on youtube who doesn't have any arms, she can write with her feet, but she's not going to win very many duels if she's at hogwarts.

** Treat the wand as requiring training as well. The spell's verbal component becomes less of an issue the closer that wizard and wand come to an understanding. Thankfully wands have a standard language to go along with the 'taste' of a caster's intent. In this interpretation, the wand is trained almost like a hunting hound.
