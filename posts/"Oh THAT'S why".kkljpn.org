Ever since meeting Padfoot and learning about the Marauder's and Animagi, Harry Potter was curious about why Voldemort and Dumbledore wouldn't learn or use such an obviously useful ability.

Since he had no way of finding out, he let it be. That changed the night of the battle, when he saw Snape's memories. For some unknown reason, seeming completely out of character for him, he had included memories of seeing both Voldemort's and Dumbledore's animagus transformations.

When Harry exited the pensieve, he broke down laughing. Of course they wouldn't use those forms! Everyone would have just broken down laughing. God that would've been so embarrassing for them.

"Oh THAT'S why"

​

/l leave it up to your imagination to decide what the forms were./


** Voldemort's is Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest snake which is worm sized. Dumbledore 's is a chicken, a bright red chicken since magical forms aren't a thing. I would love to see this

*** I'd imagine being such a tiny snake would be useful for getting information, and so long as no one knows it's you there's no embarrassment. And even then for anyone without Vold's ego it wouldn't be embarrassing if people knew---because you've got valuable information from using your animagus---and also you can torture them.

*** Are magical forms really not a thing? I thought they were just ultra rare. It was implied somewhere that your patronus was likely to also be your animagus form, and Dumbledore's is a phoenix so I just kind of figured that's what his would have been.

***** I am not sure we are specifically told that phoenixes live forever, just that nobody knows much about them and nobody has witnessed them die permanently. Also you can have the animals as an animagus form, but not have all the abilities or have them at full strength. That could be an interesting fanfic premise thought, Dumbledore rises again due to his bond with the phoenix after Snape kills him.

*** Not flamboyant enough? It's a seagull. If Albus could turn into a seagull, you'd know, because it'd swoop into meals while wearing a eye-melting scarf and start dancing on the high table. Seagulls are utterly silly-looking birds, and Albus would be /all/ over it.

And don't even get me started on animagus reverse mannerisms. Imagine Dumbledore unintentionally (and intentionally) imitating a seagull while in human form, at the most inappropriate times possible, then acting like nothing happened and wondering why people are acting strangely at such a serious time.
