At age 10 Tom Riddle and Harry Potter get body swapped, so Harry's mind ends up at Wool's Orphanage in 1936, and Tom's mind ends up at Privet Drive in 1990.


** Tom's skewed perspective from being raised in an orphanage in the 30s makes him think the Dursleys are treating him kindly.

*** Seriousely, even if that would not happen: He probably would feel like having a better life living in a cupboard but getting decent food and even meat every freaking day (because the Dursleys never starved Harry, though he got less to eat than he wanted), and having to deal with only one annoying kid at the place he lived at. It is probably a lot easier to scare three people to let you do what you want than a whole orphanage, too.

** I'd enjoy seeing Tom intimidating the Dursleys into submission.
