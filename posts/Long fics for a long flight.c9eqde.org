Romance is OK, but it shouldn't be the main point of the fic.

It should have intelligent main characters and preferably lots of focus on either the magic system or politics, but no Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Peverrel-Gaunt-Asshat, please!

That is all. Thanks!


** I'm also interested, I'm having my first-ever long flight (i.e. more than six hours) tomorrow!

Edit: Probably I'll reread this linkffn(3669186), I only read it once, some eight years ago, and loved it, so I recommend it to the OP. It's the saga of the Malfoy family (canon compliant through DH), and if you want a complete story, you can just stop reading after Voldemort's defeat.

** The longest fic I can recall is the linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). This work is arguably the only good "Voldemort won the First War" AU out there, but everything fits with your request. It really gets interesting as it goes, but try not to stop for a long period of time as the different plot lines can be difficult to keep together. But the draw of this fic is the depth of characterization, particularly of Harry, Voldemort, and Snape who stand head and shoulders over their characters in 99% of fics.

Additionally, I would throw in linkffn(Delenda Est) as well. A wierd time-travel/dimension hopper (with /some/ Harry/Bellatrix romance that is not really the focus so much as a driver), this fic generally fits with your description as well. The magic is...not that inventive much of the time, but there is a lot of material there for exploration.

*** I suppose that depends on how you count it. If you include offshoots that are in the same timeline, then linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler]]) and it's trilogy and offshoots take the cake.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12049856/1/Further-Adventures-of-the-Lone-Traveler]]) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12168828/1/Harry-Potter-Lone-Traveler-God-and-Wizard]]) and I'm â€˜not' going to link All the offshoots.

But if you just count one fic as a story, then Pokemon's Ashes Of The Past is the longest I've read.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  It's finally happened: The Lone Traveler became a God. With the Divine name Marek Ilumian, Patron God of Free Will, Minor God of Knowledge and Travel, sometimes he goes over the top. But he's all about giving people a choice - or at least the opportunity to Choose. And having fun, of course. And Pie. Lots of Pie. Completed but I've added more.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** linkao3(proof by novensides) is probably too short right? The rough opposite of aristocracy is a democracy, right? linkffn(13072492) And of course, linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) has Lord Potter, but it is rather tame, more like local town councillor, certainly not Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Peverrel-Gaunt-Asshat, and it is long enough for the longest flight.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** Linkao3(The Debt of Time)

I would say that while romance is one main focus of this fic it is also very much about friendships and includes memorable characters, some politics and lots of humor and feels. You'll know within five chapters if you're gonna like it although it does get better as you read on.
