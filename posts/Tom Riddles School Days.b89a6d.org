Tom Riddles School days is down, I uploaded a zip containing the four books in mobi.

​

This could potentially be against rule 6 but I don't think so, it looks like their web hosting just ran out.

​

From TVTropes:

​

Tom Riddle's Schooldays is an ongoing fanfiction set in the Harry Potter universe, about [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin][Tom Riddle jr.'s time as a student at Hogwarts]]. Of seven planned installments, the first four, "Year 1: Silver Blood", "Year 2: Fathomless Fears", "Year 3: Masquerade" and "Year 4: Serpens Sub Rosa" [are available to read]

​

I haven't actually read it myself but it's got many rave reviews, and I want to have a Voldemort POV in my next fic so I want it as a source for getting into his head.

*** I dropped it a few chapters in because the punctuation was bananas.

#+begin_quote
  “What do you want to do?”, asked Tom.

  “I don't know”, came the reply.

  “Do you even like her?”

  “I don't know that either”, said Tiernan, measuredly.

  “Forget about it, then”, advised Tom.
#+end_quote

The author puts dialogue commas /after/ the quotation mark, puts them in the wrong place, or is missing them when they're needed. I checked Year 3, and the author still keeps doing it.

The writing is okay, but I wasn't invested in any of the characters, most of which are OC's. None of them really stand on their own; I only read them for their association with Tom, instead of liking them for themselves. Imho, there are better fics with child Tom Riddle out there.

**** Well, thanks for the review then. Do you like any fics with a similar canonical-style imagining for kid Tom Riddle? I've only read the ones wbere someone goes back in time to try to fix him, but I'd love to see one where he stays in character.
