  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

**** I was surprised how much I really enjoyed the OCs in this fic, even though I usually don't care for them in a HP story. It actually made me invested in Ron, which is an achievement in itself. It's ultimately a much more optimistic story than most, makes you feel good about humanity (even Lucius Malfoy lol). The world-building is pretty good and it goes far beyond just "Gordon Ramsey".

**** For sure , and I didn't really care for it once it got to the point of "internal thoughs literally every character"

Most "different teacher" stories work best as one-shots, since they don't overstay their welcome. I found the Stephen Colbert fanfic hilarious when I first read it, but I don't think I would've enjoyed it if it dragged on further.

*** Good premise, but the author lost me when he/she started to include the internal thoughts of the side characters, dedicating a whole chapter for each of them. Almost all of those chapters are the same, with very little useful information. It's simply bloated.

Probably would be better if he/she could introduce those characters via their interaction with Ron instead of hopping around in their heads like that.

  Snape's away on a 'special mission' from the headmaster. When the seventh year Gryffindors take their first potions lesson with his substitute, word of a Potions Master with a pedigree for insults far worse than Snape's passes through the school. Who is this Master of the Cauldron? Gordon Ramsay, Devil of Hell's Cauldron.
