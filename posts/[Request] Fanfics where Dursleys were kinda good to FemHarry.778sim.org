I can't seem to remember, but there was a fic where male Dursleys were protective of Harry cause she were a girl. Anyone know?

  A female Harry Potter with parental looks flipped is treated differently by the Dursleys. Are the changes immediately obvious? No. But they will affect the entire course of the story. Fem Harry. AU Childhood. Light!Powerful!Harry. Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter. Tom Riddle/Harry Potter. Beauty and the Beast esque. Slytherins compete over a girl.
