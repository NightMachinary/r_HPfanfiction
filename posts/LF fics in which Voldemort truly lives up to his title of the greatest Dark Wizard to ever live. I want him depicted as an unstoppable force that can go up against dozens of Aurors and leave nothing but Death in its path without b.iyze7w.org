But yeah. I too appreciate fics where Voldy and the DE's are actually fearsome instead of people who just rely on 3 curses and that they are actually pretty easy to combat ‘if only you have the correct attitude'.

I kinda hesitate to mention because Voldemort spends a large chunk of the fic absent. It's mainly Harry's training to be a paladin. But once Voldemort returns, holy shit. Featuring D&D style lich Voldemort and Harry riding Buckbeak into battle wielding the Sword of Gryffindor.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

- Trio centric with a great Ron
- Dumbledore is awesome, but Voldemort is in a league of his own
- [[/spoiler][Lucius and Narcissa are killed off very early on]]
- Lots of political intrigues and maneuvering, lots of Wizengamot and Ministry scenes

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
