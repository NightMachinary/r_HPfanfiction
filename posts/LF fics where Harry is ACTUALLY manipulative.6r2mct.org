Every so called manipulative Harry fic I've ever read has just had Harry be in Slytherin and had him be skilled. I can't remember ever reading a fic where Harry legitimately manipulates the people around him or the wizarding world. So could you guys recommend some well written fics where Harry is this intelligent puppet master who controls people and arranges situations to occur.


** Well... Not exactly what you want, but this IS manipulative... In a way.

** I'd like to see a story where Harry isn't evil or ammoral, rather he subtly manipulates/angles people in a way that benefits him. Like, during those moments he can be the good guy and tell the truth or tell a selfish lie, he goes with the later.

Also, Dreams and Darkness Collide definitely has manipulative Harry, but he's a serial killer and it's a Tom Riddle/Harry Potter fic. Slow-burn, sure, but slash nonetheless.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener]])

Harry's pretty darn manipulative in this one (with a little help from his girlfriend Daphne). The first five-and-a-half chapters are the best ones, but the story does tend to drone on and on, although not as badly as /some/ fics I've seen. Dumbledore gets semi-bashed; Snape, Ron, and Molly receive a more thorough bashing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6731545/1/You-Can-Have-it-All-Revised]])

Even more manipulative in this one, and I think pretty much everyone gets bashed to some degree. [[/spoiler][Also, Luna gets eaten by a lion.]]

**** It's a little throw-away line toward the end, too - not even a particularly major plot point. This author is clearly a skilled writer, but I do have one big complaint about their work in that they just seem to enjoy randomly inflicting pain on any and every character they can think of.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
