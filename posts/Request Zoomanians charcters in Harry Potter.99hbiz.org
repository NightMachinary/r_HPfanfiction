Do you know a fic where Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde attend Hogwarts? Thanks in advance


** ...Zoomanians? You've probably got yourself mixed up with a foreign dub. It was Zootopia in the United States of America, and Zootropolis in the United Kingdom, but never Zoomanian.

*** Zootopia was called Zoomania in the German release.

I checked OP's profile and their second most active subreddit is [[/r/de]], so I would assume that they are German.

*** ...Why change the name for the UK version? I assume they know what 'topia' means over there.

**** Because of legal reasons. It's not so much about Disney thinking the British are dumb as it is about Disney wanting to make a lot of money in Britain without getting sued.

Zootopia was already trademarked in Europe before the movie was even developed. So in a large portion of Europe they changed the name to Zootropolis. However, in Germany the name was instead changed to Zoomania because Zootropolis was also trademarked in that country.
