I'm not sure about much, but I remember one scene:

It's post-CoS, and Ginny's family are all walking on eggshells around her after the chamber fiasco last year, which annoys her. They are shopping in Diagon Alley.

Harry goes in and to the shock of all Weasleys gifts her a diary, which she thanks him for.


** Maybe linkffn(Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)?

Definitely sounds familiar though.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  What are you looking for?

  Found it!

  "Hey Ginny!" Harry called out from the upstairs pagoda floor of Flourish and Blotts. "What do you think of this diary?"

  The talkative Weasleys in the store fell silent once again, identical shell-shocked expression on their face.

  "W-What?"

  "This diary," Harry said, waving his hand back and forth, holding a diary. "It's nice and white, and has lots of little flowers over it. Do you like stuff like that?

  "H-Harry, stop that immediately," Molly stammered trying to get him to put the diary away, but Harry kept waving it around.

  "White and flowery, that's what you like right?"

  /Just like that dress you made me wear, right?/

  Ginny couldn't help it. She burst into laughter. Her family watched her, looks of horror still cast across their faces. Harry continued to smile at her cheerfully, waving the diary back and forth while Ginny was on her knees, clutching her sides as the laughter caused her stomach to ache.

Funnily enough I just recommended that fic myself [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5xozzu/lf_good_soulbondsoulmate_aus/dejswmw/][a few days ago]], however I totally forgot that this scene was from this fic.
