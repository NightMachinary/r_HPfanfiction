In the last couple of months I've read 'The Changeling' series, all of Northumbrian's stuff, and recently just got to the (WIP) end of "Grow Young with Me"

Honestly, I didn't think I would enjoy any of them before I started reading them, but am very glad I did.

So now I'm on the lookout for more well-written stories with a perspective from an original character (or from a different HP canon character) that has a great story which probably doesn't deal with Voldemort or the school years. I find myself really enjoying the years immediately following the end of canon, especially Realistic takes on how people deal with life in the aftermath.

Suggestions? Quality has to be top notch, and it needs to be unique/original. I'm getting spoiled with all the great fanfiction out there!

Thanks!


** Hmm. Changeling had some interesting plot points, but I eventually got bored with it. I think it was around the time Ginny had learned Occlumency successfully, but hadn't got far with Legilimency and didn't want to.

I did quite like Grow Young With Me though. Hopefully that one will continue. What did Northumbrian write?

*** Northumbrian's most popular/well-known story is 'The Strangers of Drakeshaugh' which I read and enjoyed enough to warrant reading all the rest of their stuff in the same universe.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

** Linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) doesn't fit exactly, as it's a school days thing during canon, but it's about a cast of well-written OC Slytherins which has a longer post-canon sequel if you happen to enjoy them.

You might like my linkffn(13098062). Post-canon, OC characters who are competent adults pitted against an ancient witch. I'll be updating it tomorrow.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  Bloody revenge is a tale old as humanity, an ever-spinning grindstone bound for another turn. Morrigan awaited hers for a thousand sleepless, deathless years, but she waits no longer. Pyrrha Clay is her mortal enemy, her liberator, and she flies from the reckoning with nothing left but what she carries; in her heart burns the same ruinous fire which fuels the cycle.

** More of a quick one shot, but it's from tonks' perspective and takes place after it all. Author has expressed interest in expanding it into a longer story, but nothing has happened yet.

  "Without meaning to, Harry Potter was a heartbreaker." This is a bittersweet little ficlet, hatched from a weary mind and heart. AU One-sided HarryxTonks.
