I've read a few where Hermione goes back in time and teaches DADA and I like some of the descriptions of how she approaches teaching.

I also vaguely remember reading one where she goes back in time and teaches a younger trio divination.

Time travel is not necessary but the teaching perspective is

Thanks!

  Complete. The last four chapters were rewritten. Aftermath. The apprentices stuggle to rebuild their lives. The Summer of Choices may be over but life is just beginning for The Four Apprentices.
