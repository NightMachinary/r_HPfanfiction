I read a HP fanfic, on fanfiction most likely, but I don't remember the name nor is google search. It was something along the lines that Harry did not know about the existence of magic and was 17 and also worked. Remus then somehow finds finds him and tells him all about the wizarding world. I'm not sure but I think he still lived with Uncle Vernon. There is no bashing other than Dursley I think. Its been too long since I read it so I'm not sure.Can someone help ??


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] - Harry works and is 17. He dosen't know about magic until Hermione and Co. find him; later on in the story Remus appears. This might not be what you're looking for but it's a good read!

Thanks! It's not what I was looking for, as Remus is the one who finds him and Sirius is free but a good read
