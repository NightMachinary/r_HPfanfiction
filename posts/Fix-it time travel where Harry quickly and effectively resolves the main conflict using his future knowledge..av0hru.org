Are there any stories where Harry (or Hermione) end up back in 91/4/5/6 and resolve the plot within, let's say a week?

You might be wondering where the conflict and drama would be, and the answer is really simple. There is none. The beauty of such a fic would be watching the flawless execution of a well made plan (and preferably the Death Eaters). Arrive on Monday, get everything done before Friday so you can enjoy the weekend without worrying about racial purges or undying mass murderers.

No M/M or Death Eater whitewashing, preferably no bashing or Weasley wank.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is the top fic in this case, but you should have read it already.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), the primary threat was being dealt with efficiently and quickly, but there's a second part to the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting the Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]], linkffn(8854828), is a total bash of Dumbledore's "second chances" philosophy. The time traveling Harry not only killed off the future, but massacred his enemies within a week upon his return without taking out Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]], linkffn(6256154), should hold the record in how fast (12 hours) Harry dispatched Voldemort. While the action scenes are entertaining, I think his course of actions is very stupid: his time travels to 12 hours before Voldemort's graveyard resurrection, but instead of raiding Voldemort's weak homunculus form in Riddle Manor, a fact Harry knew, he resorted to storm heavily warded places such as Malfoy Manor and Azkaban. There is really no need to get all Horcruxes at all before facing off Voldemort, he just had to capture Voldemort, obliviate him back to infancy, dose it with Draught of Living Death, and deliver Voldemort to Dumbledore along with necessary information. Much easier, and much safer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), has Harry dealing with them in two phases. One happened before the school even began as he trapped Voldemort's soul in an object, and the second happened after Year 5 when he killed hundreds of blood purists within a few days. Hermione found out and wasn't happy for a long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(4740107;7405516), are all examples of finishing them off efficiently and quickly, but they have heavy Weasley involvements.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455), is time travel all the way to 1930s. It's the only fic I know in which Hermione killed Tom in the orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. Unfortunately, there is not a lot you can write if things resolve that easily.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), resolves the conflict very quickly too, but requires a super Harry who could take on Voldemort one an one.

*** I really like your idea for how to dela with Voldy- do you have any fic that does that? I mena, obliviating the guy and giving him to Dumbledore with the right information is great.

â€‹

and I disagree with the assumption that dispaching Voldy that fast would kill the drama- The Death Eaters would still be there and the fight against magical racism surely was not over. Another Dark Lord-Lady surely would arise- and I would like to see ideas for it.

**** The only other fic I know in which Voldemort was neutralized through Obliviation is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363).

Since Voldemort was so fond of using Cruciatus, we need a fic in which he got crucioed into insanity, not to the level of his canon insanity where he still has super powers, but to the level of Longbottoms where he completely loses all his powers and reasoning abilities. As far as his wraith form is concerned, it seems to keep the mental state he was last in. Therefore, even if his wraith manages to escape the body, it will remain a confused and harmless spirit for all eternity.

That's another fate this total piece of shit deserves.

** So, this made two fics come to mind for me.

The first, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child to Lead Them]] by White Squirrel is Hermione-centric. Rather than going back to 1991, she goes back to 1981 and has to be taken seriously as a toddler in order to stave off The Bad Things. It's short (30k words) and I quite enjoyed it.

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]] by timunderwood9. There's a lot more, well, planning that goes into Harry's fix-it plan, but when he decides to pull the trigger, oh boy, he certainly takes care of business. Hermione serves as the narrator for most of the story, which if actually a really great way of writing a time-traveler fic - we get to see how the non-time travelers react to his actions. I really liked it. It's also rather short (40k words).

Both of these stories are Harry/Hermione, so if that's a deal breaker for you, oh well. But if you like the parring, or if you're simply not bothered by it, these are quite the treat.

** linkffn(13052216) does a good bit of this. It's a gamer fic, ends a little abruptly, and has some of MistofRainbows' standard... kinks (stays below PG-13ish this time though), but otherwise is pretty good.

** Just remembered another one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]] by Madm05. Hermione goes back in time to the 70's and interacts with James and co. It's from Jame's point of view and continues on after Hermione manages to curb-stomp Voldie. It's a bit more Romance centered than the others I recommended, being both HHr and JP/LE. 25k words.

He returns at the end of DoM and immediately starts ordering people around. Neville (clueless at that point) gets a lot of responsibilities because in Harry's future he is equal in strength to Harry.
