Just there isn't much enjoyment in reading Harry Potter fanfictions, idk why, I have no problem reading other types of fanfictions. I think it's just that the stories haven't gotten any better for me. I'm exhausted of reading the same tropes and in-complete fics. If you could recommend any that don't follow the same tropes as most, please do. No Drarry, Hinny, or Snarry


** I felt that way for a while, like a long while and what I did was simple but very helpful. So I went through fanfic.net and put in all my filters blah, blah and I found all the incomplete and complete stories I found cool and saved them. That's it so now I already have like some 47 fics saved that I can read whenever I want because their all in progress so I would recommend doing that just look at tags etc save the ones that look good so you have a cherry picked list then leave them somewhere and once you finally get a hankering bam fics for days.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** My primary fic linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance) is pretty far from the standard tropes. Besides generic things like 'no bashing', 'good action scenes', 'a good beta to edit stuff', 'nod and a wink at the idea of pre-teens being politicians', here are some more things that make it different:

- Ravenclaw!Harry

- When people die, it's actually traumatic and fucks up the survivors

- Exploration of different settings/magic (America, Iraq, Italy, with Sumerian mythology, magical mafias, Native American shamanism)

- Different groups are interested in different things; the world doesn't revolve around what happens in a school

- Diverges from canon when Harry is 9 years old, so doesn't rehash the books. Some things in Year 1 and 2 are familiar (for example - Quirrell has Voldemort in his head, and Ginny gets the Diary), but after Second Year it's a completely new plotline, including some things I've never seen in HP fanfics before.

- It's about 330K words right now, and the next chapter is the last one.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
