It was sixth year, I believe. She follows this floating light all the way past the trapdoor, past where the Mirror of Erised was, and even deeper. She sees some freaky shit and runs out, goes to Neville, terrified out of her mind, and he goes to Harry about it.

I don't remember much else from the story.

I seem to recall it had something like that going on somewhere but I don't think it went anywhere because the fic died.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
