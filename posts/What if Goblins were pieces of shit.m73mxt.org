:FlairText: Request for a fic
:END:
So, we've all read fics where Harry goes to Gringotts and gets the most comprehensive medical assessment of all time, including the removal of a horcrux, normally with a healthy amount of goblin anti-Dumbledore propaganda. But what if that wasn't the case? What if the goblins literally didn't give a shit? Who ever gave them what they wanted was who they would side with. Has anyone read or written a fic where the goblins(or gnomes, dwarves, and other magical bankers) didn't become a comprehensive magical hospital which can do something literal Dumbledore couldn't do?

I'm not trying to flame these fics, because I enjoy them as a guilty pleasure, but I want to read something different.


** Oh yes. We goblins have the best medical services available in wizarding Britain.

Oh by the way.

That's a galleon per minute.

And an additional six galleons an hour.

Plus thirty galleons per spell we use.

Plus another fifteen per minute each spell is active.

Plus a thousand galleons per thing we tell you.

Plus a hundred galleons per thing we explain.

Plus an additional hundred thousand for actually fixing you.

You thought medical was free? No. We took notes from our branch in the U.S.A. They're making a killing on medical bills.

Oh, that'll be a hundred galleons.

We /did/ explain why it's so expensive.

**** For some reason, I now want to find a crack fic where an SI tries to get the Indy! Harry treatment by remembering a goblin's name, but they don't remember the name:

"Skullcrusher!"

"No"

"Bonebreaker!"

"No"

"Ribsmasher"

"no"

"Bloodtaster!"

"No"

**** Nah, that singular galleon is simply a tip. As only if you can match a goblin warrior in battle, in a loincloth, to the death, may you get a slight discount of 1% with the caviat of gaining a 150% addition to the taxes taken from your account every month.

My goblins are honorable, they won't lie to you, their even borderline helpful. But above all, unless you got the gold, you ain't getting a damn thing.

Although they do spare one hour on every Monday morning to assist the poverty stricken with account management. Said hour changes every week. Without a warning. Never said they were good people, just honorable about their deals. Because they'll follow a contract to the letter.

****** I was reading a fic today, where Harry is confused by marriage contracts in fanfics, because two other parties sign them but he still is the one who loses his magic if he doesn't comply. He ends up signing a contract with Ron where Hermione has to do all their work or else she loses her magic to demonstrate how stupid this is.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** I like goblins in the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][“Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly”]] (especially later volumes). They are not the main characters, they are neither clearly bad or good, but they are very ominous and, to use terminology from C. S. Lewis “The Last Battle”, they are very non-tame and unsafe. And they create [[https://www.deviantart.com/burke5/art/mole-cricket-323213407][this pretty]] cricket tattoo.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] has a very fun episode about Goblins, not seen anywhere in other fics.

Grindelwald deals with uncooperative Goblins in his own way in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]].

Goblins are scums in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]].
