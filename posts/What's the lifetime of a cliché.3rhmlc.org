I mean, we've had more than enough threads bitching about pet peeves or clichés or whatnot.

But at this point I'm wondering: is there or can there be a point where a cliché will become so reviled its popularity sinks for a while? Can old clichés be revived and recycled by good fanfics?

How do clichés form, anyway?


** Any cliche can be done well, it simply depends on the author. The problem with most cliches is that they're easy plot points for amateur authors to focus on. So, many first time fanfic authors see a story with a cliche and think, well I could do this differently and end up writing a badly written fic, with poor grammar, poor planning, and mostly just written off the top of their heads.

Cliches can be good, they just need a good writer.

** I think Ruskbyte created a lot of clichés with his Super!Harry fics linkffn(826742). They have everything from multiple animagus forms to magical cores, along with about every other Super!Harry cliché.

Those fics were /insanely/ popular and basically created that trope. Then there were a ton of copycats. And now those clichés are part of fanon for Super!Harry.

Other than that I'm pretty sure most old tropes were born in some way or another in LiveJournal.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

  We watched as Harry battled for his life against the Riddle in the diary, and then as Ron stood off against the piece of Riddle in the locket. But how did Hermione do? Did the most innocent-looking of the horcruxes in fact be one of the most dangerous?

** The Ice Queen cliche is probably close to 10 years old now, yet somehow people keep using that shit. It was /never/ good, but it's gotten to the point of being so reviled that I literally can't read a story that uses it.

I don't know if they can be revived, as some cliches such as magical trunks and superwands are better left dead, but that hasn't stopped people from trying to take them and do them "proper" such as in linkffn(10210053), which ends up being mostly enjoyable, if a bit tedious at times. You can dress them up however you want but it doesn't change the fact that it's still cliche. Then, we got new fics like linkffn(11446957) that don't even pretend to be doing them "proper" yet are someone still super popular (I'm not sure why).

*** Well, as someone who has read A Cadmean Victory, I can tell you why its super popular. The cliches, while annoying, aren't over-the-top, and the plot isn't driven by them. The author does a really good job world-building. It's unique and well-written enough and a really feel-good romance. Harry (the author) is clever in solving his problems, and the few canon plot events that stay in the story are told with a different spin on them. Lastly, and probably most importantly, the author updates at an insane rate.

We have a distinct lack of really well written romance stories in fanfiction, where authors actually take their time and are patient and experienced enough to write believable scenes.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.
