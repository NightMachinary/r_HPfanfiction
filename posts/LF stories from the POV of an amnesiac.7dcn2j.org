Are there any stories where Harry, or whoever, has amnesia, maybe doesn't even remembers he's a wizard, and has to slowly piece together what is going on without knowing who to trust?

It would be cool if the story or world or characters were drastically different from canon, so not even the readers /really/ know who to trust.

Example: Voldemort finds an amnesiac Harry and convinces his he's the good guy, but what if in this world, Voldy /is/ the good guy?

or something.


** There was a nice thriller I read where Voldemort begins to influence Harry through his scar. Blocking out memories and sending him hallucianations as a form of psychological torture.

Great fic that made you really qestion as the reader what was real and what wasn't.

That said, I forgot the name :'(

** Well, in linkffn(you're my density by robst), Harry was exiled and obliviated after Voldemort's return (because the Ministry wanted to shut him up), Hermione finds him years later and explains, and they do a time travel ritual that dumps them in the bathroom with the troll. Harry's amnesia is attributed to damage from the troll. I know people around here hate Robst, but his newer stuff is improving, and this is the newest complete one.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.
