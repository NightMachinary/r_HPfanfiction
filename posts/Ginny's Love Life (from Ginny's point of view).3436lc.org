*** I can't read it either (I keep losing my place) but it does give it a very stream of consciousness vibe that makes me think that Ginny is strung out on a sugar high the entire time.

... the line breaks should be whenever someone else talks, thus interrupting Ginny's thinking.

***** Its not the writing. It's the lack of line breaks. Edit those in and it would be much more readable.

A

B

C

instead of ABC

You have to hit enter twice to get a line break. The bottom right hand corner of the box has a 'formatting help' button. There is nothing wrong with the writing itself that I noticed.
