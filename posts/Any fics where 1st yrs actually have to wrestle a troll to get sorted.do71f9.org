Back in book one there was a line - Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll." - Are there any fics out there where this is a thing?

Since it has been stuck in my head for days now i've got an idea of how it would go in order to make it work for sorting purposes i'm thinking it would have to be something like McGonagall leads them to a room just off the great hall and says they need to get past a troll to be admitted as students.

The Gryffindors would probably volunteer to try first or go one at a time maybe following the advice or jeers of others.

Hufflepuffs would maybe try attacking in a group, dragging away the wounded students, or fetching things for the Ravenclaws.

Ravenclaws would maybe ask for clarification on the rules, relevant texts, see if the professor has any advice.

Slytherins would just sneak out of the room while everyone else was busy and go through the main doors into the great hall, either because they got told by family members (thus enforcing the mostly pure blood thing in slytherin) or they saw others doing so and figured it out.

I could imagine Draco dragging along Crabbe and Goyle for instance.\\
Hermione getting into Gryffindor because even if she looked up some spell or whatever she felt she had something to prove and the professor said they had to.\\
Neville might get into Gryffindor even if he thought himself to be worthless just because his gran told him his father did and he had to do the same.\\
Luna could be Ravenclaw because she sat in the back reading the Quibbler and just went with the Ravenclaw crowd causing animosity etc etc.


** Dumbledore: "This is The Hat, our troll. Note the mask - The Hat is a student of the luchadore tradition of wrestling, so you can expect more grandstanding than a classical-"

Hermione: "Excuse me, Professor, but I am quite sure that the House Sorting ceremony involved a Sorting Hat, not a... colorfully-dressed troll."

Dumbledore: "Oh, The Hat will Sort you out, all right."

  The boy from the train was right. In order to be Sorted, they really did have to fight a troll.

  They'd all do different things based on which House they'll go into

They're 11, and pretty much none of them would know a lick of magic. I imagine that they'd all shit their pants and run away screaming.

  Every magical school has its specialties. Beauxbatons is known for potions and alchemy, Dumstrang for the study of dark magic. But Hogwarts? They produce duelists. Scratch that, as the world will see in the upcoming tournament... Hogwarts produces monsters...
