Than possibly he is killed by his mother, because no son of hers will get expelled from Hogwarts. But that's optional.


** Sirius' parents congratulate him for trying to kill a 'halfblood with muggleborn sympathies' (because Lily) and just send him on his merry way to Durmstrang to continue his education.

*** "Son, I had my doubts in you, you know," Orion said as he placed his hand on Sirius' shoulder. "Getting sorted into Gryffindor, making the wrong friends, your inadequate marks. Not even in my wildest dreams, I imagined that it was all an elaborate ruse, to cleanse Slytherin from a traitor amongst our ranks, to purge the werewolf from Hogwarts. I have never been so proud of you."

Sirius just stared at his father, his mouth wide agape. He hadn't wanted to hurt Remus, and he never thought that Snivellius would be stupid enough to charge a werewolf with a magical camera of all things. And now his family was proud of him. Him, who despised the whole lot and had wanted nothing more than to run away once he got the opportunity. But then it got worse.

"You know, your talent needs to be honed. This was already beyond impressive. You will need a witch at your side who can help you with that. I had already given up hope on this endeavour, but since you have proven your worth as my heir, this is clearly the right choice. You will need someone with unquestionable loyalty and there is only one possible choice. Therefore, I have drawn up a marriage contract with your cousin Bellatrix. I had hoped to gain the favour of Augustus Lestrange, but - "

It was at that point when Sirius fainted, desperately hoping to wake up from this hellish nightmare.

** Walburga decides that Hogwarts is run by degenerates, and she will homeschool Sirius herself, with the help of former headmaster Phineas Nigellus.

Purebloods don't like Hogwarts, it's canon. In the annotated Beedle the Bard anthology novel (sidestories written by JKR, like the Quidditch Through the Ages charity novel), Lucius Malfoy tried to use his influence to get books removed out of the Hogwarts library for being too "pro muggle", One of the books was "The fountain of fair fortune", because it had a witch marry a muggle knight.

And thus, Sirius never gets a chance to run away from home at 16 to live with James.

**** Beedle the Bard, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the original mini textbook, not the movie franchise), and Quidditch Through the Ages are published novellas written by JKR that tie directly into canon.

Even if you don't think they're on the same level of the original 7 books, they're still on a level separate from JKR's Pottermore essays, and all of those are a level above JKR's DVD commentary, interviews, and Twitter posts.

Cursed Child, of course, is in the ninth level of Hell where it belongs.

****** It's a reference to Dante's Inferno.

Dante interpreted Hell as having many levels, with each level being increasingly worse, as appropriate for the sinners that resided there.

The ninth level of Hell was reserved for traitors--Lucifer resided there with Judas Iscariot and Brutus.

** James exasperatedly explains to Dumbledore that Sirius didn't actually trap Snape in a room with Lupin and Dumbledore goes "Wait, what? All Sirius did was tell him where Lupin was going to be while knowing full well that whatever it was was intensely private? I assumed from the way you guys were acting he had any culpability whatsoever. Weird." Hogwarts rolls its collective eyes at Snivellus and goes on with their days.

**** What Sirius did was kinda a dick move towards Lupin, who most likely would have been killed if he tore apart Snape. At the same time, Snape is fully responsible for what he did because all that Sirius did was to tell him how to get past that tree. Snape was at least suspecting that Lupin was a werewolf and still went after him on a full moon.

*** Eeeeh.. I don't know. It really depends on how Sirius told Severus about it.

In case of on actual infection, the two people expelled would probably have been Snape and Lupin. But what Sirius did was still pretty messed up even if he's not completely responsible for the consequences.

*** Given how Severus usually seems to function at the time, I don't think he would be moronic enough to go into the "totally not a trap" tunnel unless he was strongly encouraged to. I've seen 2 common ways this is done:

- Sirius arranges for Severus to overhear the means of getting inside, where they have "secret stuff" or something akin to that.
- Sirius either tells Snape directly, or arranges him to overhear like above, something putting Lily in danger at the location.

I don't think Severus knew Remus was there -- he probably suspected that Remus was a werewolf but he didn't go there to implicate him.

I once read a fic where Severus got information about the Shack by feeding Sirius Veritaserum. While I don't think that's how it happened (I honestly think it was one of the above ways, I see it as more likely), it's easily my favourite version of the incident -- because it manages to entirely justify Dumbledore's reaction without making Snape look like an utter moron, and is entirely plausible to boot.

** As strange as it sounds, but sirius is probably the one you could least likely legally charge with this.

Remus was the werewolf that put someone in danger.

Dumbledore and the other teachers that knew let him stay and transform so close to people.

Snape actively went and broke into a werewolf lair and not only put himself at risk, but risk letting him out of his save cage.

James did pretty much the same thing, only that he could probably could get away with it, because his goal was to prevent anything of happening and locking the werewolf back up.

Sirius 'just shared' some information how to get past the tree and the rest was up to Snape

** I think Walburga would approve fully of his actions and homeschool him, or put him somewhere else (Durmstrang?).

Sirius, of course, would be horrified by the premise of his parents being /proud/ of him given how he thinks of the rest of his family.

FWIW, while I loathe the way Dumbledore handled the situation (Giving Sirius a slap on the wrist and forcing a traumatized bully victim into silence? Really? And people wonder why he turned out the way he did...), I don't think Sirius ever intended any actual harm to come to Severus, he was merely being his usual rash self.

Who was friends with the local branch of the magical Hitler youth and tried to kill James during the worst memory. Imagine if that spell was two inches to the side and cut through James' skull rather than nick his cheek. We saw how effective that spell was when Harry used it for the first time, now think of how proficient the inventor would be.

** If he got expelled, lupin would also be punished. It might not be directly his fault. But, with how the magical people see werewolves, his treatment would be equivalent to how people see a mad dog. At worst, the Ministry would have to "put him down".
