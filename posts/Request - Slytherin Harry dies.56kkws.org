I would like to read a story where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and all the death eater children try to take revenge by killing him. But, since he can only die by Voldemort's hand, he keeps on coming back to life. Any suggestions?


** That sounds like it could be a pretty funny crackfic. Like Harry keeps drinking poison and getting cursed and the Death Eater kids are freaking out because nothing is working. So they decide Harry is a powerful Dark Lord himself and is just messing with them for his amusement.

*** Made "King of Snakes" because he's immune to poison. I like it.
