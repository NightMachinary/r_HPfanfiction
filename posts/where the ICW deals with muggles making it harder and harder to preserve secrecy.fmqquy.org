You used to be able to just take a piece of land, cover it with anti muggle charms, obliviate a few muggles to make them forget that it existed and it was yours. Later you had to spend months altering maps but it was still doable to hide a few square kilometers from muggles to build a new dragon reserve. Now with satellite imaging it's practically impossible and land hidden from muggles has become a very expensive commodity.

By now satellites can detect the gravity of landmasses so that hidden continent in the pacific had to be covered entirely with weak but precise anti-gravity charms.

WhiteSquirrels south pole rune circle, one of the most important pieces of magical infrastructure, sits right below the Amundsen-Scott research station and needs a major upgrade to avoid being detected by the cosmic neutrino experiment.

Dragon bones sometimes get confused for dinosaurs and need to be removed and records erased. The cloud backup too, don't make that mistake again.

Noticed me not charms all around the world need to be replaced with a newly developed version that also works on AI, because you don't want Tesla's autopilot to take people to the Leaky Cauldron.

And could someone please tell the goblins that they need to upgrade their tunnel protections against seismic imaging? We don't want an oil company drilling into one of our bank vaults.

Next on the agenda, a bill to increase the amount of mandatory obliviator funding to 5% GDP... The Americans are against having to raise taxes again, so this will probably not make it.

How is the climate changing prevention project going? Removing billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere is no easy task, even with magic. About a million galleons annually just to keep the artificial diamond sacrificing ritual sites maintained. If the muggles knew that without us they'd have it far worse than things are already...

It's the third in the series starting with /The Arithmancer/; after several disconnected chapters of "What Hermione Did With Her Life After the War," it gets into this plot arc starting in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001252/20/Annals-of-Arithmancy][chapter 20]].

*** +1 for this.

As a precaution: This is not Hermione/Ron bashing. This is what happens when Harry's priorities change and insecurities slowly go away. The Golden Trio are really all social outcasts. This goes away in time, but it really showcases both how annoying the Golden Trio really is AND how their relationship can get fractured.

Also, I lied, there is bashing. A shitload of muggle bashing. But let's face it, they deserve it.

** I like the idea of eventually Muggle governments establish a Men in Black-like organization whose task is to work with Obliviators to keep magic a secret from the world. I imagine there's a good few story ideas in that.

** Why do people think that unplottable locations could be discovered through satellite imaging? The whole point of the unplottable charm is to make an area unfindable and unmappable. Does magic care about what form your information is in, or how it is gathered? No. Does it have restrictions? no. A satellite sees the exact same thing a muggle sees, which is nothing. Even if it prints a map, or if it photographs it, the area doesn't show up, just like if you took a camera to space and photographed it. Muggle tech needs to he charmed to be able to percieve magic, because otherwise the statute would have broken when the first camera was invented.

Also, satellite imaging has been around for a while, and was certainly a thing when the books were written and take place, so I very much doubt that wizards as a whole are that ignorant. Purebloods, maybe, but the Unspeakables and the ICW must have people who work on these things, invent new concealing charms to counter muggle advances and such.

**** I don't see why it should be unable to affect a computer, really. Mental magic has an effect on animals as well, or muggle repellant charms would constantly be penetrated by the dogs people walk (trust me, if my dog suddenly vanished into the ether right next to me and his leash did something eldritch as my mind tried to comprehend where he is I'd have some questions). Kneazles for example are also affected by magic, and dementors can also feed on the emotions of animals.

A computer can be likened to a very simple, very logical and non-independent mind, which means that these charms would also have an effect on them.
