** Moldy taking Harry's blood made every day life a painful experience. It did make it easier to enter Harry's mind, but it was excruciating for him. I think he would still be barred from the house, else Dumbledore wouldn't have sent Harry back. If by some chance he did get there, he'd be at ground zero for his pain. It would probably cripple him for pain.
