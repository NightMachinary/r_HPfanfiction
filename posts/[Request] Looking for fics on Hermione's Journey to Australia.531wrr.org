I was inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/52u8p0/when_hermione_goes_to_australia_to_find_her/][this thread]] and wondering if the good people of this forum could recommend stories other than MsBinns' excellent "Australia" that deal with Hermione's journey to Australia to find her parents. Thanks!


** This one's a semi-decent WiP. Ron and Hermione. linkffn(11807757)

This one's with Percy. Pretty good. linkao3(4429844)

  Hermione has resolved her war is not over until she brings her parents home to England. Ron thinks a summer on the other side of the world is a perfect escape. But transitioning from friends to lovers is not always easy, and some hurts seem impossible to forgive, as Percy Weasley knows all too well. Can the bonds of love and family mend the pieces of their lives torn apart by war?
