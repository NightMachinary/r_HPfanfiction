So, in my crossover, the Foundation forces both the Order and Death Eaters to become its Wizarding World MTFs.

The Foundation knew it couldn't contain an entire civilization of anomalous entitites. So, instead, the O5 Council voted to include the Wizards in their list of 'non-Anomolous' entities, and to police it as they would the muggle world. In fact, Wizards were not anomolous. Anomolous entitities have certain common features in the SCP Universe, and Wizards lacked these features. However, they also knew the Wizarding World would prove difficult to police, as they lacked the kind of experience needed to interact secretly with the Magicals. In addition, they couldn't just walk up to the MOM/ICW and say, 'Hey, we're a Muggle organization with God in its basement. Want to help us contain hostile eldritch entitites?' So, the Regional Administrator for Great Britain approved a Project to 'draft' and train the most powerful wizards they could find. The Foundation approved this project, feeling that this was their best chance of getting even a half-way decent policing force. The main British MTF Units storm Malfoy Manor and 12 Grimmauld Place, taking the wizards that the Foundation believes will prove useful with them.

You might be wondering, 'How could the Foundation do this?'

Well, the Foundation are pretty much all-powerful in most canons. In fact, in some instances, the Foundation can created and destroy entire MULTIVERSES. The MTF's are basically the Foundation's police force.

Anyway, those wizards are taken to Site-67, the Greater London Containment Center. They are trained to become the new Wizarding MTF's, and given the designations 'Sigma-8-Pheonix Front', and 'Sigma-9, Deaths Head'. The newly-minted Units are assigned to police the Wizarding World.

However, all of the members of these units experience high amounts of PTSD and Depression, from being kidnapped and force to serve the Foundation's cause. A noble one, mind you, but it was still against their will.

How do I write that kind of trauma? And is this idea of mine any good, or a bad one?

What I need advice on is this: Any tweaks to the story that might make it better, and how to write a character/multiple characters with PTSD.

I'll list the members of the MTF's here:

Every Death Eater.

Every Order Member except for Molly and Arthur.
