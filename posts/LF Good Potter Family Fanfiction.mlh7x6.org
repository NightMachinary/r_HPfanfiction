Hey guys I am looking for fics where Harry has younger siblings, has his parents, or both. No Dark!Harry, Evil!Harry, Indy!Harry, Abusive Potters, Bad Siblings. Pairings can be anything as long as there is no Slash or Severus/Lily.


** It's not the focus of linkffn(7009713), but I love how realistic James, Lily, and Harry's 2 siblings are in that fic. Also the storyline is really good too, so there's that.

#+begin_quote
  AU. A 1000 years ago, a plague extinguished 3/4 of Britain's magical population, including 3 of the 4 founders; Godric Gryffindor remained and founded a new world, with a monarchy that would last for years to come. Now, Ginny Weasley is the Holyhead Harpies' star Chaser and a simple commoner, but Harry James Potter of Evans and Gryffindor, Prince of Wales, has his eye on her.
