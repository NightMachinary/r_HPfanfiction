** I'd always assumed it was whatever they normally hear as their own internal voice, or the voice of someone they trusted, seems more likely they'd listen to it, but there's no official canon I don't think, so I think it would make a good prompt.

That said, how would it expose Barty? None of the kids know what his voice sounds like, and even if they did there unlikely to connect it.

*** If it wasn't Moody's voice they would've suspected him of being an imposter. The other comment said it was Moody's voice though.

** u/TheLetterJ0:

  And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk

So in canon, the voice appears to match the caster speaking. But it's also possible that Moody was actually speaking out loud to him. In fact, since it was a lesson, it's probably more likely that Moody was doing so, just so that there couldn't be any accusations of inappropriate commands being given. Maybe if he had used mental commands instead, the voice would have been different.
