Not that dada.

Piggybacking off a suggestion from my last thread that Harry teach a Defense class, what would a DADA book written by Harry be like? (Maybe co-written by Moody and/or Lupin, /Dark Arts Demystified/) Part of me suspects he'd place an emphasis at the start of the book on the psychological and personal toll involved in combating the Dark Arts (like his words to Ron and Hermione in OoTP about what it's like to fight Voldemort).

Not that he'd slouch on the practical stuff. His heading of Dumbledore's Army shows some of what he'd teach the older years. But what would be covered for younger years, a Lupin approach?


** It would be heavily edited by Hermione, probably co-written by her, so the theory isn't neglected - Harry's focus always seemed to practical use.

But honestly, I don't see him writing a book. I see him, even if he were a teacher, as using others' books as a base and using his own experiences to flesh out the lessons.
