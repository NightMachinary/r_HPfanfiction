Basically what the title says. What are some good first sentences or paragraphs of first chapters you read in fanfiction? A sentence/paragraph that pulled you in, created an atmosphere, painted a mental picture, made you want to read more.

And additionally: How important do you think it is to have a good opening for the first chapter (in fanfiction as opposed to original stories)?

Are you satisfied if a first chapter simply tells you the differences to canon and introduces the premise? (Think all those time travel stories where many readers even skip the first chapter because it's something similar most of the time...)

Or do you expect the first paragraph/chapter to pull you in, and stop reading if it does not deliver?


** The few books on writing I've read all stressed the importance of "hooking" the readers with the very first paragraph. Perhaps it's more important for writers of commercial fiction, but still.

I don't expect such high standards from fanfiction though - if I did, there wouldn't be enough passable stories to read.

It's something I've thought about when working on my own fic, and it seems really hard. Imagine an AU story with a differently-acting Harry, where most of the stuff happens in 4th year onward. I still need to go through years 1-3 to explain the differences, introduce the OCs, etc. How do I make 3 years worth of canon rehash interesting? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*** I've not seen this (or remember if I did), but I wouldn't mind a simple prologue in a detatched, clinical, non-narrative manner that highlights the changes between canon and the AU story to come. Bullet points like

- Harry didn't meet Draco at Madam Malkins, or Ron on the Hogwarts Express, and therefore gets sorted into Slytherin

- Harry still saved Hermione from the Troll, having left the Halloween feast early himself.

- Harry befriends [Bones/Bullstrode/Greengrass/Zamboni] /at such time/ when /reasons/

If you're gonna give me an infodump, don't pretend it's narrative or interesting. Just give me the information quickly and painlessly instead of a "telling not showing" rushed chapter describing years of events and actions.

*** In "Patron", I had the same problem. I chose to start in 4th year, and deal with the differences to canon (when needed) in flashbacks in the first two chapters.

**** As a reader I think flashbacks and lengthy expositions about altered events that interrupt the narrative are very annoying. Maybe I'm just not a fan of infodump. I prefer it to come at me piecemeal, as the characters casually reference things in the past. But that's probably my fondness for the structure of the original books, where information was given in little bits until it formed a complete picture at the end.

***** There's not much of a difference between Flashbacks and scenes in a chapter/prologue, other than Flashbacks allow you to stat the story when it actually starts. Inserting the information piecemeal often comes off as infodumping, or constructed. You don't really casually refer to your past that often in talks, or not in the details that are often needed.

** I think the major difference between commercial fiction and fan fiction is that a fanfic is never actually "book 1" of a series. You don't really have to hook in readers the same way that a commercial author's new series would. We all derp on over to FFN and click on Harry Potter because we /already/ want to read something at least sort of like the fic in question.

I expect the first *chapter* to hook me into the story, but not the opening line necessarily. If I'm reading that first chapter it's because the story summary already got me interested enough to investigate.

That said... any pet peeves like poor spelling etc being present in that first paragraph can easily drive me right back /out/ of a story.

** It's rather rare in fanfiction, where prose is neglected. I've always found the beginning section of linkffn(The Broken Victory by Kate Lynn) to be very captivating, and it sets a beautiful tone, though sadly the story did not live up to it.

** From fanfiction, nah, I mainly want a first chapter to tell me how it differs from canon. If it's AU, explain the whole background. Just set it up.

I've read some first chapters where it's canon rehash with only minor differences. It takes a really excellent summary to keep me reading through that. And first chapters or prologues where you get a "mysterious scene" of people sneaking around and no names used are just annoying in fanfiction, whereas I quite like them in regular books.

The only thing that's essential in a first chapter is good grammar and spelling. I'll forgive an obvious typo or two, or if the author has one recurring grammar mistake that plagues them, but too much wrong with the writing and I will nope out of there so fast.

** Not the first sentence, or the first paragraph, perhaps. But when it comes to seeing the first chapter of something and saying to yourself, holy shit, this is going to be amazing... You can't beat Backwards with Purpose. I know /I/ was pulled in hook, line and sinker by that first chapter, and I know a couple of other people who were absolutely sucked in by this, too. I still remember the sheer feels when I read the last few paragraphs of the first chapter.

*** I had this exact same experience, sadly the rest of the story lost me. I was unfairly harsh in my initial judgement, it's not bad, just for some reason that hook went away and I felt like I was reading the same old time travel story I'd read a thousand times.

** To capture my attention, I need to read a summary with a premise I'd be interested to explore. So the summary must include the premise. If its just a quote, or something then I just scroll right past, usually. I really like timeline references in the summary too. Such as "DH compatible" or "EWE?" Or "6th year" or something to that effect. It helps me get into the zone of the story, I guess.

Then yes. There needs to be a hook. The first line is important, but no more important than the first several paragraphs. There are few authors in fanfiction writing that can pull off a, how should I put this...? "Mid-action jump in". By that I mean going directly into the narrative without any exposition. I usually hate it because I like stories to feel like they could stand on their own, and doing a poorly executed mid-action jump in feels abrupt. Like a bad paste job.
