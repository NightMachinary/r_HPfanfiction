** Just so you know you can also search characters or just pairings or genres on ffn. for example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=1&c2=549][Harry and Tonks as main characters who may or may not be togther]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=1&c2=5549&pm=1][Harry/Daphne pairing]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&c2=547][Harry and Luna as main characters with a romance genre]]

just keep in mind that a popular fic may not be all that well written or they might seem fine if you are new to the fandom but after a while you notice they are really pretty meh.

Don't be afraid to delve down into the low 1000s of favorites or even hundreds. Ive found some really good stuff before that is not anywhere near the first pages of a search.

***** It has absolutely nothing to do with this post or your comment, but I had to say, I loved your tag. It reminded me a cartoon-ish small person with a big head yelling "I'M HELPING" trying to row a boat with a fork.

Or a Jarvan 4 traping his entire team inside an enemy's Rumble ult.

One or the other.

  Harry and Daphne find themseves trapped in a hasty marriage after a drunken night, and there is no way out. How will they cope with that? Warnings: underage drinking, probably a lemon or two, and Weasley bashing. Also, English is not my first language, so be prepared for strange language quirks or don't read. Chapter 3 partly rewritten.
