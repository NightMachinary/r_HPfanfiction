A while ago I read a fic that had a funny/interesting interaction between Harry and Hermionie, it was 5th or 6th year and since they knew each other for so long they made a lot of smart ass comments about each other end flirted with each other. While I don't really care for that particular fic (I don't think I can describe it in enough detail to find it either), Anyone know of fics that they have interaction like that? Alternatively some where they act like a couple even when they're not.

​

I realize I'm mixing a couple of things here but I rather not spam with back to back posts.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Full title: The One Where The Entire Gryffindor Common Room Lusts After Harry Wearing Quidditch Pants and Hermione is Persuasive. That's rather self-explanatory, I think. Really, it's just best to move on. Equally pointless second chapter now added.

** Linkffn(12611489)

I've written this story with the goal of depicting a deep friendship between Harry and Hermione. Also I wanted something different than the many stories where Hermione disapproves of whomever he dates instead of supporting her best friend with her usual enthusiasm.

*** This is amazing! Your fic is the one I remembered! And it has a new chapter!

​

I started reading it and was like, "Hmm, this seems familiar". Then I read the "Hermione dear, I don't kiss before the first date." and realized what I was reading!

Thanks!

**** It was the first story I've ever published and at some point down the road I realised how awful it had been written (far too many dialogue tags, a few bad word choices), so I fixed those. I honestly can't believe that it had gotten 300 favourites in that atrocious state.

The promised continuation on the other hand was a difficult thing because nothing I wrote had the same tone, instead of lighthearted fun it was gritty and dark. So I ditched ten or so plot lines before deciding to go with what is chapter 2 now. By far the biggest challenge was to preserve the focus on their friendship instead of turning it into cheap romance.
