I personally like them. It is an odd balance as a long quote is rather tiresome, however a small 2-3 line is fine by me (On 3/4 page anyways).

So! If you are an author who uses quotes then why and how do you find them? If you are a reader then what is your opinion on them?

I'm going to go cook a pizza and if I don't have a reply by that time then I will be greatly disappointed in you. Yes YOU. Well, not you Jim. You're alright.


** Depends. Is it a Brandon Sanderson style in-universe quote that actually forms a part of the story? No problem.

Is it just the author trying to look more artistic by pasting pointless quotes which have nothing to do with the story? Ditch it.

** I don't use quotes, but for my last story, I started each chapter with an excerpt from one of two fictional history books covering the events of the story, to show different POVs, and to put the evnts into context. Just as all my POVs are biased, the historians were biased too, though.

** To be honest, I don't really care. But it has the potential to be pretty eye-roll inducing.

Basically, I don't care about a quote if its somewhat fitting of the chapter. Then I'm just indifferent about it, because it honestly doesn't really add anything to the story.

Worst case its pretentious bullshitting that is easily debunked as such by the following writing.

** I have seen it used well, and poorly. It tends to work better for shorter pieces I think, because the quote stays fresher in your mind throughout, and the story doesn't lose the focus of the inspiration.

** As a reader, if the quote is in-universe, I read it, and if it's done well, it adds a lot to the story (in terms of context, background info, seeing outside the main plotline). If it's just a quote from some famous person, I usually skim it or skip it. As an author, I don't use quotes before chapters.

** Also, Robert Asprin, who used funny (fictional) quotes to start the chapters of his "MYTH" series, once said that writing those started to take longer than the chapter itself, so there's a caveat for writers.

** Pointless. The sense of perceived sophistication by adding them is actually quite shallow.

** Hello Kurama,

In my opinion, Quotes are eh. Taure, as always has a solid opinion and I find myself nodding to it. However UndeadBBQ has my sentiments on Author Notes at the beginning of the chapter, be they quotes or other wise, down to a t.

That being said, most quotes that start a chapter of fanfiction are complete shit and are just to toot the author's horn in some ego maniacal way. But the few that do it right, are great.

*** That's /Kurama-sama/ to you. I've been reading /Again and Again/ and they all are relevant or foreshadow some aspect of Harry's character so I enjoy them. They are a bit cheesy but I am enjoying them even if they are getting redundant.

** I like a quote that is either -

1. Related to the chapter.

2. A quote from a character in the chapter.

3. A quote from a character related to the events in the chapter.

** I skip all quotes. They have about the same impact on me as a song fic......I roll my eyes. However, if the quote is by a character in the story and is part of the plot, then I am in favor ...but it's really hard to do this properly. My general advise is to skip it.

** To me, they create expectation at first. If for several chapters they don't suit the chapter's theme itself, they just feel like a random nice message. Else, well... They are nice addition, though unnecessary.
