Has anyone heard any story at all about a Hufflepuff Dark Lord or just a Dark Hufflepuff? According to Pottermore, Hufflepuff has had the least amount of dark wizards of the four houses, but that doesn't mean NO dark wizards. I've read somewhere that a Dark Lord from Hufflepuff would be the kind of character who wants to take over the world to make it a better place (like a benevolent dictator). There's a fic called The Sum of Their Parts, I think, in which Harry decides to become a Dark Lord to protect Teddy Lupin, and I thought it fit well with this idea of a Dark Hufflepuff, but I've never seen another like it, and i was wondering if there even are any, haha

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  Harry decides Dark Lordship suits him at age eleven. It's unfortunate that his predecessor just won't retire already.

** Why do people put so much stock by the stupid Houses and House traits and then project how that means a person would be in any and all aspects of their lives even a hundred years later?!?! That would be like saying because a terrorist was a track club runner in high school they would become a really good runner bomber or something!!! It is just dumb!!!! Why the crap does high school club traits mean ANYTHING even five years later?!?!?! It is my biggest pet peeve of a fanfic where people keep going after Hogwarts graduation "OH HOW RAVENCLAW OF YOU" and "OH YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A SLYTHERIN!!!" LIKE WHO THE CRAP CARES IN THE REAL WORLD HONESTLY WHY?!???!!?! And why does anyone think that what HOUSE you go into at eleven to age seventeen with a personality test dictate what ideals and goals you would have if you turned into a terrorist?! Like why would you be "A benevolent dictator" just because you got personality tested into a House at age eleven to seventeen when it is more like a mascot thing than anything else?! Do the first eleven years of life and all your natural human experiences NOT have any impression on your brain at all?!?!?! Abuse, a bad experience in diagon alley at sixteen, what, none of that does anything to you because OH YOU ARE IN A HOUSE THESE ARE STONE TENANTS IN YOUR MIND AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS OR CAN DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR BRAIN?!?!?!

I am sorry for ranting but yes this is the stupidest most aggravating thought process that fanfic writers ever could possess!!!! Does individuality and unique human experience count for NOTHING because YOU WERE IN A HOUSE SO THIS IS ALL YOU CAN DO OR BE OR ACT?!?!

*** In a few points I even agree with you, but mostly, just... No. Sorting the main character/s into different houses is actually a pretty common theme on YA literature, and however unrealistic it may seem, I find it to be quite a nice, if simplified, representation of real life social circles we are part of. The target audience actually likes having their personality boxed into a group, if only to say "hey, I belong here. There are people like me. People who can understand me. I am not alone"

And on the Harry Potter case in particular, I have to say it's less about your personality not changing at all for seven years and more about being molded by the people around you. Let's take Neville Longbottom as an example: he wasn't sorted into Gryffindor because he was brave, but because he had the potential to /become/ brave by being surrounded by other Gryffindors. With his personality and love for herbology Neville would have been very happy in Hufflepuff, but what he wanted was not to be happy, but to be brave. And Harry himself: the Hat told him that if he went to Slytherin he could be great, but Harry chose his friends, who had gone to Gryffindor, over becoming a great wizard (which he reluctantly did anyway).

That said, the fans tend to put a lot more thought into house traits and their nuances than JK ever did. I mean, at the end of chamber of secrets, Dumbledore is consoling Harry by basically saying "don't worry, you're not a Slytherin, you're a good person". And even by the last boom, the houses don't develop much beyond good Gryffindors, evil Slytherins, smart Ravenclaws and what the hell is a Hufflepuff.
