I know that there is a lot of fanfics with a somewhat similar premise, but none that I've found in which this part happens on the foreground, only as a background story. Like in a timetravel or dimension travel with an AU past, where Voldemort only came back when Harry was 25 or something like that.

This one is different in that it shows Harry's progression after the maze, shows him maturing emotionally, mentally and magically. Dumbledore keeps his plans to hunt the Horcruxes same as in canon, but with 2 more years than planned (5th and 7th) and Harry learns about the prophecy the same night as the maze, so he starts to focus on his studies a lot more.

Overall, there's only 2 chapters so far, so we can't be 100% sure of what will come, but so far, I'm enjoying it a lot, and wanted to share it with people who might've not seen this.

******* Even after your account is approved, you won't be able to read the fic. It's in a private writing development forum that brand new members can't access (in an attempt to prevent plagiarism situations exactly like this one).

The section that was uploaded by this plagiarist is very much a work in progress: it is still undergoing significant revisions, and when the author decides to upload it to FF.Net it is likely to have more scenes than the current version.

  Harry Potter manages one act of heroism in The Graveyard which changes everything. With Voldemort's resurrection yet again thwarted, how does the world change? A story predominately post-Hogwarts but not post-Voldemort.

** Excellent premise. I'd like to see this become a trope as it opens a lot of doors for authors to explore with. Here's a few ideas I'd have around this premise ... off the top of my head:

- What would happen romance-wise -- how would Harry juggle having a partner, maybe even a kid -- THEN having Voldemort be reborn?

- Would Harry relax, thinking Voldemort is gone "for good" or would he train to become better?

- Assuming the Death Eaters are free once more -- perhaps a story showing them panicking at Voldemort's second destruction by Harry Potter, and the drama that would cause. Perhaps a chase against time to locate the Dark Lord and get him back in a body again. Would they do the ceremony / ritual different? Would the Dark Lord look different -- better or worse? How would they feel about Potter -- hate him or fear him?

- How does the Ministry respond? Surely they would try to bury this -- if he really was defeated again (set back, not "vanquished") then Fudge would definitely want to keep it quiet. Would Harry be more accepting of this because he knows the Dark Lord isn't an active threat, or would he still want the truth to out. How would people respond if he says he defeated the Dark Lord again? -- "Fishing for glory" etc. People would think he'd be lying.

*** You're right, this could be really interesting. If the fic followed Harry through his school years, it could be interesting seeing what crazy things he'd inevitably get up to in 5th-7th years without Voldemort actively being back. Umbridge probably wouldn't be sent to Hogwarts without the perceived threat to the Ministry's authority, but then who /would/ the Ministry send? No Umbridge means no DA, which dramatically changes things. Without the Order of the Phoenix being reformed to fight Voldemort, Sirius probably wouldn't have set foot in Number 12 Grimmauld Place.

*During School*

- You could make things match canon more closely if you wanted by having Harry (and Cedric?) go on and on about Voldemort in the graveyard. Then the Ministry would still try to discredit them.
- I could easily see Dumbledore keeping the prophecy from Harry for at least a few more years.
- Dumbledore would probably still find the ring in the Gaunt shack and put it on, although it might be earlier (if he has more time to spend without worrying about running the Order) or later (if he doesn't feel it's as urgent). I'd probably have it happen at the same time just to make things easier.
- I'd probably have Dumbledore tell Harry the prophecy around the same time he was finally teaching him about Horcruxes, as a sort of "I need to pass this stuff on before I die" thing.
- Hopefully Dumbledore would explain more of his plan to Harry before dying now that Malfoy probably wouldn't be sent to kill him.
- This would be a good opportunity to write a better romance than in canon. I almost certainly couldn't do it, but the chance does exist.
- With Sirius still alive and Voldemort not fully back, there could be the common fanfic plotline of trying to prove Sirius's innocence, only now later than usual.
- Remus/Tonks romance has no particular reason to happen. You could either leave it this way (if you don't like the pairing) or write your own.
- If fifth year happens largely the same but Voldemort doesn't return at the end, the Ministry wouldn't have any reason to back off from its position in sixth year. Also, Umbridge may still be around if they didn't have to throw her to the centaurs to go to the Ministry.
- If Dumbledore still dies in sixth year, after that would be something you very rarely see--the heroes having to prepare and fight Voldemort without having Dumbledore at all. Usually (and in canon), Dumbledore's death is synonymous with Voldemort taking over, but here Voldemort would still be at a severe disadvantage when Dumbledore died.

Really, this is a great jumping off point for any number of divergences.

*** *After School*

- I'm a big fan of Harry-with-kids plots as well as Harry-the-Auror plots, but I've never seen one that combines the general fluffiness I love in them with Voldemort as a threat. I mean, /Cursed Child/ had Voldemort's daughter as a threat, but the story was crap. The closest to what I'm thinking is linkffn(12121323), where it's not Voldemort that's the threat, but the setup of Harry teaching DADA while his kids are at school was a lot of what I thought was neat. The adults keep trying to deal with the threats, but the kids end up getting involved anyway, just like in canon, only this time the adults are the original heroes.
- With Voldemort coming back later, a lot of the people who died in canon will probably still be alive when he does return. (e.g. Sirius, Fred, Snape, Remus & Tonks) This means we could get Auror & father Harry working with the adults from the original series as an adult himself. Unlike a lot of Auror!Harry fics, here there would be older people he trusts and looks up to who are just flat-out better at a lot of things than him because of their longer life experience, but he'd still be no slouch himself.
- OTOH, a lot of the people who fought Voldemort in canon will be older now. In particular, I'm thinking of people like McGonagall, Slughorn, Aberforth, and Mad-Eye, who might not be as prepared to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters as the were in canon.
- By the same token, some Death Eaters will have rotted away in Azkaban, while other will have grown up a bit more. What would Draco Malfoy be like after a few more years of the Dark Lord not returning? There's a lot of fascinating directions that could be taken.

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there. (Sequel, switches POVs)
