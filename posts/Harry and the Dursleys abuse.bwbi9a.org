This is kind of a follow up question I had from yesterday's thread. As many people mentioned here, Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys is responsible for much of his character traits in canon. We all agree on that.

What I want to know is if his behaviour is actually consistent with that of an abused child, specifically someone who's suffered that kind of abuse.

In the books, Harry is clearly not a stranger to cooking and doing a shitload of chores for the Dursleys. He's shown to be sleeping in the cupboard-under-the-stairs since early childhood (we don't exactly know when Petunia stuck him there). When Petunia tries to hit him with a frying pan, he ducks but is not surprised at all. Same when he's denied meals.

Now my problem is this. Does a child like that make smart ass remarks to people who treat him such? Remember, it isn't as if Harry came to live with the Dursleys when he was 7 or 8, having previously lived with someone like James Potter or Lily Evans. He's lived there since he was a baby.

Sure he could have smart-ass /thoughts./ But to say them out loud?

One could argue Rowling wrote this for kids, and didn't want to pile on something like this. But I don't buy it. I think in some ways, Rowling ends up normalising attempted murder (the pan incident).

Now I have no experience with any of this. People who've suffered/witnessed/dealt with child abuse obviously know better. This is just my speculation. Am I wrong? What do you think about it?

Since we all have fanfiction to provide our portrayals, how should Harry's nature have been given the canonical abuse?

Or perhaps how should the treatment of Harry have been at the hand of the Dursleys, for Harry to be as he's portrayed in canon?


** I have always thought a large part of Harry's attitude comes from knowing that he isn't their child, that he doesn't belong in that family. An abused child whose mother and father abused them would maybe internalize it more. Harry is very detached. Another aspect is, in the real world, you aren't going to find many abusive families as stupid and oblivious as Vernon and Dudley are, at least. Getting away with a large portion of smart remarks is perhaps a part of it.

** People deal with abuse very differently, and it's dangerous and kind of offensive to abuse victims to say "you don't seem damaged enough for the type of abuse you've experienced" or even "you don't seem damaged enough, so your abuse must have been not that bad after all". Abuse doesn't mean you'll be broken forever, and many succeed (including socially) and thrive in spite of it.

Harry doesn't trust adults, doesn't value his life enough, his social skills are not the best (but not the worst, either). He is a bit emotionally stunted, like when he doesn't know how to comfort Hermione after Ron's left in DH. So we do see the effects of his upbringing on his personality.

I also hate it when people say that the Dursleys' abuse is cartoonish, that something like that could happen only in the books, and in the real life everybody would notice. It kind of proves the Dursleys' point, isn't it? If Vernon was a broke drunkard beating Harry black, everybody would believe it, but normal, middle-class family messing with a kid like that? No way! But in fact, Harry's situation actually very much reminds me of a friend back in school. Her mother and stepfather treated her like shit, made her do all the chores and never spent any money on her unless they had to. All her clothes were second-hand (although fit her properly) and she would get a bottle of cheap nail polish for her birthday, while her younger brother, who they doted on, would get a new computer. They didn't beat her and they didn't keep her in the closet, but they would sometimes do shit like roughly waking her up and throwing her out of the house for the day at 5 a.m., or lock her out until late at night because the family is out. But the family was middle-class and respected, and nobody even suspected that anything could be going on there. Her mother would get away with very passive agressive comments and demeaning jokes at the girl's expense, would always compare her unfavourably to her brother, and adults didn't bat an eye because it was said with a sweet smile. Still, my friend always remained optimistic, cheerful and empathetic, and wasn't half as angry at her home situation as I was on her behalf. She was pretty resigned to it, like "water is wet, my mom is a psycho bitch, what else is new?" Back then, I thought she was coping remarkably well, especially compared to what I would do in her situation, but now looking back at what was her quite severe eating disorder (which went undiagnosed, and which her mother in fact knowingly and gleefully encouraged), hidden anxieties and low self-esteem, she probably didn't.

*** Thanks for sharing this. As I said, I have no realistic picture of the situation, and your answer clarifies a lot

** To make it short, while being legaly considered as "abuse", Canon Harry was not abused the same way you can sometimes see in fanon, and his character is consistent with his uprising.

And there is some points I would like to clarify :

​

#+begin_quote
  When Petunia tries to hit him with a frying pan, he ducks but is not surprised at all.
#+end_quote

Petunia, in canon, only tried to hit him once. But the context of the scene show 2 things : 1) It was a "reflex" action in a moment of anger, not something that happened regulary in the household, and 2) Harry knew something was coming since it happens right after he did what was probably considered the worst thing in the family, talked about magic.

The Dursley are not child beating monster, both the parents may be arguably rough when they are angry, or stressed (like Vernon pushing Harry in the cupboard right after he did magic), but they are still a far cry from the monster breaking Harry's bones every week with him only surviving with magic.

​

#+begin_quote
  Same when he's denied meals.
#+end_quote

The Dursley never "starved" Harry. During his childhood, Harry ate his meal as the same time as the rest of the family, and while he complained that Dudley always devoured his favourite meals, he still had his share of food on the table. The only time Harry was truly starved was the summer of GoF year where, because of Dudley's diet, the whole family starved (though all seemed to cheat on it by different methods).\\
I guess he also had less to eat when he was punished for doing magic, but people need to keep in mind that the 2 "punishments" we read about in the books (Summer of CoS and OotP) were by far the 2 worst punitions he had there (after being accused of ruining a very important deal for Vernon, and almost killing Dudley). Before Hogwarts, while he was punished for accidental magic, it was probably way milder.

​

In general, Harry had a pretty bad childhood, but while it can legaly count as "abuse", I always felt he was more "neglected" (still count as abuse) than being beaten up to an inch of his life. Harry doesn't fear his guardian, or even hate them, if anything he is even disdainfull of them (which can explain why he cas sometimes be a smart ass with them and never cower in their presence).

The only really violent part of Harry childhood was Dudley, who was violent with everyone. The Dursley are bad parents, but not bad enough to be child killers.

A frying pan to the dome could very easily kill someone and Harry is completely unsurprised by it. I take this as a case of show, don't tell.

If they didn't beat him at least once in a while growing up I'd be really surprised.

**** He made Petunia angry when she had her hand full, and she tried to hit him with what she was holding. A frying pan "could" kill someone if used with enough force to the head, but so could books, spoons and dippers, yet I doubt every child hitten with them died.

As for Harry being completely unsurprised by it, do you remember what he had done? If I remember correctly, this scene happen just after Harry scare Dudley by making him think he used magic, I doubt he was prepared for a frying pan to the head, but he was ready for /something/ to happen.

**** You might be overestimatind the significance of that frying pan. I'm pretty sure it was a rather ligh-weight one, so it's unlikely it'd cause severe brain trauma.

I'd say they didn't hesitate that much from decking him on a head or somthing from time to time if he did something wrong, or maybe use physical punishment of some other kind a few times for 'wrongdoing', but he couldn't've been abused too seriously (as fanon sometimes portrays). Anything more severe would be propably reserved for bouts of accidental magic - after all, magic is what causes Dursleys to resent Harry.

On a sidenote: wizards play sport with homing cannonballs for fun. I doubt a muggle woman with a frying pan is gonna do them in.

***** Frankly I'm a little disgusted with how much people are downplaying a frying pan being swung at a child's head.

Petunia deserved jail time and the removal of both children from her custody at minimum, not "lol it was a light frying pan."

***** Im going to guess that you don't do a lot of cooking with frying pans. Even a lightweight frying pan has some heft to it. And children, even 12 year old children, have fairly fragile skulls as their cranial pieces haven't completely finished fusing together. It doesn't take a lot of force to crack open a skull with a metal implement. Especially if it has a handle.

Think of a wrench. The longer the handle, the more force you can give it.

I have no doubt that if it was swung hard enough by even a a smaller sized woman like Petunia Dursley could do some nasty damage to even a full grown adult. Frying pans can and have killed people.

Like, regular frying pans. Not just ginormous one, cast iron ones or minus. Just normal frying pans.

I agree that the Dursley's probably didn't physically abuse him as seriously as fanon like to portray, but I think it was still fairly extreme neglect and emotional abuse. It is literally mentioned that Harry thought his name was 'boy' until he got to school.

As for quidditch the only arguement I have for that is that they presumably wear armor and helmets. I don't remember seeing helmets in the movie, but that could have been for aesthetic reasons. Not only that, but they have a healer on hand for injuries who can literally mend bones with a wave of her wand. Muggle doctors can't do that, and Petunia most certainly would not be equipped for it.

****** Well, i have 3 frying pans - one is light enough and with short enough handle that it would be pretty hard to do some damage with an offhand swing, and the other two i don't think i could actually employ for such tactics.

I think i should've stated more clearly that the point i tried to make was that the physical abuse wasn't on some insane levels as portrayed in some fanon, despite that incident - i.e. they could've been taking a swing at him and whatnot, but it's unlikely those were premeditaed attemps to do him in or cause physical damage. Mental abuse is whole 'nother matter.

And on the topic of pans again - sure you can severly damage or kill someoen with one. Same as with a fist to the face. But that scene you keep referencing definitely wasn't an 'attempted murder' or something of the sort.

And just in case - i do not encourage hitting people with frying pans or think that it is an okay and perfectly normal thing to do

******* You'd be surprised how much damage something made of metal can do, even if it's only a couple pounds.

I agree that a little tiny frying pan probably couldn't do too much damage. But a regular sized frying pan can pack a wallop.

As for whether it was an attempted murder, I agree on that as well. I don't think Petunia was actually trying to kill him. I think she was mad and lashing out. I don't think she was even trying to hit him. Probably just scare him. That being said, I do think that depending on where the frying pan hit, I have no doubt it COULD have killed him. Or at least knocked him out.

Hmmm... that is actually giving me ideas for a look into what her reaction would be if she HAD hit him.
