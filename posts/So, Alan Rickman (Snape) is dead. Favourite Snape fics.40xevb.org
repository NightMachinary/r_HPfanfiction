  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** It has a slow pacing, takes its time to get to the more interesting parts, and uses some bad plot devices occasionally.

However, I remember it being long not because it's uselessly stretched but because it tries to give natural character development. Not everything the characters do here is always used later as foreshadowing or a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun][Chekhov's Gun,]] but these actions make them look more alive and real.

Similarly, while some plot arcs here may seem poorly thought-out, I'd still prefer them to yet another story that stumbles through [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][the stations of the canon]] making it look like all the powers and actions of the protagonist are only a delusion they are having because the plotline has little to no essential differences from the canon.

**** Absolutely loved Resonance and its sequels. They are very long but I really liked the character development. The pace the author moved really allowed for the story to come off as not only believable but the exact thing that Harry needs heal and for Severus to find redemption. I was really impressed because she started the fic after OotP (before a lot of pertinent details were revealed in canon) but she was able to weave a lot of it into her stories naturally. I almost didn't read it through the first time because I thought the author took a way easy out with Voldemort, but that really wasn't the case which pleased me. Harry slowly but surely gets super powerful and she writes a really good evil Harry as well. Really entertaining read, one of my favorites. I like it so much that last time I re-read canon, I stopped after 5 and read this fic instead. It is a little mushy at times but that works for me. The final story was abandoned, however, I wasn't left with a feeling of incompletion. The author has additional unedited chapters on her website that really wrapped it up quite nicely for me.

HG/SS isn't everyone's cup of tea. But this is really, really well-thought out, well-written, well-everything. Amazing plot, and a nice slow-burner of a relationship - it really builds up on a solid foundation. Unless you're the type to absolutely not stomach this ship, its a must read. Especially if you want a character study of a flawed, anti-hero Snape.

Disclaimer(?): I LOVE this fic. I was there at the start in 2005, and I was there at the end in 2013. A rare example of a long hiatus ending in a finished story!

** So many of my faves have already been listed. Let me see...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The boy who died alot]] - "Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)" <-- read this one today, completely by accident. Graphic, at points. But a wonderful read :)

These three are more "mentor/father figure snape" which I love!

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=148][Blood Magic by GatewayGirl]] (about 350000 words)

And seconding linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko) and it's sequels most enthusiastically.

[[http://www.aylno.dreamingillusions.net/where.html][A Year Like None Other]] is also amazing.

The third is a voldemort-mentors-harry AU fanfic that also has a wonderful snape in it but he's not the primary character. ... on the other hand. Snape is pretty awesome in it. AS a warning, it starts out rough as hell. unpolished, unedited, lots of spelling errors. It goes to facinating places though. That said, I fear it may never see it's ending. so less snape fic, but still awesome snape: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

Ah, there are so many good ones though. So many.

      A/N: Originally written for the Severus/Harry Big Bang 2012 over at severusharrybb\.  To see the illustrations by , go to the original posting of the story\! Warnings \(highlight to view\):
  #+end_example

  Repeated major character death (don't worry, it doesn't stick!), bucketloads of dark humour, chan (one kiss at 15, sexual awareness from Snape's part ~age 15/16 onwards, but no actual underage sex), angst with the odd touch of horror, brief attempted non-con (not in Snarry pairing), suicidal ideation and attempt, moral greyness and flawed characters, wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. Oh, and a decidedly happy ending. ;) This started out as a crack-fic idea. Then I started writing it, and it decided it wanted to be much more than crackfic---and much, much longer as well! The thank you list for this one is equally massive: first, to everyone at the severusharrybb community---thank you for the cheering, the pep-talks and the glimpses at all your WIPs; you kept me going when frustration with JKR's plotholes and fear of deadlines made it tough to keep going. To the mods for putting such hard work into organising this big bang, with extra special thanks to accioslash for much needed honesty when I was angsting over the ending of this which prompted the brainwave I needed. To my britpicker rycolfan for her reassurance, badgerlady for whipping my typos and M-dashes into shape, and abrae for a fantastic and thorough beta (the semicolon is dead; long live the semicolon!) and her immeasurably kind words. ♥ And last, but not least, to my artist---I hope you've had as much of a blast illustrating this as I have had writing it!A/N 2: Any scenes/dialogue quoted and adapted from the books are JKR's property and used purely for transformative purposes; I lay no claim to them and make no money off them whatsoever.

** Sorry if someone else has linked to this one already, but this is seriously THE BEST Severus Snape centered fanfic that has ever been written, in my opinion!!! The writing is absolutely superb, and the plot is just fantastic. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. :)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/361513/chapters/586425][Within the Lair of the Dark Lord]] by: [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/AltheaG/pseuds/AltheaG][AltheaG]]

  Brilliant. Dark. Ambitious. Vulnerable. The teenaged Severus Snape was warned by his mother to stay away from the likes of Regulus Black. He was told again and again that moving in the same circles as Lucius Malfoy and the Black family would only lead to trouble. So why did he do it? What possibly could have drawn Severus Snape so far into darkness? And can he ever get himself out of the lair of the Dark Lord?

  A star whose arch features and languid diction were recognisable across the generations, Rickman found a fresh legion of fans with his role as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films.

  In a lengthy post, Daniel Radcliffe wrote that Rickman was "One of the greatest actors I will ever work with" as well as "One of the loyalest and most supportive people I've ever met in the film industry".

  Last year, Rickman reunited with Kate Winslet, another Sense and Sensibility co-star, for his second film as director, A Little Chaos - a period romance set in the gardens of Versailles.

Other than that- nah. Snape's a bully who obsessed over a woman but didn't respect her enough to actually make the necessary changes in his life (aka DON'T BECOME A DEATH EATER AND DUMP YOUR DEATH EATER FRIENDS) to keep up any kind of positive relationship with her. I admire Lily Evans' character for kicking him to the curb for actively fighting for the /extermination/ of Muggleborns just like her. Toxic friends like that should be dumped without a moment of doubt.

RIP Rickman, though, great actor.
