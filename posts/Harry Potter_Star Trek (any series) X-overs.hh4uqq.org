Self explanatory. There are so few out there, they can be really hard to find. For the love of God, no slash please!


** One of my favorites is Dunuelos's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729635/1/Through-the-Wormhole][/Through the Wormhole/]], which has a total of three parts, but he ultimately abandoned it because the muse abandoned him, apparently.

*** I was really bummed out when he canceled but the story fell into the same trap that many other crossovers do: badass, powerful Harry totally destabilizes the storylines that he's tossed into.

**** Honestly, my favorite parts were the ones that discussed the differences between philosophy Harry adheres to and the United Federation of Planet's philosophy.

Badass Harry is fun, but the character interactions between the two franchises are where the money's at, so to speak.
