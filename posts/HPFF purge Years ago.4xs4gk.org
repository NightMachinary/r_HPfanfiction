I recently went back to HPFF (harrypotterfanfiction dot com) after a very long time only to discover that my favorite fanfic match. by mental had been deleted. I've since found the story to read, but have discovered there was a schism that resulted in several high profile fanfics getting deleted. I can't find much detail on it, though. Does anyone have the scoop on what happened?


** I don't but a lot of the HPFF forum users are here [[http://hpfanfictalk.com/]] Someone there might know.

*** Just Google it and about ten different people have put up copies. I think the wattpad and ffnet were the most complete.

** I didn't pay attention. Apparently it was really dramatic, though.

*** I think this is a more recent bit of drama, because none of the names on the post are related to the stories that were taken down (as far as I'm aware).
