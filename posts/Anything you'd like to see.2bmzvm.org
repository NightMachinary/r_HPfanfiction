I'm getting rusty as a writer. I need something to return my spark, and I thought Fanfiction would help. I recently uploaded a new story to fanfiction.net, but I didn't exactly come out the way I thought it would. So I've come here hoping that any of you would have some ideas of things you'd like to see regarding the Harry Potter universe. I'm not exactly interested in slash, bashing, anything to do with gay protagonists (I like to read them, I just have no idea how to write them). I'm mainly a vanilla writer, but I'm looking for something that's really going to spark the creativity lying dormant inside me. My penname on Fanfiction is the same as the one I use on here if you're looking for any more info in what kind of writer I am.


** Nearly every Marauders era fic (that doesn't involve time travel) I've read is either Snape-is-evil or Marauders-are-evil. I'd like to read one where Lily is a sociopath, playing the Marauders and Snape against each other for her benefit. Someone once mentioned that plot bunny to me, and I've been looking for anything like it since.

*** I'd definitely read this.

The idea is subtly explored in a fic whose name I forget, but only in speculation by Harry over the type of person she may have been behind her facade (something about him, and as an extension his mother, being some sort of creature that has a fondness for games and manipulation).

** Harry gets blackout drunk. When he wakes up, he doesn't remember anything, so what follows is him and his buddies going on a Hangover-esque adventure to trace their steps back and figure out what happened.

Insert lots of crazy drunk ideas. Riding dragons and such. Harry could also defeat Voldemort with his surprising drunken... wand ability, and not remember a thing about it. He could also splinch some body part and spend half the story looking for it.

** By vanilla do you mean cannon-compliant or vanilla only in pairings?

I would like to see a good Redeemed!Dudley story, especially one where he interacts with the wizarding world. A time travel story where the founders come to modern Hogwarts would be cool too. Maybe they wont be sorted in their own house. I don't know of a Sirius-raises-Harry story where Siris didn't go to Azkaban and adopts him as an infant legitimately.

For cannon compliant, a good Neville-as-a-teacher especially one where he interacts with Draco maybe.

** The fannon is currently really short on fics where Dudley has magic too. I've only seen about two using that premise, which is a pity as its such an interesting one!

*** There may be more, but the first thing that comes to mind is "so what?" From what we can tell in canon, what makes a good wizard is largely hard work and intellect.

Dudley would be about as good as Crabbe or Goyle - so he might hope to someday cast a Fiendfyre good enough to kill himself.

What impact would the addition of such a person have on canon? Change Vernon/Petunia's opinion is what most people say - either that or they hate Dudley too - and at that point he's already had the neglect/"abuse" for those that don't know just how acceptable such treatment would have been even just 20 years ago in Britain. So now the Dursleys are marginally less terrible and...that still has little effect on the Harry/Voldemort story that drives the books.

So what is the point? Why rewrite canon with this essentially original character who you've based off an unlikable bully - though reading that from a first person Dudley perspective would be more interesting than anything currently out there.

Tl;dr this is a boring premise that may be handled well with a good author, but decent authors generally have more ambition at this point in the fandom.

**** Personally, I find the aspect of how would harry feel about having such a major aspect from his childhood there with him. Unlike Crabbe and Goyle, Dudley saw himself as a leader among his peers, not a follower. If the sorting hat bases house on what you value, not what you have, he may well have been in griffindor too. How would this have affected Neville to have such a bully in his own dorm room? Would he have developed the bravery to stand up to voldemort and slay Nagini? Would Hermione have come out of her shell if she'd spent all her time being picked on by Dudley? What if Dudley had ended up friends with the twins? Would this have meant Harry no longer had a sanctuary at the Burrow?

For me, interpersonal relationships are what drives a plot, and adding a new character into the mix can be a very interesting thing to explore.

***** Those aspects could be explored, but again most authors wouldn't bother because there is no larger story to tell. Bullies grow up, and even Neville has a wand that can be used to shut him down - but if the only change is the addition of Dudley I'm still left wondering "so what?"

At most I could see this done decently as a handful of scenes throughout the years - anything more is just a rehash.

****** I suspect we just look for very different things in our fiction. I enjoy exploration of character, and seeing how minor changes could possibly create huge differences, even if it comes at the expense of plot. I particularly like plots that are about one tiny change snowballing until it changes the world.

******* All great fiction is character-driven, there's no disputing that. And there are a hundred good "for want of a nail" stories that snowball from a supposed "single change".

Maybe it's because I've been around too long and have read too many of the damn things, but the prospect of seeing all the same shit I've already seen - this time with Dudley! - is just unbelievably uninteresting.

Time was I probably would have read it, but that was maybe back in 2006 when we didn't have as much stellar work that was infinitely more creative.

You want character-driven with an amazing plot? Enembee's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]]. Great example of how to take an interesting premise and make it great with fantastic characters all around.

** One idea that I've always wanted to do is have Hermione sent to Azkaban for kidnapping and blackmail of Rita Skeeter at the end of /Goblet of Fire/. The story could be told from Hermione's POV, perhaps being "rescued" by Voldemort during the subsequent prison break, leading to an early captivity in Malfoy Mansion. Or maybe Harry's, facing the difficulties of fifth year, Voldemort's machinations, Umbridge's abuses, etc. without her. It could even be a "picking up the pieces after the war" type tale where she tries to put her life together after Voldemort's fall.

** I'd like to see:

James holds off Voldermort for long enough to allow Lily and Harry to escape. So James is dead but Lily is alive with Harry, and Voldermort is still at large.

Lily goes into hiding with Harry in a foreign country, and lives as a muggle to avoid detection, but Harry ends up going to Hogwarts under heavy security, possibly not until the 3rd or 4th year when the ministry/order of the phoenix have gained a slight upper hand in the ongoing war. He's been home schooled in magic by Lily before then.
