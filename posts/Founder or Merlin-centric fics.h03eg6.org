I haven't seen much of these types of fics, but I'd like to hear about any fics that are either set in Merlin or the founders times or have a lot to do with them. I read a fic that I never finished where Harry is mentored by Slytherin's portrait, so even something like that would be great. Thanks!


** I'm writing one! Linkao3(23957842)

It's Set several decades into Hogwarts existence, with the founders as major characters but not the main characters. It's set just after the Norman Conquest, and follows a lot of the political fallout of that within Hogwarts.

So far I'm on a fortnightly update schedule and have published three chapters but written seven, so, plenty of material even if it's not all available right now. Let me know if it sounds up your street! It's also available under the same name on FFN.

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts, Britain's largest community of magical learning, is only decades old and already bitterly divided. England has fallen to a foreign king. And as the stone walls of Hogwarts grow ever higher, whispers say that Salazar Slytherin is plotting something... Two students from either side of a war are driven together by events that will change Britain, magical and non-magical, forever.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.
