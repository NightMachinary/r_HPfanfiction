*** That second link is smut with an 8 year old. Why.

Edit: Seriously, remove it. Sexualization of a minor feels like an understatement with that fic. It's downright depravity.

****** Well, I'm being a sarcastic prick because i agree with you about the absurdity of it. But rule 7 is:

Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.

Mostly pointing out the absurdity of that rule.
