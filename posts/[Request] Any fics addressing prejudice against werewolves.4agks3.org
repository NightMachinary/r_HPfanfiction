With/focusing on Remus would be a plus! But really anything I'm all for, any characters or OC's. If it deals with werewolf problems I want to read it!


** The accidental animagus by white squirrel has a werewolf rights movement as a subplot. It's pretty long and pretty good and it updates every two weeks.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** It's a subplot in my story "Patron", though mostly in the second half of the story. Voldemort has been exploiting the prejudice against werewolves to recruit them, and then doubled down on that in the chapters after 50, where it becomes a major plot point. Apart from Remus, there's also a werewolf OC to show the other side's point of view.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** If you don't mind threesomes, "Care of Magical Creatures" by Arsenic might be right up your alley: [[http://tasteofpoison.inkubation.net/viewstory.php?sid=16]]

Hermione creates a home/jobs program for werewolves (& also adopts a werewolf child) and Remus plays a huge role in the story. It's also long and well-written, and the prejudice against werewolves is the main plot, not just a side plot. It is NC-17 though FYI, just in case that's not your thing.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]]

Classic Remus/Sirius from way back in 2007 and clocking in at over 400,000 words *AND* it's complete!

Without spoiling anything, there are /several/ instances of /severe/ werewolf prejudice, pretty much the entire fic is about it really.

It's been ages since I've read it, but as far as I remember it's fantastic.
