On another note, didn't a "Prompt/Request" flair exist or did I imagine that?

You can edit the default flairs. So select Prompt, click the edit icon and type in Request after it. I use a mobile app so the steps might be somewhat different.

** Which still doesn't stop Fudge from claiming that Dumbledore altered his memory in order to trick everyone and steal his power.

I think you can type "/Request" next to prompt when you set up your flair.

** There's something similar in the Narcissa Militant series linkao3(11343366) It's not the graveyard scene, because that doesn't go as in canon, but Narcissa arranges a confrontation between Voldemort and Harry specifically for the purpose of getting a Pensieve memory for the Wizengamot.

  Narcissa is actually the source of the Malfoy family's wealth---and not because she inherited the Black fortune, either. She's an in-demand spy and assassin. But now she's retired, and intent on using all her skills to make sure her baby boy gets what he wants. If that's Harry Potter, then Harry Potter he shall have.

** There's a scene along those lines that's pretty good in Araceil's "Relentless, We Survive" on AO3. It's a pretty good story and even though it's a crossover, it's a pretty mild one. He only shows the DA though, so it probably doesn't play out quite like you meant.
