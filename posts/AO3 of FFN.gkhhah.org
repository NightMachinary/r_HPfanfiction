Which do you prefer and why? And have you guys ever read from Quotev and Wattpad?


** I prefer the tag system in AO3 and the ways you can sort it. If you search key words in FFN you cant filter by words, favourites, follows or anything else and that's always bugged me.

That being said I prefer the number of fics on FFN and the profile section, as well as the layout of favourite stories and follows; I think it works better than kudos and bookmarks.

AO3 is better formatted by FFN has a better range of fics.

I've never used Quotev and for some reason any fics I find on Wattpad are the cringey ones with bad grammar you imagine a 13 y/o wrote. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I loved them when I was 13, but it's not what I want now.

** AO3 allows far better searches thanks to the tag system, it isn't censored by idiots (you can publish anything that's legal, not just anything prudes want to allow you to look at), it doesn't have ads, and it will never delete your story because some jerk reports it for something that isn't even there. It's got a much nicer UI in almost every respect, and is run by much better people. Indeed, the non-profit that runs it is committed to archiving and preserving fanworks and isn't going to suddenly delete anything ever. I would use it exclusively except that there are people who don't publish there, so I have to look at their stuff on FFN.

** I will always support AO3 with every fiber of my being, as a fandom content creator. They stand for the rights of fans to make transformative works and post them on the internet. Disney has been recently started handing out DMCAs to fan artists and creators and the legal team at AO3 is ready to defend the right to fan works in a physical court. Plus, if you've posted work on AO3, you are an equal recipient of a [[https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/11/18300639/ao3-fanfiction-hugo-awards-2019][Hugo Award]]. (Though no one individual writer is technically a winner of said Hugo Award so, unfortunately, you can't claim it on a resume.)

** The thing I like about AO3 and the thing I hate about AO3 is the tags. If they were used sensibly and systematically it'd be an amazing system. The way a lot of authors use them completely defeats the purpose behind them. Use them to denote pairings, themes, important things that might identify the story! Don't use for "Draco is such a hottie" or "CuteButNotReallyHotButKindOfABit!Hermione".

And don't use the tags as a second summary. Use the summary for a summary!

*** Not sure if you already do this, but you can change the skins on AO3 if you're logged in, and one particular skin is exactly the same as the default, but it also sorts the tags into sections so you can easily see pairings, characters, and then everything else as separate rows. Maybe this could improve your experience with tags?

Though I personally love those comments, haha, it gives me a better sense of the writer before I even read the fic, so I know vaguely what to expect of their storytelling style.

** AO3. the tag system is far superior to FFN and actually allows for detailed searches. it is really annoying that you can only include and exclude one pairing at a time when filtering on FFN.

never heard of Quotev.

*** I've noticed this as well, and I wonder why it is.

Fics on Ao3 and FFN are similar quality level at the top end of the spectrum, but the bottom end is much lower on FFN, with plenty of fics that are just wall-of-text or otherwise eye-meltingly bad grammar.

Is this because the userbase of Ao3 is older on average? Does Ao3 have a higher barrier-for-entry that keeps out the people who lack a certain baseline skill level?

**** AO3 used to be invite-only -- iirc there was a waiting list for the public (I also have a vague recollection of a lottery), and members would get codes every now and again to distribute to their friends... or something along those lines. As these things tend to go with hobbies, good writers are usually friends with other good writers and so codes would spread rapidly within those social circles. I'm sure many BNFs were also given codes by virtue of their status -- somebody in the fandom would get them a code. Additionally, AO3 was started by some really good writers, so it got a bit of a jumpstart in that regard. But really, there isn't anything much at play aside from social dynamics and self-selection.

** I read on both Ao3 and FFN but I honestly think that the set-up of Ao3 is superior. The filtration system is better (filtering OUT is WAY better). FFN has a very low max limit on characters in the summary which can make the 'summarizing' task unnecessarily difficult for authors who want to do the opposite of what the Netflix summarizers do, which would be to actually make their work sound like something not inherently boring. The tags system grants extra context to every work without taking up space in the summary.

One of the best parts of Ao3, imo, is that Tag/keyword searches can be filtered by relevent preferences AND ALSO (unlike FFN) sorted according to most words, most kudos, etc.. Every time I search for keywords on FFN, I have to manually mentally compare each title's stats in the results if I want to read an as-yet unread-by-me fic with an established pro-this audience. It is very tedious. The only thing I don't like is that I can't search tags or keywords across multiple individual fandoms without the engine thinking that I want a crossover fic with all those specific fandoms (or those plus whatever else, as is often the case when the engine presents me with Tumblr Drabbles collections), even if I mark the search with 'exclude crossovers'. But another point for the tags is that they can include -cough-unofficial-cough-'genres' (fan tropes or fandom-specific plots) which are not - and never will be - listed on FFN.

Another best part is that authors can link specific works of theirs into a titled series. This series can be easily searched and accessed, and when a reader is finished with one 'book', they can click 'Next Part of the series' and smoothly transition into immersing themselves into another piece. FFN does not have this linking function, so readers have to skim the summaries on an author's page for "Part 1" and "Part 2" (etc.), unable to filter out all the unconnected works of that specific series.

There is also more media and inclusion in general that can be submitted to Ao3. Want an illustrated fanfic? It's not impossible! Dramatic audio reading of a fanfic? They have those too. Want to properly credit another author for a collab fic? Boom. Linked and underlined at the top.

Oh yeah: and I don't normally have to worry on Ao3 about stumbling across a Rated:M which should definitely be rated an E-for-Explicit but cannot be marked as such because the web designers seem to think that 'MATURE should cover just about everything, right? Warfare, gore, creepypasta, and sex'. Well guess what: Some people do not want to be stuck reading tween-appropriate warfare and politics and horror and might like to graduate to more thought-provoking Mature fics without stumbling across literature porn. Ao3 understands this concept.

I have never read on Quotev or Wattpad, mostly because the navigation is unfamiliar to me - I do not understand how to find anything I might actually want, and I certainly like what I already use. (This thing called 'change'? I hate it.)

** I've used FFN more than I've used AO3, but I do prefer AO3 in terms of quality and sorting. FFN has more options, though. I think the biggest thing that FFN has over AO3, other than quantity of fanfics, is the app interface. It's much easier to read fanfics on the AP than AO3 due to the simpler system.

As to Wattpad, I wouldn't really recommend it. Searching through is horrible, it has a much younger demographic and most of the fanfics are for One Direction or other real life boy bands that were made by middle schoolers. There's that 1 in a million chance you can find something you like, but it still isn't something I'd really recommend. Plus, users like to steal other's work.

*** 100% this. I only recently started using AO3 after years of fanfiction reading, because I exclusively read on my phone and the simple fact that ffn even /has/ an app is monumental. Add in the text to speech integration which means that I can keep ‘reading' my stories regardless of what I'm doing, and it's really no contest most of the time.

Also tags are great, but being able to filter out romance on ffn is so fucking nice. I don't give a shit about pairings, as long as there's no harem or rape fantasies or anything like that, and ao3 makes pairings one of the fundamental parts of their search features which really steered me away for a long time, as I couldn't figure out how to filter stuff properly.

I just recently discovered the ‘gen' filter on ao3 though so I've started using it more, and I've been pleased so far. It doesn't completely solve the issue, but neither does filtering out romance on ffn, so it's a moot point.

** FFN is my go-to, but they all have strengths and weaknesses.

I prefer FFN's profile, favorites and downloads system, but it's often times oddly conservative and I honest to God do not get the way your supposed to be able to post things.

Wattpad has what seems to be the most engaging community within comments and such, but has recently taken a turn for the worse-what with the limiting of the number of stories you can have offline/downloaded and really pushing the commercial aspect.

And AO3's tag system, while a bit over the top at times, makes it far easier to find things when you want to read something specific and is more lax with censorship, but keeping track of story updates and the lack of a easily manageable library system is beyond frustrating.

(Oh and I had never heard of Quotev before this, so no opinion on it)

** /Answered this a few weeks ago, so I'm just copying my response./

There are three things about AO3 that makes it my preferred site:

1. The option to show the entire work on one page. This is great for times when I'm going to be away from a network connection.
2. The ability to select a specific fandom when looking at an author's works. For the more prolific authors this is a must. I despise having to search through dozens of works from fandoms I don't care about for the Harry Potter stories.
3. Series. On ffn, you have to go looking for stories in a series, and read the descriptions to figure out which one comes first. On AO3, not only can you get them listed on a single page, but you can go directly from one story to the next.

For balance, the thing I like most about FFN is the ability to quickly find the "Complete" tag so I can filter out unfinished works. I don't always remember to look for it, but that's on me.

** I read all the comments and no one mentioned my favorite features of AO3.... The bookmarkers notes and searching sections. I read on both AO3 & FFN. Started with FFN and read all i could in my favorite pairing then i found AO3 and read there. I have hundreds of stories saved on the 2 sites. I often find it hard to search for a particular story I want to read again if i can't remember the exact title. With AO3 when i bookmark a story i can add notes to remind me the details of a story and I can add my own tags so i can easily find bonding fics for example in case the author didn't actually tag it that way. FFN bookmarked stories has no filtering option. Overall i find AO3 more user friendly.

** As a phone app I prefer ffn. It has a feature that reads to you so I can tuck the phone in my pocket and still have my eyes/hands free to feed the animals or whatever. Also, if I have to minimize the app for whatever reason, when I reopen the story ffn generally opens the chapter about where I left off. Ao3 starts at the top of the page. I think there's a 3rd reason but it's not coming to mind atm.

I downloaded the Wattpad app, but I've yet to read anything on it. I relate the most to Snape, I'm enamored with his spying proficiency. He's my favorite character and I frequently find myself getting bored with a story if he's not in it. I did a few searches for him on Wattpad and found nothing but smut. Now, I don't care if a story includes smut/slash/het/whatever, but if the romance is the ONLY plot then I'm not interested. Perhaps I just didn't word my search properly, I didn't see a search filter, but if I ever post one of my stories I plan to cross post and looking through search results I felt I'd be the first to post a story not sex oriented.

I've not heard of Quotev, I'll look into it. Thanks for mentioning it.

** I don't have a strong preference for either. Whichever site has the stories, there I shall go. FF.net is older and has more of the classics linkffn(naked quidditch match). FF.net also has a better mobile app, arguably better UI, and feels better for looking through communities and recommendations. AO3, on the other hand, has a much better filtering system and actually links the sequels of multipart stories. Plus AO3 is a lot less squeamish about smut, which I can filter away anyway.

Right now, the features on AO3 are better, but I mostly get story recommendations for FFN, so I just go where the stories are. I'd prefer if authors published on both websites and readers linked to both websites, but I'll take what I can get.

On a philosophical note, I believe more strongly in AO3's core values (freedom of speech, openness, and tolerance) than FFN's (???, profit).

As for other sites, I go where recommendations point me. Nowadays other sites generally aren't popular enough to get linked a lot. Our resident link bot started off only linking from FFN before expanding to include AO3. I dunno if it includes other sites now.

** Comments/reviews are also a point of difference.

On FFN, I like to use my reviews as a place to search for a fic I can't remember the title of, but I do recall my reaction to it. So that's great. On the minus side, it only shows your last 300 reviews. And I really dislike that you can't edit or delete reviews that you've made.

On AO3, commenters can actually get into a conversation; it's not limited to yourself and the author. Comments can be edited and deleted, if you made a mistake or want to add to what you said.

To answer your second question, I've never read from either of those. I've never even heard of Quotev before.

It's the only reason I use it over ao3, which does indeed have a much better tag system for better searches. But I almost never use the search function on ffn because of the ability to easily browse other stories favorited by the author when I finish one. I never have to use the search function, I just scroll through the author's favorites and add 5 more stories to my list, and then more from those. Plus, after I finish one, the app itself will recommend a list of about 20, but their algorithm still needs little work 😂

Never used Quotev and I find myself avoiding Wattpad, as it usually houses the worst stories. (Need to mention here that not all stories on Wattpad are bad, not all stories on FFN or AO3 are good or even bearable, I just made the worst experiences with Wattpad ones.)

When I was much younger, I started off reading 1D fanfiction on Wattpad and then on Quotev. I can't say I've really use them much in the last 5 years though. Especially since I stopped reading 1D stuff a long time ago. Their stories are usually childish and basic in my opinion.

** I've used FFN for ages. The sheer quantity of posted stories means there's pretty much always something new that I'd give a try reading. The filtering means I can have a minimum amount of words, and can sort by favorites so there's somewhat of level of popularity/quality.

The numerous times I've tried Ao3, it seems like either I'm using it wrong, or the filtering just doesn't work. For example:

I exclude M/M => The first page is filled of Sirius Black/Remus Lupin, Harry Potter & Cedric Diggory, Harry Potter/Tom Riddle, Dudley Dursley & Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy & Harry Potter etc.

Am I expected to exclude every single specific pairing I'm not interested in?

+Also, how do I search for a specific crossover between 2 universes? I can drill into one. But I can't seem to find a way to add a 2nd one. I can choose "Show crossovers only", but that includes everything.+ Nevermind used the search instead of filter.

Pretty much at the end of every attempt I leave Ao3 frustrated and annoyed.

*** Well, one problem I notice is that you've assumed the "&" symbol denotes a romantic relationship: it doesn't. When that symbol is used in tags it means a close platonic friendship.

As for filtering out slash pairings:

Unfortunately, just like on FFN, not all authors tag their fics correctly. Your best bet is to exclude M/M and then also exclude every specific pairing that you don't want. It may take a while to refine your filters, but afterwards you can save that results page as a browser bookmark in order to quickly reuse the same filters again in the future.
