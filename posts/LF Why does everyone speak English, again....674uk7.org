"Your account statement as requested, Mr. Potter."

The goblin, Plodvice, passed the sheafs of parchment over without another word.

Our brave and independent and fiscally responsible Harry immediately started to peruse them for this fic's proof that the Weasleys and Dumbledore were embezzling from him and he actually owned seventeen different manor houses and stakes in every company and-

Harry frowned. He tilted his head, tilted it the other way, then handed the parchment back with a sheepish expression.

"Is there a problem, Mr. Potter?" Plodvice queried with a neutral expression.

"Uh...kinda. I can only read English. This is Gobbledygook." the Boy-Who-Lived said sheepishly, "Maybe I should ask about language classes at Hogwarts..."

Plodvice raised an eyebrow, then stood up from his chair, shuffled around to the bookcase behind his desk, and picked out one of the books, beginning to flip through it.

"Instant language mastery, instant language mastery..." he muttered while flipping through the pages, "Come on, you wizards have all minds of mind-affecting charms and potions, you must have some kind of Polyglot Potion...Barty Crouch Senior knew 200 languages for goodness sake..."

So yeah, I'm just looking for silliness where not everyone speaks the same language.


** It does make logical sense that, as English wizards are Gringotts major customers (only customers?) in Diagon Alley that they would speak English and have documents in English.

*** But they're Goblins and their customers are wizards. Goblins take every chance to be a spiteful towards wizards as possible. Now, what would be more spiteful than to make a wizard learn Gobbledygook to read his own banking reports?

Gringotts documents being in their own language is now my headcanon.

***** It seems like *wars* haven't kept them from taking away the gold from the goblins. I don't think having to learn a language, as annoying as it would be, is more pressing than being on the opposite side of a bloody conflict.

****** I'm not so sure it was 'business as usual' *during* the actual rebellions. Besides, Goblins like gold more than they hate the wizards. The adjustment period would certainly disrupt the economy for quite some time even if the wizards decided to accept this new reality in their relations.

******* I mean... I think we can agree that it actually makes zero sense for the wizards to have their gold stored by the goblins. Zero sense. So the discussion is probably a bit moot. Because its not like there was /one/ war, there were /several/ Goblin Rebellions. Its to be expected that there will be more.

Thats like sunni Saudi Arabia storing their gold with schia iranian bankers because "We're not at war at the moment".

What I'm saying is that I as a reader will buy into any shenanigans the Goblins pull, because its fun and the whole damn situation makes no sense anyway.

** I believe that Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived did this one. Harry had to learn German under a translator spell, but since he didn't take too easily to it, it took very long for it to start having a serious effect to the point where he could hold a conversation. But someone like Barty was very receptive to the spell, so he could learn languages easily.

** On a more or less random note (and completely inane; it's the middle of the night, I wake up from a way-too-long nap, and by mind probably is not functioning properly now), does Harry in this snippet own seventeen manor houses and in addition to that he has stakes in every company, or is it that he has, in every company, both seventeen stakes and seventeen manor houses? Because, well ... do forgive me if I am being too random here, but I feel the latter would be a great thing to base a crack fic on.

That said, I will get to the actual request. I do remember a story called “Magic, as opposed to Magic”, which does have characters speak in different languages, but for what it's worth the problem is quickly enough resolved and the story is a crossover of sorts with one of the TES games (via featuring characters from some other story based on one of the TES games) so it might not be something you want. “The Girl Who Loved” does have that too, but that fic is a weird thing (I would put it in the same category as “Make a Wish”, which I hope makes it clear enough how ... weird it is), and it also is, for better or worse, crossed over with a bajilion and then some other series, most if not all of them Japanese comics and/or animated series.

I don't think I have any more stories on my list of whatever I've ever read, or at least I do not recall any being there right now, that fulfil your requirement, so I will leave it at that.

PS. Yes, the language of law and the language of fiscal matters are both Gobbledygook.
