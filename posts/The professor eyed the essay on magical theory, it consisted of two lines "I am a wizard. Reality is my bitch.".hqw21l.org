** If that's actually what Magical Theory boiled down to (magic being an unknown quality that lets wizards Do Stuff™), that sounds like something Harry The Hufflepuff would do: linkffn(6466185).

In his third year, he hands in four essays for DADA class, on how to deal with very different magical creatures, each essay just consisting of "kill it with fire".

**** Unfortunately it's not a crossover and the teacher was Lupin (whose response was some pride at him being the son of a Marauder), but I kinda want to read "Harry Dresden teaches DADA" now.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Mister Weasley, while this is technically /true,/ I cannot help but point out that one goes much further with a lady, including Lady Magic, by cultivating a little /respect/.

Which begins with not calling her 'bitch'.

Had you paid more attention in class, you would have a decent foundation of understanding on which to /build/ that respect.
