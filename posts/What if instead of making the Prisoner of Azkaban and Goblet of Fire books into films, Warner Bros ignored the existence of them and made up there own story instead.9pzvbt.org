** I'm not sure this is the right community for this discussion, that being said.... They could do that but then it wouldn't be harry potter....

Star wars wasn't a book first, it played so well in a movie because it was designed as a movie....

Changing the complete story of Harry potter... Alienates all the book readers that watched the movie which was and is a big majority of the audience and makes it not harry potter.... Which again alienates your fan base....

I think what you are maybe wanting is spin offs and they can probably do so, but again the Harry Potter movies are so tied into the books so J.K. Rowling, until she makes a spin off (I don't really count fantastical beasts a spin off) they won't have a huge market for any more harry potter films

1. The setting is Scotland, not California

2. They are 13 in PoA (Hermione is 14)

3. Let's take the plot about the righteous fight against tyranny and replace it with... Well, uhm... Dating drama where the plot comes from misunderstandings and feels completely forced.

** Then we'd be in the same boat as the Percy Jackson fans. I think they did their best with the material and changed it up here and there to fit the time limit of two hour movies

** We might not have movies like this, but speculative versions of future books made up the backbone of the Harry Potter fandom while the books were still being published. There are tons of them out there.

Granted, I don't think the fandom got really big until after PoA, but I'm sure there's something.

*** Fandom still is nowhere near as popular as the books or movies.... Only us weirdos (term of endearment) that basically live and breathe Harry potter read fanfiction.... There are a lot of people that like but don't love HP. There isn't a market for what would basically be fanfiction movies
