As the title states I'm looking for interesting Hermione pairings that aren't Ron or Harry. Be it Neville, Cedric, or another one of the Weasleys, something else entirely! I'd love a good, long, involved story. Thanks!


** "The Arithmancer" by White Squirrel has Hermione/George in a really really well done way. I'm normally very focused on lesbian ships, but I loved how their relationship was done I'm this story. It's also one of the best HP fanfics I've ever found (and I read a whole lot of them).

****** -"Power of Love" Series by Philosophize (just great great stories, female Harry/Hermione ship and easily one of the best works of fanfic out there. Starts with a short story called Yule Ball Panic)

-"Unicorns" by TiAdoro914 (more casual and fun loving than the others. A joy to read)

-‚ÄùWitnessed Here In Time And Blood‚Äù by whistle.the.silver (dark and not very happy, but is just such high quality. Really great story)

-‚ÄùThe Hunters‚Äù by LJlashlaure (much more slash, less plot than the others, still a fun read)

-‚ÄùOne Step At A Time‚Äù by hphglover (pretty typical fanfic in terms of plot, still a good read)

-"Written In The Body" by poetheather1( (one of my all time favorites. Just make sure you read this one because it's bloody fantastic)

-"Here And There" by Jackdawess (Another favorite. Time travel, adventure, romance, super well thought out plot, lots of laughs and tears. Make sure this makes it onto your must read list as well because it's so good I've read it 4 times now).

**** Lady Archimedes is absolutely 100% worth the read. I'm keeping up with Annals at the moment and very much enjoying it. Sadly I do not. Like I said, I focus on f/f stuff and I only started this story because I love Hermione so much that I really wanted the experience of a huge story from her POV. The straight romance was just something I had to deal with in exchange for spending all that time in Hermione's head üòú

**** I firmly believe Hermione should have ended up with George and not Ron, and Sirius (to me) is like a sexy, angsty version of George. This fic (spoilers) does a really good job of making it believable and making you fall in love with the pairing. A lot of Sirius/Hermione fics use time travel, which is fine and works well as a plot device. I'm working on one without time travel and am loving that realm of possibilities.

**** There isn't much to go on sadly. The one I linked is the story I wrote after being inspired by "Dignity in Fear", but I am really hesitant to recommend it anymore because the last few chapters were some badly disguised author inserts on LGTB issues where everyone puts up with Lupin moping around because he is gay but ignores Harry because, well, he is not important to Hermione I guess.

Until Chapter 23 it is a great story, it becomes a deluge of angst with an opinion insert after that. Coincidentally, that marks the end of the 5th year, so you can see it as complete 5th year story.

** I like Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger, though these types of stories take place after the war. Red Garden Gnome has two, well-written stories regarding both of them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243730/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]] has Hermione joining Charlie in Romania, before they both head back to Britain with the opening of a new dragon reserve. It's a slow-burn romance but one that also has some good mystery, action, and a little bit of horror mixed into it.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12858961/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] is probably the best Charlie/Hermione story I've read. It's about them taking dual teaching posts at Hogwarts as a new dragon reserve prepares for its opening.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) hope femslash is okay? this is Hermione/Luna (interesting and pretty unusal pairing... imo anyway) fic is really long (like i think the longest fic of that pairing ever written maybe worth looking at for that novelty alone?) im a bit of broken record posting this fic all the time lol but i love it and i want to send the author more traffic so they continue.

Its just very sweet fluffy fun most of the time, though theres a pinch of smut thrown in there(its not all sweary porn-y and more light humours and fluffy those bits) and the fic is getting a bit dark now with bellatrix lestrange being introduced, they've gone into Bellas head alot and given interesting insight to her so she not just a stock villian find all that stuff fasinating. Plot was thin for awhile but has really picked up as its gone on.

  While patrolling the castle one evening Hermione runs into a certain someone or rather falls over a certain someone. A rather odd someone in fact, who is in need of a little help.

** linkao3(The Safe Word is Devil's Snare) Marriage law fic, but it's Hermione/Neville. It's really good and smutty.

linkao3(Belonging to the Fog) is Hermione/Lucius. It's dark and creepy, but well written. Still updating.
