** "My Lord," simpered Lucius, "your plans are going wonderfully. Soon we will conquer the world and you can kill all the Muggles!"

"Humans," Voldemort corrected idly.

"...Humans, my Lord?"

"Yes! Yes, yes, yes," said Voldemort.

"Please explain," said Lucius, cringing as he expected a Crucio. "My Lord, I thought you believed in the supremacy of magic!"

"Magic sustains the world. Magic comes from nature. Humans are bad for nature. Therefore, humans are bad for magic, and humans are destroying the world. Did you know, Lucius, that the shaman-king Temujin stopped the phenomenon of global warming by getting rid of a large number of humans? In this way, he started to save magic. I will finish what he started!"

"But my Lord, what about blood--"

"Sectumsempra."

As Lucius gurgled, Voldemort wiped his wand. "Oh no. It seems that the filthy polluting muggles have murdered Lucius. I will, of course, commandeer his estate to save the world from itself."

**** New theory, when Voldemort died in the movie (not the books) he dissolved, because his death was caused by Thanos' snap, not his killing curse.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/][Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7]] without a doubt, the best portrayal of Voldemort I have ever read, surpassing even Rowlings version of him in my opinion. It is very, very different from normal Voldemort, but the care and detail put into the portrayal is beyond reproach.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Pretty popular fic but how Voldemort started out is similar to what you're looking for. Spoilers ahead:

He gets denied the DADA position because he's, well, pretty evil. He gets drunk with his old school buddies, and they decide to teach everyone a lesson by showing how incompetant everyone is in DADA, they get blackout drunk and wake up, finding out later that Tom started calling himself Voldemort and his followers Death Eaters and they attacked and killed a lot of people. Voldemort just sort of rolls with it and makes it political with the blood purity stuff in order to legitimize his movement since he was in too deep after that.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
