** Read her other stories on the site because they are all excellent.

And as I said I was not a fan of HP/SS stuff at all before I read this. It's so believable and very well written. The sequel is also being posted now and is equally as good (it's written in Snape's POV).

It is a strong M though. The torturing scenes are kind of intense.
