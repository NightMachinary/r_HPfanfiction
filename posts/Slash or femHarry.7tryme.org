** One of my favorite stories is Cartographer's Craft, which includes a slash relationship between Harry and [[/spoiler][a young Sirius, "born" from the Marauder's Map]]. linkao3(979182)

Harry in the story is very well written, and the romance is a very, very slow burn. It includes things like Harry figuring out that he likes dudes, wondering "what is wrong with him" and working through that, and more real-life-style problems. It's great, and I completely recommend it.

If you write Harry correctly, I think that the reader will be inclined to read it regardless of if it's fem!Harry or just regular slash.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** I hate genderbent stuff. I tend to find it very creepy and essentialist, where suddenly the character is unrecognizable because they're a man/woman. It often seems to be like an excuse to make a canon character into a bad self-insert, where they pretend that your assigned sex really makes /that/ much of a difference to your personality.

I do read "slash" fics, but I tend to seek out those written by other men or older women, because often fanon queer characters end up feminized or made into a weird man/woman equivalent. As a gay man, as much as I don't want to read genderbent nonsense, I don't want to read something where /because/ a character is gay, they're effectively made out to be genderbent.

**** For me, it's weird that people always make genderbent characters cis. Like, that's such a bizarre thought to me, that you have a male character, and suddenly, just because they're assigned female at birth, they're actually a girl? That's not... Really how that works.

And then there's this idea that if a character /is/ a cis girl instead of a cis dude, suddenly that character is constantly having sex with all these men or being sexually assaulted all the time, or being overtly feminized et cetera, when in a fic where the characters are their original genders, that stuff wouldn't be acceptable at all.

It's just ridiculous to me. I've genuinely never read a genderbent fic that I enjoyed, because they always seem to buy into such ridiculous amounts of nonsense.

***** If anything, this comment is the bizarre thing.

I don't really think gender identities need to be brought into Harry Potter. Most people born female consider themselves so for their entire life. What are you expecting, exactly? That every fem!Harry fic needs have a little prologue where Harry thinks about whether or not they identify as a girl?

Ignoring smut, I don't think I've read a fem!Harry where she has sex with every man, or gets sexually assaulted 24/7, or is super feminized. Most of them, from my experience, have none of that.

******* So again, what do you want, exactly? It sounds like you want that prologue I mentioned in every single story, or for every fem!Harry to identify as something other than a girl. Which is really strange.

Honestly, if I was reading a fem!Harry story and she suddenly declared herself gender neutral or whatever, I'd probably the fic. It's the same as religion, most people don't really want it in the HP universe, and having it there is usually a sign the author is going to become preachy through their characters.

Your issue is like if I said, "I find it bizarre when people give Harry new guardians to raise him and they're British, not Jamaican."

You have to realize that the majority of people don't think of things like that. I wouldn't be surprised if most people didn't even know what cis really meant before 5 years ago. Or even now.

*************** Because they would prefer to have them just be born as that gender? Because maybe they want Harry to grow up as a girl from the beginning, or they don't want to deal with the troubles or angst that come with transgenderism, or because there are few transgender people and those who aren't don't want to write from that perspective when they don't know what it's really like, or because they don't want to insert transgenderism in a world where that kind of thing doesn't ever get mentioned, the same reason people don't usually insert religion into it?

There are a number of reasons. I don't have a bee in my bonet about it, I just find it weird that someone can't accept that an author might just want to change a person's gender without going through transgender stuff.

*** That's the same issue I usually have genderbending. Though unlike you I like the idea of fem Harry (but not any other character), I have never seen it done well. I never feel like I'm reading about a female version of Harry. The girl's personality is always so different that it might as well be a completely different person. And like you said, often a self insert, usually idealised.

And I get what you mean by the second part. In fanfiction, a gay character often doesn't act very realistically.

** Regarding what's popular:

With a fandom as large as Harry Potter, you're going to find groups of readers for just about everything. There's interest in both fem!Harry and gay!Harry, and there are also readers who won't read one or both. Any post on the subreddit is going to get response bias of people who are interested rather than people who skip over the topic but will read a good story regardless.

More on-topic of the thread itself:

Write whichever character you want to write. The best stories aren't written by authors trying to please fans, they're written by authors who have a clear vision and share it with the rest of us.

If you're split equally between the two, I feel like the character/story isn't well-defined. A gay male is going to have a significantly different perspective on life than a straight female, as well as other people treating the two entirely differently.

*** No worries; I started this post out of genuine interest into how people feel about this subject. Which of the two I choose will depend on how it fits with the stories and which I can write best in character. My story is still very vague at the moment. But thanks for the response anyway.

As for what I meant by popularity; on the regular HP subreddit most people tend to go a certain way. Reddit just attracts certain people. For instance, most people on the HP reddit dislike the movies and CC. I wondered whether in this subreddit the majority agrees on certain themes or types of stories. Especially when I don't see many fics recommended here that aren't really au and out of character.

**** Lets put it this way. I am the first to admit that men can look good. But there's a difference between good looks and sexual attraction. And as soon as the PoV goes into detail how "attractive" a guy is, I might ask myself how much he can bench, but I'd never come to the conclusion that the guy is sexually attractive.

Add to that the absolute lack of suitable male character to ship somebody with. The best one I can come up with is Justin FF, a background character with around three lines in seven books. There's simply no decent option.
