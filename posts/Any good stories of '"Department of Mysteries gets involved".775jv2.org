Title says it all.

Preferably nothing too OP, but I'm not averse to it if it's good anyway.

Lockhart is an Unspeakable. He helps train Harry and Ginny. Yada yada yada. Luna's character is awful.

It's a fun story. Don't take it too seriously.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.
