Disclaimer: This is a rant. I just had to get this off my chest, and I thought this would be the better subreddit to do so instead of the main one. I look forward to your opinions on the points I made, if anyone actually has the patience to read through my sleep deprived ramblings.

I've been a huge fan of the HP books (and to a lesser extent, movies) for most of my life. But honestly, as I'm getting older, it gets harder and harder to read the later books without tossing them away in frustration. The first couple books are at least childish in tone and center around couple children, but as the books get more "mature" and start revolving around politics and war, it gets more and more stupid.

The sixth book for example, holy shit the sixth book. Harry Potter, who lost his godfather in battle and then learned that he is literally prophesied to kill one of the most powerful wizards in the world, spends his school year worrying about teenage love. It's explicitly stated that he has a shit ton of free periods, but what does he do? Does he restart the DA, teaching both himself and his friends how to defend themselves in the upcoming war? Does he try to learn more magic, so that he can maybe have a chance against Voldemort and his Death Eaters? Does he continue trying to learn Occlumency just in case Voldemort tries something again with their connection? Nope, he lusts after Ginny, plays Quidditch, and argues with Hermione about a fucking textbook.

And it's the same for Ron and Hermione too. Both of them almost died at the end of their fifth year, and now they are in the center of the war as Harry's best friends. So what do they do? Ron spends all his free time snogging Lavender, and Hermoine spends all her free time either feeling jealous because Ron snogged Lavender, or feeling jealous because Harry gets better marks than her in Potions. Fucking seriously?

Susan Bones loses her aunt, Hannah Abbott's mom dies, Neville, Luna and Ginny personally fought agaisnt Inner Circle Death Eaters. You'd think at least one of them, considering both Ron and Hermione are incapacitated by teenage hormones, would approach Harry and ask him just what the fuck was he planning on doing in regards to the war, if he wasn't planning on helping directly by continuing the DA or helping indirectly, through politics, by aiding the Minister.

Don't even get me started on Ron and Hermione dismissing Harry's worries about Malfoy. Dude had been ranting in the hallways about mudbloods and blood traitors since he was fucking twelve. His father is one of the most high profile Death Eaters. He literally couldn't act more sus if he tried. But no, it's fine, he is definitely not planning something. Why do people consider Hermione smart?

Then of course there is the seventh year. WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY CAMPING? Literally. Why. What advantage does starving in a fucking tent like a goddamn moron give them in their search for Horcruxes? Surely, they could hide in an Order safehouse? Or, if that's entirely fanon and the Order is so fucking stupid that they didn't take the time to prepare proper safehouses, then they could still surely hide at Kingsley's, wherever the fuck Remus lives, etc. After all, they stayed in Shell Cottage for a while, they could have done the same with other houses of Order members. They didn't need to tell them of their mission or anything, even though it's fucking stupid of them to hide it even after Harry is disillusioned with Dumbledore, but they could still benefit from being in close proximity with the other Order members. Gathering intelligence, assisting them in at least planning counter-attacks against the Voldemort regime, asking others to provide them with whatever research material they may need. Actually doing something, you know? Hell, this way, Ron wouldn't have left the two dumbasses either, as he would be getting intel about his family regularly, if not actually seeing them. I'm fully with Ron on that shit by the way. Like, bro, my family is actually fighting in the war and I haven't heard from them in months. Including my sister who is staying in a boarding school led by Death Eaters. The same sister who used to be your ex, which makes her a big target. Why the FUCK would I camp out in a forest, stressing over Horcruxes without actually doing anything? He was right to get mad at Harry for not having a plan. Hell, they didn't even know that Voldemort made his name taboo, for fucks sake. If Ron hadn't left them for a while, all three of them would be dead in a month.

Dumbledore is the same, and the Order too. They never fucking do anything. It's like Rowling fears having her heroes fight against wizard nazis would make them seem immoral, when doing the opposite makes them look incompetent as fuck. It is supposed to be a war, but it feels like a schoolyard brawl. "Don't stoop to their level" and shit works if it's just a couple fuckos doing random attacks on muggleborns, but they are a fucking terrorist organization. Why the hell are you wasting human resources on guarding a prophecy when you can fiendfyre the shit out of Malfoy Manor? Bitch, they Imperio'd your comrade to get to the prophecy, retaliate. Imperio one of their bitches, put up a guard to make sure they have time to do what they need to do, and have them blast the shit out of the Hall of Prophecies. Here, done, fifth book over.

This is why I understand bashing, honestly. Because if these characters aren't all secretly evil, then they are extremely stupid and incompetent. I cared more about the first chapter of Half Blood Prince than the rest of the two books in their entirety. Bellatrix questions a comrade's loyalty, Narcissa actively takes precautions for her son's protection, and Snape is fucked. See what Bella did, there? Instead of doing nothing but bitching about how Snape is so untrustworthy and oh why would anyone trust him, she instead put him in a situation where he had to be loyal to her cause, or literally die. Sure as hell beats everyone moaning about Snape and Draco for seven fucking books without doing anything. I think I might've rooted for the Death Eaters if they gave us more insight into their actions, not because I'm an asshole, but because they are actually doing things.

TL;DR: If the good guys actually, you know, did anything other than sit on their asses all day, the war would be over way sooner and without nearly as many casualties.


** Ah, but JKR wants to write a fairytale in which innocence and passive sacrifice overcome the ultimate evil.

Therefore, the good guys must NOT have political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical competence. They must not act proactively, they can only react to whatever shit bad guys throw at them, and they will rush into any dangerous situation without second thought.

****** Actually, canon Dumbledore is only incompetent, senile, and criminally negligent. He's hardly manipulative or Machiavellian, as he could at best only fool young (ex) students to do the dirty work for him. Against career politicians like Fudge and Lucius Malfoy, he got outmaneuvered and out-manipulated like a bloody idiot. This guy sits on significant knowledge and magical power, but could barely put any of these to good use.

On the other hand, I don't consider him malicious, unlike the Ministry. He's just incapable of fighting those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums effectively.

In the end, he resorted to children's sacrifice, which says what pathetic level magical Britain had sunken into.

I honestly wouldn't cite this particular incident as an example. Harry was throwing around stunners and blasting curses during the Stupidity of the Seven Potters. I don't blame him too much for disarming Shunpike, who he knew was an innocent. His mistake was using this spell way back, during the graveyard fight.

A more relevant example would be Harry not executing Dolohov and Rowle in the cafe after the Ministry fell.

I agree with everything else you said.

****** Prepared for this to be an unpopular opinion, but I think the notion that heroes having moral standards makes them naive or childish... is a deeply flawed one. At least personally, I'm glad that despite a lifetime of abuse and being targeted for death from a young age, Harry tries to avoid vengeance and wants to seek the least violent path whenever possible. It's what makes his character so appealing to me.

I kind of want to make a post about this, because it's at the root of my problem with most dark!Harry fics, and why I've never been able to care much about any iteration of Hadrian Peverell. The nihilistic worldview most of them espouse drives me crazy.

******* Ooh, a polite dissenting argument that's well thought out. I agree Harry having morals is good. Stan Shunpike was imperioused if I remember correctly (It's been close to a decade since I read Deathly Hallows last).

I however disagree with his handling of the death eaters. The trio obliviated 2 death eaters, one of whom later killed Remus. Harry's actions, when looked at from an outside perspective, look selfish in the war.

Nihilistic Hadrian Peverell fics are rampant. A 12 year old killing people never sits well with anyone and the main character tends to be a hypocrite. But Harry in Canon was just a martyr.

He might snark a bit, but ultimately he never stands up for himself (like walking out of Snape's classroom...seriously, I would have done that! Hell, I and my fellow classmates once really did walk out of a lesson because this teacher was so enamored with folk dancing (circle-dances) and we boys hated it and it was not on the curriculum either, we had checked before!

** JKR writes her stories with a planned ending in mind, unlike GRRM who "gardens" and writes his story based around character motivations and realistic consequences to their actions. Rowling has been on record saying that she wrote the ending of HP early on, having the image of dead Harry being held in Hagrid's arms from day one. This planning of hers also includes the epilogue, possibly explaining why the "19 Years Later" scene feels so cheesy and tonally inconsistent to the rest of Deathly Hallows.

Once you become aware of her writing style, you'll also notice that people, established as clever, are only as intelligent as the plot demands. At that point, you can enjoy the stories more because you stop being mad at the /characters/ for being so dumb or passive.

For example: Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater.

When Harry explains the clues to Hermione (Draco and his Mum in Knockturn Alley, Draco showing Borgin his arm, Draco on the train, Draco's weird habits on the Marauder's Map, kids almost getting murdered) it's clearly strange, suspicious, and worthy of investigation. The funny thing is that Hermione DOES recognise Draco's behaviour as suspicious, and remembers a clue, but for no real reason, she brushes Harry off. Don't see it as Hermione being OOC, see it as JKR /making her OOC/. JKR planned each book around a central mystery that the protagonist has to solve, and what's the point of having a mystery if the smart character solves it before the school year even begins?

.

#+begin_quote
  'Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!' said Hermione. ‘Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!'

  Harry gaped at her. ‘I forgot! But this proves Malfoy's a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?'

  ‘It is pretty suspicious,' breathed Hermione. ‘Unless ...'

  ‘Oh, come on,' said Harry in exasperation, ‘you can't get round this one!'

  ‘Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat.'

  ‘You're unbelievable, you are,' said Harry, shaking his head. ‘We'll see who's right ... you'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry.'
#+end_quote

.

Literally the whole of last year had Harry telling everyone that Voldemort was back, and being called a liar. The next year, everyone forgot he was right all along, and are back to calling him a liar. Lol.

.

The plot mandated stupidity in DH is something else, though.

#+begin_quote
  In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.

  ‘It's not stealing, is it?' asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. ‘Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?'

  Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, ”Er-mynee, ‘oo worry ‘oo much. ‘Elax!'

  And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: the argument about the Dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom.
#+end_quote

Foreshadowing that Ron was going to dip out when the going was bad. But then....

.

#+begin_quote
  They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left) and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.
#+end_quote

Like holy shit, Hermione kinda forgot +about the Iron Fleet+ that they had an invisibility cloak the whole time.

I waited for them to remember that Harry had a magical mokeskin bag, and Hermione had a magical extended bag, but instead they continued to wear the Locket the whole time, knowing that Dumbledore had died wearing his ring horcrux, and the Diary had stolen Ginny's soul over the course of a year. But in JKR's universe, people remember things based on whether or not they fit her final outline, /not/ because it's within their character to notice and remember. Furthermore, her plot demanded Harry's suffering and allegorical sacrifice out of Love.

** I love the HP books and would fight anyone who says they suck BUT I also completely agree with you. Literally every single point you have brought up.

If they are all not secretly evil then WHAT IS GOING ON?

One of the biggest mistakes JKR did was trying to make the HP series both a fairytale and a coming of age story. The biggest blunder that we can directly see where this plays out is how she tries to makes magic both a LOGICAL thing and also a MYSTICAL thing that can't be explained AT the Same time. It just feels like oil and water sometime...

So yes I completely agree with your post. Looking at the books through an adult's eyes makes you question so much. Like why do the good guys if they are good allow so so so many people to die??? Being one of the main questions

Edit: Another thing that occurred to me, something that royally pissed me off (even the first time I read the deathly hallows) WHAT was up with the whole 7 Harry Potters plot point??? What was the point of that? They could have done so many other DIFFERENT things. The biggest reason they give is /the trace/ but once that falls why couldn't they just portkey out or apperate out?? Or some of them fly and some of them portkey and some of them apperate?

If it was a children's story, then adults can read it with children and children can also read it themselves. If it's a coming of age story adults can read it because they understand the process while children can read it to learn some valuable lessons when they grow up.

And there are a lot of other little things like that...

Anyway, Harry was in deadly and dangerous situations at least 3 times a year, yet he never did anything to learn how to protect himself and his loved ones better, until Hermione forced him to (and that was mostly motivated by their lack of education by Umbridge, though Voldemort was a secondary concern at the time).

Concerning Ron leaving during the Horcruxes hunt, while I will agree that Ron did have valid reasons to be worried about his family, I feel that he knew what he was getting into, Harry told him everything he knew from the start and even tried to convince them not to come with him. And it wasn't even the first time Ron turned his back on Harry...

But I do agree that they were ill prepared and that they should have asked for help from the Order. That said, Dumbledore didn't give them much informations to go on so it was pretty much impossible to really prepare IMO.

As to why I consider this such a traitorous act (I don't know about others but that's my opinion)? It's because it's not the first time it happened (and at times when Harry needed him). Hermione for all her faults, never left Harry, not in COS, not in GOF and certainly not in DH.

Which I mean flakey freinds are fine but in this case Ron flaked off specifically when Harry's life is in incredible danger, and both times he always left after they had a big fight,, and both times it left harry alone with none but hermione to really trust. None of that is Rons fault however, hes a kid and honestly both him and harry are victims to the general incompetency and/or cruelty of the older characters. Ron's never had a proper year to confront his family about his self consciousness and inferiority issues and harry has never had the opportunity to give someone space because they ussually die on him when he does that.

**** I don't really think Rowling meant for Dumbledore to be manipulative and the Philosopher's Stone shit to be set up as a test for Harry. I won't deny that it certainly looks like that when considering the entire series, but book 1 was still very much a children's book, and a common trend in many children's adventure stories is that adults are aloof, incompetent and don't listen to the children when they have something important to say, therefore having the children save the day.

Not putting the Philosopher's Stone under a fidelius is easily explained as well: Rowling hadn't invented it yet.

I always take the clues for manipulative Dumbledore with a grain of salt, especially when they come from the first book.

As for Ron, I completely agree with you. He's just a kid who acts the way you would expect. He's actually significantly more loyal and brave than I would expect from most people (especially as a teenager). Yes, he abandoned Harry twice, but he regrets it instantly both times. In GoF, he still helps out Harry by giving him the clue about the dragons (through some intermediaries) and it's probably just his pride that won't let him admit he was wrong and acted in anger. As for DH, he literally couldn't find them after he left and cooled down.

Hell, with all the positions Dumbledore holds, he must have some gold in his vault. A donation to the DMLE, and no one has an excuse but to investigate the claims. Add to that a Harry Potter who woud be willing to take Veritaserum, and not only can you prove Voldemort is back, but you could even have Sirius exonerated if you play your cards right.

****** Fudge was minister though and was doing everything he could to squash any mention of Voldemort's return. Combine that with the fact that people like Lucius are keeping things quiet (presumably) and it's much harder. Veritiserum isn't flawless either. What if he had a memory charm? He'd think it's true but isn't. Not that he did but any argument on why it isn't true would be used. Harry got shit on by skeeter in year four too and many people will believe what they hear in a trusted news source and it wouldn't be hard to believe that fudge issued a gag order or whatever to keep the prophet from reporting Voldemort being back anyway. I think Dumbledore was banking on Voldemort wanting to know why he was destroyed that night badly enough and desiring to end Harry enough that he would do whatever it takes to get the prophecy. If dumbledore “feeds” snape info to take to Voldemort implying the prophecy is the key that would make him even more likely to want to get it.

******** True but Fudge thinking he's out there doesn't matter because in the book isn't he shown as a person who cares more about being minister than doing his job as a leader? I think he felt he would be replaced if Voldemort can be back. I always felt like he's an ostrich, sticking his head in the sand in the hopes the predator won't see him. Plus I think he is shown as willing to listen to the people with the most money. If that happens to be Lucius convincing a paranoid person his cushy position is being threatened? Plus a healthy dose of fear of what would be done to him and maybe his family if he has one. I read one fic where he was the least worst option out of all the options at the end of war which could be plausible seeing as scrimegour replaces him and he wanted Harry to make the ministry look good and all.

******* Yeah I agree, but all it takes is a seed of doubt, isn't it? I mean, on one hand you have Cornelius Fudge. On another hand you have Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter. It's not hard to determine who is more respected in the public's eye. Of course, like I said, that was until Dumbledore let the slander get to the point where everyone thought he was senile and Harry was delusional.

But then again, would I prefer reading Dumbledore making long public speeches to him dueling Voldemort in the Ministry atrium? Fuck no.

******** Didn't the idea of Dumbledore being senile start much sooner? I think I remember in book one Gryffindors saying he's crazy but great or something. The biggest thing too is that I don't think Dumbledore would be willing to go as far as Voldemort. Bribery and threats and all that. Dumbledore should have stepped up far sooner but he didn't and either it was because he wanted peace (stupid but something he'd probably do with his whole redemption thing) or he legitimately couldn't even if he tried. Sadly we can't know because it's written from a child's perspective plus Rowling wanting it similar to a fairy tail.

*** Well, we don't really know what old Dumbles was actually doing. We see the story from Harry's perspective. I think it's likely that Dumbledore was furiously researching Horcruxes after second year, finally realizing how Voldemort achieved immortality thanks to the Diary. Gathering all that information and puzzling it together can't have been easy.

He was originally probably planning to take care of all the horcruxes himself, only to get cursed by the ring due to a moment of inattentiveness brought forth by finding the Resurrection stone, which he'd been looking for for almost a century. Then he didn't teach Harry advanced magic, most likely bc Harry (1) wasn't ready to learn advanced magic - he barely passed most of his subjects in school, apart from dada - and (2) Voldemort is way too powerful to learn how to beat in a year. Instead, he gave him as many tools as possible to find the Horcruxes (without saying it outright bc the Harry Potter books are essentially Mystery novels and spoiling the mystery at the start of the book doen't make for a good story).

** I mean, I loved HP as a kid. The Wizarding World and Hogwarts was the stuff of dreams. But having grown up and read more widely, JK Rowling is an overrated, lazy writer. She makes up stuff as she writes (lol) and still tweets completely irrelevant information that do nothing to fill the absolutely gaping plotholes. Her characters are OOC, she chucked one of the most interesting characters, Sirius, under the bus for the sake of advancing the ‘plot' but dear Harry spends 6th year battling hormones. WTF?! Its waayyyyyy more likely for Harry to behave like the typical edgy HP from post-OOTP fics. And that says a lot about Rowling's writing. The ‘villains' are less-developed than the bad guys from 90s cartoons. What made HP exciting was the initial premise of the story and the world-building. But now, thinking about it, the world-building is actually extremely contrived and limited.

Even the newer YA fiction series such as Hunger Games are better written. But then again. when browsing the Teens section at a bookstore recently, I felt disgusted at the lack of diversity and creativity of YA series. Maybe we've just outgrown HP. As such, HP fanfics appeal to us much more than just a modern retelling of fairytales.

** I think the Harry Potter series suffers quite a bit from its popularity.

The books are really great (as evidenced by the still huge fanbase if nothing else). Even though Rowling dropped the ball a bit with the last books, the story is still compelling and the end is satisfying and heartwrenching (ignoring the epilogue).

The problem is that they start to fall apart under scrutiny; The world Rowling created -while wondrous and compelling- is wildly inconsistent, the heroes are passive and act illogically, the villains' (especially Voldy himself) motivations and intelligence are suspect, etc.

As long as you don't really think too much about it and suspend your disbelief, the series is amazing. However, analyzing and discussing canon is exactly what a fandom does.

And of course, the older and more cynical you get, the harder it gets to refrain from using logic to pick the books apart, suspend your disbelief and think like a child.

Put someone like Clausewitz in their shoes and book 6 will look differently, but Clausewitz had a long military career, I'm not sure he'd do all that well at 15.

Same thing goes for the rest. How often did you see people do dumb shit in real life because they didn't want to deal with things right now? Yeah, Voldy is a motivator, but Dumbles is still around at this point. Procrastination kills.

  WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY CAMPING?
#+end_quote

Because all it takes to be utterly FUCKED is one mistake. They stay with Remus and someone spots him buying more groceries than usual? Voldy pops in for a visit. Remus gets caught and legillimenced? Voldy pops in for a visit. And the second the trio goes down, Horcrux hunt is a bust and the Death Eaters basically just win.

It would be possible for them to stay somewhere if that place had a proper insurgency training, because insurgency is what they are doing right now, and they have entire MoM against them with all its resources. Which includes addresses, and then even Fidelius may not be able to save you, assuming the good guys even have anyone capable of casting it in the first place (Shell Cottage could have been done by Dumbles ahead of time).

#+begin_quote

  Why the hell are you wasting human resources on guarding a prophecy when you can fiendfyre the shit out of Malfoy Manor?
#+end_quote

Because killing someone in cold blood is psychologically very hard thing to do. Some people can't get over it even with a training, I remember seeing a documentary about SAS where one of the instructors basically said that no one can guarantee that a guy will pull that trigger when the time comes, but they can increase the likelihood with good training. Training which a bunch of teenagers had no idea even exists, let alone how to do it.

THe older members of the order, however, are implied to go for the kill. Not at the end of book 5, but that is likely to keep their squeaky clean(ish) rep with the public and not be arrested by the ministry.

Oh, yes, let us midrape someone in a jolly fashion, they did it to us first. Again, how many people would be comfortable with sorta-revenge-rape? Sure, the trio did it, but with great reluctance, and that is as it should be. I think people tend to forget just how incredibly invasive and creepy Imperius is - it is an Unforgivable for a reason.

*The real problem: Dumbledore*

Yeah. If he had a better plan, a lot of things would be fixed, mostly the training issues. But then and again, what you see here is a de Jomini approach that by some miracle worked: have a grand master plan that will stop the war with the least casualties possible. It ended up working - there was some killing, but for the most part, MoM just chucked muggleborns and dissidents in Azkaban. Sure, it sucks, but they were released and hopefully got a good therapist afterwards.

If the good guys went ham with their violence levels, well. Look at what happens to most insurgencies. Warsaw ghetto uprising, Slovak National Uprising, Hussite wars - the insurgents lost them with various levels os severity and even the people who refused to fight were met with harsh reprisals.

Dumbleplan avoided all of that, but it had one problem: if any single thing out of a huge list went wrong, it was all over. We simply don't know what Dumbledore's backup was, maybe something set up with Flamel or ICW, we were never told.

*De Jomini and Von Clausewitz*

This is an interesting bit, because it answers a couple of things. I have no doubt - JKR had no idea about these two gentlemen, but it still fits.

These two are authors of two major doctrinal approaches before WW1, de Jomini advocated a general having a plan and every officer further down only knowing his part and carrying it out. It had advantages - the plan isn't revealed if an officer gets caught, you can pull off some impressive stuff with it.

The other, von Clausewitz, had a different approach. Tell your officers what their rough goals were and what the overall plan was and allow them significant amount of initiative. You don't get perfectly executed master plans, but you are able to react incredibly quickly and exploit unexpected opportunities. Interestingly enough, this is how medieval armies worked - provided all the nobles were on the same page and not engaged in petty or not-so-petty political struggles (which they most often were).

Now, you may notice modern militaries are following Clausewitz - WW1 and WW2 proved him right, and the last vestiges of de Jomini were in doctrines of Warsaw pact. And the idea of soldiers and officers having their own decisions to make filtered to us through books and movies, doubly so in long-time NATO members countries. (And by the way, yes, movies from Soviet bloc countries place a lot more emphasis on generals or leaders and army as a collective as opposed on individuals)

But not to Dumbledore. He was following de Jomini approach. And what you see in the books are its disadvantages - frustrated officers and soldiers not knowing why they do what they do, infelxibility, and so on.

*tl;dr*

Yeah, more proactivity would be nice, but characters can and should make stupid choices, rash choices and choices that reflect their limited knowledge.

I do enjoy fics that go for "let's make Harry more savvy" route, but that doesn't make them somehow superior to the orignials. Well, except the Malfoy thing in book 6 thing. That was just stupid.

Harry needed to find and destroy the Horcruxes; that was the only way to defeat Voldemort. If you show him training, it would amount to nothing since that training wouldn't have mattered. It also explains why Dumbledore didn't train him beyond lessons about the Horcruxes.

Having said that....Harry did not know this. He thought he'd have to actually defeat Voldemort, which presumably would be accomplished through feats of magical strength. So he totally should have trained harder and restarted the DA for his friends. And the DA would have been beneficial for the other students to fight the enemy, which was necessary.

My big issue with the Horcrux stuff is that a) Dumbledore clearly seemed to know more about their location and how to destroy them. I really can't buy that in the entire time he was aware of their existence, he could only find and destroy one of them. And did he explain to Harry how to destroy them? That I forget.

** I agree with you on a lot of these points but had canon been more logical as you described then Harry Potter would have been a completely different story. From a purely narrative sense, having the adults actually do something would have been a bad idea for JKR. Regardless of the plot holes and other issues, we all loved reading Harry Potter so clearly JKR did something right.

1) It would have taken the focus away from Harry. Considering that Harry Potter is objectively a kids book then it makes sense to give the younger characters most of the agency.

2) It would have created a power creep scenario. If you have the adults fighting the same enemies as Harry, then you have to explain how Harry and company are surviving in fights against well trained adults while also acknowledging the skill gap that would naturally come from age and experience (also not being a teenager).

Point 2 gets addressed a lot in FanFiction by giving Harry a quick power-up so he is on par with the adults but I often don't see this executed well.

** I disagree with most of this (caveat below) for one simple reason: They were kids. Deeply traumatized kids trying to hold on to a sense of normalcy while the world was falling apart around them. They still trusted Dumbledore at this point because, well, what other possible chance did they have?

Now the ADULTS! Screw them and Dumbledore's inaction, they should have been far more proactive. The only theory that explains their reticence is the "Most of society agrees with the Death Eaters but don't like violence." IE, if they retaliate, then instantly everyone turns on them. Which, given the whole snatchers and the ministry rolling over, might even be right (the wizarding world is a pretty terrible place).

I'm sympathetic to their camping as well: They KNOW that the other adults are useless and filled with spies, and that finding the Horcruxes is the only way to win. Yeah, they didn't do perfectly, but see point 1: they are kids, not resistance fighters.

Especially if he is deprived of love, because he would want his friends to survive. Like, this is harsh, and in no way is it actually Harry's responsibility, but you can't argue that student casualties would have been lowered if the DA spent the sixth year studying as well.

Like, I'm not expecting Harry to gather an army and march to the Malfoy Manor. But I do expect someone from his position to at least continue the fucking study group that he specifically formed with his friends so that they wouldn't die.

Honestly, a child should have had nothing to do with being a war. Also, realistically, a child who was raised abused and/or without love tends to have sociopath personalities or be more mature than than other children of the same generation.

** Is no one gonna mention maybe JK Rowling is shitty at writing that revolves got to do with Art of War, like don't get me wrong, she a great author, but she started as a author writing children book for children which slowly become for rated E or T or Adult as the Philosopher Stone fans become a decade or two older. The only thing she write about War in HP is Battle of Hogwarts and Only Battle of Hogwarts, which is just a siege of a school in a nutshell, which isn't even that great let alone perfection. Like why is no one riding on a bloody flying broomstick.

A fan of the series in the internet even expected some student, quitditch players fighting on a broomstick at the end of the series before Deathly Hallow even release or being written.

And you people expect the author to write Dumbledore to do some decisive move during the war or prepare for it before it even began.

Plus, in his defense, he's the most powerful wizard of all time, does not mean he's the greatest Wizard "General" of all time. In war between Albus and your average Muggle General of the Army, which I dunno about you isn't your average human being since becoming a General of the Army, let say USA, isn't a small feat to achieve. No doubt Albus and his own army, wizard or Muggle soldier, will not get destroyed but slaughter.

He only become the Leader of his own Order, because he has the charamistic and power to lead. To fight against Voldemort, he didn't study and train to lead and win the War.

** Re: students' actions in 6yh year, Dumbledore

People don't always make perfect, completely rational choices and decisions. Especially when they haven't been trained for things like guerrilla warfare and torture resistance. They also often have poor coping mechanisms for dealing with stressful situations.

Criticising their actions is one thing, and probably even has some merit to it. Criticising the accuracy of their actions for their psychological profile is another thing entirely.

Also keep in mind that the contextual setting surrounding their actions is not the real, "muggle" world but the magical one instead. One where they had the rather pazifistic Dumbledore as their mentor figure, one where Dumbledore fed Harry bullshit lessons about VD's childhood instead of actual battle magic sessions, and one where all this Dumbledore's bullshitry turned out to work exactly to a hairtight precision. And the in-universe explanation for this is that the muggle-world common sense and logic is not applicable to the magical world, and there are very intricate and esotheric forces at play (prophecies, wand lore, soul magic, love magic, oath magic, etc) that can ultimately determine the outcome of even country-scale conflicts.

Out of universe, you can criticise the entire setting for being too unrealistic and thus useless for teaching valuable lessons to its audience. But that would be a completely different topic of conversation.
