a) doesn't he have one in his office/quarters?

b) why wasn't he in there in the first place? Helping Filch polish trophies in the middle of the night?

c) are we to assume that teachers don't have dedicated bathrooms at Hogwarts and just use the same ones as the students?

d) does this imply there are no bathrooms in obvious places e.g. by the common rooms or Great Hall?

e) was he DRUNK at the school??

  Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon --- or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.

It's not that unusual for people to be awake and active at 5:30. He was out doing Dumbledore shit, as Dumbledores do, presumably on the seventh floor since that's where the Room of Requirement is, needed to take a leak, took a wrong turn, and ended up finding the Room.

A better question would be why did he walk down that hallway three times looking for the bathroom.

*** To explain the walking past three times, I've always imagined it happened like this:

He was heading down some random hallway on the 7th floor and when he gets to the end of it, he's like, "oh! I took a wrong turn, fuck I really need a bathroom!"

He turns around to go back, but as he reaches the end of the hallway that he started at, he's like, "damn, I really gotta go. Maybe there is a faster way to a bathroom back that way." And turns around and goes back down the hallway.

At this point he's passed the place where the room would be 3 times, but he's like, "fuck it, I'll go the long way." He turns around, AGAIN, to go back the way he came from, and this is when he sees the door to the ROR and being Dumbledore, he investigates, and finds a bathroom!

*** Ah but it's never specified that you have to walk in front of the door thrice in a row - could have been three different occasions of him walking by thinking “I need to pee” and on the third it showed up.

** Old people don't have as much bladder control. He could have been talking to a painting then BAM he has to go NOW.

As for the three times thing, I've always thought that was for intentionally unlocking the room. If you're walking the seventh floor in desperate need then the room will appear regardless.

** Of course he was drunk.

He was trying to convince Snape to get a haircut, wear a nice suit and go out and have a drink with a nice young witch from the ministry. Instead Snape started bitching about Harry again. Completely worn out by Snape, as anyone who has had to deal with other people's never ending drama can be, Dumbledore took to swigging some firewhiskey and wandering around the castle. That's when he stumbled onto the Room of Requirement

*** Exactly. Dumbledore's placement as headmaster at the time was slipping and Hogwarts was under threat of becoming the domain of death eater sympathisers. He'd framed his aiding of Harry as an eccentric, foolish, and weird old man's story about incontinence that "just so happened" to contain valuable infomation about the room of requirement. If he'd told Harry directly that he knew of a room where he and his friends could go to escape Umbridge's oversight and train -- and that discussion became known to the many people who wanted to depose of Dumbledore -- then he'd be taken out on the basis that he was actively defying the education reforms. Harry might also be implicated and face serious consequences.

Maybe this is a real story, maybe not. But I think it is. It's plausible. I don't see why, in Dumbledore's many many years at Hogwarts, an incident like that wouldn't have eventually led to him discovering the room. In a sorta infinite monkey theorem kinda way. Either way, it helped Harry and was a smart move.

There aren't. They have been wedged in where there's some free space and where the plumbing runs through.

** Everyone has been caught off guard before by having to go to the bathroom. It's not just old people. You get side tracked exploring, plotting, and like someone else said doing Dumbledore shit and suddenly you realize you have to go. You're on the seventh floor, we don't know exactly what is on the seventh floor. It's a massive castle with moving stair cases and passages built long before in door plumbing was a thing, it might not have a bathroom. He can't apparate. In a panic he paces and does the pee pee dance up and down the stretch of hall. When the castle answers his prayer and a bathroom appears.
