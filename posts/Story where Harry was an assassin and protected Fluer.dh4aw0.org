Hello! I'm trying to find a story I can't remember the name of. Harry is an assassin/mercinary who is tasked with Fluer's protection. He has a brother, and lily works at Hogwarts while James is an Auror. I think he also had a demon armor suit thing, but that might have been my imagination.

Thank you in advance!
