** People on this sub don't hate H/Hr; in fact, this sub is probably way more accepting of the pairing than most other HP forums, except actual H/Hr-dedicated forums.

But, if you're wondering why people hate H/Hr in general, it's mostly due to the fans of the ship.

** Ok. Let's say you're going to write a Harmony fic. You like writing good and realistic relationships, so you think about what both characters need in a partner. You write down something that seems very important for each of them:

1. Harry really needs and appreciates humor.

2. Hermione loves arguing--as a sport, and to keep her mind active.

Uh oh. Looks like you've got some issues, because you also notice that:

1. Harry does not find Hermione funny.

2. Harry hates arguing.

These are very, very hard issues to deal with. You could always give Harry someone to joke with, and Hermione someone to argue with, but then you're going to have an even harder case to make that they belong together, instead of putting Harry with the person he finds funny (Ginny's pretty funny!) and Hermione with the person she loves arguing with (boy does that Ron like to argue!). Or you could try to figure out how to make Hermione come across as funnier. Maybe she has the hots for Harry and starts taking lessons from Ron on the things he finds funny--puts real concerted effort into it to show him that she loves him. That'd be cute! And maybe Harry can learn to tolerate arguing, instead of blowing his lid when people do it around him--It's hard to see him ever enjoying it, but if he put effort in, too, then sure! Maybe it would work. If you wrote that? I'd read that. Each character trying to change themselves to make sure the other's needs are met. Maybe it's ultimately a doomed relationship, but it's one worth writing about, reading about, and it's also one that will /start in the first place/.

...

But you know what's easier than that?

We could just make Harry not need humor so intimately! And we could make Hermione just not enjoy arguing! Then they fit perfectly together!

And that's why I hate Harmony. Because, regardless of what you do to make sure they never get together with Ginny or Ron (itself generally a very tricky thing to do), that Harry isn't acting like Harry. And that Hermione? She's not Hermione.

(Hope that helps)

*** Ginny is deliberately written to be the perfect woman for Harry, so I won't argue with that.

The assertion that Hermione enjoys arguing, however, has always been one that baffles me. Unless someone can point out in-text confirmation that Hermione actually likes arguing, I don't think there's any evidence for it. It's telling that whenever Ron and Hermione have an argument, they usually end up ignoring each other for hours or even days at a time afterward, and whenever she and Harry have an argument, it almost always ends with Hermione in tears. JKR has further implied in /that interview/ that Ron and Hermione's arguments aren't as constructive as R/Hr shippers claim: if the author says you'd probably need marriage counseling and that you're 'fundamentally incompatible', it's likely those shouting matches you've been having aren't really as sporting as you thought.

In all honesty, none of the canon trio are particularly good for each other. H/Hr has its issues and so does R/Hr, and it probably would have been a better idea to leave them all as friends. And doing so would have pushed romance further into the background in the latter half of the series, which is always a plus since Jo is an at-best middling, at-worst terrible romance writer.

***** My evidence there were books three and four. In PoA, when Harry and Hermione aren't talking for a long-ass length of time, Harry honestly doesn't really seem to care, and needs to be told by Hagrid that they should make up. In GoF, when Harry and Ron aren't talking for a substantial length of time, Harry is flat-out miserable, and comments things to the tune of "things were just a lot less fun with only Hermione around."

So I do think that humor is an incredibly important part of intimacy to him, and a pretty necessary attribute of whoever he gets with. Whether it's /necessary/? No, probably not--but you'll need to work twice as hard to put him with someone he doesn't find funny.

***** And Hermione lacks a sense of humour? News to me. I know people get hung up on ships, but this "they would NEVER EVER be romantically involved" stick is getting old. People are not one-dimensional. They are not caricatures. If Harry couldn't stand her they'd not be friends. If he can stand her, they can fall in love. It's not as if love is rational, nor is it as if everyone has just one soul mate and everyone else is out of the running. (Not to mention that in canon, Ron and Hermione made it work, and Ron arguably is about as fond of humour as Harry.)

I think people are too extremist in their interpretations of characters. And base far too much on the last few books, where everyone was acting out of character for plot reasons anyway. (That people even think a time of war when all three were under the influence of a horcrux they stupidly decided to carry around with them would be a fair showing of how they normally interact with each other is weird in itself).

****** Hermione doesn't have /the/ sense of humor that Harry has. There's a difference. Also let's be real, she's not very funny, which is more the point.

And as for Harry not standing her, they're less than comfortable around each other when Ron isn't there to act as a buffer. In fact, IIRC when Ron isn't there they become rather awkward study mates (GoF, HBP?) or Hermione cries a lot/overcompensates (DH).

Also it's rather presumptuous to call an author's writing out of character for her characters because they're going in a direction you don't like, but okay

******* "/The/ sense of humour"? Do you honestly think people really can't have some flexibility, or enjoy several kinds of humour?

And do you honestly think that Ron shares Hermione's sense of humour? Further, there's an easy explanation for them being awkward around each other: They miss Ron/are under a lot of stress/are under the influence of a Horcrux.

Again: If Ron and Hermione can make a relationship work, Harry and Hermione can do so as well.

With regards to OOC behaviour, Dumbledore is the best example of how a character is acting OOC just so the plot won't get derailed. For all his supposed wisdom and experience, he's a victim of the "adults are useless" trope throughout the books. And he's not the only one - everyone is forced to act like an idiot just so the plot is not derailed.

The point being that they miss Ron in a way that Ron and Hermione together don't miss Harry. The point being that they don't have the easy relationship the other pairs in the trio have. The point being that Hermione treats Harry like her younger brother, not relationship material. But okay.

** I don't think it's this sub specifically, though fanfiction definitely seems to be an outlet for some H/Hr shippers. I would imagine most non-H/Hr people have back buttoned an otherwise decent fic because of the pairing.

But I think there's another reason why Harry/Hermone is particularly disliked within the fandom.

First of all, canon!Harry and canon!Hermione together is out-of-character by it's very nature, so right away at least one of them is going to be OOC. On top of this, Harry/Hermione writers frequently demonize Ron, Ginny and/or the entire Weasley family in order to make sure their pairing is morally in the right or simply to make things easier. It's definitely possible to write a Harry/Hermione fic where Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione relationships fall apart naturally, but it's rare.

A pairing like Harry/Draco can exist while leaving the Ron/Hermione pairing intact. Hermione/Draco can exist while leaving Harry/Ginny intact. Obviously there are writers who tank Ginny to make Harry/Draco work, and writers who tank Ron just to make Draco/Hermione work, but one of the two core pairings is unaffected.

*Harry/Hermione /requires/ OOC behavior from Harry and/or Hermione, and it /generally/ includes in OOC behavior from Ron and/or Ginny. It ruins both of the two core pairings, and it turns the the trio dynamic upside down, which is an important pairing even if it's not a romantic one.*

So a lot of fans dislike it more than they do a pairing like Harry/Draco.

**** I have many arguments, I will begin with one on each book. If you want more don't hesitate to ask me (and I don't bother to be downvoted, most of them are idiots who worship Emma Watson (and not Hermione) like a goddess) :

First book: It may have been before the three were friends but am I the only one finding her annoying ( I know it's no). How she follow Harry and Ron everywhere like a lost puppy and then snap at them (with the three headed dog for example)

Second book: I don't know you but I wouldn't want for any reason anyone taking my appareance. Who does the little bookworm think she is to polyuice someone else. I like karma and I would have liked that she looked like a cat for the rest of her life.

Third Book: Her pet is a cat. Ron's pet is a rat. Ron was sad and angry that his rat (seems to be) was dead. Couldn't she just say sorry even if she don't think it. For God sake, can't she understand that her friend is sad and try to be mature.

Fourth Book: Can we talk about the fact that Hermione KIDNAPPED, TORTURED and let Rita Skeet IMPRISONED? I really don't know how with the polyjuice fact and this she didn't land to Azkaban. And after that she reprimand Harry for the Sectumsempra he used on Draco.

Fifth Book: The book where Hermione created the DA, said to him that it will only be a few one and invited the whole world. The same book where once Harry get caught, she let Harry suffer even if she was the one who created the DA.

Sixth Book: The book where Hermione decided to be the most annoying. Harry knew Draco was a Death Eater but she was: "No Harry, let me do the thinking in this group. If I didn't discovered that Draco was a Death Eater first how could you? After all I am the most intelligent bitc.. eh witch of Hogwarts." (Just this book I will give a second argument) In this book Hermione attacked Ron because he had a girlfriend (Seriously?) And in the fourth she snapped at him because he was jealous of Krum.

Seventh Book: Same as the sixth. Harry knew that the Deathly Hallows where important but Hermione said the same: "Harry, who is the most intelligent bitch? I am. So stop thinking and just kill Voldemort:

Epilogue: Did she confuse someone so Ron could have his Driver License? Please someone put her in Azkaban.

** I myself don't hate the pairing (in fact IMHO it makes way more sense than Hermione/Ron who in my oppinion would tear each other appart (or at least would have had a divorce by now!) - as long as Hermione tones her high-horse-I-am-always-right shit down a little and Harry at least tries to do better in school etc. (show some curiousity man, try to learn stuff that's not needed for a) class b) quidditch or c) survival (note: On the last one he IMHO kind of still fails...has a dark lord after him but doesn't at least dedicated an hour or two per week to extra curricular studies? - Damned, he really must have wanted to die!)))

In my oppinion they make a lot of sense:

- they bring out the best in each other
- they compliment each other (she's the best at theory and he's the one for practical application)
- they have a similar enough background
- she'd know better than any other witch that Harry might need a therapist (can't go to one because they usually don't know about magic)
- she knows there's things that are off limits (talking about the Dursleys)
- he'd support her ambitions
- she has never betrayed Harry at all (while Ron does so all the time)
- etc. etc.

Still, I do dislike the pairing if the author does it wrong like turning Harry into Hermione's whipped yes-man (seriously, for all his flaws, the guy does have a spine!) or turns her into a bimbo (sorry, if that's what you want? Pair him with Lavender or something!) :(

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. *For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night.* And he also happened to be a wizard.
#+end_quote

(That's the very first paragraph of PoA, emphasis mine)

It bothers me a lot when people say that harry doesn't care about school or learning, or isn't curious. "Doesn't care about learning" seems to be pretty much entirely a fanon construct with little to no evidence from the books---as for "isn't curious", that is not only not evidenced, but also blatantly untrue; An uncurious Harry wouldn't have searched for Nicholas Flamel, nor tried to find out what was paralyzing the student body, nor stalked Malfoy for an entire year...

.

I'm also a little confused where you're getting a few of your other ideas from:

#+begin_quote
  she has never betrayed Harry at all (while Ron does so all the time)
#+end_quote

I can think of three occasions when Harry felt betrayed by Ron:

1. GoF, when Ron didn't believe Harry about putting his name in.

2. OotP, when Ron didn't tell harry anything about order business and Grimmauld Place.

3. DH, when he apparated away, immediately regretted it, and returned to find H&Hr gone.

I can likewise think of three occasions on which he felt betrayed by Hermione:

1. PoA, when Hermione got McGonagall to confiscate his Firebolt

2. OotP, when she wouldn't tell him about order business/grimmauld place

3. HBP, when she was trying to confiscate his copy of Advanced Potions Making.

Those three occasions are neither "never at all" nor "all the time" -- for either of them.

#+begin_quote
  He'd support her ambitions.
#+end_quote

As far as I can remember, Harry takes equal part in making fun of her for SPEW and her homework habits, and does not, in fact, support her ambitions.

#+begin_quote
  she knows there's things that are off limits (talking about the Dursleys)
#+end_quote

What evidence is there for this? For her respecting of limits, her having some intuitive idea of what his limits are, or even that the Dursleys are off limits to talk about??

.

Finally, I'm confused what either of the following have to do with being a smart match.

(Divination and History of Magic were his worst ones, and History had the excuse of him receiving the vision, while who cares about Divination?)

**** Yeah he wants to know about Flamel because it's a damned secret (no one is telling him, which sparks his curiousity - but he is NOT curious about school work and spells, he never asks a teacher questions or tries to do better (extra credit))

As for Ron:

- he didn't believe Harry about the tournament and was even to much of an ass to tell him about the dragons!
- I agree on OotP but that wasn't what I meant (if it were then Hermione also betrayed him because she also listens to Dumbledore and doesn't even think about a phone-booth or muggle-mail!)
- Ron's leaving in DH was also one of my examples
- but there's other things: He doesn't speak to Harry after he learns that the ORPHAN has a little money (sorry, but Ron's an ass!)

Yeah, sure Hermione goes to the teachers a lot and that's wrong, too (I think Harry should really have told her off countless times - I mean she wants to know his secrets and feelings etc. but the book never says she spills the beans herself if something bothers her, so why not leave Harry alone?) and she also worships authority (teachers, books etc.) which is wrong, too but it's always with good intentions - Ron's betrayals never have a good intention, no: There's selfishness and jealousy and that's it (oh, and stupidity - come on the guy knows that he'd give up everything he owns for a chance to even talk to his parents for a few minutes, much less to have them back completely!)

Of course he does support her, he defends her from Malfoy etc. (sure he sometimes makes fun of her, but he isn't wrong here either: She really goes above and beyond and it's hurting her, too like having no friends except two boys (come on she doesn't have any female friends her age - Ginny doesn't really count either as they don't seem especially close, not as close as the trio at least!)

Of course that has something to do with it - they have both a lot of potential (Harry is damned good at practical magic, despite shoddy education especially in defense and with her bringing his theoretical knowledge up to speed and him helping her with the practical aspects they'd go far IMHO!) and could bring that out by helping each other!

  He didn't believe Harry about the tournament and was even to much of an ass to tell him about the dragons!
#+end_quote

Then how do you think Harry found about them? Sure, Ron didn't tell him directly but he found out nonetheless.

#+begin_quote
  but there's other things: He doesn't speak to Harry after he learns that the ORPHAN has a little money (sorry, but Ron's an ass!)
#+end_quote

When was this? Anyway, Ron feels awkward and jealous and he has the right to do it. Most people would feel jealous of Harry, who gets all the attention and has all the money. Ron has six siblings to compete with for his parents attention and his parents have very little money. Most people who have families don't appreciate them either. It's human nature.

  Of course he does support her, he defends her from Malfoy

Ron does that too.

****** Found out is not "Ron told him" is it? :(

Yeah and Harry has a right to to tell him to bugger off (sorry, but I think he should have really told him where to stick his jealousy, just like he should have told Hermione where to stick her bossyness!), also:

Ron isn't competing - he's got no skills (ok: Maybe chess!) that make him stand out, his brothers do and Ginny has the "I am a Girl!"-Bonus! - he's given up years ago!

I know - I don't like mine as much as I should (Oh, I do love them, but sometimes I'd rather have a vault full of gold, too - at least that vault wouldn't try to run my life etc.!)

Of course Ron does defend her, but otherwise he's not a great friend (much less a great boyfriend...he's a prat with the "emotional range of a tea-spoon!" -.-)

They are - but I bet Harry would be more motivated to learn if his girlfriend wanted him to :) (especially if she promises him a reward later!))

**** All you really need to do is set it a few years post DH. Barely anybody marries the people they date at 17 these days. The characters would be much more mature, so the emotional binaries people are posting here wouldn't have as much effect. I suppose you could argue that that's OOC, but only because there's nothing really defined until the epilogue on.

I read plenty of fanfic anyway, but the fact that there's so much undying love between teens has always bothered me. I've never written HP fanfiction, but if I did (and wanted romance) I'd almost assuredly write it with the characters being a little older. What I wanted from girls when I was a teen is far different from what I wanted from women in my twenties. It might be OOC from my teen self, but it's quietly clearly still me (I might have SI myself into myself though).

**** While I'm not the person you replied to, personally I think that the most likely way for this to happen would be for them to try, have the whole thing crash and burn, and then give them a reason to try building something on top of those ashes.

We do know that Harry needs humour and can be quite sarcastic if given the possibility, just as we know that Hermione needs her trivia and needs to occasionally argue; those needs are there because they are emotionally ... not fully stable, and it means that if they were to limit themselves to each other the whole thing would crash and burn because of there being no way for them to satisfy those needs. And that, normally, would have been an end to their relationship. bBut there are people who, when given proper motivation, can take whatever it is that crashed and burned for them and try again, differently, try to change themselves for the cause; the same thing applies to relationships, and if both of them were given a reason to actually try they could build something on top of those ashes because they would be more mindful then of each other's hurts and needs.

Admittedly it would be hard because that's quite a mature approach to romance and stuff, but they already are capable of being friends so clearly they can be in each other's company without issues so there already is something from which to change so that they could be compatible as a couple, and change brought by something that makes sense in the world of the story isn't out-of-character. The only question would be how exactly to make them motivated, but I think it something for a brainstorming session rather than something to throw a haphazard idea for and do whatever.
