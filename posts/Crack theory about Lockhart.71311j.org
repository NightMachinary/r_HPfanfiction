Lockhart is actually taken over by a SI - just like in linkffn(Magical Me by Publicola), but that's exactly why he's so incompetent. In an alternate universe, Lockhart is a true hero throughout the Chamber of Secrets story book, so when a SI wakes up in /this/ universe's tale, he believes he has to match all Gilderoy did in the story he knew, thus, a man who keeps fucking spells up, but keeps trying and pretending he's awesome anyway.

Because Real!Gilderoy actually is awesome, and is the only wizard capable of performing the tricky and nearly impossible feats described in his books.

Too far fetched?

*** Dumbledore also knows about the curse on the position and wanted a bit of revenge because Lockhart had memory charmed a few friends of his...

*** Hence why it's a slightly crackish idea. The idea is, he's competent, but his books are written as adventure stories rather than actual factual textbooks or boring details. Gotta sell what sells. And yes, he's still an exhibitionist, and a dandy fop, and slightly immoral, but still massively competent under it all.

*** Ahh yes /strokes beard/ let's use my school as a resource to reveal a memory spell spamming criminal. What's this weird feeling I'm getting??? .. Children.. education.. school.. Hogwarts... hmm, probably unimportant. Yes. This is a good use for a school. - Albus Dumbledore

Tune in next time, for magical creature care with Fenrir Greyback!

** I wonder if anyone has done a similar premise for other disliked characters. A "Magical Me" version of Filch, or even Mrs. Norris would be funny. I can imagine someone who genuinely thinks they're a perceptive reporter ending up in Rita Skeeter's body.

** Sounds plausible like JKR actually Rita Skeeter theory.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.
