I started reading Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals by mugglesftw linkffn(12738075) and realized since right now it only has one chapter I would love to read others that are complete. Anyone find stories like this? I don't even know how to search for this kind of fic on FFN or Ao3.


** Jesus Christ people it was supposed to be a joke.

***** Good stories! Quality fiction! And lots of it!

Also for authors to not burn out because of demanding readers so they can continue to write.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*** A joke well executed is the best joke of all. And there's too much heart and emotion in that one chapter to make it a real joke.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys wins really sucks.
