I have been looking for one that interests me that doesn't involve fire-arms. I am fine with Weasley and Dumbledore bashing (I prefer it actually). Any recommendations are appreciated!

  Harry and Hermione decide to make a soul bond, despite not really knowing what they are doing. Horlarity ensues (portmanteau of "Horror" and "Hilarity"). This short story is not to be taken seriously.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** To clarify it doesn't have to have bashing in it, I'm fine with it not bashing anybody. I just like bashing in stories like this because I don't think Ron would react well to their relationship. Thank you for all the recommendations so far!
