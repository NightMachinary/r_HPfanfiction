I forgot the name of this tomarry fanfic. I can't find it anywhere. It's about Harry going back in time to try to change the future of Voldemort by being the adopted father he needs. In the first few chapters Harry wants to earn his own money with a job he finds as working in sewing clothes. He buys a fixer upper house for him and Tom and goes to find and adopt the boy.


** Harry goes back in time and rises Tom. He also has a love partner etc.\\
Never read it, but saved it for later since it looks interesting ^^
