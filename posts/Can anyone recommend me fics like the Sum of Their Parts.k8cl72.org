linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts)


** This is a oneshot, but-

*** This was /excellent./ Seriously, if anyone has anything else even remotely as good, I'd love to jump in. It reminds me a bit of Ruthless by AngelaStarCat linkffn(10493620). Entirely different premise but similar vibes.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

  Harry knows that everyone would be disappointed in him. Hell, he's disappointed in himself. But he just doesn't see any other way to change the rotten structure of wizarding society.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
