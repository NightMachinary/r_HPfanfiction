The Riddles (as opposed to the Gaunts) are a traditional Pureblooded wizarding family. Tom Sr. is a Wizard who wakes one morning to find himself bedded with a strange woman in a strange room somewhere out in Muggle London. A girl who 'just wanted to have some fun' (Merope), and was unlikely to succeed in seducing anyone naturally due to her disfigurations, has made a disgusting (not to mention /illegal/) habit of hunting, drugging, and preying on handsome men so that they would indulge her in any way she wanted. Tom is her latest victim.

Worse: she liked Tom so much that she eloped with him without his sober-minded consent.

For sympathy, Merope acts the part of a pitiable young woman who only wants a man to love her for who she is rather than for how she looks. She expresses her long-held romantic desire for a handsome man (like himself) who would intentionally attend her without mind-altering aids. Naturally, her pleas fail to move him and she calls in a family friend under a ruse of acquiescence to Tom's demand to move forward with an immediate anullment. This 'friend' is a skilled hypnotist. Gratuitous 'therapy sessions' ensue.

The wedding is small and simple. Tom's family feverishly and vehemently tests for potions and Memory Charms. Naturally, as the means by which Tom is being manipulated are not magical ones, the tests prove negative. Tom Riddle is blasted off of the Riddle family tree.

But wait: it gets worse!

Tom's sweet, darling wife Merope isn't just a sexual predator and manipulator: she is also a wanted, sadistic, and terrifying serial killer whose face is as-yet unknown to the authorities but whose Modus Operati is as sickeningly distinctive as her brothers'. Merope, for reasons unknown, was simply of a mind to 'Play House' with someone on a whim. As her family - the Gaunt family - is not at all a normal one, Merope wanted to try married life for a little while; just for fun. Unfortunately for Magical Britain, she chose to marry a Wizard who was more than happy and willing to educate and demonstrate for Merope all that Magic, Wizards, and Witches could do. And explain what they couldn't do. And mention how helpless he would be without his wand. And theorize on what loopholes to Magical defenses could be easily exploited by an efficient and pragmatic Squib.

Unfortunately for Merope, however, her mad behavioural inconsistencies and manipulative tendencies are consistent enough to be overtly suspect and Tom finds his own way of fighting his mental conditioning. As a result, Merope becomes increasingly short-tempered and volatile as she surely and steadily loosens her mask of a caring housewife. She eventually stops caring about subtlety altogether. Tom is horrified to discover how surprisingly capable and efficient she, a woman, is at putting him low, wrecking his escape plans, ruthlessly slashing through any defenses he might manage to erect, and domineering over him as he begs for mercy. /Him/. A man blessed with /Magic/.

Consequently, Tom doubles and triples his efforts to get away from her... which, of course, incites her to act increasingly irrationally to try and get better control over him. Merope even gets it into her head that there must be 'another woman' for her 'quiet husband' to be acting out like this. And so, Merope Riddle nee Gaunt begins her criminal foray into Magical Britain to rid herself of the 'Competition'. Starting with Tom's ex-fiance - a Pureblooded cousin. From here she begins to fixate on exterminating all the Pretty Witches. The Aurors, unfortunately, are baffled by this rash of murders. They are also unwilling to consider a pathologically violent Non-Magical source.

Muggleborns, however, are not as detrimentally limited in their investigation theories by such rampant classism as "Only someone who is Magical could harm another Magical!" Since the Purebloods have shunned him, and the Halfbloods think he is - at best - an incurable incompetent; or - at worst - absolutely nutters, it is to the Muggleborn Witches and Wizards and the Squibs in their Muggle Police Force and Forensics teams that Tom must somehow acquire aid from to stop and put down his mad, mad wife.


** This is glorious. What about the parseltongue? Does she use snakes to mark her victims, or is it like the Christian 'speaking in tongues'?

*** I imagine that charming and handling deadly snakes are a Gaunt family 'thing' and that they do mark their victims with them in some horrifically macabre way. Any actual Parseltongue skills would have to come from the Riddle side of the family.

Bonus points if Tom Riddle Jr. /fakes/ his Parseltongue later on and succesfully herds and controls various snakes and their behaviour via normal expert-snake-trainer means. üêç

** To expand (in perhaps a cracky way): Merope takes a break when she gets pregnant with Tom junior, and it turns out he's just as psycho as her, just as disfigured, and suffering from other disorders as well. They finally kill Merope, only for Junior to kill them in turn. No one can figure out if he has magic or not- he's highly resistant to damage and hysterically strong, but doesn't outright cast any spells or use obvious magic. He escapes and takes to wearing a mask to hide his disfigurement. They allegedly kill him, but nothing they do seems to truly stick...
