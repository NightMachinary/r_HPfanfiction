A lot of the time when I see marauder fics they're a little OOC given the stuff we actually know about them. Is there any realistically portrayed marauder fics that follows along with canon, that includes the bullying and assault and everything with no prettying it up or ignoring it happened? Where James acknowledges he was completely gross to Lily and goes into how he fixes that? Or where Sirius realizes that what he almost did to Remus, and even to Severus, was completely wrong?

Can be any pairing/rating/etc. Thanks for anything you can contribute!


** Ooooh, good request. I don't have anything to hand - most of the fics I've seen that actively embrace that "James is an arse" thing tend to glorify Snape completely (not a lot of room for 'no angels here, everyone fucked up' ambiguity in fanon, despite the prevalence of 'grey!Harry' fics) and I don't believe I still have any of those fics bookmarked as I'm not a big fan of that kind of sin-washing (I'm also currently resorting my fic bookmarks after piling them all into one folder to make Fanficfare with Calibre easier, so I haven't got everything back in folders yet), but I'll post if I find I have anything.

I hope someone else posts stuff! :)

*** Shoot, if you did magically find them I'd be willing to read those as well! I don't Snape erased of all mistakes/sins, as I enjoy my Snapey angsty and stupid, but I'm willing to put up with it just to find something that actually treats James how he should be treated and not ignoring everything wrong he did :)

Thanks for commenting, though!

**** It's possible I will, but not likely, sorry. I have another thousand fics left to sort (and the seven-hundred I've already sorted have given me a hundred category folders) and I recognise literally none of them, so I'm likely gonna end up needing another age to read through to know how to sort.

But yeah, it's a real shame there aren't more fics like that. Genuinely-Reformed-Bully is such a fascinatingly empathetic idea to explore, and doubly so, since I imagine a not-insignificant portion of the people here were probably bullied or isolated nerds and that kind of redemptive change-over-time arc of a bully would probably have some therapeutic use for those experiences.

I might actually take a stab at the idea, once I finish my current batch of fics (not HP, in case you were going to ask, I'm a Life is Strange writer atm) as I've had something similar happen to me - in A-Level, I became good friends with a couple of people who'd bullied me in secondary school, and in secondary school I became friends with a kid who threw a half-brick at my head one time. :D
