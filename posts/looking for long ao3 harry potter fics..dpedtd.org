I finally got an ao3 account, not that I couldn't read on it before I just never really got around getting an account. but I followed an author over, so in for knut in for a galleon.

anyway, I am looking for fics that:

1. are long, 20k+ words, and aren't available on fanfiction.net.

2. I dont care which pairings there are or if there aren't any.

3. I would prefer no cross over fics, I dont have time to research the crossover universes enough to understand it perfectly.

so give me your favorites, your least favourites, and everything in between.


** A favourite of mine drone ao3 is Future's Past it's a time travel fic so stay clear if that's not your thing same with Fem!Harry it's 40k+ pairing Orion Black/Fem!Harry linkao3(Future's Past by darkseraphina)

** Seven Names linkao3(5265569) is very good. Not 100% perfect, and it's not full of butterflies and sunshine and rainbows, but I rather enjoy it.

 

Whispers in Corners linkao3(1134255) is perhaps my favorite completed Ao3 Harry Potter fic to date. Yes it is a crossover with the BBC's Sherlock series, but the few bits of plot from that show that are relevant are explicitly spelled out(pardon the pun) to Harry when they come up. No knowledge of the TV show is required.

 

Face Death In The Hope linkao3(5986366) probably holds the title of "favorite Ao3 HP fic" right now. It is less action packed than some might wish and definitely slower paced and more introspective than a majority of fics (over the 207k words so far, technically only around 3/4 days have elapsed in story). But the topics the characters are dealing with are heavy and significant enough that that sort of devotion of time to them is completely appropriate. And the strength of the fic is definitely in its characterizations and interactions between characters. There is also a companion fic showing alternate PoVs that only add to this strength

**** Time wise the Sherlock fic "takes place" between seasons of the show for 90% of the fic. So in terms of plot that Harry "needs" to learn is just the very very general/basic "Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant detective who is an ass to basically everyone" sort of stuff.

 

If you like time/dimensional travel fics, and especially characters from different timelines/alternate universes interacting, than Face Death In the Hope is definitely the fic for you. That particular element is my pet pleasure (or whatever you call the opposite of a pet peeve) and is a big reason why I love Face Death In The Hope. (it's rather similar to Stages of Hope in that regard)

***** I replied to someone else, but I am kinda afraid of time travel fics. I'm willing to try them if they have good recommendations, but for some reason if I were to pick them out myself they end up reading a little better than my immortal. lol every fic usually gets about 5 chapters to truly catch me so I at least try to give them a chance.

I'm looking forward to these reads now.

Resurrect The Living by fascinationex It's been a while since I last read this, but I do remember it having a rather interesting premise.

*** linkao3(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) is an excellent story and the author's central masterpiece, one of my favorite stories. It's the most original take on both fem!Harry who befriends Voldemort, Horcrux Voldemort as compared to main Voldemort, and general concept of Harry as the Master of Death and what that means. It's also possibly post-canon from a certain point of view.

linkao3(My Immortal Lily and the Art of Bringing Me to Life by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) is an excellent horror story that crossovers over the above story with My Immortal in a wonderfully terrifying way. If you've ever read and enjoyed Philip K. Dick's "Ubik" then you'll love this one.

** linkao3(Realignment by Puzzled) Author's summary: "The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about."

An excellent depiction of Grindlewald's war and what it means to the wizarding world, character studies of young Tom Riddle and Dumbledore, and amazing worldbuilding that shows how truly magical and fantastical wizards can be, while at the same time keeping true to the books' theme that "older" magic does not mean greater or more powerful, and that the wizarding world is progressing, not losing the glories of the past. Also contains time-travel, well-intentioned extremists, and both main characters growing as people.

** linkao3(14800721; 15457248) are part of the Black Sheep Dog series (375k+ words). It starts off with Regulus surviving and his parents getting involved. What makes it really good is how each Black family member is portrayed. Sirius's parents are humanized realistically. The whole relationship dynamic is engaging to read

linkao3(16801360) is Lucius POV crack fic (30k words). It's pretty funny.

linkao3(4789040; 12801672) has Hermione waking up in the 1940s. The first listed is the unofficial prequel. She and Tom Riddle are a thing, and both are really competent. Riddle is very creepy at times. This goes very in depth into the Wizarding World of the 1940s and has a lot going on. This fic is how time travel fics should be set up if it is a planned time travel.

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...

** All of these recs are Remus/Sirius as that's all I read. So from my favorite author, works that are specifically over 20k:

linkao3(Do Not Disturb by fluorescentgrey) and its sequel:

linkao3(Heelstone by fluorescentgrey)

linkao3(Seven Simple Machines by fluorescentgrey)

I really would recommend all her stuff, even under 20k, because it's really just very well-written.

And I've already rec'd this a few times in this sub but I'll throw in a self-promo here and say my own:

linkao3(Let Slip the Dogs of War by itallstartedwithdefenestration)

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

*** So the main reason I asked for recommendations is because there's something to be said for when someone recommends a great fic. I mean I can message them and geek out a bit, and pick out parts that tell me, hey I can see why they like it.

Also, I know it's a general request, but I wanted to open up my reading preferences, having someone recommend something I may not be interested in right away from a summary is kinda the name of the game here.

However, I appreciate you setting that search up for me. I'll book mark it.
