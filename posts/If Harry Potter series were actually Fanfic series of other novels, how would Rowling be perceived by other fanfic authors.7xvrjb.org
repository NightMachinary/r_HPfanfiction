I m really curious how HP series would be judged if Rowling were a fanfic author and wrote the series as a fanfic series. I have seen many fics that I honestly feel much better written than Rowling herself.


** She would probably get slammed by the whole HP/HG community, as well as for having likeable, competent Weasleys and a non baby-eating evil Dumbledore.

  “You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”

  “Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”

  “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” /[that moment, when even Severus fucking Snape is your moral superior]/

  “Meaning?”

  “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter ---”

  "But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”

  Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, “well ... I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry's best interests at heart ---”

  “He's not your son,” said Sirius quietly.

  “He's as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?”

  “He's got me!”

  “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?”

  “Fred --- George --- NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley shrieked.

  Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.

  “FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE WAS NO NEED --- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS --- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!”

#+end_quote

I wouldn't say that, if you think about it. He's extremely manipulative, everything he's done was to end Voldemort, and one of the only plans he actually failed was the one of him losing the Elder wand ownership to Draco. He's actually really fucking cunning and used Harry as a puppet all along and acomplished his goals, which was ending Voldemort.

Yes, he can be called a disgusting old manipulative man, but you can't say he wasn't capable of following and orchestrating and executing his plans. Remember everytime he gives Harry advice that will come in handy just later on the year, where you know Harry would be fucked otherwise. The Mirror, Fawkes, The Time Turner, his knowing that the blood Voldy took from Harry would be his undoing (if you don't remember that passage, it goes along these lines "And Dumbledore's eyes twinkled when he heard that" or smth like that, during Harry tale of the Third Task, you can check the books. Also, he knew from the get go that the only way to get the Ministry believe Voldy was back, was by shoving him to their faces, so he manipulated the events, somewhat, to generate a trap at the DoM, because if you think about it, why not simply destroy the prophecy and be done with it ? If only Harry NEEDED to hear, he could've told him whenever he wanted, but he needed Voldy to show up. And the rest is just his plans regarding the DH and ofc Harry's assisted suicide/sacrifice, his best manipulation ever, fucking over with Snape's mind and using guilt as his weapon, and forcing Harry to be the "good guy" and die for everyone.

If you really think about it, Dumbledore is a phenomenal character, but he's a disgusting manipulative person. Also, his "flawed philosophy" was followed perfectly, "The Greater Good" was actually achieved by sacrificing Harry's childhood and most of his life for killing Voldy. So yeah, I hate Dumbledore, but he's, in my opinion, the best character Rowling made.

The weight was already looming over Harry regardless of Dumbledore's feelings and desires for a ‘happy childhood'.

Even if you consider that maybe Dumbledore thought Tom was gone for good until he wasn't (and that clearly isn't the case) the weight of being Wizarding Britain's savior is still heavy and Harry had nothing for a defense.

We know how the story ends, so we know what should've been done, but we can't know what we would've done if we didn't. About the prophecy, I think telling him about after either second year or fourth year would've been the ideal, but definately not later, because just then Voldy was back, he was gunning to Harry (he fucking orchestrated Harry's inclusion in a tournament, with a 8-month plan just to kidnapp the kid, he's pretty obsessed) and he wasn't going to stop, so idk. There's argument to be made that he shouldn't ever tell him the prophecy because Voldy could've read from his mind, but like I said, its really hard to know how one would've acted in Dumbledore's shoes.

As a victim of an abusive half-brother, let me tell you that saying you care and not backing it up hurts a lot more than simple indifference. All Molly did was sent food when Harry was starved, instead of you know, actually doing anything about it.

And Arthur is the incarnation of incompetence. Hogwarts has a library so independent study is a known concept in the magical world.

Personally, I think Rowling would be viewed as an overall good writer, though terrible at large-scale world-building, forming a coherent and consistent magic system, and biased against Slytherin. Rowling's Universe would feel too small, even if the magical world is much smaller than the non-magical. There would also be a lack of nuance for many topics, especially for the first two or three instalments. People would criticise the minute details as well - some harsher than others.

Isn't the Thrawn Trilogy in Star Wars extremely popular? Isn't it exactly about how not everything will magically be okay just because the Imperator and Darth Vader are gone?

I think it's extremely interesting to think about systemic issues instead of focusing on getting rid of the big bad. Magical Britain is a very dystopic society and ripe for the taking by anyone devious enough to take advantage (Fudge, Crouch, Malfoy, Voldemort). Voldemort is a symptom, not the problem. There's no reason to leave fantasy tropes behind...

************* The Thrawn trilogy is "popular" at best. Now, "Return of the Jedi" (in fact, the whole OT) is /extremely/ popular.

And that is the story with the satisfying narrative. "Realistic" fiction doesn't appeal to everyone as much, and also often is better in the context of another work - say maybe the Star Wars OT?

Which is why a lot of fanfiction is popular in the first place, for example robst is immensely popular - but I doubt he would succeed in writing original fiction, because his works are enjoyed mostly in the context of the original books

To make my point more clear: "Realism" appeals to certain people, yes. But it often isn't narratively satisfying.

Rowling will sacrifice everything (worldbuilding, characterization, realism, ...) for a good story if she feels like it helps her story.

And if you don't like that, that's fine! Try other authors, GRRM comes to mind, and many other authors as well - but it simply not the focus of JKR. She prefers her neat wrapping up with "realistic" (grimdark) endings.

************** I feel like being strawmanned a little bit. I'm not saying that a story absolutely *has* to go this route. Simple stories can be great! I primarily objected to the notion that a (popular) fantasy story has to do the whole 'defeat the big bad' thing as the final conclusion.

In particular in Harry Potter it was a mistake because the narrative isn't framed in a way where Voldemort can be blamed for everything. For example in LOTR Sauron is a corrupting influence and everything and defeating him basically fixes most of the problems. It makes sense and is satisfying. Killing Voldemort for good fixes none of the big substantial problems, just some of the immediate and most pressing ones.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters are most often compared to WW2 and it seems as if that comparison was intended by JKR. Imagine if Germany had no Nuremberg Trials, no radical change in society and culture and just returned to the Weimarer Republic as it was before Hitler came around. Germany was ripe for the taking by Hitler and just assassinating Hitler wouldn't have magically solved all the problems Germany (or the rest of Europe - it's not as if just Germany was somewhat unstable) was facing.

******* Snape being on the good side was not some sudden out of place decision. It was foreshadowed from Book 1 itself. Draco also not being as bad as he seemed was a plot point in Book 6. Both their turn-arounds are also important to Rowling's overarching themes of love and choice.

....what?

As for the pairings, I don't like them either but the groundwork for both was also present well before DH.

So none of these are sudden developments. They were all culminations of clues Rowling had scattered throughout the books. They're also YA novels, and a lot of stuff (eg: incompetent adults) are tropes; you're reading it like it's dystopian fiction.

******* Right. Rowling paints a pretty grim picture of the Magical World (biases, corrpution, backwardness) and ends with a scene where it is shown and told that /nothing/ has changed, except that everyone is older and has children. Slytherin's are still evil scum (though Harry doesn't care if Albus ends up there!!1111), Magicals disregard Muggles (and probably Muggleborns too), Draco smirks and the steam engine makes "toot toot".

I wouldn't even have blinked an eye if they somehow re-elected Fudge, now that the Dark Lord crisis is over.

Harry Potter is one of the many works that falls onto the middle of the spectrum.

Do you have a rec for this? Because while I have liked certain fics better than canon, they're a matter of preference than actually feeling like they were of higher quality. I've never actually come across a fic that captures the magic and whimsy of Rowling's HP.

Not "much better", but better. Rowling's series would still be a very good fanfic: The books are well edited (pacing!), there's no typos and grammatical errors, they are finished (not abandoned) and have some semblance of plot, characters and themes.

If a Fanfic hits all these points it's probably already way above average... maybe >80%?

And then there's the fact that it is easy to forget all the groundwork those fics that may be "better" rely on. Would they be just as good without all those established characters and worldbuilding to fall back to? It's a very iterative process and very doable to just omit some of Rowling's mistakes to become better, but it's a bit unfair competition.

** Well, that is hard to say since what many appreciate most is not her writing, but the world she built for us to dive in. I would like her "fics" for including a lot of everyday life and for having plot lines that are independent from the main plot. I would not love her characters however, since many lack depth and the plot holes (time turners...cough) would make me a little crazy.

** 2 things that I feel she is great at. Characters that are well built and overall realistic. (not perfect but believable. The characters grow, are memorable and are not perfect.)

Second, a world that is fun and brings out the wonder that is the strong point of the booka. The world is really cool.

Not as good stuff, the systems are flawed. Quidditch makes near 0 sense as many of us know. Magic system is not perfect. Parts of school don't make sense etc.

The plots are not perfect as well. It well written and fast enough but something are just too perfect. Like voldermort not putting a horcrux in some mad impossible to find place or overseas or something. The plots could be better.

** There are fanfics that address and satisfy Rowling's plotholes and weaknesses better. Making them appear better than the actual canon novel. But "appear" is key. Cus they are based off of Rowling's character/setting/world foundations and their strengths based off Rowling's weaknesses. Thus, without the original canon, these fanfics wouldnt make sense.

Example 1 would be fics that fix the triwizard tournament to something that would actually be enjoyable to watch. ie not staring at the surface of a lake for an hour. But a lot of these fics are working off the base knowledge and interest the readers already have in the triwizard tournament. Many fanfics will also throw in jokes referencing the canon tournament's faults that wouldnt make sense or be funny without the reader's interest in the canon tournament.

Example 2 would be fics that brilliantly point out Dumbledore's manipulations and do an exceptional job of having the fanfic characters confront Dumbledore's negative sides. A fanfic would be considered higher quality if it did this in a better fashion than a less-well written fanfic pointing out the same flaws. However, readers enjoy this cus they see the wrongs of canon righted. Without canon's mistakes, they wouldnt care about Dumbledore being brought to justice

Although, i think those invested in the fanfic world develop a whole set of fanon characterization/background/setting/magical world. Thus, they can appreciate references to the fanon world rather than the canon world. Such as fics that dont really establish Evil!Dumbledore, but readers are still able to follow and sympathize with anti-dumble characters due to having read previous fics where Evil!Dumbledore is better developed and established
