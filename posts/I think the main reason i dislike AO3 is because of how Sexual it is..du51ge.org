Now don't get me wrong i am not a prude and enjoy me some sex and porn everyonce and a while, but I've noticed especially in the HP fandom on AO3 their is alot of kinks and just sex in general in stories where i wouldn't expect it. I read fanfiction to relax and have never been into sex scenes in general so thats probably why i don't use ao3 all that much, besides the abysmal lack of tag limits and oversaturation of Drarry.

To expand on this, i read for the story and sex scenes tend to not add anything to the story


** Fanfiction did a big fic purge years ago where they got rid of fics past the M-rating, fics written in second-person PoV, "X reads the books", and songfics. Anyone who wanted to read and write higher rating fics moved to Ao3.

This wasn't helped by LiveJournal dying, and being bought out by a Russian conglomerate that moved the servers to Russia, bringing them under the jurisdiction of Russian law. In Russia, the law is strict on LGBT media. Or by Tumblr doing their big purge and ban of adult content after Apple deleted them from the Appstore because users reported seeing underage pornography on the site.

Ao3 is full of fandom porn not because it's full of creepy perverts and horndogs. It's because Ao3 is the only safe and reliable fandom space on the internet to post it.

**** FFN, unlike the notorious Wattpad, bans Real Person Fanfiction (RPF), fanfics that feature real life celebrities. An example of such a fic is "After", the infamous Wattpad fanfic that had the boys of One Direction in sexual situations. Second-person PoV fics that invite the reader to insert themselves into the story count as RPF, where the /reader/ is the real person, as opposed to Harry Styles or Zayne Malik.

"X reads the books" are banned because the authors that wrote them copy-pasted large sections of the original text, and just slapped in some reaction shots between every couple of lines. That counts as plagiarism, even if the author wrote the "JKR owns my soul" disclaimer at the beginning of the chapter.

Disclaimers don't mean shit. The rules of free use in fanfiction allows transformative content. Pasting large tracts of copyrighted text doesn't as "transformative", and FFN didn't want to get sued.

** Check out the rating before you start. Fics marked as Explicit tend to have a whole lot more sex than ones marked as Mature, for example. Also, there are writers who write different versions for Fanfiction.net and AO3, so check to see if that's the case (Ffnet ones need to be more tame because of the ratings there), so you can sometimes choose the version that's more appealing to you.

- Go to the general Harry Potter page: [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]]
- On the right side of your browser, you'll see a gray box with "Sort and Filter" at the top. Look downward to the bolded text that says "Exclude." Right underneath, click "Ratings" to expand the sub-menu.
- Click "Explicit" (and optionally "Mature") to remove those fics from the selection.
- Make any additional choices in the options there. I usually set the Language to the desired language (in the pull-down bar at the bottom of the gray box) at the bare minimum, but you can also: exclude or include slash, set a minimum or maximum word count, allow, disallow, or require crossovers, etc.
- Click the "Sort and Filter" button at the top or bottom of the gray box.

** So rewind this back before FF.net did their purge and you would have had the same issues there. Its not the site, its your inability to either filter things properly, or get recommendations that suit you.

Ao3 simply has a much wider range of fics because they are not censoring things like FF.net has been doing (to such an extreme that it is concerning). So it requires a bit more effort to search and exclude.

Both Ao3 and FF.net have issues with tagging with Ao3 often being overtagged and FF.net being criminally undertagged and both failing to police tags (although I dont blame them because its nearly impossible). So you are going to run into search issues regardless of site, but FF.net may be safer for what you want even if Ao3 is the way better site for finding unique and quality stories.

Also, while you claim not to be a prude this line....

#+begin_quote
  To expand on this, i read for the story and sex scenes tend to not add anything to the story
#+end_quote

Suggests otherwise. There is nothing wrong with being a prude if that is your personal choice. But lets be real here. If you think a sex scene cant add to a story, you are very far removed from reality or very against sex scenes. In fact, more often than not, a story that actively dances AROUND the sex scenes or anything similar, is less believable and less immersive. Sex is a part of real life and a realistic HP story would involve it, EVEN within Hogwarts itself amongst the student population. Although that is a whole other situation since one should be careful dealing with depicting minors in sexual situations. Note, I am not saying a good story cant exist that does not involve sex. There are plenty like that.

Personally, I only read Slash in the HP fandom. More specifically, *Drarry*. However, where I branch out from the majority of the Drarry fandom, I don't ship bottom!Draco with top!Harry...or versatile/switching. We're rare, my kind, so I have to constantly ask whenever I request a Drarry fic whose topping/bottoming.

I don't always have to read smut but I always ask anyway just in case. Very rarely will people tag sex positions or even if smut/sex is involved. They don't personally feel the need to do so. As the author, that's their prerogative but as the reader - at worst, it can either be triggering and/or uncomfortable; and at best - disturb the flow of the story by continuing skipping scenes. Which is a /*HUGE*/ pet peeve of mine.

*** You can use the tag for Drarry and just include Top!Draco or Bottom!Harry. It will mean maybe accidentally filtering some fics, but that's the trade off.

**** I've been doing so. Still. Not all fics are appropriately tagged. I've been duped quite a few times even when I'm tagging 12 different ways to say the same thing. Also, the ratio between top!Harry and top!Draco is 4-1. Add in a couple of tropes, completed works, and over 50k word count, I've pretty much exhausted my options. That's not even factoring in if the story is actually well written.

****** I know. I have the same issue with in the Naruto fandom with the SasuNaru ship, though there does seem to be more bottom!Naruto fics compared to bottom!Harry.

** I don't object to the smut. I can just about filter out anything involving sex with any Malfoy, Snape and Voldemort.

What I object to is the filth of child abuse - surely it ought to be possible to ban anything involving raping literal babies. It is quite obvious that this stuff is written to give some pervert a thrill, there are few if any in depth analyses of the affects of abuse it's all three year old Harry in pink panties sucking off his dad or Vernon and getting to like it. Why the hell this is allowed I have no idea.

That's debatable. In the USA people have gone to trial and been convicted for writing/owning fictional child porn.

****** StarDolph did a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dgxi2t/comment/f3g86ab][reasonably thorough rundown]] of the current legal situation back when the fubar of the banned fics list went down on this sub.

tl;dr There are two set of laws which apply to fictional depictions of child pornography. One set only applies to visual media and is on shaky grounds of constitutionality, but it has not been struck down yet so it is still used to prosecute people. The other is the anti-obscenity laws which are more general and apply to all kinds of media, even fictional stories posted online.

The [[https://www.post-gazette.com/local/neighborhoods/2008/08/08/Writer-s-monsters-lead-to-obscenity-sentence/stories/200808080169][most recent case I know of]] was a woman who posted explicit pedophilic stories to a privately hosted pay-to-view website. She initially tried to use the defense you mentioned, that her works were thereapeutic for herself due to her own past experiences, but she eventually pled guilty to the charges to avoid going to jail.
