Need some lengthy stories with his twin sister as the central character---to clarify, I don't want fics where she is the wgwl and harry is the true bwl or stuff like that. OC-Centric. If you've read Green Eyed Monster by Sphinx-Legend, id appreciate something similar in quality and length. Slytherin OC is also preferable.

*** Was the one that came to my mind as well. It's pretty decent and I really liked the way the slowly shifting relationship between Harry and his sister was portrayed, IIRC. However, as a fair warning, readers have to be willing to swallow a certain amount of straying into Mary Sue territory, which I remember to be particularly bad during the beginning. showing her as a potion genius by helping Snape grading essays during her first year was particularly painful, even if it served slowly building something of a friendship later on

**** Oh yeah, I totally agree about that. When I read the fragment you mentioned, I almost dropped this fic, it was that ridiculous. I still didn't finish that one in the end (I reached 5th year as far as I remember) but this happens to many fics I read once the novelty wears off there is rarely something that pushes me to finish.

**** Honestly, it's not that strange to have the smart kid help grade homework and stuff under supervision. Back in the day I would do that in detention.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC

** There's Princess of the Blacks and its sequels. Harry's not called Harry though, but to my knowledge, the boy is the true boy who lived. It's very dark though, so if that's not for you, I'd avoid it. linkffn(8233291)

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** Have you read linkffn(Splintered Dimension by TheTruffalo) ?

Poppy isn't a Slytherin OC, but she's way darker and has a different past. There's no wbwl shenanigans, Harry is the de-facto BWL, but Poppy is meant to help him. Can't say much more without spoiling though. Be warned, there's a lot of angst. And Harry can be even more dense than in canon sometimes (relationship/tact-wise) and even callous at times. Overal, pretty much canon.

  "What do you mean Poppy doesn't know she's Potter! Why didn't you bloody well tell her?" James snarled at his former headmaster. He couldn't believe that no one had explained it to her in five years at Hogwarts. Lily spoke up from his side, "What...what happened to her while we were gone? How did she get those scars?" She whispered. (AU with humour, angst and romance)
