#+TITLE: So I am writing a crossover with Star Wars in a similar setting as the Chosen two, but a bit better and with Captain Rex and Cody. I have been wondering if I can implement different forms of the jedi or a vibroblade user to that of a wizard or witch for a Defense against the dark arts class?

I have been wondering how to implement a clone in a unique way as a teacher of hogwarts.


** I have no idea what the Chosen two is, but honestly I think the idea you've suggested sounds a tad silly. I don't get it, a clone knows nothing about magic, they know nothing about the Dark Arts, nothing about how to use magic to defend against it. Melee weapons are stupid in a society that can apparate, can banish people away from them, can vanish your weapon, can transform your weapon into a large rubber phallic object. A clone can't teach the students to do that. If sounds like you're trying to put something daft in because in your head it sounds 'cool' and that's fine, you write your own story for you. If you want me to tell you it is a good idea or good writing however, I won't do that. Magicals in Harry Potter, for all their quirks and oddities are incredibly powerful and versatile only held back by the competence of the public. Without effort they defy reality and shape it to their will. A Harry Potter magical in the SW universe will always be more interesting to me than a SW into HP because there is little to nothing a SW character can do that a magical can't.

*** Chosen two is a fan written story with ashoka and anakin. I understand what you mean, but I actually got this idea because of how in order of the phoniex, they taught actors fencing for the wand duels to make more interesting. My idea was actually taking that idea going a bit further. A clone doesn't know magic, but he is able teach the students how to fight. Heck they even made a fanfic with Deadpool where he taught them how to use guns.
