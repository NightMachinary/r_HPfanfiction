:END:
I'm looking for some post-war Snarry fanfic where Snape doesn't get the cold treatment from everyone. For example, Snape is in the infirmary and because he's depressed and angry, he said some mean words to Harry and Poppy and Minerva yell at him for making Harry sad. Or like any of Harry's friends being angry at Snape and telling him to either treat Harry right or they will hex him.

I read a lot Snarry fanfic where everyone is on Harry's side and they always tell Snape if they make Harry cry they will hex him and I feel like Snape should get some love or at least have Poppy and Minerva as allies. Because in a lot of the fanfic when Snape said something mean to Harry, Poppy/ Minerva sometimes say something like "oh I've seen Harry grow up and he didn't have a good childhood and if you make him happy than pray to God make him happy" to Snape and I'm always wondering why they say that when they ALSO saw Snape grow up and understand that he also had a shitty childhood, was bullied by the Marauders, and forced to play on the light and dark side during the war.

So if anyone have any recommendation where Snape at least have some support, Poppy, Minerva, Molly, Ron, Hermione, Neville, etc., please recommend them. Thanks in advance!
