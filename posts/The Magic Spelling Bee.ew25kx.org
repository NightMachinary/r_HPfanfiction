In an old post of mine a prompt that was never prompted came up about the spelling of the word Magic. My post discussed the trope of adding a k to mke it ancient magic or 'Magick'.

Now here comes the prompt, the more wack the spelling, the more powerful the sorcery. Hogwarts only teaches student magic, some people study more powerful magick. Dumbledore and Voldemort have discovered light and dark majik respectively. Noboy was prepared for Harry to come to the battle with in-depth knowledge and master of the ancient Majyx from the days when sorcery was nothing more but an incredibly powerful energy that a user shaped to his or her will. Harry has no need for wands, motions and incantations. With the knoweledge of majyx he can simply shape ge energies around him with his mind to do all that magic, magick, majik, majikth and majix plus so much more.

Naturally a crack fic one shot that would be very interesting if anybody wants to write it.
