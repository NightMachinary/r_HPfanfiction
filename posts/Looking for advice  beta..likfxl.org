I've got a fic that I started when I was super inexperienced so the first chapters are terribly cringy. I think the later ones are a bit better. I've got some good ideas on how to continue, but I can't find the motivation to write when I feel like nobody's going to read it because the first chapters are so bad. Because of this I've spent the last few months creating detailed plans for the plot of year 6 while procrastinating on writing the next chapter in year 1...

If someone with a bit of beta-ing experience could check it out and give me some tips on how to make it less bad I'd be really grateful. Also beta-ing for the next chapters would be greatly appreciated.

** I personally don't have the time to beta, but I just wanted to point out a few more beta-finding resources you might not be aware of.

There's beta profile functions and forums on FFNet, the beta-bartering thread on [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]], and if you go to the sidebar here there's a button-link to the sub's discord (apparently there's a way to request betas there, but I don't use discord so I don't know specifically how it'd work). You can also post to the Dark Lord Potter forum for writing advice and particularly... blunt feedback, if your skin is thick enough for that. A lot of the big names in the fandom hang around there (including some who are actual published authors) so you'll likely get some good advice.

*** Just a head's up, the beta feature on FFN is so outdated that most of the (thousands) accounts have not been online in years. It's 100% a waste of time to comb through that list; even /if/ you get a reply-- it's to say they don't beta anymore.

**** Huh, really? Maybe it just works for some of the smaller fandoms, I suppose. Makes sense that a twenty-year old fandom with a million fics would stagnate a little in places, come to think of it. :)

***** It's one list. For all fandoms. To manually comb through...

****** Shit, really? Dang. I feel mildly bad about directing people in that direction so many times over the last year. Woops. :D
