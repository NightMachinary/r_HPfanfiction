Now that we know a decent amount about Ilvermorny, I'm interested in fics where Harry goes there, whether he never attends Hogwarts, it closes, or he transfers. Other canon characters can be present or just Harry is fine either way. Particularly interested in how students can be chosen for multiple houses but then they have to chose one, so it would be interesting if a fic made use of that.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12048619/1/The-Ilvermorny-Champion][The Ilvermorny Champion]] by Vance McGill GoF AU! Lily and Harry escapes Voldemort during that dreadful Halloween night. Later on moves to the US with Sirius and Remus in tow. Then comes back for the Triwizard Championship. Its a great read, ongoing.
