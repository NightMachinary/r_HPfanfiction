Ok I know this is a bit of an interesting request. I stumbled across this on a recommendation from someone at some point (in this subreddit). It had BY FAR one of my favorite early plots. I found the direction taken immensely interesting. I honestly wish the early part was even more developed then it was as it had so much potential before Harry even made it to Hogwarts.

Sadly either the author has abandoned it, or its taking months to update. I was crushed when i realized it was not complete. For anyone who has read it, do you have any like it to recommend? (hopefully complete or at least consistently updated).

--------------

I guess I could explain what its about, but then i might be spoiling things for anyone who has not read it. Soooo... Ill just post the initial plot start. Also....

*SPOILERS*

Harry is a twin, and its his brother that has the scar, and Harry is assumed to be a squib. He is disowned and hidden with the Dursleys to protect him (albeit a harsh way). He ends up developing powerful magic, running away, and being trained in secret by Nicholas Flamel before changing who he is, and going to Hogwarts.


** "I'm still here" might fit your definition in parts. It has an older Harry thrown into another dimension (where there is a girl-who-lived) go to Hogwarts under an assumed name after meeting the Flamels. Definitely powerful.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
