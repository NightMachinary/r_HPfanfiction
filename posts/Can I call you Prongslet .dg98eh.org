The entire concept of fanmade nicknames is extremely annoying. I cringe everytime I hear or read, "Prongslet". Something I love to read is crossover fanfiction, I don't know why, but they can be very interesting if they have a good plotline. But then the word 'Progslet' pops up. For me, this is like a cockblock, totally turns me off to the story. What about you guys? Example of the story I was just reading,

"I know you're my son Harry. But if you don't want me to call you that, I won't... though I hope you don't mind me calling you Prongslet every now and again."

"I dropped my birth name to forget my past. As long as I'm never called Harry again, I don't mind being called Prongslet."

STOP IT! It's like ruining a perfectly good fic with an annoying af nickname. Who even came up with this shit? Holy #@$&.

Have you read any story with an annoying nickname like this that made you want to strangle the author??


** Prongslet, cub, pup, I dislike them all. But Mione takes the cake for me. It's not hard to use one extra syllable and say her full name. Nine times out of ten, if I see Mione anywhere in the story, I drop it. As far as strangling the author, I once saw Harry call Luna "Lulu." I don't remember what story though.

*** I don't mind a Mione that's like, rare. Friends shortening each other's name once in a blue moon because they feel particularly lazy one moment is cool with me.

If that's the only way a character refers to her, ehhhh yeah I start to dislike that.

**** I don't even mind exclusive usage as long as it's from her partner because Mione is exactly the kind of slightly annoying pet name partners like to use.

But everyone calling her that would feel odd.

*** I only like ‘Mione when it's something like Ron saying it while eating. If it's used rarely it's fine, but if that's pretty much her name now it's terrible.

Once read a fic where her nickname was Mia or something, but that fic was full of a lot of dumb shit.

**** I don't mind a fic where Lupin's wolf has a ‘pack' but it has to be something he really struggles to understand and accept, as per his canon hatred and rejection of his condition. Agree that canon Lupin would never use pup or cub. Fenrir can use it fine the au fics where he's not a slavering monster. And I wouldn't even protest Sirius using pup; his animagus is so much a part of him that I can see him using pup just to be annoying.

** I used to hate Prongslet but my standards have gotten so low over time that I don't even mind it anymore.

What really sets me off is the horrible Gred and Forge, HA HA get it? it's like Fred and George BUT THEY CHANGED THEIR INITIALS IT IS SO FUNNY what revolutionary comedy.

Tbh, My Immortal had the best nicknames. I'll take B'loody Mary over Mione any time.

** I hate it when they call Harry Prongslet. It's so cringy... It doesn't even make any sense either! "Prongslet" wtf is that? that'd be like calling Sirius' son Padfootlet or sth. Prongs is just James' nickname. It would be way more logical if Harry had his own nickname, or if they planned on teaching him to be an animagus too and waited to give him his nickname when he had his own animal form.

*** It's only his nickname because his antlers stick out like prongs. Wormtail is a rat with a thin, bald, pink tail. Padfoot is literally the only one that isn't just 'what's your most easily identifiable feature?' and even then, I'll bet the footpads are the only part of him that isn't black.

** Mione gives me a pause every time I read it, but that is pretty much the only one I dislike. (Well other than in The Accidental Animagus, where Sirius calls Harry Pup and Hermione Kitten, despite the fact that Harry was a cat animagus from a young age and so literally turns into a kitten.)

"Hello Hazzy" James exclaims to a 1yr old Harry with love "You're a cute little baby, aren't you. You're my little hazzy. My lille haz. Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle!"

Lily finishes her work and looks at a sleeping 5 month old Harry. She starts stroking his hair. "Oy little Hazzy. What are you up to? Sleeping? Dreaming? What are you dreaming about, Haz? Ah, you're so adorably cute!" Lily squeezes harry's ickle hand.

*** As pointed out above, Lupin wouldn't use animal related nicknames because he hates being a werewolf. His self-loathing is the biggest reason why he is an utter cock in the books, so him suddenly being all cute about what half the fandom sees as magical AIDS is very off.
