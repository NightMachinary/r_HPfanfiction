** It depends on what you like, of course. I'm happy to make more targeted suggestions if you provide more info about that, but I can offer a few suggestions and my reasons for them.

For canon compliance, fleshing out more background: linkffn(The Snape Chronicles). It goes through Snape's life from childhood up to the Battle of Hogwarts. (Some of Harry's behavior in canon really was objectively rather questionable.)

There's also an alternate ending by the same author, where Voldemort understood the Elder Wand a bit better, and defeated Snape instead of killing him - leading to some interesting post-DH times as Snape deals with the aftermath of the war. Both stories are complete.

For a deeper exploration into what magic could do, there's linkffn(The Arithmancer) and sequels, all now complete. I recommend it with a caveat that Hermione can be considered a Mary Sue, and indeed I gave up on the series for a while as a result. But I think it pulled things together well by the end. I find it's best if you consider it a worldbuilding exercise.

For a very different take on the Harry Potter universe and Harry himself: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). It's highly divisive and tends to attract downvotes for the abrasive protagonist and intermittent author tracts, but the prose is solid, the plot is complex, the antagonist is fantastic, and it's overall a very thought-provoking (and dryly funny) read. I recommend trying it out, because it gets mentioned a lot; if you don't like it, you can then say that you've tried it and you're sure. If you do happen to like it, there are various fan sequels.

And just for fun, there's linkffn(Minuets in B Minor). Incomplete because it's an ongoing project, to collect samples of humorous typos from other stories. From a privet sorting ceremony, to fabric insight, to the Bubotuber puss; the whole thing has an admirable non-ruble quality.

I don't know what exactly you'll find in the other SH archives, but I can start a trawl with the basic "random fic" feature in one of the SH archives and get an ok hit for my Snape addiction ;)

**** Hey that's fair. Is there a particular character or pairing you do feel drawn to? Maybe we could help direct you to some more specific archives based on your character preferences.

SH is clearly ran by Snapefans who want quality Snapefic. I'm not sure what else is available for other preferences.

Would love to help you if there's a character or ship I've seen a good one. Or a kind of plot or mechanic you've liked. Sometimes that's all you need for a new wiki-like rabbit hole :)

***** I'll honestly read mostly anything with a few filters, for example, while gay relationships are fine by me, the majority of them have some form of Draco/ in there which has the same problem with snape. although I think that Draco deserved a redemption arc as he was only a child under his father's influence, in 90% percent of the fics it's an overnight thing which is just ridiculous. Also, the few slash stories that I have given a go seem to be very sexually charged and while I have read fics with lemons in them which I genuinely thought were good (For Love Of Magic) it mostly isn't for me.

Some ships are just silly. I have tried to enjoy post-Hogwarts fics in the past but the entirety of it is just D/Hr which is just an outlandish ship.

Mpreg is just silly, I have never read a mpreg fic but the concept is at least mildly disgusting to me. where does the baby pop out of? Don't want to know.

I don't enjoy fics where you basically discard the entire plot of Harry Potter for a story s weird to me. I'm not talking about AU fics I mean where the only similarity is the names. (while a fic I think is called "Wastelands of Time" is well written I don't see the Harry Potter in there, baring in mind I only read the first three chaps)

I do enjoy fics that explore and explain different areas of magic (For Love of Magic), It's always interesting to hear the different theories.

My fav ships are H/D H/T H/Hr H/G H/F

I don't mind a little bit of bashing but I don't like it when things are taken out of proportion and do prefer it when everyone is mainly nice. Also, I have read several good fics where Harry's abuse at his relatives is worse than we saw in the books but some fics take it to far. "Thanks to a snake" walks that line well but I once read a fic that was going kinda well and out of nowhere Harry has a million scars from when his uncle tied him to a chair and took a knife to him for hours on end, pulling out his nails and all sorts of stuff. I don't want to read that

I don't mind ships with people who we don't know much about for example Susan bones and Hannah abbott(?). I don't see why this fandom has a problem which ships like that, saying that it is basically an OC. This fandom is probably the biggest in the world and as a collective has basically designed a character that most everyone uses and we just accept that that is how they act and look. Daphne Greengrass has one mention by name as far as I am aware in the book. We don't know her personality, her looks, her parent's names or anything about her and yet most of the information we use is treated as fact and no one bats an eye when she is used in a fic.

Sorry I feel like I have used this post to vent and explain my feeling o certain concepts.

Thanks to everyone for all of your answers

*** For me, when I take out the slash, dramione, major Weasley bashing, anything not featuring Harry, gore, Harry inherits thousands of titles and is friends of the goblins/Merlin/hogwarts herself/any number of the founders.

Then add 20k+ words, complete or actively being worked on, at least decent writing?

You're looking at a rough guesstimate of about 1000 fics you can read. Half of them you won't find because they're buried in the rest of the crap you don't want to read.

**** Hell, even just complete fics will cut out more than half of those (~385k)

Complete fics that have Harry in them at all will cut down half of those completed ones (~105k)

Want an actual story?(more than 20k words?) Then you're looking at ~35k stories.

Once you take out the garbage or ones that aren't English, and you're probably going to exhaust the stories on FFnet relatively quickly. There can't be more than a thousand of them.

*** that's what I thought but about half of those are abandoned and half of that his about 200 words long and several other filters, then you have to sift through the rest to find good fics.
