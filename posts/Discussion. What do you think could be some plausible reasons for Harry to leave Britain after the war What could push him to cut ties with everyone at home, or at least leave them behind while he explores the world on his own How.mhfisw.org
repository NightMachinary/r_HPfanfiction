** Hatred of his fame, PTSD or Depression, Everyone else is dead etc.

My personal favourite headcanon is Andromeda taking Teddy out of the country shortly before the final battle on Tonks request in case they lost,

After hearing of the defeat of Voldemort she tries to get in touch with Tonks to see if it is safe to return with Teddy but is instead contacted by a weary and forlorn Harry who has to tell her how her daughter died alongside her husband

Andromeda learns he was named as Godfather to Teddy & upon seeing how much he is struggling to adjust to a life after the War basically decides that she is adopting him and refuses to let him leave her or Teddy until she is satisfied he is healed enough to stand on his own once more

Harry meanwhile finds the idea of spending his time playing with Teddy and talking with Andromeda to be exactly what he never knew he needed

As for how others react to this, it often varies based on what type of fanfics I'm reading at that moment as to whether it is a good one or not

** I think it could be because of too many bad memories associated with different places? the ministry could remind him of the fight between Voldemort and Dumbledore

Hogwarts could remind him of how many people died

the burrows could remind him of how happy he was when he was younger when the whole family was there.

it could also be because of the fame, he was famous before when he defeated Voldemort but now he could be even more famous “the boy who lived twice!”

he could want to escape to a place where no one knows him.

** If by plausible you mean no additional bashing, just following canon, there are several reasons.

1. His own trusted mentor Dumbledore basically plotted his death. True, for the greater good, but it doesn't change the fact he needed him to die.

2. Witnessing Snape's death. Different than the previous deaths, as it was quite traumatic, gruesome and it felt intimate in a way. A man he insulted and called a coward more than once. A man who truly desired his safety and wellbeing and was horrified to deliver his final betrayal through his Pensieve memories how he has to die in the end. Massive guilt, l would say. No one saw it coming.

3. Survivor's guilt.

4. Some of the Weasley family could have resented him for Fred's death. I don't think things could ever be the same, with Ron or Ginny. Harry could have felt pushed into some things due to his own sense of guilt. It sounds strange, but people who grieve say many cruel things and try to put the blame on people close to them just to make them feel hurt like they are.

5. Ginny is more like a little sister to him. She would most probably expect something, but l don't see Harry ready for a romantic relationship with anyone, especially not right after the war. Ginny was a badly written character, especially for being the main protagonist's love interest. Flat, bland, boring really. Popular redhead? Oedipus complex - probably not. No excitement at all, she is just there and she is a female Weasley available. That's how l see it.

6. Elder wand ownership. Harry shouted for everyone to hear about many things, among them is him being the master of the Unbeatable wand. That might attract new enemies.

7. New ministry using him as a poster boy and a puppet. After war time would be difficult to refuse the new government. He could again be pushed into something he doesn't want.

** Lots of people travel after horrible events.

In my family, my mother suffered a TBI while my dad was deployed to Afghanistan, and then I became disabled. It was a rather awful few years for our family.

We ran away to Scotland together. It was awesome. (We live in Australia.)

The reason for travel was just - sometimes it's enough to just want to leave. Sometimes trauma is enough of a reason in and of itself. You don't need any other reason, especially if you plan to come back. (Harry doesn't actually /have/ to come back in your fic - best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry and all that)

Re Ginny: she can go with him. Irl relationships, that's what happens. If you love someone, you just as often pack up and leave with them.

Or: she can give him a kiss and wave him off. Irl relationships, that's what happens. If you love someone, you just as often let them go on an adventure and wait patiently for them to come back.

The choice is yours.

** PTSD.

He spent six years pretty much looking over his shoulder for Voldemort to appear and kill him before being forced to head the resistance against him. Seriously, they had /Potterwatch/ to keep people informed on everything. Voldemort had to kill him to achieve victory. He had to kill Voldemort to achieve peace.

So it's easy to see him not exactly handling anything well until he managed to get help for it. Ginny, if we're being honest, would either be the person forcing him to do it for his own good or the person who wouldn't care.

The only two who'd probably try to keep in touch would be Ron and Hermione, but as someone else said, the Weasley's may feel some anger at him for getting Fred killed.

Wasn't his fault, but grief gives zero fucks about common sense

** I could see him wanting to travel, ‘adventure', take a sort of gap year, and visit different countries (wizarding parts and the Muggle parts too). Especially since he's never been on holiday. Egypt, Romania, some other place the books never tell us about.

In a scenario where he falls in love with one of these places, he might move there for a couple of years. Long-distance relationships might be easier with a paired mirror. I forget whether owls can fly internationally (I'm pretty sure they can).

Or maybe in his career as an Auror, Harry is dispatched to go and deal with some unique issue overseas? I can see him getting burnt out after several years as an Auror and just needing a break/change. And can definitely see how he might just want to get away from everyone for a while.

I doubt Ginny would be /happy/ with him staying for ages, but if Harry really wants to go badly enough (like, if he's got his heart set on it), it would be out of character for her to say no.

I can imagine her travelling for international matches as well.

If you mean voluntarily going overseas permanently and cutting ties completely, then... nothing I can think of, really. Nothing canon-compliant, anyway.
