** After Harry been successfully extinguished and the crowd suitable calmed down, Dumbledore called Harry to his office.

“Harry, did I ever mention that phoenixes are sometimes fond of people?”

“Yes, Professor, I believe you mentioned it after the event in the Chamber.”

“Yes! Right. Well... Fawkes was fond of your parents. /Really/ fond of your parents. After they graduated, he'd often go missing to apparently hang out with them. I never really asked for the details, and he never answered. Well, I think we have our answer now.”

“Professor, you can't be implying?!”

“Why yes, Harry! Fawkes must given you some sort of blessing because of his friendship with your parents! What did you think I meant?”

** It was a perfectly ordinary day during his third year at Hogwarts. Harry had just finished brushing his teeth and getting dressed and was now waiting in the common room for Ron and Hermione to come down. 'Hey mate' said Ron 'Hermione still not down yet?'. 'Nah mate' Harry replied. 'Bloody girls and their... Hey Hermione' Ron exclaimed. 'Hey guys' Hermione started 'Wanna go down to breakfast?'. 'Yeah, I'm starving.' said Ron. 'You're always starving Ron' Harry claimed. He was interrupted by his own stomach grumbling. 'Well I guess I am too' he conceded. 'Let's get going then' Hermione said.

Together they made their way down to the great Hall. It was relatively empty. Only a couple students scattered across all house tables and the Professors McGonagall and Snape and Headmaster Dumbledore were there. The trio took their customary spots at the middle of the Gryffindor table, Ron on one side and Harry and Hermione on the other. Harry has about to reach for his second scone when he got the strangest feeling. He didn't have time to process anything before Ron shouted 'Bloody Hell Harry, you're on fire!'. The most ear-piercing scream erupted shortly after. Harry tried to clamp his hands over his ears to block it out but it didn't seem to quieter. In fact, it seemed to come from within him? As quickly as it came it subsided. 'Um... Hermione? Do you know what happened?' he said and turned to face the brain of their group. Hermione reached for her wand and muttered an incantation 'I think you best see for yourself'. She held up the hand mirror she just conjured. Harry's eyes bulged. Instead of his messy mop of hair there was a fire on his head!

*** After a bit of experimentation, it was determined that Harry's personality and the fiendfyre's infinite hatred for all things not itself had somewhat balanced out. It still had a mind of its own, but it was very primitive and not infused with evil like ordinary fiendfyre would be.

The Unspeakables assigned to his case tried dragging him off to their dungeons, either to hire or contain him, but found that their spells were burned away by the fyre itself. So they settled with offering him employment after his NEWTs, should he be interested.

Life settled into a new routine from then on. After the second set of charred bedsheets, Harry managed to stop his flaming hair from consuming everything it touched, and instead it simply lashed out at nearby flies and spiders, startling everyone he walked by on his way to class.

The fyre seemed to have several effects on Harry - not simply his personality, which was slightly more impulsive, but also his resistance to temperature and magic. Spells did not affect him for long, and he missed the beginning of winter, only noticing the snowfall outside when his classmates started questioning his summer attire, they themselves cloaked in shawls and scarves.

One thing the fyre never tried to affect however was the invisibility cloak. Maybe it could have, but it shrunk into a bright orange inside his eyes whenever he put it on. Harry was glad he wore the cloak at those times, since save for the flames, he was now technically bald.

***** Not really. Or, at least, Strange Academy is much closer because it's specifically about magic.

Some takes on the Mansion are closer to Hogwarts in the sense that it's sometimes secret in the sense the general public don't know it's a school for mutants. I'm pretty sure, but not 100% sure, that in the Ultimate Universe this was (a) the case and (b) they had some kind of technology to make it look different on the outside. But... in the main universe it's more like a really weird AU...

Setting: Hogwarts but is only for muggle borns in a muggle!Voldemort (Graydon Creed) won AU

Characters:

- Dumbledore (Xavier) /is/ a manipulative old coot and The Master of Death
- Grindelwald (Magneto) is sometimes on the staff (and sometimes is pretending to be someone else but then further turns out to have been that someone else pretending to be Grindelwald pretending to be the someone else they actually were, or something... I get confused and half of it was a retcon).
- the Basilisk (Rogue) is a staff member,
- Snape and Mundungus are combined into one character (Gambit) who is usually dating or married to the Basilisk, except when the Basilisk is with Grindelwald
- Ariana is now Dumbledore's twin and is evil (Cassandra Nova)
- Credence is Dumbledore's son (Legion) and is in a relationship with Trelawney (who is presently dead)
- Percy is a main character (Scott)
- Ginny (Jean) is still occasionally repossessed by the Horcrux... and also isn't a Weasley any more because Percy/Ginny is the main ship
- Morfin (Wolverine) is the designated hero and has a thing for Ginny, several children and also has a thing McGonagall
- It's fem!Barty Crouch Jr, and also Bartie has renounced Voldemort but is basically otherwise unchanged and now has a thing for Percy (Emma Frost)
- Fred and George are now (a) very Catholic, (b) fascinated by pirates and (c) one person (Nightcrawler)
- Narcissa is now Fred and George's mother, the Basilisk's adoptive mother /and/ Voldemort's mother (Mystique)... /and/ it's a Black family metamorphagus fic
- Also, there wasn't enough Trelawney so Cassandra is in the fic and is also Lucius and is also dead
- It's a fem!Harry Master of Death from a different universe fic (Moira) and Harry's also convinced Dumbledore and Grindelwald to resurrect everyone /except/ the two Trelawneys
- Macnair is now Voldemort's father (Sabretooth)
- Ron is now blond and sometimes is a Death Eater (Havok), but that was a magic spell
- McGonagall is now half African American and half Kenyan... and also was possessed by a Horcrux (Storm)

And then there are several more Voldemorts... there's pink hair Voldemort (Quentin Quire), there's Weasley!Voldemort (Vulcan), there's read Darwin Voldemort (Apocalypse) and there are two different Grindelwald fanboy Voldemorts (Exodus and Cortez).

** "You're a Demigod, Harry," Dumbledore spoke after they had both settled down in his office.

"I'm a what?" Harry was confused. It was hard enough dealing with being a Parselmouth and Voldemort wanting him dead, now something else had to be added to the mix.

"A Demigod. And a son of Hades."

"The Greek God?"

"Yes and no," Dumbledore answered, making harry even more confused. How could Hades both he a greek god and not a greek god. Maybe this was just a potion and the headmaster was playing a joke on him.

"Much like that Peter Johnson story, the gods are real and interact with out world. But its a little more in depth than that. Every version also exists simultaneously." His eyes twinkled like this was an explanation in of itself.

"So which Hades am I?"

"My boy," Dumbledore sighed, before steepling his fingers, his eyes boring into Harry's "It should have been obvious these past few years with your flair for dramatics, and anger."

Harry felt his anger rising even now, he had a lot to deal with, Dumbledore should just tell him rather than say such things. "And?"

"Im afraid you are the son of Hades alright, but the disney version."

** Ancient protections. Those of love often hold something far more potent than the common wizard could understand. From where Dumbo sat, he saw with mild peculiarity that Harry's hair had burst into that of fire. The young boy was having quite the difficulty of explaining that no, it didn't hurt, and he was not going to Madam Pomfrey until someone explained what was happening.

Dumbledore from where he sat, was casting a rather impressive list of spells to find out what was making such a commodity happen to the boy. After perhaps the fiftieth charm, Dumbledore managed to find his answer. Oh and how amusing his answer happened to be.

Rarely, such a protection of love can be mixed with the most violent of hates. It was not often that something like this happened, and it was so rare that a curse could mix with a protection. Yet in the case of Harry, it seemed, that the protection was directly linked to the hatred Lily had felt towards Lord Voldemort. In such a sense, it seems, a part of the boy's consciousness had linked with one of the most powerful of spells.

He would need to find a way to speak with the boy about this. More than that, there would be a multitude of tests that the two of them would need to go about with figuring out. The first, Dumbledore already had in mind.

Fawkes appeared upon the old man's shoulder. He was careful to approach slow, and with the slightest of smiles. It would not bode well to scare the boy as he sat in the most fragile of precipices.
