So i'm looking for a fic where harry is good but is going against like most of the staff and like every student except friends

I don't really care what pairing as long as it is still harry/a girl just because i prefer it

And also i prefer longer stories so please no one shots or like under a 100k but if you think it really is good then do link it or tell me it's name

Thanks!

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
