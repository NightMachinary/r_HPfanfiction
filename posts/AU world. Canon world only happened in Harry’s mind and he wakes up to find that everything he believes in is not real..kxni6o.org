Is there any good fic where Harry had some sort of accident (like a Quidditch one) that put him in a coma and after some time wakes up to find his parents and uncles alive? He doesn't remember his real life, just canon, and they try to help him get his memories back

If the Wizarding World exists and Harry was just in some sort of trance or coma, better
