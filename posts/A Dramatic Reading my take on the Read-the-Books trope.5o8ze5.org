Based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5i6m67/serious_take_on_the_readthebooks_trope/][this thread]]. Since my idea was well-received there, I wanted to promote it here now that I finally have it posted:

/A Dramatic Reading/: linkffn(12324284).

The backstory here is that I believe that any trope, even the most absurd or hackneyed, can be made to work in the right hands, and this is how I think the read-the-books trope ought to be done. Read-the-books fics are universally terrible, in my experience, but by writing with an actual plot in mind, only quoting 5% of the source material, and only having people interrupt when it would be natural to do so, I hope that I've solved 90% of the problems that come with these fics.

Expect Chapters 3-5 in the next few days, intermittently after that.


** Will the pace pick up after the first few chapters involving the Dursleys? I want to see how Umbridge reacts to the Baby Norbert incident.

And, after that, the encounter in the Forbidden Forest.

** Hey- I did not expect something this entertaining, even from you who I've read and liked the works of before. The biggest problem I had with stories like these is that for all the knowledge gained, nothing ever actually happens. This, already Dumbledore is gone like canon OotP, with similar remarks from those present. But it also looks like things will continue to happen; good work and keep at it!

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** In all honesty, I only saw this when looking around your author page on ffnet looking for a LA update, but now I'd actually be ok if you just wrote more of this for a while. I mean, I've never seen this type of fic ever have negative (or really any) consequences outside of the books, and already you have lots of things happening. The one thing that really got me about this was that, in prior forays into this type of fic, the (often quoted word for word) text of the books would invariably be more interesting than the actual fic, but here it's the other way around. Also, I think Kingsley's line made the whole story for me. Please keep this going, it's already really good and poised to become even better.

** I don't know how to feel about it, since on one hand this is not your job so you should write whatever you want to right but on the other hand i am very hungry for more lady Archimedes.

** Read it last night and it was really great, well paced and as you promised, avoided all the pitfalls of the usual readthebook/wish fulfillment fic. I used to like these but always ended reading them in diagonal, skipping entire paragraph at a time and finishing a chapter in a minute or less. Yours is captivating, and the change from canon are immediate and not promised later as a reward like is usually done because 'mysterious author trapped everyone in the great hall thanks to the DOM and Umbridge'. Again well done, and I will get around to read Lady Archimedes someday, but exams await now so... :-D

** Oh my goodness this may be the first time I've read through the entire chapter of a reading-the-books fic. Usually I scroll fast, skipping vast amounts of book text.
