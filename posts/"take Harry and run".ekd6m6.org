Looking for a decent length fic, preferably complete but open to those that are updated regularly, in which Lilly does in fact "Take Harry and run"


** Good fics where Harry and Lily will survive confrontation are hard to find. These are only good ones that i am aware.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

**** They aren't together in the fic (yet). Some creepiness in the story is intentional, and it ties into the plotline of Harry using manipulation to protect himself and his mother while stuck in a dificult situation where there's no clear solution.

In the backstory, Lily basically raised Harry to hide the truth of who he is from everyone arround him, lying to even his close friends and allies to manipulate them with the eventual goal of opposing Voldemort from a position of strength. Thus, Harry was raised to see avenging his father as his entire raison d'etre. The fic has an interesting arc of Harry finally realizing that's not a healthy basis for a loving mother-son relationship.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.
