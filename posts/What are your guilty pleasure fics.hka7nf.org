Personally, it's "Harry is betrayed by everyone" fics. You know... the ones....

Evil!Manipulative Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione paid to be his friends, marriage contract with Ginny, Molly is stealing from Harry's vault (as is Dumbledore, and... everyone, really) and, OF COURSE, the Twins are "the good weasleys". Don't forget the twins are always the good ones. But thanks to the support of his One True Love (Luna/Daphne/Fleur/Tonks/Susan/Hermione when she isn't a betrayer) and the power of *BIG DICK ENERGY*, Harry manages to overcome the manipulations of Dumbledork and easily beat... Moldyshorts? Moldyfart? Voldywarts?... whatever that guy name is.

I know it's bad and terrible, but I just can't help liking it. French people have a word for this: nanar. A movie that is so bad it becomes good.

Soooo, what are your guilty pleasure fics?


** It's absolute garbage and I can never manage to get all the way through, but you just can't beat linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero) for being hilariously bad.

** Potter Luck fics or "may you live in interesting times"

Where Harry has incredibly high Luck stats but the author is like a DnD DM enjoying the alternating 20 And 1 that Harry gets.

Examples Kinda like rorschach's make a wish,

that fic where Harry is mistaken at Lucifer (they were summoning the 'lightbringer' which was a moniker of Harry as a leader of the Light),

that fic where fae! Harry weaponizes a reverse Felix felicity against evil! Dumbledore and snape,

that fit where Potter's family magic is Karma

A fic where DoM had Harry on a sort of watchlist because of Lily's felix felicis experiment

Ron accidentally started a cult that worshipped Harry as God of luck

The Potter line has a "blessed curse"

Not all of them are complete or 'good' but hey, it's a guilty pleasure. I can be snooty with quality of fits I read but dumb fun repetitive fics like these are enjoyable from time to time.

** So... this will definitely be an unorthodox choice, but I have a soft spot for linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence)

It's a fan sequel to HPMOR (red flag right there, but I personally think a lot of HPMOR recursive fanfics surpass HPMOR) that has Ginny as a wizarding Christian. The author makes some odd choices, but overall it's just so cathartic to see HPMOR-Harry treated like an actual real person instead of the narrative warping around him to make sure he never has to have personal growth.

He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl): Featuring an unabashedly OP!Slytherin!Hermione who actually does interesting things with her OPness, Slytherinness, and Hermioneness, it has an excellent update rate.

On the other hand, there's a lot of bad fanon and unwarranted divergences from the canon setting, and characters and setting elements are often arranged for the protagonist's convenience. For example, Draco wants to be friends with Hermione, but Lucius isn't---and will brutally punish Draco for it---unless they pull off some "ritual" that, loosely speaking, proves that they are equal before magic. There is also some pureblood culture weirdness around menarche.

** I have two that I reread from time to time and hate myself for doing so.

1) linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts by Clell65619). It's so ridiculously over the top that it's compelling. Some scenes are genuinely laugh-out-loud bad but I keep coming back to it.

2) linkffn(A Different Halloween by RobSt). Robst gets a lot of grief and much of it is deserved, but his real trouble is that he can't write conflict. Anything that might look like an obstacle is flicked contemptuously aside before it can mildly inconvenience Harry. In this story he doesn't even pretend. It's basically a feelgood story and sometimes that's just what I feel like reading.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** The 'Willow Prank' fics. Those where Sirius tells Snape how to get past the Whomping Willow, is ostracized by his friends and falls into depression.

Soul bond fics.

OP/Indy/Lord/etc!Harry.

Fics with excessive angst.

** Mine used to be those, until I got tired of how bad so many are. I mean... when I was an angry teenager these were gold, but by this point I can't enjoy it anymore, it's all a bit much. I now much more enjoy the milder version of this type of bashing that are still bashing, but not quite so extreme. (You know... where not all of the things you mentioned are present at once, just some.) On occasion I'll still read them but I don't get much out of it anymore.

My favourite is the "Sirius fixes everything" variant, if there's lots of Sirius & Harry paternal relationship type fluff (just to be clear, completely platonic, not remotely sexual - not bashing the ship but for this type of story I'm super not into it), I'll forgive the story A LOT with regards to quality/OOCness.

** Bashing fics. I can only take so many "I have to kill the Voldemort because he killed my parents" and "Death Eaters are bad" fics before it gets... boring? Stale? one of those. Anywho, I like the alternative interpretations of characters. They are fun once in a while. If they are funny.

** Amortentia fics, particularly when Amortentia helps the couple realize they're in love with each other. Ugh, accidentally blurting out that it smells like the one they like to the whole class, or it not taking effect because they're already in love with the target.
