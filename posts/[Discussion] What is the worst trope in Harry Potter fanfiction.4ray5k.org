** Stations of Canon. It's like authors can't use their imagination or have problems with figuring out the consequences of characters actions. Even in some of the most divergent fics there are these things like the same canonical teachers being employed in subsequent years, or Triwizard Tournament occuring in fourth year. Or even Sirius escaping Azkaban. Think about it - without Weasleys winning the contest (which is already based on random chance) /and/ deciding to go on vacation /and/ having a photograph with Scabbers in it /and/ Sirius somehow getting a newspaper to read, it just wouldn't work. Fate is really inelegant answer.

*** Wasn't the Triwizard Tournament planned independently of Harry's life, though? What I mean is, wouldn't that have happened when it did regardless of what Harry and Voldemort were doing because it was an international thing? I always thought having it happen was okay, just not having it happen the same way. I could totally be wrong, it happens a lot. ;)

****** I think it's fanon, but I've read somewhere that the Tournament happened in Hogwarts to make Sirius' escape seem less important. Either way, I don't think the competition could be planned for a long time, so butterfly effect would probably prevent it. But Averant's suggestion is also cool.

**** I'm toying with a story where Harry is not at Hogwarts but it's found out when he's around six that the Dursley's were abusive towards him which resulted in Dumbledore losing a good deal of power and being removed as Headmaster of Hogwarts. One of the ripples of this is that the Tri-Wizard tournament gets delayed until what would be Harry's 5th year because McGonagall wants it to be safer and make sure only seventh year students can participate.

****** It's a HP/Warcraft crossover and Dumbledore is found out because Harry is accidentally transported to the Warcraft universe. The Tri-Wizard tournament is just an interlude chapter that shows what's happening back on Earth while Harry is raised on Azeroth during the events of Warcraft 3 and the first two expansions of World of Warcraft. It's still a long way off from me actually putting out chapters, I want to get to at least the end of the events in Warcraft 3 which would be the end of the first major story arc.

It's really sad, because I like the idea of a wizard having a magical trunk. The storage space makes perfect sense. My personal favorite is the magical trunks in The Well-Groomed Mind, in which it is something each individual wizard creates for himself. The design Harry starts working on actually doesn't have giant chambers in it, so he won't ever get trapped a la Moody.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin actually has a bedroom trunk that Harry buys, but he notes that it reminds him of the cupboard so he'll probably never use it.

** I enjoy timetravel fics but I honestly don't understand why every single one has to go bsck to Harry and co being 11. Just going back a few months before thend battle of hogwarts would be sufficient, or maybe the Department of Mysteries to save Sirius. I often think about going back to my high school years in real life, but to be 11 again? No thanks. Plus it allow authors to avoid finding ways to prevent squicky preteen sex lives. Speaking of time travel, I really would like to see other characters getting a chance. What would Hagrid do? Amelia Bones (also an annoying trope is Susan's connection to thr DMLE)? Molly Weasly? Ron alone (I know of one unfinished fic that does this)? Fred and George? Dumbledore? Draco? So many possibilities but people only ever focus on a few.

Also, the ones where someone knows tonnes of magic before getting to hogwarts. Accio Trevor comes to mind.

Runes that apparently nobody else seems to have studied oe harry/hermione/someone is such a prodigy that nobody can beat them. Earth Magicks also.

  Draco fell in love with Hermione, but it was already too late. When a contraption of Dumbledoor sets Draco back in time to hisfirst year of Hogwarts with no memeories of the future but all the feelings and love felt towards Hermione from his future self, how will he do things the second time around. Much better than the summary. A time travel story with a twist, Draco Edition.

** So I have two. The first is possibly the most trivial and pedantic, regarding an overused line, and its canonical so disregard as bitching if you'd like. It irritates me to no end when a female character (generally the LI) chastises one of the boys for language. "Language Harry/Ron!" Not their damn mum woman.

Second is by far more irritating (In my less than humble opinion. When a character tells Harry to basically suck it up, stop moping, or quit being a punk. I get that no one likes too much angst but lets be real. (As real as we can be when discussing fiction.) Harry is a teenager. Teenagers are angsty. And the ones who weren't are liars. And I'd say Harry has more reasons to be angsty or whiny or whatever than virtually any other character except maybe Neville. Orphan, chased by a psychopath, mistreated by a teacher for frankly childish reasons, publicly reviled/canonized, raped by a house elf(I may be remembering that part), abusive relatives(another irritating trope when authors with no concept of abuse fail miserably to make it convincing).\\
My overly long point is, it's annoying when the author presents the angst then just has stock character #5 give him a monologue about why he doesn't have it so bad and he should be proactive. It usually leads to the grossly over powered indy harry. It's ham fisted, and just poor character evolution.

Also long author notes. Fuck long author notes. It's a story not your personal podium. Thats what forums are for.
