I want to know if anyone else has words that despite perfectly knowing how it is spelled, still reads/says it wrong in their head.

My example: I know that it is â€˜Wizengamot'. But in my head whenever I read it it turns into â€˜Wizenmagot'. Wizen-MAH-Got. It just sounds so much better to me and awkward/clunky saying/reading it the right way.

Let me know if you have the same problem and with what word. ðŸ˜‚

** Sectumsempra. The two m's make the word so confusing for me and I always have to check it twice to see if I spelled it correctly and even then- I feel like it still doesn't sound right.

** Actually I'm still not certain how 'Wizengamot' is supposed to be said aloud. It is usually Wizengot and even Wizengmont in my mind. Lets see, what else..

The "e" in Remus I usually read as "eh" rather than "ee".

"Sevrus" instead of "SeVErus".

I don't know whether the "e" in Gideon is silent or "ee" sounding, but I usually read it as the "eh" sound (once again), which is the least accurate I feel like.

For Hermione we got the canon "Her-my-oh-nee" tutorial, but she's still "Her-my-nee" to me lol.

The "Are you Sirius?" jokes didn't work out for me since I read it as "Siryus".

For the spelling itself, some confusion with Peverell and Perevell. Karakoff and Karkaroff. Durmstrang, Drumstrang. Wabulrga, Walburga. Gerrelt and Gellert (Grindelwald, Grindlewald). McGonagall, McGonagoll, McGonegall...uh...

And many many more, probably.

Edit: more additions
