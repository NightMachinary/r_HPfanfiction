  Following Voldemort's downfall attempting to kill Harry, the Hogwarts professors appeal to the Ministry of Magic to allow the young boy to live and grow up at Hogwarts, away from the world's dangers. He grows up unlike any other child in the Wizarding world, meeting years of students before he is allowed a wand. Now, he will meet his fellow classmates to finally learn magic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black][The name is Potter Black]], where he is raised by Sirius who is a professor. It's a 160,000 word sequel to a 1000 word oneshot. I have it recorded under really good, but it was one of the first fanfics I read and I can't remember anything about it... So it might be good?
