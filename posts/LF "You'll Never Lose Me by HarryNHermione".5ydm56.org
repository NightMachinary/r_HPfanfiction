I found this on Portkey.org a long time ago and forgot to make a hard copy of it before the site had it's meltdown. It's an H/HR Romance fic that revolves around Hermione under the mistaken belief that Harry has chosen Cho Chang over her and thus she ventures out to the shore of the Black Lake in the middle of a winter storm and endeavours to freeze herself pining away for him. This not being the case, however, he finds her in time to save her and brings her safely back to the castle for much warming and loving. Exactly how much loving, I'm unsure of and thus I cannot remember the rating, but believe it to be at least PG-13 to possibly an R. If anyone could help, I would greatly appreciate it, thank you! Here is its link from Portkey.org [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/3442]]


** Damn, one of the few stories from that author not archived. I can even find some Italian translations but not this one.

I will look a bit more, hopefully it will turn up eventually.

** Try the zip linked here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5nerkw/collection_of_portkeyorg_fics/]]

I don't know if this particular story is in there, but as far as I know it's your best shot.
