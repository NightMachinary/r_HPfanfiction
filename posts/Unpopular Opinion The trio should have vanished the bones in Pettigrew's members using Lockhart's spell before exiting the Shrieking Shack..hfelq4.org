*** I originally thought about making a post where I'd have cut Pettigrew's legs with the (taught to first years) Severing Charm and closing the wounds with lots of salt, but I thought the subreddit would have been too pussy about it. The title was going to be "'Try to escape as rat now, you filthy degenerate.'"

** Lockhart performed the spell incorrectly. I imagine to varnish bones they would have to do the Vanishing Spell, which was not something they could do.

** I read a do-over fic where they broke his legs.

But yeah, as Ash_Lestrange said, replicating Lockhart's miscast spell would have been impossible. They only heard it the once, and Harry was in pain at the time, not to mention in the middle of a crowd. (I know *I* couldn't tell you the incantation without looking it up, and I've read it more than once.) And obviously none of them has a reason to know the medical spell to vanish bones.

** Vanishing - much harder to do than most people think.

Vanishing an iguana over at least 15 minutes (if not an hour) is the exam given to people. Plenty of people fail. Two third years aren't vanishing bones with such precision, hence the unpopularity of the opinion.

** I mean in the movie he was walked out. In the book I think he was walked out “tied between Remus and Ron” and I never ever understood why they didn't just wake Severus up - there is a spell for that, yes Snape isn't the nicest bloke but take his f-ing wand and he's defenseless. Say, “yo, Snape here is the man that killed Lily go get Dumbledore,” like COME ON. And then with Snape AWAKE you can stupefy or petrificus totalus Pettigrew. OR you could just knock out Peter and have Hermione (SMARTEST WITCH OF THE AGE) levitate one of them. OR they hate Snape anyway, just leave him there?! Like REALLY? Out of all the things that Harry Potter went through and that JK write this one scene has pissed me off the *most* for /years!/ It was /so/ idiotic and stupid they all should've been prosecuted for letting Peter escape. Not even Hermione had anything to say?! Or Remus? I can see Harry and Sirius and Ron being like “this is a great idea!” But really Hermione and Remus, really?! Ohmygod. And as a side note - I did read a book where they turned Peter back into a rat and put him into a cage. He didn't escape then either. So freaking stupid. Anything for a plot point, eh?
