I would especially like any Newt/Tina recommendations, but I am open to other characters and pairings. I've mostly only read fics for Harry an co, with some Marauders era and Next Gen, but I want to start reading fics from this time period too. Longer fics preferred, but one-shots are good too.

Thanks!


** If you don't mind slash, linkao3(16135016) is my favorite FB Fanfiction of all time. It's really good imo!

  “Oh no, please, no!” Percival interrupted him, obviously knowing what the older man was talking about. “I read about it, it´s irreversible and binding...” His horrified eyes glanced at Newt before he closed them. “Mercy fucking Lewis--” “Percival Galahad Graves!” “-- he´s just a child!” Percival hissed, glaring at his father.
