This is a trope that I see often in HP fanfiction, often correlated to Harry being Lord Potter Black Peverell Gryffindor etc. I can't figure out where it came from, since as far as I can tell, it has no basis whatsoever in canon. Did it start in a specific story?

(if you haven't come across it, it's the idea that there are 28 very old wizarding families that are basically controlling everything in the wizarding world behind the scenes)


** It's actually a Pottermore thing that JK Rowling released.

** it's actually not as important as fanon makes it to be, or well, it's not important at all. No one really talks about whether or not you're in the sacred twenty eight, nor do they refer to someone as Lord Malfoy or shit. (Or at least as far I'm concerned, they don't).

Not to mention the Potter aren't even apart of the Sacred 28.

*** No, Sacred 28 in canon is just a made up list that a disgruntled pureblood published - it included families that wanted to be claimed as pureblood like the Malfoys, but also included people like the Weasleys who had proof of muggle marriages. Nott (the alleged writer) apparently excluded anyone who raised a fuss about not helping the muggles in WW2 ie. the Potters (who are not included in the list even though they were pureblood at the time). Many families on the list are either extinct by 1991 (Prewetts) or down to single digits (Longbottom). Canon has nothing about the sacred 28 ruling anything.

******* Well, J.K. effed up the storylines in the Fantastic Movies franchise. According to long standing HP canon, Minerva McGonagall was born in the 30's, '35, I believe. But, in Crimes of Grindelwald she was alive, teaching Transfigurations, as a young woman, while Dumbledore taught DADA (yes, and that is not the most bizarre thing that occurred in that movie). After many complaints about this from the fans, McG's date of birth has been allegedly taken out of her page on Pottermore, thus, retcon. I say allegedly because I heard of it here on reddit or on Tumblr, but haven't checked for myself. Will do later and edit this post.

******** Also the general implication of Grindelwald used to be some Nazi ties due to the defeat in 45. Now he is mostly dicking around in New York. His "crimes" were generally believed to be along the lines of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731][Unit 731]] or some form of magical genocide equivalent to the Third Reich. Maybe some proto Voldemort, but not what we got so far.

********* Absolutely! There's also the fact that from what little the canon-canon (that is, the books) implied, Grindelwald's goals was vastly different from Voldemort's. IIRC, his goals was the dominion of all wizard-kind over muggles, as opposed to Voldemort's who preached pure-blooded domination over the rest of the world. Mind you, I may be extrapolating what the books said about Grindelwald, because there's been a couple years since I've read them. TBH I was disappointed that J.K. chose to portray Grindelwald as a proto-Voldemort, who was as boring and unidimensional as a villain can get. G.G. was supposed to be the most feared "Dark Lord" of all Europe, while L.V. remained in British territory.

EDIT: just in conclusion, I agree wholeheartedly with the person above who said that Pottermore is nothing but a poor executed excuse of world-building.

i'm not sure what you mean. grindelwald himself never mentions blood purity. many pure-bloods do gravitate towards him; if his platform is magical rule over muggles, it does make sense that the people with the least ties to muggles and the most belief in magical superiority would be most likely to join him

Some storylines were left loose, some ended much too soon, others made no sense whatsoever and quite a bit conflicted with the first Fantastic Beasts. As a LGBT reader, most of J.K.'s decisions lately disappointed me, and served to severe what little ties I had with canon!HP. Thank goodness for fanfiction.

** My headcanon mostly says there's more than 28, but that 28 of the original families of the first major magical empire are all that's around in Britain anymore. Depending on where in the magical world you go, you'll find different numbers of different families, depending on how they spread out over time, but that, no matter how much time has passed, they are all still tied together with the oath to the family they served so long ago..

I got the base for that idea from one of the first fic's I ever read, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9825937/1/Bound-in-Servitude]]), though is has evolved over time, which I suppose means we are all influenced by what we read, and when we read it.

If, however, you ment in canon? Hell if I know, sorry for the needless interference, then.
