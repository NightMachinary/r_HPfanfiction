Ok so they've lived a reeeeally long time so their outlook on the world is probably different to the average witch or wizard.

They don't appear to interfere in the wizarding world much. Is this true (if so, why?) or are they just super sneaky sneks about how they influence the world?

What do you think their opinions on the Statute of Secrecy (they are older than it) and the muggle world are?

What do you think their personalities are like?

What is their relationship with the Goblins? They could flood the economy with gold, after all.

Etc etc. Have fun :D


** My favorite interpretation is the one found in the Where In The World Is Harry Potter trilogy linkffn(2354771)

*** Hm. That one was /creative/, but I don't really like the idea of making the Philosopher's Stone into nothing more than a sham. It takes away some of the magic, for me.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** I liked Nicolas Flamel in linkffn(637123).

Spoilers for The Phoenix and the Serpent follow: [[/spoiler][Flamel as a squib is an awesome idea, because it totally subverts the expectation of him being this awesome wizard because he created the Philosopher's Stone while providing an excellent explanation for why he hasn't been stopping every dark wizard since the 1300s. I liked how he seemed to be modeled off a scientist from the Enlightenment period, always experimenting and not bothered by setbacks or failures. I thought his death was a little contrived, but it does clarify how vulnerable a Squib would be to magical creatures: drop your guard and you'll die to something (relatively) mundane, like a tree falling on you. Mirrors the reality of how humans evolved, where we can build weapons that can destroy cities but can still die to a tiger in the night or a tree falling on us.]]
