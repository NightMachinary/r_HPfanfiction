I want to read some stories where someone, /anyone/, stops Snape from being the gigantic assholish fucktrumpet he seemingly is to every single person he interacts with, and preferably stops him being the boogyman he is to the majority of Hogwarts..


** I can't help you, but upvote for ‘fucktrumpet.'

Also:

Snape: “Fuck you, I have tenure!”

** I mean... when you say someone, anyone.. "stops" snape. Do you mean arrested or killed or is reformed acceptable. And what if the person who "stops" snape is himself? Also, how "stopped" is acceptable? Like, what if he is still a complete hardass but also fair.

Curious more than anything because I have read a few stories where he serves as some sort of mentor, father figure, or comrade to Harry after finding out information or traveling in time, or having guilt and so on... So it made me think about how vague your request was heh...

*** Yes.. I don't care if he gets fired, stabbed, arrested, killed, or just screamed at to the point where he, and Dumbledore by extension, figures out that the behavior he exhibits is not fit for a teacher, no matter how moving his sob story was and how useful he may have been as a spy..

The war ended 10 years before the first book.. Give the guy a job as a potions researcher and master brewer to the school/St Mungo and hire a real teacher.. He clearly despises children, and teaching them..

** Linkffn(the art of self fashioning) was a well written fic w an engaging plot. I had trouble connecting to the characters b/c Gray!Harry doesn't quite have friends (though he loves animals!)

It's more than a bit dark and definitely fits your request of Snape getting his comeuppance.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** "For the love of Magic" by noodlehammer. Snape gets away with playing his game until he doesn't.

Fair warning, there are some mature themes, mature scenes, and morality drift. Not often recommended because (not to get into spoiler territory, but...) the protagonist of the story isn't a "hero" (or, perhaps by the end of it, even a good person).

Apparently, there is a lot of hate over some anti-Islam rants within the story and "powerwank" themes. Looks like it wrapped up about a year ago, but the consensus seems to be that the author just wanted to switch to another fandom that wasn't so upset with him already

***** There's also a lot of really creepy sexual stuff: Tonks (an adult woman with a stable job) very explicitly wants fuck Harry when he's twelve or thirteen (I can't remember which; it's been a while), is /briefly/ concerned about this, and swoons over how "mature" he is until she decides that actually, it's totally cool. The author justifies this by having Harry use a ritual to make his body age faster. That was the point I stopped reading, but it purportedly gets worse from there. I can't imagine how that's possible, and I /don't want to know./
