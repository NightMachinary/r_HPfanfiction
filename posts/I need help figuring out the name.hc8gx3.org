:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What is the name of the fanfic where Harry is the dark lord and figures out that Luna is the light lady. And both are chosen by magic. I'd really appreciate the help.


** If you don't get an answer you should re-ask in a few days, but make the title more informative. Eg. “What's the fic where dark lord Harry and light lady Luna are chosen by magic?”

It also helps to include as much other information as you can in the body of your post. Things like the site you think it was on, its genre, other plot points, etc.
