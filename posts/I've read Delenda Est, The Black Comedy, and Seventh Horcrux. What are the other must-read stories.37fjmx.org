Also I just finished Delenda Est as I'm making this post. Holy shit what a great story. It was so well written compared to most fanfic. I was hesitant to read it for a long time because it was Harry/Bella which I thought was absurd.

--------------

I should say I've read a lot of other stories as well, the three I mentioned are just the ones that seem to be staples of HP Fanfic. Are there any others I've overlooked?

** For classics, sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]].

For a credible (if depressing) Book 8 of the series, I'd propose Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]].

For pro-quality writing and outstanding world building, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]'s Alexandra Quick series is certainly must-read caliber.

Myst Shadow's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] has a nicely detailed exploration of the intricacies of magic and is one of my personal favorites.

A recent story that probably will become "must-read" fare in time is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by The Carnivorous Muffin.

***** Both to some degree. JKR's canon tends to be of the 'fairytale' variety in that most things end up for the best. However, if we take a more realistic approach to the events after DH and before the epilogue we get something that probably resembles 'The Golden Age.'

Many of the characters in HP should be, and likely are, damaged people with more than just a /few/ issues. Harry is the king of the hill in this respect. I think it doesn't need to be explained why he has issues or what those are.

In fact lets look at the epilogue for a moment. We see a bunch of Potter kids that look like they were named by their father. Now, naming their daughter 'Lily' is fairly understandable, or even their firstborn as James is also understandable. Those follow fairly common traditional naming conventions. Now we don't see any of Ginny's influence in the names of those kids. Even the middle names relate to Harry and his family. Where is her father's name? Her mother's or grandmother's? And lets not even get started on the middle Potter child. That brings up a whole other mess of problems.

What we can draw from the epilogue is that Ginny was, to some degree, uninvolved, decision wise, in the most important moments in her life. What does that say for the whole picture after DH?

****** I've just started reading this fic over, and can certainly say that it has a strong element of realism to it. I'm only about half way through, so I can say little of how it ends, but so far it is addressing certain issues that I've often wondered about, and, too, showing how deep the scars of childhood go in the trio. More, it shows that the wizarding world is still refusing to change, and how power is a dangerous thing for anyone to have.

/This/ indeed seems like a far more realistic journey to the epilogue (which I've never liked one bit). Just because things look perfect from far away, does not mean that they are.

*** As much as I enjoy (most) of those, Forging the Sword is definitely the ultimate must-read in pretty well everything. Canon-compliance/expansion, good plot and story, realistic characterization, mature grasp of bashing/shipping (as in, none of it), and a perfect mix of originality and following canon within a narrow divergence. Whats not to love?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] by jbern is a second person adventure. It's definitely a must read if you can get used to the way it's written. It took me a couple of chapters to get used to it first time I read it but it's worth it. It has a sequel as well - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759007/1/Turn-Me-Loose-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][turn me loose]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've lived]] also by jbern. It's a favourite of many and whilst it has it's flaws the sorting hat's character makes up for them all.

Whilst I'm recommending Jbern's work I may as well include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To fight the coming darkness]]. It has a bit of grit to it, a good Voldemort and a nicely strong Harry.

**** If I recall, the beginning was written as a challenge back when jbern was having a public spat with various personalities on DLP; he and Bioplague/Merrill II both wrote the intros to stories for the community to judge. This was his entry.

While it was a bit clumsily done (it was written in jbern's early fanfiction days), the rest of the story is surprisingly good and re-readable.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] is quite funny. Features a lazy Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] is an excellent one-shot. Simple, beautiful writing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We're Fighting For]] has a badass Harry who's far more capable than his canon counterpart due to extensive training from Moody, Sirius, and Dumbledore.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]] is pretty humorous, but the focus isn't on the BWL so much as it is on Ron (In Name Only).

BajaB's Harry the Hufflepuff (and it's two sequels) are probably the best place to start. Absolutely hilarious.

***** It fits in as a comparison to the Mongomery sisters. Some lost their younger family members, such as their brother, while others lost their older family members, such as Hannah's mother.

You are correct about when she died. Hannah was told during Herbology (I only remember that because Sprout was her Head of House) in September or October and she didn't come back until the next year when Voldemort required attendance.

This all being said, I would still 'recommend' it, if only because of its prominence and approach.
