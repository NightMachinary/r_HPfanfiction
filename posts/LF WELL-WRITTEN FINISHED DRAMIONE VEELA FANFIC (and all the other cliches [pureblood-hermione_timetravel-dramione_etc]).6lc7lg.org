Now, I just dived into the world of fanfiction, I've read almost all the popular ones here posted. I'm curious as to what's this "veela" idea/sub-genre I've been reading all bout fanfiction.net and I'm curious as heck but I think the best way to introduce someone an idea to a fanfiction is to recommend your favorites :) So please please please recommend me your best/favorite veela dramione fanfics! And ofc all the sub-genre/idea that seems to cluster in fanfic sites! Thank you in advance!


** Okay well. This one is more a "subvert the veela trope" fic but I love it and it's SO well done: linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina). You can check dramioneasks on tumblr - they have lots sorted by genre/trope!

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.

** I was looking for recommendations and your comment irritated me. I apologise for being rude about it.

I have a lot of friends who used to write Dramione ff and many of these works are very much IC. I have actually found a great quantity of enjoyable Dramione fics (though not normally veela fics or other cliches) and most of the authors (those I've interacted with) are wonderful people on top of that. I think I was a bit offended, because I don't know why this subreddit has the impression that Dramione fics aren't well written... when I have found that there's a plethora of publishable-quality ff out there. Even just scrolling through FF.net I can normally find some great reads if I look at the review count.

Anyway, I am never upset if a certain ship isn't your cup of tea! I just was a bit offended on behalf of a lot of great authors I've known and read over the years. I shouldn't have reacted as quickly :) sorry again!

** There's no such thing. There's barely such a thing as a good Dramione fanfic.

*** Clearly you've never read an AnneM Oliver fic. A lot of Dramione is very well-written. Better than any Drarry I've come across...

**** Was it really necessary to comment on a month-old post?

I'm not really a fan of Drarry, either, for the same reason I don't like Dramione: everyone is horribly OOC, and not in a way I find fun or interesting.
