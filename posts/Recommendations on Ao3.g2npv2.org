anyone have good, well written drarry fanfictions? Preferably the long type of story (bare bare minimum being 10K words but would rather ~50K+) and set in hogwarts "8th" year type shit. Thanks in advance.


** This one is very well-written and over 100k words, and while it's focused on Harry and Draco, it doesn't really become Drarry until the end. Check it out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][here]].

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21921442/chapters/52322524][The Promise of Summer]] recently and it was absolutely amazing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]] is another great one set in 8th year.

If you don't mind reading non 8th year stuff, then I definitely suggest [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]], it's one of my all time favorites!
