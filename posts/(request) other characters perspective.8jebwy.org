does anyone in here happen to know of (or could write) a fanfiction from Hermione/Ron 's perspective through any of the years. I have always been really intrigued as to what other characters thought throughout the series


** Well, there are many Hermione centric fics, but they are mostly AU (alternate universe). If you are interested in those, I have several good ones to recommend.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is an excellent Year 6 story from Ginny's POV and fully canon compliant. It's also the one that got me interested in HP fanfics.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/]] is /Order of the Phoenix/ but told from Luna's point of view.

It's not completely canon compatible, given that it was written before /Half-Blood Prince,/ and some of the formatting is a little constrained, but for the most part, I think it holds up remarkably well.
