** If you haven't already read A Year Like None Other (you can find it on skyehawke). It's a slow build to a powerful Harry and it's very long, it also has two multi-chaptered sequels, one of which is still being written. It's very good!

*** /still/ being written? Gosh. I started reading it when it was like five chapters in. I'm just now getting into fan fiction again and seeing what would be a good first story to read in years.

I don't think I could re-read that one.

** Sunset over Britain and Sunrise over Britain are two fantastically writted books by Bobmin356 on fanficauthors.net both insanely long. But both feature a very (and credible) over powered Harry, with a terrible Voldemort to match, as well as actual drama.

[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/]] It was also written in 2005! So yay old plot devices!!! But still seriously fantastic

*** Interestingly, Sunset is one of the stories that use super!HHr tropes before they really became tropes, eg manip!Dumbledore, Dan/Emma Granger... So if you're looking for one of the fics that started this trend, you need look no further

**** Yes! I love that sometimes about reading old fics. Bobmin actually commented about it in one of their more recent fics how they've been writing HPfanfiction for so long that they wrote a lot of things well before it became tropes and then cliche.

*** Deprived also has a lot of other characters /commenting/ on how ridiculously powerful Harry is, which is half the fun of those kinds of stories. Also not going to get into how well written it is. I will say that I think for what it is, it's not /badly/ written.

**** Silly and good are not mutually exclusive in a Humor fic... You'll see what I mean when you reach the duck cannon. It's good, and I enjoyed reading it, but I enjoyed it in a similar manner to Monty Python.

Harry does things that /should/ be impossible like most people breathe.

** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]] It's a bit of a stretch to say this Harry is ridiculously overpowered, at least in the beggining, but it's still a /great/ read.

** try this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]] it is a cross over with the marvel universe. It is huge 700,000 words and 20 chapters long. Harry fights some of the most powerful characters in the marvel universe. even if you only have a vague idea of marvel universe it will see you through. be warned it is a harem fic. but not in the usual way. the women are well developed outside of the paring.

** I really enjoyed one of the original works titled "Knowledge is Power" where Harry is two years older then Neville, Ron and Hermione (them being the Boy-Who-Lived and Golden Trio). I feel like so many people have tried to emulate and even outright plagiarize it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]

Only downside is that it was abandoned, yet it was thankfully saved by an author who takes no credit for it
