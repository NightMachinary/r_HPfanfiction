Getting the Hang of Thursdays by Hayseed. One of the absolute best. I'll find a link soon.

Edit: [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/][Link to Wordpress]]

Summary: A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again. Inspired by the WIKTT Time-Loop Challenge.

  I intend for the story to be done in another two updates. Another 'regular' chapter and then several of them posted at once as the ending. I have put four weeks as the target date for next chapter, and the last update will probably take even longer than that. But you will get several chapters for that, so it should be fine.

#+begin_quote
  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  The original sequel to "The Course of Love". This is in the middle of a massive re-write just like "The Course of Love" so if things are confusing, that's why. It'll be a while before I have the re-write complete. Sorry. The Darcy family plans to welcome a new member, but dangerous interference from the press could spell disaster for the pair. *In the process of being rewritten*
