At the core of the whole HP world is the concept that the magical world sucessfully hides itself from the mundane one. There are noted events when this doesn't work, and muggles have to be obliviated, but the fact that the masquerade seems to be holding, and these are worth talking about suggests that this doesn't happen often.

Yet this is also a world with dragons. According to the HP wiki, the largest dragon is the Ukranian Ironbelly, which reaches 6 tonnes. I then assume a typical dragon is in the range of 1 tonne. A quick google of the food requirements of raptors and lions (dragons fly, but are large enough that keeping warm is easy), suggests they eat about 5% of their weight in meat every day. This is about 1 sheep, per day, per dragon. There are apparently 2 separate species of dragon in Britain alone (i.e. populations large enough to be self sustaining). In a world with land registry, tax authorities, farming subsidies, muggle neighbours, and in remote mountain regions, hiking clubs and RAF training areas, both the dragons and their food supplies would not go unnoticed, especially as they are apparently concentrated into just Wales and the Hebrides. Also apparently the Hebridean Black requires "territory as much as 100 square miles each". The land area of the Hebrides is about 2,500 square miles, allowing at most 30 dragons with 45,000 people living within their territories and never seeing them.

My headcannon solution to this is that there are magical pockets of land, either natural or wizard made, which magical creatures mainly live in. Wizards protect the access points to these spaces, so muggles can't wander in and the magical creatures rarely escape, rather than chasing down every paraglider who flies into a hippogriff. This also explains how diagon alley is still hidden despite there existing comprehensive maps and aerial photography, how platform 9 3/4 exists, and how nobody had put a building foundation or drain pipe through the ministry of magic. They are in a pocket dimension of their own, which have an access point through the brick walls/phone box.

Alternatively someone write a fic where Harry becomes Lord Potter, rediscovers his ancestral manor, then spends years in court trying to evict a Traveller community which had set up there.


** My theory of "wizard space" as many fics call it is that the surface of reality/the world can be viewed as a map. If you then took the boundaries of wizarding areas and stitched them together you could create a new flat "surface" that doesnt show Diagon Alley for example. The creases and dimples where the folds come together are places like the Leaky Cauldron

All peculiarities in street design and geological shape to the world are due to various wizarding folds.

*** In linkffn(A Time Apart by Ozzallos), a multicross of mostly Ranma/Sailor Moon/Harry Potter, Sailor Pluto notes that wizard spaces are out of phase with mundane reality, which would mean that there's probably an entire wizarding Earth available. That seems incompatible with the treatment of #12 Grimmauld Place and the Leaky Cauldron, though.

In linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream), a Sherlock cross, Sherlock notes that #12 Grimmauld Place is one of about three dozen "missing" houses he knows of in London, and mentions social organizations devoted to such locations worldwide. This fits your "wizard space," but indicates that even if a property is protected by fidelius or other charms, there are effects that muggles can note if they're paying attention.

  “That's been done. Anyway, once I'd got the streets down, I walked them all. Studied them all. Noticed the anomalies. Did you know, for example, that there are precisely thirty-seven missing houses in London?”

  “Like Leinster Gardens?” asked Mary, shivering. She really didn't like to think about what had happened and almost happened there, although things had worked out in the end.

  “Well no, Leinster Gardens has house numbers and fake house fronts but there's a physical gap where the houses themselves are missing. These missing houses are just ... not there. Gaps in the sequence where there's no reason for there to be a gap, but no actual gap between houses. A street with eight houses on one side and seven identical houses and a missing number on the other side. And nobody notices that it takes forty paces to walk from the north end of the street to the south, but forty-four from south to north, only on the side with the missing number.”

And, in non-fanfiction, R. A. Lafferty's "Narrow Valley" has a marvelous description of what you see when you try to throw a rock the apparent 8 feet from one side of the magically-narrowed valley to the other.

***** No, I mean they mess with the muggle's perception of the world. So the muggles start their scientific beginnings with the wrong "blueprints" so to speak.

Say the world is X by Y by Z. But after wizard magic, it's actually A by B by C. That could potentially mess up a lot of research.

Not to mention weather patterns.

I don't think so, Harry probably has like a Welsh green or something protecting the manor.
