I'm looking for something that starts as a mentor/student relationship, which turns into friendship, which may or may not turn into romance. A good example of this would be the phoenix trilogy: linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the HB P).\\
Or, I'd like a relationship similar to the one Hermione has with Snape in linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina) - truly excellent fic, by the way; I highly recommend - but where their relationship is the main focus of the story.

Snape has to truly care about the student he's mentoring. The story could go through all seven years at Hogwarts, or just a few. But really I just want a strong, positive, mentor role for Snape to a female student - ideally Hermione, preferably not Pansy.

I also want to point out, for anyone else is searching for what I was, that there are two earlier fics in the series---I got a couple chapters into The Ambiguous Artifice before realizing my mistake---and that the author has just recently posted the first couple chapters of Book 4.

** While Snape is a reluctant mentor (and Hermione is a self starter), this is a feature of linkffn(applied cultural anthropology).

Also, I have a pretty good Snape mentors Draco fic if thats acceptable and you're looking for a project. linkffn(innocent) is a long, long fic focusing around the premise that Sirius black escapes early and kidnaps Harry. A sub plot is that there are two malfoy children Hydrus (basically cannon Draco) and Draco. To hedge their bets, the malfoys try to get Draco sorted into gryffindor (and ask Snape to mentor him to get there). It's an unusual take, and really the only reason I continue to follow the fic.

** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, the Slytherin) has a strong Mentor!Snape.

Linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) also has a lot of Snape.

I believe he's present in linkffn(brilliant Magic by LJ summers)

There are, of course, the forced mentorings of Hermione by Snape, usually pushed by Dumbledore. This can be seen in linkffn(5089614), Linkffn(7170435), linkao3(311126) [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17863&i=1][Second Life alt link]]

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I think linkffn(the irony by awakethelion) applies.

***** I just finished Second Life - that one was new for me, so thanks for the recommendation - and while everything leading up to the final battle was pretty average, the post war arc was standout. Severus' apathy, and then Hermione's, and the entire trial. How people didn't fall over themselves to forgive Severus, the one guy who couldn't let it go in the courtroom, and the slap on the writst that they felt obligated to give him. The whole thing was brilliantly done.

** linkffn(looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconis) super long, I read it a while ago but remember it being entertaining even if the characters were slightly over powered.

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)
