Any fics where Ron is the one that steps up? Like for whatever reason hermione is the one that doesnt believe harry about the tournament or she dies or something that ends up with her not being the “good” friend


** Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) if you can get past the first ten ish chapters it's a really excellent series, Ron becomes a really good friend and smart while hermione takes a lot longer to get there
