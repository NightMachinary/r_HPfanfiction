When reading older fanfiction sometimes you come across relics of early fandom, Fanon names for Luna's parents, alternate horcruxes, or the Hermione Jean/Jane debacle, but sometimes you come across something that seems SUPER strange in retrospect. Here are my favorites that I've seen.

A H/Hr fic written between GOF and OotP had a gem in the beginning authors note to the effect of: "Don't worry Krum is not in this fic."

A fic written between OotP and HBP where Mundungus Fletcher was described as an all around good guy that had a moment of bad judgement getting drunk on the job once. He even was the one to shuttle around the Black estate after Sirius died.

Anyone else have anything like this? I'd love to see it.


** In some of the old ones like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]] Ginny gets called Virginia. Aldo in some really ancient ones you'll get stuff like the Potters being older, weird explanations for Voldemort's immortality pre-horcrux reveal, and complete books written with the name of whatever book wasn't published yet.

Nope. Aristos are people. We all know that there are people who don't care much about their appearance.

If you're thinking of the sort of aristo that dresses up in stupid clothes to go and grovel at royalty or debate in Parliament or be seen with The Right People around town - they're a small minority of the aristocracy. Most of them are younger sons or members of unimportant cadet lines and most aren't even very well off. They weren't even very well off a coupla hundred years ago.

It really shouldn't, unless the author of the fic explicitly tells so, There are so many contradicting and simply different shit going on from the books to the movies that make everything seem so confusing. After a while, it really blurs the line from to another.

** I remember when OotP was announced but not released, there were a whole series of fics that tried to guess at what the order would be (much like many others did for the other books). My favourite was one where Harry is recruited into an insane secret spy agency where the members could change their appearance at will and had earpieces that would play situationally appropriate music when they weren't otherwise in use. It's what we would now call AU, but at the time was just an insane guess at the next book. I've never found it again because it was (if I remember right) names HP and the OotP.

Harry and Ginny were divorced, Rose had a huge crush on Harry and ended up going with it after she turned 17, Hermione knew and was okay with it because Rose had wanted it for a while and was an adult, Ron and Ginny didn't find out until later and were pretty pissed.

It was pretty fluffy and I enjoyed it, then maybe halfway through suddenly Rose has to confront her abusive ex bf who's now constantly trying to attack her, she suddenly has panic attacks and is emotionally/mentally unstable, and Harry knocked her up. Completely ruined it for me lol.

  Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light; He was laughing at her. "Come on, you can do better than that!" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room.

  The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.

  The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.

But for real, the old AOL and Mugglenet forums had a lot of discussion about this. We all speculated he'd come back since the spell wasn't green. It was definitely collective wishful thinking at its finest..... but we were grasping at anything when it came to trying to figure out what could happen next.

** Sirius/Remus was tacitly assumed to be canon by a /large/ portion of the early fanfic community & tbh JKR lost a lot of respect when she hard-nixed it. Sirius/Marlene McKinnon was Sirius's big straight pairing. And then even those who weren't sure on Wolfstar were pretty sure Lupin was a canonically queer man that JKR was just tacitly not mentioning for editorial reasons but was giving adult readers as many hints as she could about.

In fanfic I guess a lot of stuff that was seeded in the books we expected to come back around, e.g. Veelas, giants, acromantula and metamorphmagi. Given JK's propensity for Chekhov guns it seemed like a lot of that would come back.

I vaguely recall before we had Luna, Ginny/Neville was a strong secondary pairing in Harmony fics as a comic relief couple. And on that point, Harry/Luna never really hit its stride as a huge pairing until the OOTP movie.
