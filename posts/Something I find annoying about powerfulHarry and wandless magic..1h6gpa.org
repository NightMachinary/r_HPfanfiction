It's so irritating when Harry is able to do wandless magic to Dumbledore's calibre right off the bat. I'm currently reading /Protection/ by PrincessPotter, and though I LOVE the story (Harry/Ginny and GREAT characterization, IMO), it does get a little frustrating when Harry is using all of this advanced wandless magic.

In my opinion, that is something that might take years to develop and at /best/, I just imagine him being able to do simple spells. (/Accio,/ etc.)

Sigh... If the story is good, it's forgivable, but sometimes it's a bit much!


** What I don't really like about how wandless magic is put in fanfics is that its not a powerful form of magic to begin with, its the whole point of wizards using wands. Wands are the focal and enhancing device for magic, and a closely guarded secret, so powerful that other races are ban from their using them.

Going back to wandless magic seems rather counter intuitive if the aim is to became a more powerful wizard. The most it would be as I can see it, is as a one trick pony attempt at fooling the enemy a false sense of security if you lost your wand.

*** Yeah. I agree with you. I was going to mention something about Dumbledore and wandless magic, but the more I think about it, I think most instances of wandless magic with him involved recognizing enchantments, etc. (Like at the cave in HBP.) I imagine any wandless magic to be kind of rudimentary, like you said. Very well put.

I feel like I search high and low for great fanfiction (canon pairings, good grammar/writing and great characterization), but there's always something about it that gets to me! Haha. This is one of those things.

** I think in general more authors need to get it though their heads that every bit of power and ability they give to their "heroes" automatically ups the level of challenge they need to present to said heroes in order for their story to be interesting for its conflict.

Wandless magic is but one type of powers HP fanfics keep bringing up. Telepathy and magic communication, new powerful spells, wards, unique modes of travel, f-ing house elves - a slave race that is somehow even in canon shown to be more powerful than their "masters"... (why isn't Voldermort breeding these buggers as shock troops since even an abused, dumb one like Dobby can easily handle one of his death eaters?)

In my reading, more than any other flaw in fics (even more common than bad grammar) overpowered MC is the most frequent. I don't stop reading them because action is not high on my list of important story aspects, but still, after MC is established as being overpowered, I find it necessary to just start skipping all following action scenes. They will be either boring if the writer shows such powers used properly, if frustrating if they are not. Since many fics end with several chapters with action heavy climaxes I often don't finish reading them for this reason.

I frankly can't understand why such a high percentage of writers seem to fail on such a basic concept as power balance between their antagonists and protagonists.

*** Ugh, f'ing seriously. Are you reading my mind? Your first paragraph is just spot on especially. It makes the action so boring when the MC is so "all powerful." It's just so unrealistic. Why do I want to read about a character who never fails? Boring!

I like action sequences, but it is hard to find fics where it is genuinely well done. I find it most tolerable when Harry (my MC of choice, of course) is flawed and not some superhuman person. I just think that's so dumb. Like you said, authors don't up the anty enough to make it believable. And, really, the characters are fine as they are without the added bonus of being such magnificant wizards that they are infallible.

** I try hard in my stories to make any wandless magic either a pain in the ass even if it is powerful, or only useful for things that would be easier to learn the muggle way (sleight of hand) or something like summoning his wand if it is knocked/taken away.

In my current story I plan to severely overpower Harry including wandless magic, but Voldemort was nerfed in chapter...3? And any opponents he has will be Gods, so he will ALWAYS be underpowered compared to his foe, and need brains and luck to win.

Very anime.

I agree with you though, when wandless becomes the end all of all magic and Harry just happens to be a natural AND super powerful it drives me nuts. I guess its become so cliche I just accept it without a thought now...

**** I have though I hate plugging my own stories, especially when its WIP and has been unupdated for...2 months? /sigh/

Maybe I can make myself write again, I love the story, I just burned myself out between work/writing/single dadding...and everquest2.

Anyways, its a crossover with the anime Shuffle! but you don't have to be familiar with the source because I cover the pertinent points (and add my own).

** I like a powerful Harry but I completely agree with you that it's most often terribly overdone. Really powerful wandless magic being flung all over the place is so not canon it's almost AU.

It particularly makes me crazy when the author has made him the most powerful wizard since Merlin and yet has him being escorted around by groups of people for his protection. It's like they didn't even think about the story they're trying to tell.

Yeah, I don't mind him being powerful. I mean, Harry /is/ powerful in his own way. But yes, it is often far too overdone and is just difficult to read. I love good action (and violence, yeah I said it), and I hate it when the author makes Harry escape unscathed or barely injured because of his "immense skill and prowess." I'm just like... Yeah right.

*** Hm, yeah, good point.

I guess what I'm saying is, in certain contexts (and with certain characters), "wandless magic" makes sense. But when it's bolts coming from your hands, stunning spells, shit like that... It's just a bit much. I could understand accidental magic or small spells...

It may have taken him a month with a wand, but I think that IF he were even remotely capable of doing wandless magic, it would take months if not YEARS to learn. I think people in fanfiction tend to make it seem like he's just so awesome and powerful that it comes naturally. I don't buy that.

Harry's powerful when it comes to defensive spells (using a wand). But apart from that... Yeah, no.

I see what you mean, though.

** Wahoo, another Protection fan! That story is one of my all time favorites, and, interestingly enough, the author has a great explanation for harry being overpowered. It is actually one of the few fics that does it right, just wait and see ;) That being said, I totally know what you're saying. I only really read H/G and nothing pisses me off more than an over powered harry. The character becomes boring because he is no longer being challenged or is vulnerable. The worst thing about an overpowered harry though is how he interacts with others. Suddenly, everyone is pretty much his inferior. I like Ginny as a character because she is strong, but what does that matter when harry is running around calling on the elements and turning into a frickin gryphon. I guess my point is, if you are going to "level up" a character, everyone needs to level up, enemies and friends alike. Also, every overpowered harry character is a dick.

LOL, yeah I know, right? It's irritating. And yeah, Protection is good. The over-powerfulness is understandable in that story, but I read it more for Harry and Ginny's relationship. I like the premise of the story, even if the over-powerful Harry can get a little annoying even there. (When he 'changes'.)

***** I love fanfiction that has well-written action sequences, believable angst, and also believable romance. Preferably all these things combined, but I am happy with anything, really. I will even read AU if the characterizations are canon.

I hope that helps. Basically anything you've enjoyed that has good grammar.... Haha.

Fantastic Harry and Ginny dynamic. Their relationship is the main focus, but there is also a nice amount of action. Probably my favorite fanfiction version of Ginny because it portrays her as strong and doesn't just forget about the chamber.

Normalcy: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11821]]

A big part of this story is harry getting pretty severely injured at the beginning. It is interesting to read something where the main character isn't untouchable.

Yellow submarine: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine]]

Tied with "Need" as my favorite. This story is funny and touching, but I have to warn you, rape is a huge part of it and there are some graphic descriptions. This is definitely my favorite harry. The author has written a few other stories and they are great as well.

Growing up kneazel: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129206]]

This story is awesome. Seriously one of the funniest things I have ever read. The sequel is a work in process but the author updates regularly.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=10831]] This author has written a couple of stories I really liked, just browse around her stuff.

A dream unlocked: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=5395]]

Not my absolute favorite, but interesting story. I like it because it deals with Ginny and Tom quite a bit.

I have about 80 stories I have read and favorited, but these should start you off :P Do you have any stories that you would recommend?

All of these are good authors and I have read most of their other stories, definitely check out what else they have written.
