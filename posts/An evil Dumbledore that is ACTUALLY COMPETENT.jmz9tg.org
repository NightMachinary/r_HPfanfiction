Title says it all. I don't mind a "For The Greater Good" Dumbledore in a story, but I've read so many fics that have him hold the idiot ball the moment it turns out he's not just a nice grandfatherly figure. He's got his reputation for a reason, but the Dumbledore in some of these stories seems like he made it to his position and title by some unseen miracle rather than with great talent and legendary feats.

So any stories where he does some questionable things, gets bashed or is just downright evil, but is also competent and not a bumbling idiot that gets outed and defeated by a bunch of teenagers on a whim would be appreciated. I'd rather see him go down fighting, and hard at that, when Indy!Harry and co bust him instead of having having him collapse like a house of cards, at least that way it feels earned and satisfying. Have the story actually explore how horrible the situation is with a legendary wizard of his stature doing things that are wrong, and sticking by these actions, instead of just taking the easy way out. A Dumbledore that is off the rails should be comparable to Voldemort as a threat, if not outright more terrifying than him altogether.

All recommendations are appreciated.

** Nightmares of Futures Past depicts him as fairly competent and not evil, but inclined to think that he knows best without reference to other people's opinions, which naturally puts him in conflict with a Harry who has future knowledge and is therefore walking his own path. Incomplete, updating about once every three years. FFN deleted it for bogus reasons, but you can get a PDF or eBook from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

For a somewhat more evil Dumbledore, there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303265/1/Wait-What][first chapter]] of "Wait, What?", which is basically a collection of one-shots.

  “Blood of the friend, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your ally.”\\
  Voldemort is resurrected. It doesn't go exactly like in the books. This is what happens when I read a bunch of 'good Voldemort, evil Dumbledore' stories, and then try to imagine what it would actually be like for Severus Snape in such a universe during the thirteen years spent alone at Dumbledore's side. Here's a hint: Voldemort is not easily getting his spy out of Dumbledore's clutches. And saving Harry Potter may be a bit of a trial as well.
