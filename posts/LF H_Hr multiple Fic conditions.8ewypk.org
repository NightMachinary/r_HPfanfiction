I posted this in the Harmony, but nobody gave a result. Maybe these dont exist, but i want to give it a try here.

Want to know, if there are Fics with the listed requirements:

1. Hermione is dragged into an alternate Universe, where the War lasted longer and is more darker. Harry and Hermione are in this Universe "companions-in-arms" and lovers. He is the Leader of the Light Side (like in Canon) and she is his confidante. While the Canon Hermione "loves" Ron, she finds this AU Harry soon attractive and has a crush on him. He is more mature than Canon Harry (not sure, how to describe it, to be honest) and trained than his counterpart, but he distrusts Canon Hermione (dont know about the AU one, maybe she was killed recently or dragged into the Canon Universe). However during the Time, she spends there, they grow fond of each other and make love. Hermione even thinks about stay in this Universe (not necessary).
2. during the Horcrux Hunt, Ron finds his way alone back to the Trios Tent, but there he Witness how H/Hr are kissing (not like the Locket scene, but rather tender) and is hesitating about return to them or not, because he blames himself that they grow this close....or whatever. The Kiss between them might not be a "serious" thing, so it could just have been a misinterpretation of Ron. Both POVs would be good.
3. post Hogwarts, but no Canon Pairs: H/Hr are very good and really close friends, who occasionally sleep with each other. I wouldnt say "Friends with Benefits", although it might get to this. When Harry is touching Hermiones Hip after the Work and knows, where and how she likes it and she wants more. Im eager to read about the "Moments" or "Mornings after", imagining Hermione wearing one of Harrys shorts with just a couple of Buttons connected (if not completely open). However, they are not a Couple, just some Friends who spend the Night together from time to time. It would be also good, if Hermione takes the initiative occasionally.
4. Hermione is confronted with a AU Vision (or “visit”) of her and Harry lovemaking. (might be connected with Nr.1)
5. again the Hunt: while Hermione had a Crush on Harry during the Years, but "fell in love" with Ron, since his leaving, her old feelings for the Boy-who-lived begin to grow anew. She might have an inner fight with herself and in the end she cant bare it anymore and eagerly kissing a totally unprepared Harry....or since Harrys break up with Ginny, he has starting to have feelings for Hermione and since Rons leaving, she can see the desire in his Eyes (in addition to her new found feelings for him).
6. Whether Canon Hunt or AU, where its H/Hr from the beginning: due to their time alone, Harry slowly longs for Hermione and her touch, while she concentrates on their Task and ask Harry to do the same because: if they once started with IT, they are distracted for the whole Task.
7. a Fic with Canon pairs, but with “intense and intimate” H/Hr Moments. I remember, there was a Fic on Deviantart that was written around a picture with H/Hr playing with snowballs. As far as i know, Hermione is stuck in her Bra and Harry needs to help her unclip it. So, they are in moments/situations, that are usually only for Couples. And they might feel embarassed, but (possibly also) attracted.

Oh, i have a request for the name of a Fic, too: it was written movie-verse, so Harry did his Goodbye to Ron and Hermione, but after he departures, she follows after the next corner, drags him into a empty classroom and they start Kissing. She even is about to open his trousers, but he interrupts her. If i remember, there was the dance song of the Tent in a Radio, or some sort. Harry refuses to have a "quickie" and tells himself, that if he doesnt make it, Ron will take his place.

*** Not OP, but there are so many stories I want to read but they haven't been written (decently) yet and there's no way I can write them because there's only have so much time and I'm already working on two long-term projects.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.
