Read Grow Young With Me, was asleep in 20 minutes and didn't wake up once. Going to be trying out Vox Corporis tonight. Thanks reddit!


** Author here. Before anyone gets downvoted or upvoted to oblivion, I just wanted to say that if my story helps you fall asleep, then I'm glad. Insomnia is a bitch.

Okay, good day.

*** As the one who recommended it I did really enjoy the fic but I could easily see it as a calm, gentle fic to read when you're trying to go to sleep. Apparently it worked.

**** Would've done the same, had I seen the thread. It's just so sweet and has a really calming effect!

*** Thanks for being such a good sport. The writing was good and it was definitely enjoyable but as I didn't get too immersed once I hit a certain part of it I fell asleep. Good work though!

*** Good day to you too. Hope you don't let people like me get you down and keep improving. Who knows, maybe I'll end up liking something else you write.

******* Doesn't seem like that from the downvotes you are getting. xD Good on you for liking the fic I guess. I thought it was bad, but maybe that's just me.

Huh. You're right. Edited it to make it a bit more obvious.

** No need to be a passive aggressive twat. If you didn't like the story leave a review. I thought the story was written wonderfully. If you don't have the patience to read a good romance don't read them.

*** OP posted before literally asking for boring fic suggestions to help fall asleep. Clearly, somebody delivered. 'Good' is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to fanfic (or any writing in general really...). Another rec on that thread was vox corporis. I love me some Harmony, but thought someone needed to take that beast out back and put it out if it's misery. We each have our own preferences, and fics we hate. And this is actually somewhere we can talk about that without being told "don't ever say anything that might hurt the precious author's feelings".

**** Well I don't hold anything against this guy for not liking the fic, but making a thread about it without any real critique is over the top. Didn't know there was a thread earlier, but generally if you're going to start a thread on why you hate a fic, you should make sure theres some actual substance first. Sure we shouldn't be afraid to call out authors, but we should also have some semblance of decency.
