Seriously, what is the point? I am genuinely curious why people copy nearly word for word canon events, and only change things /that do absolutely nothing for the story./

It's called fanfiction, not copy and paste canon.

I'm currently reading a fic that drastically changes Harry's abilities and early childhood, but so far it has does absolutely /NOTHING/ to change any events. It's asinine.

I can understand following major plot points. Troll, Chamber, Sirius, Goblet- etc. But when you copy everything, and change nothing, why does your story exist?

I remember a fic where Harry asked Hermione to the Yule Ball. Beyond them being more close, nothing changed. That story is pointless. Just read the books at that point.

I am doing a terrible job of explaining this, so I apologize, for that and the rant. But if you know you know.

Note- I'm not trying to put anybody down, if anything I'm trying to encourage people. Change /everything./ If your story can be swapped with the books with nary a difference, you're doing something wrong.

TL;DR- Why write fanfiction if you don't change anything? If everything happens as it does in canon, with changes that make no difference, or should make a BIG difference but don't, why does your story exist?


** The thing you're criticizing is called “stations of canon,” not “canon compliance.” “Canon compliance” is generally filling in missing details from canon, like young Voldemort's rise to power, Moody and Tonks' Auror careers, Andromeda and Ted's romance, etc.

“Stations of canon” means rewriting, or sometimes even copying and pasting the same old memorable moments from canon with minor changes, like “If Harry had been raised by Sirius, Sirius would have been so proud when Harry got put on the quidditch team after that remembrall incident.” I'm not into those either, but I don't begrudge people who enjoy them.

*** Time travels that rehash canon stations are absolutely the most frustrating type of fics.

Time travel or knowledge about the future is the ultimate Deus Ex Machina, but these authors either have a too strong attachment to canon plot or don't know how to use future information effectively. The key to improve the outcome is not trying to alter some canon stations to their favor, but striking directly at Voldemort's greatest vulnerabilities using future information.

There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

**** Quite, which is why the tried and true argument to keep changes to a minimum as to preserve the foreknowledge they have is so very dull, I mean there is being strategic and there is being a passive observer and in these sort of stories it's even ethically questionable...

**** Not if the Time-travelling is self-consistent. Or if your aim is to prevent a very specific event in the future which you don't want to butterfly out of control. Eg: Six Pomogranate Seeds. I do agree that sensible fics that don't change canon are far and few between. I believe the the time traveller likes to selfishly maintain a safety net of precognition in these fics versus the uncertainty of an open future.

** As I understand it, canon compliance means the story doesn't contradict anything canon says. But there's lots of fics that are canon compliant without copy-pasting canon. Such fics can expand on the world's history, or describe character interactions that occur off-camera, or describe a possible future for the world, after canon finishes.

Here's one of my favorite canon-compliant oneshots, if you're interested in reading a relatively good one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13268227/1/Compliant]])

(incidentally, it's also about compliance in the sense of obedience)

** That's not what canon compliance is. I only write canon compliance so I try, as best I can, not to change anything and instead write prequels, missing moments or alternate povs, or sequels around the existing story. It means that the reader already has an established knowledge of what has happened and I can play on that with bittersweetness, foreshadowing, or an in depth background.

You're perfectly entitled to find it boring - personally I don't enjoy alternate universe. Everyone likes different things.

** I don't remember the specific fic, but i read one where Harry and Hermione went to the same school before Hogwarts and she got him in trouble with the Dursleys and he hated her for it. This makes him supposedly Uber-cunning, in a way I've never seen in another fic. He's supposed to be “a snake in lion's clothing” (for lack of a better phrase) and the whole story from then on is essentially word for word canon except filled with Harry's inner monologue about why he's being so cunning by doing everything he's doing to appear and sound exactly like the boy-who-lived they expect and not who he truly is. The only real difference was that he let Hermione get attacked by the troll. I didn't finish it because it was ridiculous.

** I agree with you. I once read a story, (or should partially read) about Harry getting sorted into Slytherin, with the synopsis about how Harry's school experience would be different if he was sorted into Slytherin. The only difference was he was sorted into Slytherin, had different conversations inside the dorms, and didn't have Ron wanting to play chess. He still became friends with a guy and a girl, that he hung around with all the time, and once he stepped outside the Slytherin dorm, the author, rather than typing it all out, may as well as put a line in.. "See Philosopher's Stone pages 125-145." Other than the scenes inside the dorms, there was literally no difference from the actual book.

Alternately, I have read stories of Harry getting sorted into Slytherin, and while the events from the books still played out, Harry was doing his own thing, and was not in the center of it, so we heard of it peripherally, as Harry heard about it. For example, while Harry was still the Boy who Lived, it was Ron, Hermione and Neville that had the run in with the troll. The detention in the Forbidden forest with Voldement killing the unicorns, Harry wasn't there and heard about it from Draco. Also, as far as Quirrel and the Philosopher's stone was concerned, all Harry heard was that something happened and that Quirrel was no longer able to teach the remainder of the year.

** I agree so much

I think people keep things same because it gives you a framework to follow and a level of familiarity

Like for example.

In many fics where Harry ends up a slytherin he still ends up very close to Hermione. Probably because Hermione is a popular familar character and has a useful role and can keep providing that role of being the smart one.

Even though realistically it makes more sense a different Slytherin would be the one Harry got close to and someone else would fill the smart one role instead of Hermione. They'd likely have to be a more minor character that needed more fleshing out too and to many what makes fics fun to write is because its with familiar characters so that might not be appealing.

I may have missed something here, but in what magical realm is that "canon compliant"? I dunno, back in my day canon meant things happened precisely how the 7 books made it, and you filled in the blanks. No ifs and buts.

** Sometimes even following major events is unnecessary. Like some people seem to believe someone /must/ escape Azkaban the summer of '93. In stories where Sirius is free, I've seen Bellatrix and Peter escape for no reason at all other than to hit the station.

The troll entering the school and CoS might be the only inescapable stations. Hermione doesn't need to be in the bathroom, though, and a lot of CoS things don't need to happen, especially if Harry isn't friends with Ron and/or in Gryffindor.

** Canon compliance can be a cool way to explore another character. Writing events outside of Harry's perspective certainly helps.

I fell down the HP fanfiction rabbit hole in the first place reading one-shots about Hermione's pov. Maybe you've been reading fanfiction for too long, and you're just unimpressed by CC stories now?

** Well, I mean this kind of stories is not that common. If anything I love to see more stories were authors don't copy baseless fandom cliches with almost genuine perception of them as canon: all powerful goblins, Dumbledore being evil, magical cores being a thing, magical oaths being a thing (I am not talking about Unbreakable Vow), magical marital contracts, titles Lords and Ladies for heads of pureblood families, etc.\\
If anything, most good canon compliance stories are for those who love to see "missing scenes" that would fit into original timeline.

Though, I prefer stories with canonical worldbuilding but with major divergence event.

** It seems I used the wrong lingo, and people are upset and aren't understanding my point.

I meant writing canon events, and not changing things, even when things should be changed.

Like Harry having proper guardians, but them not being upset over him fighting a troll or the basilisk.

Writing Moody's early life and how he became Mad-Eye isn't what I'm referring to. I'm referring to basically writing canon events as they happened in the books. Like the books from Hermione's pov, a person who was there for the whole damned thing.

Figured I'd say it louder for the people in the back or not paying attention.

*** Yes I totally agree with you. I see so many stories were the author is introducing new interesting element but then just repeating canon, like the timeline wouldn't have a different outcome. Iv see it done many different ways, some rewrite entire sections from the book, or recape the actions without to many details, or worse write new action between the existing scenes and think that people remember every part of the books.

I think it comes down to experience, and getting better as an author. Following the main plot lines can be a great platform to shape your story after, but it can equally be a thin line to walk, to have enough material on your own and reusing to much from the books.

** Sometimes I like it. Sometimes it's done badly.

I quite like stories where the basic plot is the same just Harry is different because he's in slytherin say ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/14/][on the way to greatness]] springs to mind) but that's generally because the interest is with the character and their development. The plot is more of a sidenote.

Personally, I always write canon compliantly. My stories are only oneshots so it doesn't matter really since I just choose the in-between moments that weren't in the books...

I don't like reading stories that are too "non canon". If it's a big event like Time Travel or a character doesn't die, where obviously events will be different, sure im all for it. But I have no interest in reading a Harry/Hermione because in my head, that's not what happened so it feels wrong. To me it just feels fake and 'like fanfiction' (yes I understand how hypocritical that sounds).. Keep it canon please...

Though I'm fully aware my preferences are not at all reflective of everyone else's but hey! An opinion!

** I think canon compliance is only acceptable when it's marauder since anything can happen in the years any friendships relationships as long as jily happens and the two snape incidents that are canon confirmed. However, all the endings are extremely bitter sweet and any scene with peter being a good loyal friend is filled with dramtic irony. I do love it though when Peter is more of a lackey than James and Sirius like because he'll do anything they ask, it seems more accurate.

** I disagree. I read/used to write fanfiction because I love the universe and like to explore it further or explore what-if scenarios. If I'm going to +write+ read something that has nothing to do with the Harry Potter universe other than the names then may as well read an original work. That way, if it's good, I can even support the author financially.

*** What sort of What If scenarios can you write without changing Canon in some way? You can't have Harry sorted into Slytherin, as that goes against Canon. You can't have someone else fight the troll or go against Quirrelmort, as that again would be against Canon. Other that telling the story from say Lavenders or Neville's perspective, it would be extremely difficult to stay 100% Canon in any story.

On the other hand, I have read supposed crossover stories such as with LOTR, where the entirety of the story takes place in LOTR Canon, Harry is the only one there from HP Canon, and other than being named Harry and Hogwarts getting mention once or twice in the entire story, they may as well as cut out the Hogwarts mentions, changed the name of Harry's character and just said it was a LOTR story, as it really had nothing to do with Harry Potter Canon.

**** I mean that the set up of the story remains largely unchanged. Harry is orphaned by Voldemort and is forced to live with his relatives until he gets invited to Hogwarts. That's basically the setup of the whole story. Also the personalities of the characters remain largely unchanged as well as the established magical world.

***** Good point. Using that as a basis, there are still quite a number of stories that can be told without diverting from established lore. For example, While JKR has touched on some incidents that happened with Harry pre Hogwarts, it is still a wide open slate that could be utilized, while still staying Canon compliant.

****** Also with regards to what you were saying on crossovers... I'll admit I am not a big fan of those... but if you do it - and there are some done correctly out there - you need to have a dominant universe. Like in case of the two most popular HP xovers - Marvel/HP - do you have mutants that have some scientific explanation to mutants'/superheroes' powers which are pretty restrictive or do you go by the HP universe in which anyone can learn those skills? Or if you go for HP/LOTR... does the whole action happen in our world or in the Middle Earth? And, depending what you choose, do the rules from one universe or the other apply to magic?

For me Xovers are a pain because you have to pacify both fandoms if you are looking for popularity, but even if you write for yourself... you still need to be consistent in your storytelling. Personally, I think the only fandom that is somewhat compatible with HP is Sabrina the teenage witch... the only difference is that in one universe you have latin words for spells while in one you have rhymes (although judging from Ron's first on-page attempt at magic, that's not necessarily untrue in the HP universe).
