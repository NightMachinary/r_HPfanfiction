Why?

every time I read a fic where they use condom or are like, I don't have a condom, I cringe.

wizarding world is so anti-muggle, why do you think they would use something so muggle as a condom? they use quills instead of pens. they don't know what clothes muggles wear. they turn their noses on muggle medical procedures. Arthur and stitches anyone? it makes no sense for them to use condoms.

you can be creative, this is a magical world. spells that are like a tiny barrier, lubricant creams that are also against any STDs, a spell that gets rid of any potential baby after or before the deal... why... condoms? so cringey.

wizards just wouldn't use condoms. period. I don't care if JK stated that as a fact, if she did, it was just because she wanted younger fans to be careful or some other bullsh*t.


** Condoms have been around for thousands of years and used to be made out of things like leather or animal bladders/intestines. It's entirely plausible that wizards and witches use them - just not the ones we use today.

*** I was about to comment this, too.

Now imagine that because of the Statute of Secrecy the wizards didn't know about the latex condoms and were still using the ones made of animal intestines. Maybe there would be a discreet business specializing in their manufacture such as placing spells to make them more effective & do other stuff.

Would that even be a problem? I mean, the mean reasons why we switched from "animal intestines" to latex is because the raw materials were easier to get from an Industrial Production (that and maybe some increase in confort of use).

But wizards have a limited population that doesn't need any industry, not to mention they can just use "Magic" to multiply one condom until they have enough. Also, there is probably some spells to make said condoms more confortable, no matter in how it is made.

So, outside of the Muggle raised being embarassed and/or grossed out about it, is there any reason for wizards to not use the same condoms than the one used by Muggle before the Statute?

***** The out of story, real world context would be that condoms made from animal intestines or bladders were not "tight" enough in the sense that though they could block sperm, they still had these microscopic pores that allowed bacteria and viruses causing sexually transmitted diseases (STD) to pass through. The latex ones have tinier pores so when used correctly, they are a means of STD protection aside from birth control.

So I guess one scenario would be a Muggleborn or Muggle raised getting concerned about STDs.

I wonder how fanfic writers would address this? Saying that STDs don't affect wizards and witches or that the condoms are spelled to protect against STDs were the first two things that came to mind.

**** The potential for wizarding world Watsonian jokes in this is incredible. Like, if there's a variety of animals they make condoms out of, I bet there's a tonne of 'wandlore jokes' about what each type you favour says about you - "Only the most enduring of magicals choose Centaur skin - you can ride them like a stallion.". And all the really insecure guys boast about how they need Dragonscale so they don't wear the condom out, and so on.

Wdym? They steal Muggle shit whenever it's convenient for them (see Hogwarts Express, cameras, Knight Bus, Ministry cars, etc). I think condoms would qualify, if not the Muggle version then a magical one would surely exist.

** I disagree. The first mention of condoms in history was 1564. Roll into 16th century condoms were used to prevent stds like syphilis which was a BITCH back in the day. Unlike today with modern potions you died. ☠☠☠. Spermatozoa was discovered in the 17th century and THEN, get this, condoms were a thing for the wealthy and the upper middle class... the not so wealthy could thank Mr.Goodyear for vulcanised rubber in 1839. Look up condoms history... it's INSANE. Magicals would have condoms, they might have potions for stds, gay fiction has lube and stretching charms, but muggleborns would balk at the animal membrane the purebloods carried (rinse and reuse) and pass around the latex tinfoil packets and the purebloods would turn their nose up but secretly pay GALLEONS for a box that cost the muggleborn 5 pounds. I'd be rich! The Pen vs Quill argument would apply to the type of condom. Modern vs old fashioned but they'd have them. Ps: courtesy of my C-Dramas, there was tonics to abort babies. A potion would be easy to get but difficult to create since one wrong step you can turn barren or lose your magic.

I just had this funny idea that the Malfoys looked down on the Weasleys because the Malfoys thought that the Weasleys could not afford to buy condoms.

**** Lmao. I don't know... Arthur was pro-muggle. Now I'm picturing them having condoms but wearing them improperly, Molly hating them, or they were used for other stuff. Like holding knick knacks... can you picture Arthur proud of his workspace where he's tinkering with muggle stuff and there's condoms hanging from the wall that holds marbles and nails? Here's Hermione's dad standing bug eyed and quiet because Arthur is very proud because 'he figured it out', muggles were just using them wrong.

** To be fair, if magic can go wild in the throes of passion, short term things such as a barrier spell could be cancelled accidentally. I could quite easily believe that Molly is one of those witches, and it's why they have such a large family. So it could well be that condoms were taken up because of this fact.

But if you don't have that, then as you say it doesn't make sense why that would ever be an excuse. If for no other reason than you could just transfigure or conjure a condom if worst came to the worst.

***** Why not? There's a potion that makes a werewolf almost take at the full moon. There's a potion to regrow bones, and it apparently knows which bones are missing. There's potions with nearly every effect imaginable, so why couldn't there be an all-purpose sexual health potion that prevents pregnancies and STD's? It's even logical: the potion was invented to prevent STD's and couldn't tell the difference between those and pregnancy.

******* Magic in Harry Potter is ill-defined, by which I mean there's no actual mechanics to it (as opposed to Wheel of Time, Light ringer series, and Brandon Sanderson's books; all of which show exactly how their magic system works in detail). So there's the possibility that some magical illnesses are unpreventable. Maybe some are self-generated, where the illness just appears in the patient for no known reason. Maybe some illnesses are rare enough that it makes more sense to treat rather than cure. Maybe all of these are true or there's something completely different going on. Beyond that, we don't really have a great idea of how potions work and what effects they can and cannot have. All of that taken together means we can basically apply any logic we want to potions and magical contraception.

******** That is not a rebuttal, that's a I don't care because I can handwavium and it works because I said so.

If we already have some examples of magical diseases that they can't just magic away then the logical and rational theory is that there are more diseases than the few we see.

If you abandon logic and say handwavium then you're saying that those diseases only exist because someone else hasn't handwaved them away.

********* There is no logical or rational theory where magic is involved, though, because we don't know the rules. If I'm talking to a friend about Wheel of Time, we can discuss what channeling can do and what might be possible and who would be able to do it because we know the rules. If we're talking about Light ringer, we can do that even better because Brent Weeks helpfully provided a list of each luxin's characteristics. For Brandon Sanderson, each book has different types of magic, but it still all follows rules and we can follow a logical path to figure stuff out.

Harry Potter doesn't have that. How does a summoning spell work? We know that it apparently has enough intelligence to send the summoned item around things rather than through, given that neither the walls nor broom break when Harry summons his, but that's about it. What if they summon a wall? What if it's something that's held more securely than the twins' brooms? We don't know, because there's no rules. Moreover, we can't apply anything we k ow to other spells. Banishing does the opposite of summoning, but apparently it doesn't care about walls and goes in a straight line. What about Molly Weasley's sauce? Gamp's Law of whatever says she can't conjure food, but there it was. A basilisk's gaze kills, but we accept that a lens or reflection somehow reduces the magic enough that it only petrifies. What happens if someone uses a mirror to block the Killing Curse? Nothing, probably, but we just don't know.

So to say that anything is the logical and rational theory is impossible. You cannot have a logical and rational theory when there are no guidelines to follow to the conclusion. Your theory is as much handwavium as mine.

** I completely agree, except magic should make condoms amazing. Infallible spermicides. Amazing lubricants. Condoms that vibe. Condoms that can change shape during the act. Condoms coated in all sorts of crazy potions. Perhaps one that helps prevent premature ejaculation. Perhaps others that treat ED. This is just a taste of what should be possible if we were a little more creative.
