You all know what I mean. A Big Happy Weasley Family, Incubus, hell, even Night Moves would do it. I prefer a Hermione or Delacour focus, but any would be fine.

linkffn(11516452; 12092542)


** linkffn(For Love of Magic) by the lovely Noodlehammer, features a rune'd up Harry who gets it on with multiple ladies and will get it on with at least one more of them yet. I also recommend his Naruto series for more lovely sexiness.

Speaking of hammers, our own wordhammer's linkffn(Spiral Tangents) has all the steamy bits of Spiral Path, as well as the really bloody bits. So watch out for that.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rejected Path) features a very depressing Luna who kicks off Harry's descent into dark lordism and harems.

And you already know about Incubus.

And I just remembered a Fleur fic I'm sure you'll enjoy. Linkffn(Sticky Situations at Shell Cottage)

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Try out '[[http://Ficwad.com/Story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]]' by Vanir - Harry rubs elbows (and other parts) with magical creatures from Nordic myth. It's only fair- he's actually an alchemically-designed spawn of several powerful creatures, so god-like powers of sexual awesomeness shouldn't be surprising.
