I've read several one shots (should have bookmarked them when I got the chance..) about Dudley and Harry interacting after the war when their families have grown up a little and they were fantastic. Guess the bug really bit me after reading I read [[/u/AnneNeville]]'s [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8918215/1/The-Wonder-Years-The-Diary-of-Hal-Dursley][The Wonder Years]].

Any and all recommendations are welcome! :D Thank you in advance.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]] by paganaidd was a good, satisfying read. It starts with adult Harry Potter being asked to deliver a Hogwarts letter to a muggle-born child with the last name "Dursley," second bedroom on the left, 4 Privet Drive. I would read this one first, then read the other related stories by the same author.

** I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6519436/1/Criminality][Criminality]] by TeddyBear334

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486190/1/Fortunate-Son][Fortunate Son]] by CallMeCassandra

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4363256/1/Normal-to-be-a-freak][Normal to Be a Freak]] by Minnionette

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3469424/1/Chance-Meetings][Chance Meetings]] by Lowlands Girl

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3984345/1/Invitations][Invitations]] by little0bird, who has a few other fics that involve the Dursleys.

I second the recommendation of Dudley's Memories. The author has a sequel and another author has written a spin-off, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486190/1/Fortunate-Son][Fortunate Son]].

** How is this interesting? Not to be an asshole, but the Dursley part of the original HP books was always my least favorite part.

*** I agree that the parts with the Dursleys are the worst parts of the books. However, in the first book I thought Vernon, Petunia, Dudley were a GREAT satire on a certain lifestyle. When I reread the books, they had me laughing out loud.

Then they became tiresome.

And then, Dudley was attacked and apologized. We learned more in HBP about Petunia. And since then, I think there has been some opening for those two characters. They give some room for exploration--either in the future, or in Petunia's case, in her past.

A lot of fanfic can be "what makes (made) someone who s/he is?"

*** It was when I was reading the 7th book for the first time, the scene where Harry has to leave the Dursleys for good that where I started to wonder what would happen to the family when the war was won and how they would interact with Harry. Would they realize the magnitude of their actions towards Harry? What would Petunia do around Harry's kids? How would Dudley turn out? Would there be any magical Dursleys? Will Vernon finally get over himself (highly unlikely but I can dream)?

I think you aren't alone about it being the least favourite part of the series. I don't particularly like them either but I think that there is a lot of room for growth with that family :).
