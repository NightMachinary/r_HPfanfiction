Hey guys (and girls),

got another request:

I'd like to read about a Harry that's curious - unlike canon Harry, who treats getting to learn MAGIC (damned, I'd turn into Hermione right now if I could learn to impose my will on the universe by flicking a stick!) like a chore, something to avoid, no sense of wounder present what so ever (except in a few scenes, like say the wizard's tent at the start of GoF at the world cup), no interest in specific magics (what makes the Marrauder's Map work? How do brooms fly? etc. etc.), no drive to learn extra-curricular stuff (except when the dementors disturbed him playing quidditch and when the war was about to kick off...I mean even the brain-dead would brush up on their defense knowledge in that situation IMHO)...

Note:

I read almost everything, except slash (at least if it involves the main character - especially not Harry/Draco or HP/SS), so keep the recommendations comming :)

ps: Bonus points if there's a well writen romance in there (no whipped boy or girl...disagreements are normal, even in relationships - as are different hobbies etc.) and if Harry's more intelligent and driven and makes use of his fame and money (it was never stated how rich he was...and his account was called a trust-fund!) :) without being Super-Harry (so defeats - especially against adults are to be expected)...or if he is: He needs to have worked for it! A rivalry (with another intelligent student - like Hermione) would be nice, too (if it's not like with Draco Malfoy in canon...so no insults, no calling the other's parents names etc. - more an academic kind of rivalry!)

ps: Something like "Applied Cultural Anthropology" on FF.net (just with Harry instead of Hermione as the protagonist!)


** Linkffn(Worthy of Magic) has a fairly curious Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

*** Yeah... it's pretty much just a stinking great pile of money that is exactly as large as it needs to be for Harry to be comfortable, but not 'rich', because as we all know, rich people are snooty fucks like the Malfoys, and that wouldn't be very heroic after all. Not that Harry ever does anything with it either, mind, heroic or villainous. The least he could have done was (offer to) buy Ron a new wand in CoS, gods!

Anyway, the 'trust fund' thing is fanon, usually coming from fics that posit the existence of a 'Potter family vault', and often suggesting the existence of a 'house Potter'. Please excuse me, I must take a moment to retch. Either way, Harry usually ends up richer than Midas in those fics, conveniently ignoring the fact that his canonical vault has N-1 galleons inside, and is therefore sufficient until the freaking heat death of the universe. Or at least until the end of the plot :/

**** I totally get making him rich though. It's like a power thing. Malfoys have power over the Minister because they have tons of money. So to compete Harry must also have money. It's a quick and often lazy way to solve a problem.

That said it would be cool to see a fic where we have a savvy Harry go head to head with a decently powered villain (e.g. A Malfoy with money). "Who would win? A smart Harry or the status quo?"

**** Well said - but: Not every fiction involving noble houses (I mean as far as I remember at least house Black is supposed to be noble...or they fancy themselves to be nobility at least!) is bad...sure there's many that are (not questions asked), but condemning a fiction just because it uses a popular trope is not something I agree with (unless of course: It's a trope you absolutely hate and that even the best writer couldn't pull of in your opinion...something like Harry/Draco (for me: Can't be pulled off convincingly, sadly, as I've heard that there are many great fictions that are Harry/Draco))

***** Eh, Lord of House Potter is a trope I've seen badly often enough (and badly enough) that I've come to associate it with bad things. As in, its presence will worry me about the quality of the ensuing fic, because it rarely exists by itself. It's usually included as part of a quasi-self-insert power fantasy, in which giving Harry oodles of money/prestige is used as a shortcut to the position of independence as a child. Power fantasies bore the crap out of me, honestly. I wouldn't say I directly condemn every piece of fiction that uses these tropes, but their presence is, in my experience, strongly correlated to OOC, Gary Stu, bashfests. And I do hate that. It's /almost/ like I hate 'Lord Potter', but it's hate by association with previous bad experience. I've never seen this trope done in a way I didn't hate, but I'm open to the idea it could be good, or at the very least neutral. I'm just extremely sceptical of that possibility, because I've never seen one I liked yet. Extraordinary evidence and all that.

I wouldn't mind a heavily political fic involving 'Lord Harry of House Potter' if he was at least old enough to have hair on his balls by the time he started doing things. And if the person writing it was capable of producing political intrigue. Basically, the position where 'the aristocrats are a bunch of dicks' cannot be /suddenly/ fixed by 'let's make the protagonist part of the aristocracy'. And a lot of fics I've tried to read involving Lord Potter seem to imply that Harry is somehow better than those around him, by virtue of his standing, and that it's easy to change a world that does not want to be changed, so long as you have money and a title. Basically, he's a posterboy for the aristocracy itself, fighting down the 'bad aristocrats' with his incorruptible lordly blood and all. It's kind of gross, imo. If someone were to write one of these, I think they'd need to be both intelligent enough to make a good intrigue plot, the self-control not to use Harry as a Gary Stu author mouthpiece, and also good enough at writing to execute their plot in a believable way. Not exactly a perfect storm of conditions, but not one I've seen come together yet, sorry.

****** Well, I do like the occasional power fantasy - as long as the over all writing isn't bad...to each his own of course, can't make you like it an d I won't even try.

Still I'd recommend looking for political fics...there's good ones out there...sadly I don't remember the ones I've read - too long ago...sorry. Maybe put out a request?

** linkffn(What you leave behind) does not feature a deep understanding of magic but has indeed the search for the sense of wonder. Harry does not really explore purely magic but he does explore Hogwarts with its secrets, which of course are magical.

This might not be exactly what you are looking for, but should be close enough, and it is a really good fic.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** One of my favorite parts of linkffn(the best revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) and it's completed sequel is Harry's childlike curiosity at magic! It's got some neat wizard cultural stuff that all the first years get really excited about learning too. And Snape is really cool! And there is some nice romance in there as well.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

**** Yea Severitus is the correct term! I'm not usually a huge fan because it seems so unlikely with their canon characters but with Harry starting out so young and curious and not-famous in the fic, their mentor-student relationship happens organically and believably.

***** Yeah, it takes some work/fiddling but it can work (at least if there hasn't been a lot of hatred between Snape and Harry...meaning: After one year (or more) of having Snape as a teacher I don't think it would work, but from the start? (Snape sees "the cupboard under the stairs" and realises that Harry's no spoiled prince (NO PUN INTENDED!)? Sure, why not! I think Snape's able to realise that he'd make a better guardian than the Dursleys despite him being a jaded human being - but he'd at least not mistreat people on purpose or not feed them...or lock them up with a cat-flap to give them food!))
