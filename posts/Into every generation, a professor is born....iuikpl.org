The Great Hall was filled with the bustle of students as students took their seats. Harry's eyes scanned the staff table anxiously. He nodded back, smiling, as Hagrid beamed at him from over his tangled black beard. His eyes fell next on Professor Snape, who's gaze was fixed on the man sitting two seats to his left, his familiar expression of resentful contempt whenever he was faced with the new Defense professor. His eyes moved to the newcomer.

She was young, easily the youngest person at the staff table- she looked barely older than some of the seventh year students. She was quite pretty, but she seemed uneasy, almost awkward in her seat at the staff table. She sat straight in her seat, her pale face taut, expression slightly strained, and Harry noticed that her eyes were constantly moving, as though she was trying to watch everything at once. Her blond hair was tied back in a sensible bun. She wore a black jacket over a plain white sweater. She didn't look dangerous, but something made Harry think that she was tensed, ready to spring into action at a moment's notice.

As the last of the sorting concluded, Harry's attention returned to the Hall. The assembled students gradually fell silent, as Dumbledore rose to deliver the usual start of term address.

"Welcome, one and all, to another year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our excellent feast, I have a few announcements. First of all, I would like you all to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, who has traveled here all the way from America- Ms. Buffy Summers!"
