:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's about Harry finding out that Hermione and the Weasleys are stealing his money because Dumbledore gave them his Vault key. He goes to Gringotts, retracts the keys and makes new ones that only he has access to. They find out and confront him in the library, but Harry points out everything they did wrong while everyone is listening and Snape keeps hitting his throat with soothing charms. He then calls on magic and Fawkes to brand them. Hermione and Ginny get temporary ones that will fade if they change, but Ron gets an extra betrayal one that won't fade. In the end Ron and Ginny kind of learn their lesson but Hermione doesn't and she gets expelled.

** Why would you want to read this? This sounds like it has elementary level grammar and Harry hooks up with a rich Slytherin.
