I'm running out of fluff for my room com story. Its basically fluff with bits of "well what if this character had decided to do the rational thing instead of what they did in the book"...well, that and using Eric Sawachika as my basic for Daphne G.

My point, is that unless I want to start writing full blood quidditch sections, or something other than glorious glorious fluffy goodness, I need ideas. Halp


** It sounds like you are trying to pad out your story beyond what is needed. My suggestion is do the exact opposite.

Instead of worrying about adding more Quidditch or something else to offset the massive amounts of fluff you already have think about editing and reducing the fluff you already have to maintain the balance you are looking for. You will avoid unnecessary padding and hopefully identify and keep the best of fluff you have already included.

*** My issue is I wanted to /at least/ cover Harry's 1-7. With maybe 2 chapters after that

**** If you don't /need/ to cover it to tell your story then why would you?

** Maybe instead of Fluff for Fluff's Sake, you can consider another approach? Generally, multiple characters in a big story have arcs going on. You'll get a close focus on the protagonist, but through their perspective you'll learn what's going on with their friends/family/rivals too. And sometimes those arcs interact with the protagonist's arc too.

So if Fluff A is “these two characters are having a sweet rom com,” maybe Fluff B is, “these two buddies are trying to maintain a friendship despite pursuing the same romantic partner,” and Fluff C is, “so-and-so's sibling has their first crush!” Except the B and C plots have some bearing on A, too. Like how Hermione and Ron's drama over Crookshanks and Scabbers tied in to the main plot of PoA.
