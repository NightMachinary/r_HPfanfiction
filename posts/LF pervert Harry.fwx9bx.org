Harry is a teenage boy with an invisibility cloak...

Or

The Room of Requirement changes to whatever the user wishes. What about a one way view into the girls shower? Harry discovers this.


** Linkffn(Weeb)

Harry's goal in life is to build a harem. He's also really into monster girls, and is so defensive over it that he manages to beat Hermione in an argument over his fetish (mainly by claiming that you only see half-human hybrids, then accusing her of thinking Hagrid's parents didn't love each other).

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.

  What happens when Luna Lovegood hears about a most unusual magical creature? Lunar Harmony story, H/Hr/L. NOTE: This is TRUE version of a story that I was never able to finish originally. Think of this like a movie with alternate endings. The old, "alternate" version was published previously. Rated M for Mature.

** I remember a fic where Snape, during the Occlumency lessons, uncovers all of Harry's fantasies and Harry is terrified that he will tell on him. So he takes charges and tells all the girls he fantasized about what he did before Snape can. I don't recall the title, but it was funny as hell. I hope someone links it.
