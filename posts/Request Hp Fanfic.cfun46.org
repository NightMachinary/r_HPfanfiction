I was looking for some help concerning an old fanfic I read where sirius is involved with snape's werewolf sister and regulus is involved with Albus Dumbledore and Minerva Mcgonagall's daughter

Other rememberd details: Regulus is a Cat animagus

Abeforth Reveals Albus and Minerva marriage to harry

And Harry either improve wolfsbane or cures it and tests cure on remus and snape's sister

Albus and Minerva have a son

Thank you in advance any help is appreciated.


** "Sirius is involved with Snape's werewolf sister"

Everyday we stray further from God's light.
