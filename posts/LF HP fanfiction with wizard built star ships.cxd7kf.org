Just finished reading Darth Marrs HP Quadrilogy. There was this implied war between the Q and mage ships. Is there any fanfictions out there that have some sort of wizard built spacecraft with space battles? I've looked at quite a few star trek and star wars crossovers and found only 2 with mediocre space battles.

*** It's a wonderful fic, but be warned that D.S.S. Requirement doesn't actually have space /battles/, and the wizards are only beginning to build their own fleet by the ending.
