** Still working on my fifth fic in my female Harry series. Currently on chapter three, with some nice Millie backstory, but it's a little slower than usual while my attention is divided between two projects (I wrote a scene of something, just to get it out of my head, and now it's 9k with an outline. Oops.) I expect that project will be between 30-40k, so I should be able to knock it out in less than a month while simultaneously writing my female Harry fic.

Year three is still being posted, we just met Buckbeak.

Here's year one (also on ffn) if you're interested:

#+begin_quote
  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** I'm currently writing a story about Ron picking up TMR's diary, but Tom is sort of the typical teenage ass who goes about following Ron like a ghost (and Ron is the only one who can see him, which makes it all so much more annoying.)

Here's an excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  Ron paced back and forth in his bedroom, impatiently tapping his foot every so often.

  “Cease your pacing. I am already devising how to solve your particular problem.” Tom chastised, rolling his eyes.

  ”You can't even /hold/ the diary.” Ron retorted. In truth, Tom had been having a hard time picking up solid objects as of late.

  “Well, at least I‘m not a boy with lesser hold on his magic than a dead prefect.”

  Ron picked up his copy of Unfogging the Future and chucked it at the ghost's face. Tom promptly discorporated himself, turning the usual see-through grey.

  “Twit.”

  “I heard you. Would you prefer I stop working and let the diary drain you of your magic?”

  “If you would die, then yes.”

  Tom scratched neck leisurely, “I'm already dead.”

  “Oh, shut it.”

** Linkao3(30416121)

Linkffn(13847943)

My first Fic. Going strong with over 80k published and keeping a large buffer of about 200k in drafts. Publishing every Thursday and sometimes Sundays.

Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys and ends up on an island of magical creatures with an OC. Eventually people start to look for Harry. Next chapter will be right before Harry's return to England.

Writing tomorrow's chapter was a bit emotional and gave me one or two happy tears when I was writing it. I hope everyone enjoys it.

  Adaptation and survival. These have been the two primary consistencies in Harry's life. First, he had to survive the Dursleys, and then their abandonment. When he washes up on an island filled with magic and danger alongside a young girl; he must begin a new cycle of adaptation and survival. His past will eventually come looking for him, what challenges will he need to overcome?

** Still writing the next chapter of my crackfic.

Here's another excerpt:

“1-Ꝩ27! Go cut power to the city, take 1-Ꝩ99, 1-Ꝩ72, and 1-Ꝩ251 with you!” 1-Ꝩ1 hissed, the four guards in question nodded and ran off down a side street.

Seventeen minutes later, the group reached the port, and abruptly every light in the city went out. 1-Ꝩ1pulled out a pair of infrared goggles, he motioned for 1-Ꝩ66 to take out one of the watchmen. 1-Ꝩ66 shouldered his rifle and took out a silenced gauss pistol; he rushed unseen through the darkness, the watchman was caught unaware, a muffled bang and the man dropped dead.

“Move!” 1-Ꝩ1 hissed, 1-Ꝩ66 casually shot the lock and pulled the gate open.

“Alright, spread out, take out any watchmen and disable comms on those cargo ships!” The guards spread out, “Gimme the mic 1-Ꝩ225!”

1-Ꝩ225 flipped a couple switches on his backpack radio, dials and LEDs lit up.

“Jumper to Skipper, Jumper to Skipper, do you read me, Skipper?”

“Skipper here; what is your status, Jumper?”

“We have arrived at the target location; you should be able to make your landings within the next hour.”

“We'll be there, Jumper.”

#+begin_quote
  It has been seventeen years since Britain's Second Wizarding War, and most wizards are happy to act as though it was just one (more) unfortune hiccup in the Magical World's otherwise illustrious history. It was just a few dark wizards, after all. Once they were either killed or put in Azkaban indefinitely, the entire affair had been over and done with!Magical Beings in the UK who are not wizards tend to feel differently about that situation.As unrest is brewing and a Goblin rebellion is on the horizon, a Canadian correspondent and the Daily Prophet's first goblin journalist investigate the foundations on which British Wizarding Society has been built. What do the Goblins want? Where did house elves come from? And why don't they want to be freed?

** *Harry Potter and the Lost Child - Chapter 14 is out!*

*Excerpt*

‘Oh, what are they up to now...' muttered Molly as she grabbed the handle and swung the door open.

‘...I nicked it when he wasn't in the room. He nearly caught me. Pretty cool eh -- '

‘What exactly did you nick James?' asked Molly in a threatening tone.

The trio jumped and turned around at her remark. James had been holding an old-looking piece of parchment. It was completely blank and unimpressive.

‘What the -- '

‘It's just a cool piece of parchment Mol. Nothing special. Here, have a look,' James handed the parchment to his cousin.

‘Right, you're telling me you bothered stealing some old blank piece of parchment and that it was so impressive, so awe-inspiring, that you all decided to sit down and admire it on the floor right here -- James how stupid do you think I am?' said Molly venomously as she grabbed the paper out of James' hand.

James gulped nervously.

Molly pointed her wand at the parchment and uttered ‘Aparecium.'

As though an invisible hand was writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.

‘Mr Moony extends his greetings to Miss Molly Weasley and congratulates her on becoming a Prefect despite her... interesting... choice of hairstyle.'

Molly stared, dumbfounded, at the message. James, Fred, and Ton were visibly fighting the urge to laugh out loud. The parchment was not done yet, however. Another writing appeared beneath the original message.

‘Mr Prongs is astonished that Molly had not yet been swarmed by a pack of in-heat Cornish pixies. He would also like to compliment the previous holder of this item for his exquisite name.'

And another...

‘Mr Padfoot would like to inquire for the particular motive behind purple being the colour of choice for the impressive streak in Molly's hair.'

Finally...

‘Mr Wormtail wishes Molly a good term at Hogwarts and would like to kindly ask that she let go of this item as her Prefect-ness might be contagious.'

*Check it out:*

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a fix of the (in my opinion) less than great Cursed Child. I guess I just wanted to give these characters the sequel they deserve. This is a second/next generation canon-compliant (though not with CC obviously) continuation of the series I love so much.

You can find it here:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224]]

and here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

This story is meant to provide an alternative for people who would like to know ‘what happened after the story' and would rather not bother with the hot mess that is CC (again my opinion).

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon-compliant (except for CC of course), the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Reviews/kudos/comments/suggestions/insults are always welcome!

New chapter every other week!

  (OLD TITLE - PLAYING FAMILY - PLEASE READ AUTHOR NOTES ON CHAPTER 1)With the end of the Great Wizarding War and Voldemort vanquished, the wizarding world is able to return to normalcy. Harry Potter had his dream come true by working as an Auror, but not everything is as good as it seems. Haunted by nightmares and stuck in life while his friends move on, Harry has a hard time looking up. At the same time, Draco Malfoy faces the consequences of being on the wrong side of the war, and with his father arrested, his mother in shambles and working at a dead end job, the only relief he finds for his pain is drinking. But after a strange encounter, Harry and Draco will work together against an anti-muggleborn hate group, racing against time to stop the prejudice and hatred from spreading once again, facing old-time enemies, protecting their loved ones, all while balancing their own traumas and fears - and learning to work together.

** I'm currently working on an outline for a Harry Potter crossover with The Godfather called "The Family Peverell", focusing on Harry being reared under Michael in his later years to become a mafioso, while also plotting against the current Ministry and his rival, Vincent Corleone.

Other than that, I'm working on a Timelord!Potter story and only need to finish two chapters before I'm finished with the first story in the series.
