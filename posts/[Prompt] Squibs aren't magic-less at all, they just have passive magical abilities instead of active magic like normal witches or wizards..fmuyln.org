So Squibs are in fact born with passive magic abilities (probably just one specific passive magical ability) that they have no conscious control over or general awareness of.

For example, a squib school teacher might not notice that the pencils she uses never dulls or pens run out of ink and markers never dry out while she is using them but they don't magically sharpen or refill themselves either.

To some absurdly specific passive ability that the squib might never discover such as a squib being able to grow perfect tomatoes but only if planted in a square clay pot painted neon yellow with a very specific shade of purple polka dots.

Since this magical abilities are so underpowered and low key the squib doesn't need to have a magical core for it to function since it can run just fine off of whatever magic remains in the squibs blood.

For a possible canon example our dear Hogwarts janitor's passive ability might be cleaning related, like he can clean messes or maybe just magical messes better than a typical cleaning spell.

Can I have a one-shot or two exploring this?


** One of the most popular passives is a curse, actually. It makes it so you're allergic to cats and also very alluring to cats.

*** Interesting about cat allure. After all the only two Squibs we meet are Arabella Figg, The Cat Lady, and Argus Filch, who has Mrs. Norris. And Filch obviously has some sort of connection with Mrs. Norris.

** One passive ability all squibs seem to have is the ability to see hidden magical things like the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
