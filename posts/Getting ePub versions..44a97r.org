** lol love the bot. Has made this time without internet manageable. Thank you and these are some of the best I have every read. Teacherbev's story is actually the first fanfic I ever read. And I downloaded it off the internet thinking I was getting an advanced release of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix. What a surprise when I read this and several months later that's not what is released but in the end I liked bev's version better than J.K. Rowling's

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** No problem, but in the future, please PM the bot with your requests (it's actually why I implemented that!).

Also, downloads are currently having issues because of a bug in the downloader (not the bot itself); full stories are not really being downloaded properly.

Anyways, I'll remove this submission for now, to reduce spam and encourage PMs instead of threads like this. No hard feelings!
