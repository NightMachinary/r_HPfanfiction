** I've tried Wattpad but for the life of me, I couldn't figure out a way to search for stories. Seemed like it just presented everything randomly. And almost every fic I came across was CharacterXReader. Which to me is weird, I like 1st or 3rd person stories, not 2nd. I used to be a devout FFN user and hated Ao3 when it came out because at the time, no matter how I filtered, I'd get HarrypotterXOneDirection crossovers or Teen Wolf. Now their sorting has gotten more advanced and there are more stories posted on Ao3 (not to mention most of my favorite authors moved over to it), so I definitely prefer Ao3 now.

Also, you can use the AO3 saved filters user script to save a set of filters you check frequently (also mentioned on that FAQ page)

**** I can vouch for this. I went on ao3 earlier to look for a lucius/snape/narcissa triad fic or a gay lucius fic and all I could find were [snape/narcissa] [lucius/narcissa] [snape/lucius] in the same story, and draco being the gay one and his parents going along with it. Despite the fact that I only have a registered account for ffn, I do like ao3 a lot, maybe even more than ffn in some areas. Wattpad has always been a put-off for me due to story formatting, lots of fics are y/n x character, and maybe because the writers have almost always struck me as the gacha profile picture type.

** AO3, no contest. Fics suffer a bit from overtagging, but overall it's easier to use and much more pleasant to read fics on. I like the design a lot better, the commenting system is vastly superior, I like the "kudos" idea, I like how easy it is to download fics for offline reading... and pervy girl that I am, I like the smut. ^{_^}

FFN is perhaps a litte easier to search through, and of course it has a potentially larger audience, but... if I have the opinion to choose between reading a fic on FFN or AO3, I'll choose AO3 any day.

Wattpad just doesn't measure up to either of the other two.

** Well, obviously Wattpad is out for me because this is the first time I ever heard of it. And seeing as apparently 0% of the fics recced here link to that site I would say I don't need to know about it? Just an assumption.

And for FFN vs AO3, it depends under what criteria you look at them. Old classics? FFN of course. Variety in more adult themes? AO3. Custom search? AO3. Could go on, but overall I simply read on the website where the fic I want to read is posted :D If it is on both and has no scenes cut out in the FFN version, I read there. Simply out of habit from the last 15 years.

** Never visited Wattpad before.

Ao3 has more options than FFN does, for better or for worse. I feel as though if they just put a limit on the amount of tags for different sections( characters, genre, characteristics of story) then I'd definitely prefer it over FFN. Times when I filter that I want to read a story with Ron in it, i don't want him mentioned only 50 times in a 300k+ story.

I do appreciate the bashing, smut, a/b/o, mpeg, harem, and all the other story killing tags that I can just filter out right away.

To answer the question, FFN for now. It has better stories for me at the moment and is easier to navigate. But if Ao3 can clean up the overtagging, i can see it taking the place as my favorite.

** AO3. It's tagging system makes it the best for finding specific fics and its filtering options makes it so you can exclude anything that you dislike. Like, if I don't want to see something like Harry shipped with an adult, I can just exclude those those tags. The closest option to that on FFN is excluding the whole romance genre. AO3 is just easier to navigate. Plus, it's a bit harder to make an account on AO3 than places like FFN so authors that take the time to register tend to also put more time into things like grammar and editing. Wattpad is just...no. It's great when you're a kid but I've found it unbearable as an adult.
