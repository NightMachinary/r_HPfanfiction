*** Yep. It's also a lot of fun. Tailed off some in the sequel, but the author was making the jump to his own original fiction (which is quite good, btw, at least the D-List Supervillain series is) at the time.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** Literally like the entire if not main focus of this fic is curse breaking. Hermione learns how to become a nearly undetectable thief from Mundungus Fletcher, and the majority of the heists resolve around ward breaking.
