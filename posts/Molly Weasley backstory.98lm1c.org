Anyone know of any fic that explores Molly Weasley's family, childhood, etc? Is there a fic that explains where her clock came from? Thanks in advance!


** I'd love to see one. Especially if it showed a whole heap of cooking charms, and how, when overpowered and aimed at humans, how deadly they are. Kinda like how Shade Umbras used a cooking charm on death eaters in 4th year.

*** Yes!! I think I'm going to have to just break down and write this myself.
