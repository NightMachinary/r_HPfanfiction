** Eh. I've seen that name before and some pretty close ones.. considering [[http://www.kanjijapanese.com/en/dictionary-japanese-english/mahou][Mahou]] translates to magic, and [[http://www.kanjijapanese.com/en/dictionary-japanese-english/tokoro][Tokoro]] translates to something like "place".

** Mahoutokoro and Uagadou were both briefly mentioned in Pottermore articles. A student from Uagadou competed in a Potions competition in Wonderbook, and I think Mahoutokoro also got another mention from either Fantastic Beasts or QTTA. Probs just my memory playing tricks on me, though.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouagadougou][Ouagadougou]] is the actual capital of Burkina Faso.

**** Yep. These school names aren't the most creative (or sensible)... But hey: Word of God is Word of God. :P

** I think the earliest reference to Mahoutokoro was in the Wand woods article on Pottermore, which was posted back in 2011.
