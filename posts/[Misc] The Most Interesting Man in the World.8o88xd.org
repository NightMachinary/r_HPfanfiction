So yesterday I was thinking about how some characters were given the shaft (either in the books, movies, or fanfiction), in this case Charlie Weasley, and I came up with this idea. What if Charlie Weasley was the guy from the Dos Equis commercial? If you don't know what that is:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN-k5B551Hk]]

So I thought it would be funny to make it broader: make up your own commercial about one of the less important characters in canon.

Here, I'll get the ball rolling:

"He gave his father 'the talk'."

"Dragons are afraid of him."

"He can speak Romanian...in English."

"He once left his wand at home during a duel...to even the odds."

"He is the most interesting man in the world."

(From Charlie) "I don't often drink whiskey, but when I do, I prefer firewhiskey."

The funnier, the better.

Edit: My favorite so far is my jokes about Harry. If you understand all of them, you win ALL the awards.

Edit 2: Check the Daphne one, I put a lot of effort into that.

Edit 3: There is now a Master of Death Harry and a Harry Potter Part 2. Also, my best was probably Luna.


** Albus Dumbledore:

"He once got in a staring contest with his reflection, and after 3 days he won."

"He won the lifetime achievement award, twice."

"If you got sent to his office, you would list it on your resume."

"If the Minister of Magic knocks, and he is busy, the Minister waits."

He is the most interesting man in the world.

(From Dumbledore) I don't always eat sweets, but when I do, I prefer lemon drops.

** Okay people, I'm back, and its time for round three (plays mortal kombat theme in background):

Nymphadora Tonks:

"She was sorted into Hufflepuff, but people still like her."

"She was a role model for klutzes everywhere."

"If shes tracking you, you will know."

"She got pregnant after only a month of marraige, and yet no once asked the obvious question."

"Dying your hair is okay because of her."

She is the most interesting woman in the world.

(From Tonks) I don't often date, but when I do, I prefer if they play hard to get.

"When a dragon roars in the woods, he hears it."

"When he gets in a fight, you'll lucky if he uses his wand."

"He was convicted of murder, and all they did was expel him from school." (Seriously, they didn't even kick him OUT of the school, he stayed there!).

He is the most interesting man in the world.

(From Hagrid) I don't often do tasks for Proffesor Dumbledore, but when I do, I shouldn't have mentioned them.
