So after getting the premise of Batman No Mans Land, I'm looking for fics where the WE gets hit with some disaster natural or not and the society is essentially crumbling.

Would also appreciate if it includes the other Wizarding nations essentially abandoning Britain sorts like in Wish Carefully and forbids travel in and out.


** Try Ambient, in which magic is being sucked away after the final battle. I don't find it to be an easy read, but it is an interesting one.

  The British magical community is on the verge of collapse. Two factions at war for what's left of society, Hermione's fled the country, Ron's losing himself, Tonks is dying, Luna's been murdered & Harry's living alone in Gringotts. A Harry Potter Mystery.
