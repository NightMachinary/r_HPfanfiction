Post-war fight for equality*

I'm looking for a fic where everything isn't just dandy after Voldemort is defeated. Many less radical blood-purists opposed Voldemort's senseless murder. After the war, they still hold positions of power, wealth and influence, and problems don't just magically vanish.

I want a fic where people actually have to work to close the gap between purebloods and muggleborn. It isn't all smooth sailing. Not everyone is on automatically board. Not all muggleborn integration ideas automatically end up being huge success. The opposition doesn't consist of easily humiliated dunderheads, but of competent people who, at least from their point of view, have reasons for their beliefs, and even raise legitimate issues at times.

linkffn(Democracy by starfox5) would be a good match - it isn't about integrating muggleborns, but about political reform (and doesn't tick all boxes I listed above) - but fits the spirit of the request, and is a great fic overall.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

** Are you familiar with linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)? Less political reform, more "offing Voldemort didn't work, the system that spawned him and his Death Eaters is mostly the same, time for a more direct approach".

Also, it's not post-war, but some of the themes you're talking about become important in the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, where Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war. Lots of characters are alive who weren't in canon, Harry was raised by both parents and the Marauders, but she's legally barred from Hogwarts, and there are worse restrictions coming. Riddle isn't trying to come back to life each year, he's trying to discredit Dumbledore in order to gain political dominance to push through more blood-supremacy legislation. And, as it turns out, he's actually trying to save their society in his own twisted bigoted way.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
