See title. I'm also happy with fics with 'Harry raised by X race' under similar conditions.

By 'no secret centaur magic' I mean 'no amazing super-empowering or horcrux removing or right-of-conquesting whatever' (but early animagus transformation is alright, I guess), by 'no spartan-way stuff' I mean 'no super-military martial-arts 'showing-weakness-not-allowed' stuff', and by 'no bash-cliches', I mean 'Dumbledore/Weasleys aren't stealing from the Potter vaults'.

Also, knowing the classical reputation of centaurs, no smut please.

~looks the subject up~

Except for Chiron and Pholus and Asbolus, and the centaurides (female centaurs which are rarely mentioned), and taking into account ancient Grecian views on rape, and considering the most famous incident involving centaurs was the centauromachy at Pirithous/Hippodamia's wedding...it might be more accurate to say that centaurs can't hold their liquor.

**** Why does everyone assume that the centaurs forced themselves on Umbridge? One Cracked article?

Here's an idea, maybe the centaurs consider themselves above someone like Umbridge.

She calls them beasts, but she's so ugly and repulsive that she ought to be classified as a beast herself. Raping her would be bestiality.

So, what should the centaurs do instead? The same thing you do with any other misbehaving (female dog), you train her to behave.

In this case using a leash and a rolled up copy of the Quibbler.

~imagines Dumbledore entering the centaur village later in the book to find Umbridge being swatted on the nose with a newspaper every time she says something impolite~

***** People were assuming it since the day the book came out, due to the mythical reputation of centaurs. All that Cracked article did was scoop up some theories that were already out there and stuff them together in an article. It's just the most popular explanation to link to because it's easier than finding an old message chain you remember somewhere on the yahoo group HPfGU back in 2003.

***** Do note that I never said they did anything to her. Just that they got a female (because she is female, and the centaurs did get their hands on her) and that there was no smut.

Whether or not any particular thing was done to her, from carnal activities to torture to sitting her on a log and telling her how much she sucks for two hours, it's something anyone can judge for themselves.

** I'm interested on whether anyone has any recs for this request. Usually when I find "Harry was raised by X race" stories it's done specifically so he can learn their super secret magical abilities and then parade into Hogwarts and tell everyone how inferior they are (particularly the Slytherins. Gotta put those Slytherins in their place, you know.)

Good luck on your quest!

Hey, I just had a silly idea!

What if a goblin-raised Harry had the amazing incredible super-duper power of ~dramatic drum roll~ .../chartered accountancy?/

Follow the adventures of Harry Potter, certified public accountant!

Gasp as the priceless Philosopher's Stone is disposed of after centuries of depreciation!

Laugh as Harry uses the Diary as a ledger to the consternation of Tom Riddle!

Go 'wowsers' at the income tax assessment on the 1000 galleon prize of the Triwizard Tournament!

Smile as Harry audits the holdings of Lucius Malfoy and proves the presence of bribery and funding of Voldemort!

Be astonished when Harry trades his life in exchange for protection of the denizens of Hogwarts, at full market value!

And cheer as the Boy-Who-Balanced-The-Books diversifies his portfolio for an additional 1% return per annum!

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
