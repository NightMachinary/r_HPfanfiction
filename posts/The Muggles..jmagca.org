A muggle boy gets his girlfriend blown up in front of him because some wizards decided on having a fight in the middle of the street. He narrowly gets out of having his memories erased, some other muggles who know about wizards contact him and they infiltrate the magical world to get revenge.

Extra points for lots of brutal gory deaths.


** This prompt actually reminds me of the series The Boys' premice.
