I know I've read a few a couple years ago but I haven't seen one in a long time. A lot of the ones I found were abandoned really early in the fic as well. Are there any decently written fics where James and Lily come back to life at some point. Complete would be nice but as long as its long enough to at least go on for a little while I'll be happy. I don't know why, I've just suddenly gotten a craving to read about Harry whose spent years as an orphan getting what he's wanted most and regaining his parents. If it's only one parent thats fine too but I'd prefer both. Let me know if you can help me out. Thanks.


** Well there is linkffn(The Last Casualties) which is 380K words.

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

*** And its absolute garbage. Like seriously can you not allow any form of conflict? It's almost on the level of Harry Crow, but at least that's somewhat well written from a technical standpoint. Stories without meaningful conflict are /boring./

**** Well I personally enjoyed but I am curious what do you mean the story lacks meaningful conflict?

** Lily comes back to life in this one - it's pretty good, but diverges after 6th year a lot since it was written before the last book came out.

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH
