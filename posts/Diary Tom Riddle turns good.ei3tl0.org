As per title I'm curious whether there are any stories where the Tom Riddle in the diary becomes good, maybe something like that having absorbed a bit of some character's life force (the most probable is Ginny but other spins are game too)he has also internalized the concept and the understanding of love (not that he would openly admit it, at least not until like the 80% of the story?) I'm especially curious in two possible outcomes: A) he obtains a new body but not at expense of someone else's life, maybe he absorbed smaller/smallish portions of life force from multiple people B) he derails from his own initial plan of using all his interlocutor's life force to gain a new body because he became attached to them and doesn't want to hurt them anymore


** Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? linkao3(15675297) hasn't been updated for a long time, but even unfinished it a really good example of this.

Spoonful of Sugar linkao3(16594244) has this version of the diary, although he is not a main character.

I haven't read it yet, but I've heard The Impostor Complex linkffn(13275002) recommended a few times for this kind of thing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader][Book Learning]] has the diary essentially merge into one person with Ginny.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow.

  Harry has been raised from the time he was five with full knowledge of what he was, a Horcrux, and how someday he would need to die to avenge his parents. Thus, when he finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he recognizes it. Horcrux speaks to Horcrux, a game of persuasion and manipulation.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche. Polish translation

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** It is not the center of the story, but "A Black Comedy" by nonjon has this as a kind of twist later, and towards the end Harry interacts with diary Tom.

Usual nonjon disclaimer: nonjon writes great stories with nice characterization, plot and themes - but if you don't like his humor, you won't enjoy his stories. If you do enjoy it, you'll love them.
