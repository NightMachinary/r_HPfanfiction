Anyone know what happened with the story HP & The Primes of Merlin? I used to love that story and had it saved on FF.net, but I can't find it anymore.


** It's in the ff2ebook archive:

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=primes+of+merlin]]

I just skimmed through it, but my guess it was removed for plagiarism? Large sections seem to be taken wholesale from the books. If that's the case then I have to agree. I always respected FF.net stance on not allowing plagiarism. Everyone who does that harms the community and fandom.

*** Can you d/l the whole archive? I see an option to d/l the 2016 one, but can you get the more recent one?
