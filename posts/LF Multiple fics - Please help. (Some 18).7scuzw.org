The first one was a fic featuring Harry\Hermione(Luna I think). They spent a lot of time in the FF doing rituals. They turned Trelawney in to a super devoted (to Harry) dryad, with her own tree. I remember there was something to do with a lot of magical beasts, and like a jeweled turtle shell or something. Trees were important in the story, and there was something else to do with fairies and a fairy queen I think.

The others are more adult in content, the first of those was a story about Harry being recruited into an organization to "hunt" sex slaves. Tonks, Fluer, and McGonagall were all instructors there to "train" Harry. The second of these was a fic where Harry had a power to help females get through their monthlies, and the cramping with his magic in a very intimate massage I believe. Of course it turns in to a fic where all the females he helps immediately want to jump him. The last was a story that I really cant remember to much about, but Harry has an agreement with the sorting hat to help him with knowledge and whatnot, and the hat turns into a sweat band i think. That's all I can remember about the last one.

Thank you for any assistance you can give.


** The first one is partially kissed hero, by perfect lionheart. Who still hasn't finished it.

** Im pretty sure the last one is “Harry Potter and the Bloodline of Lust” on ficwad.

Harry borrows the hat to help him learn about creating secret passages and help suduce hermoine with all its hidden knowledge. He never gets around to the first part.
