I'm looking for something decently sized (50,000+ words) but without major character deaths or huge fallouts.. slice of life type stuff. Don't mind anything except gender swapped characters. Thanks!

  After a normal Saturday breakfast at The Burrow, Hermione discovers that a marriage law is about to be enacted. Unless she finds a suitor over the weekend, she will be paired by the Ministry of Magic, possibly with an ex-Death Eater. Ginny decides the solution is to offer Hermione her choice of Weasley brother. But George is determined to share his thoughts before Hermione makes her decision...

** Obligatory Harry Is A Dragon recommendation: linkffn(13230340)

Pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. Harry being a dragon, along with amped-up competence from the adults, pretty much takes all the danger out of his life and that of others.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should.In other words, this story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
