** It has very little effect generally. Its more a symptom of the type of fic it is present in than a problem itself. I find that fics with Hogwarts starting at 14 often do so so they can have explicit age of majority sex at year 4/5.

Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on personal tastes.

*** That's true. Im just wondering that in numerous fanfics, Harry shows a maturity level well beyond an 11 year old boy should show. Making Political decisions and acting like a adult makes more sense if he is atleast 14 year old and start job at 21, not at 17. Then, many review start badgering the author for turning Harry into a mini politician.

I'm just asking that by making harry a mini politician of sorts, would benefit the story or cause reviewers to moan that I'm not letting Harry be a normal 11 year old kid if I start Hogwarts at 11.

(As if abuse was not enough for him to mature up quickly)

** I'd rather start a story late myself, with a 5th/sixth year Harry. The dynamics of first year are different and an older Harry ruins that.

*** The thing is that i want to build Harry from basic level, rather than using a 5th/6th year Harry. So 6th/6th year Harry won't work for Me.
