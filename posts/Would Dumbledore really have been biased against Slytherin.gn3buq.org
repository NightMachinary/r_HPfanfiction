So I've read two Slytherin-centric stories, as you do, in which one or multiple Slytherin students join Harry and co. in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet and Dumbledore was either reluctant to give a fair amount of points to the Slytherins or gave them during the welcoming feast but less for the same number of people.

But I can't stop myself from thinking, despite really liking those stories, that this is not Dumbledore. In the original books, Dumbledore had no reason to give points to Slytherin because none were with Harry to try and stop Voldemort from getting the Stone - and there's also Rowling's input of wanting Gryffindor to win the House Cup. Also, keep in mind, in those two stories the main character is a Muggle-born, not someone you'd think Dumbledore would be biased against because of their houses.

I myself am writing a Slytherin-centric fanfic, and although I haven't completely figured out the numbers or if they will even do the gauntlet in its entirety because my characters have common sense and it's not because we were lucky enough to know how to get past the Cerberus and save you and Weasley from Devil's Snare that we should continue to advance in the deathtrap set by the teachers, Potter! But do you think it would be out of character of Dumbledore to give points fairly to Slytherin in the case of Slytherins helping Harry?

Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House), linkffn(New Blood).


** I don't know if he's deliberately biased against Slytherin, but he does seem to have a Gryffindor bias, or at least a Harry bias. So do the other professors, like letting Harry join the Quidditch team while Draco has to wait until next year. Harry can have his own broom as a First Year while no one else can.

Giving points to Harry's friends for their efforts? Sure! Giving them a total that just puts them past Slytherin? Sounds suspicious. And waiting until the feast, letting Slytherin think they won, and snatching victory away at the last second? Uncool.

Dumbledore is probably pleased at handing Harry and Gryffindor a nice victory, and didn't take Slytherin's feelings into account. We don't see much of Dumbledore giving house points, but we do see him letting Harry off the hook numerous times. This can certainly stick in the craw of Slytherin House, where the only one who overtly favors them is Snape.

We don't see him punishing anyone that I can recall. There's no reason to think he's harsher on Slytherins than he is on Harry

** Well, I would argue that giving Gryffindor just enough points to win the House Cup is unfair - entirely leaving aside the question of for or against whom this is biased. Keep in mind the students worked hard all year for those points. And then along comes the Headmaster and randomly inverts the order. What even is the point of collecting the points over the year, then? Just have only points distributed at the leaving feast. Should Snape, Flitwick and Sprout have stood up, too, and distributed some more points?

As for what kind of bias this is, I'd say it is primarily a bias /in favour/ of Harry. Just like Dumbledore says, he cared too much. The /effect/, however, clearly must be that Slytherin feels cheated, and rightly so. And Dumbledore should have known this.

This is the biggest issue. You can construct more strenuous links, e.g. when the Troll supposedly is in the dungeons, and Dumbledore sends the Slytherins ... to the dungeons. Personally, I prefer to think of Canon!Dumbledore as not (intentionally) biased against Slytherin. He is biased in favour of Harry, and maybe Gryffindor. And, in FF, it can also be interesting as showing him just not understanding Slytherin, if you are giving (or expanding) each House its distinct culture.

As for your question, my favourite answer is that there aren't any points to give out, because no self-respecting Slytherin student that isn't a seventh year (maybe) would try to get past a Cerberus for any reason. What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger, it has the potential to /kill you/. But that's a cop-out, so - my best guess is, he would reward Slytherin students, albeit perhaps not with as absurdly many points as happened in Canon.

Honestly, if you and two of your friends prevent the single most dangerous and evil wizard in history from potentially getting his hands on an artifact that would bring him back to full power while you and said friends are 11 and 12 years old, you deserve to get all those goddamn House points and a bigass trophy.

Neville's points were kinda bullshit though.

**** Well, I suppose -- it depends on what you see in their actions, and what kind of behaviour you want to encourage or discourage.

I feel bad for quasi-channelling Snape, but Harry & co's actions were /extremely reckless and ill-thought out/. You obviously can only stretch this so far, because PS especially is more of a fairytale than anything, to which IRL standards don't fully apply, but without his mother's protection -- which Harry didn't know about -- he would be dead and Voldemort would have the stone *that he hadn't had before Harry arrived*. If, as a Headmaster, you want to make a point that such behaviour is irresponsibly reckless and not permitted, you ain't handing out points but detentions, and I don't think anyone would have grounds to complain.

The idea that Dumbledore rewards Harry already implicitly contains a value judgement -- bravery, self-sacrifice, etc. are to be seen as positive. Which is a fair position, but in that case, we /very much/ are back with the bias: Dumbledore, as a Gryffindor himself, considers them such, and this /hugely/ clashes with Slytherin, which instead would champion caution and self-preservation -- Dumbledore hands Harry points for essentialy embodying the values of his House, and I wonder whether he would hand Slytherin similar kinds of points for embodying /their/ ideal.

I don't think one set of values is better than the other, but it's helpful to take this step back and realise that's what's going on here, if one (or, presumably, Dumbledore) would argue those actions deserve a big reward.

*** Concerning your last paragraph, it's more that Neville goes telling the MC and his friends about Ron and Harry having gone to the forbidden corridor. Since they are a numerous group, they send some to alert the teachers and MC goes to save Harry and Ron because they might be children, help is always better and there is a real risk of them dying and Neville told them about the Cerberus and how to pass it. It's not like they'll go after whoever tries to steal the stone or anything, they'll patiently wait for the teachers to get them under the trapdoor.

**** I have no intention to tell you how to write your story, so tell me if I'm offending :)

That said, if you do want my opinion -- self-preservation remains a thing. Can the MC know that there won't be even worse things behind a Cerberus? And if they already operate under the premise of there being a /risk of them dying/, then I'd think the risk for the MC isn't any less. Therefore, if for plot reasons I really needed the MC in there, I would consider constructing additional incentives, so that the risk/reward ratio improves. And what would be best, would be if it could be turned from an open-ended into a calculated risk; but I suppose that is complicated, because for that, the nature of the traps and the situation at the stone would have to be known in advance.

All of that is why I concluded I wouldn't do the PS thing in a Slytherin story of my own (unless I wanted them to steal the stone themselves), - but, obviously, YMMV.

***** I completely agree with you. I think it's a bit caused by adrenaline/panic that someone could /die/ and a bit of arrogance in their own abilities versus Harry and Ron's. There is also the possibility of the two boys not having gotten past Fluffy yet so better to intercept them with teachers on the way than wait for the teachers. It's a bit flawed, but I think the plot really needs the mc to have a bit of adventure.

** From the first paragraph, I would agree that it is off-character. Favouritsm for Harry (maybe Ron) potentially as he had a fair amount of positive contact with parents and I like to think even Dumbledore is fallible to those associative feelings but that's the only stretch I can think of.

I could wax lyrically about what I think his actions towards Slytherins would be like but in just talking about points (and very publically given points) then I think he would be fair.

** He does have a bias, the favouritism he shows towards Gryffindor is a sign of that. But that doesn't mean he's biased /against/ Slytherin.

I think Dumbledore cares about every student in the school, regardless of the House. It's just that Slytherins don't hold him in high record and don't reach out to him, so he knows them less. He still got angry when Marietta Edgecombe was manhandled by Unbridge, so he definitely doesn't ignore students that he himself doesn't like.

In summary, it's just that he likes Gryffindor more, rather than disliking Slytherin.

** I would agree that Dumbledore does not treat Slytherin house well, with the first year points fiasco being a strong example of this. To me, that's one of many things he doesn't do well in his role as Headmaster. Having a house system is okay but Dumbledore never seemed to try and put any practical measures in place to try and deal with the more toxic elements of house rivalry. A great pity he never gave up his other jobs and focused full time on making Hogwarts the best school it could be,

** It depends on the Dumbledore you're writing and the situation of the story. Who're the Slytherins in question? Would it be out of place for Dumbles not to give Draco points for helping Harry? Depends on several other factors, what's Dumbles motivation in the story? Even if Dumbles does give them points would he give them the same amount of points? Less points? "50 pts for Neville for sticking up to your friends 2 pts for Draco for solving a witty chess match." Dumbledore would absolutely not want Harry to be friends with Draco or Theodore. To what extent would he try and break that friendship, I could see Dumbledore being petty and not giving as many points. He would give them a couple just so he doesn't have to hear shit from the board of governors (ie Lucius)

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Dumbledore is bias because he is a gryffindore himself. Add to that the he was the former Head of the house. He is not the ionly profesor that is seemingly bias to his house, dont forget Snape. We can really see it in his difficult classes. Slytherin are the ones who takes majority in his class. And his blatant grades to Hermione (the only class that she received EXcede Expectations all are O's). Slughorn even stated it when he return as the potions master at hogwarts.

Dumbledor and Snape are not the only ones who favor their house. Hagrid is also, I would say too "pro gryffindor" "anti Slytherin: (maybe because of Voldemorts doing in his school days). The low key one is also Mcgonagall with her favoritism with Hermione. My theory with this is because the two are alike, they both saw their academics highly.

** But I am also suspisious with the headmaster's blatant favoritism with Harry / Golden trio / Gryffindors. I read this obe fanfic, i forgot what this name, where the slytherin students felt betrayed by Snape's double crossing of Voldemort. Its not because they support him but its becauese instead of them the slytherins Snape helped and saved their rival the griffindores. (Backstory/// After their defeat from gryffibdores in the housecup(harry's 1st yr)after Dumbledore making feast in the great hall for his fav house Snape when they return in their dungeon gave them a feast and said "from the time Harry Potter entered Hogwarts Slytherin will be bound to lose, no matter how hard you all work and study, Gryffindor in destined to be first place" somewhere along those lines. The students saw snape as their pillar in Slytherin hating hogwarts but when the last war happened they felt betrayed. And the aftermath results in Slytherin being painted more badly than it ever was.

Imo, Harry would be just be a nobody as neville was if his parents werent killed. He became a powerful because of Voldermorts soul inside him. Neville would be the one would be called a the Boy Who Lived because of the tragedy that happened on his parents.

** I remember Dumbledore in the books just being bias in general. Like he lets the twins prank all the time, and if I remember right he let the marauders prank all the time as well. I mean there is pranking and there is vandalism, I do believe blowing up toilets or removing them would result in a strong discipline to curb such behaver but that never happens as far as we know. He allowed Harry to join quidditch in his first year which apparently hasn't been done for like a century before that. He allowed Hermione to have a time turner. The final example of his bias is with Malfoy and letting him run around doing death eater stuff all of HBP.

While most people just draw the idea Dumbledore is biased to Gryffindor due to the many examples one can pull from the books. But I think he is just a biased individual who likes to play people like chess all in the name of the 'greater good' to make himself feel better.

As for your case, I am sure Dumbledore would be biased towards Harry favor. And would make sense for him to treat Harry and his friends as biased as he treats those he favors normally. The only time I see this subverted is when Harry's personality was like Voldemort's or Dumbledore was just straight-up evil and manipulative and didn't like Harry straying from the script.

*** Except that Tom Riddle, Bartemius Crouch Jr and Percy Weasley would also have had time-turner since they all had twelve O.W.L.s and two of those were under Dumbledore's tutelage as Headmaster and the other one was while his time as Deputy-Headmaster, which I think would have allowed him any say in the subject if the Headteacher and his deputy had any say in this. It seems that time-turners are given out if the student's grades and the Head of House allow it and then the Ministry gives it. The student must be gifted, but that's just it, these three students were as gifted if not more than Hermione and two of those were in Slytherin (at least we think Crouch was, but I think its kind of implied because he's a Death Eater that he's Slytherin).

I also don't think its really fair to consider the twins and the Marauders being pranksters evidence of Dumbledore being biased. Almost every good character we hear about is either Gryffindor, has an unknown house or in some very rare case is explicitly from another house. So, of course, we wouldn't hear about non-Gryffindor pranksters.

This is actually very open to speculation. Perhaps the credits where different? JKR said that "Hermione gave back the only time-turner to ever enter Hogwarts" Does that mean Dumbledore always had one for a long time and let random students use it? Or does it mean he only got one for Hermione? Hermione's accomplishments seem less impressive if she had to use a time turner and no one else did...

**** Fair point the O.W.L.S. that could be the cause for sure. I yeah I agree with Crouch, most Death Eaters are implied to be Slytherin because its the 'evil' house.

In the cause of pranksters, I am not arguing Dumbledore is biased to only Gryffindor pranksters. I am just saying he is biased to people he likes or feels deserves his attention. Maybe a better example would be Remus Lupin with Dumbledore allowing a werewolf into school as a student and a teacher later on. It could be seen as Dumbledore being benevolent but due to their being no mention of other werewolves in Harry's year or amongst the teaching staff could also be seen as bias.

** Have been? At the end of the first year he destroyed any chance of Slytherin students joining his little chicken club - he stripped them of the house cup without any concern, turning them entirely against Harry. He basically signaled he was not their headmaster at all - much like Trump likes to do shit to signal he's only president for his favorites. Dumbledore ran the school like a fiefdom; he kept his door shut to everyone but his favorites, and they were always Gryffs.

There was no reason to give points to Gryffindor. No reason to award just enough points to really, really stick it to 1/4th of the school. His grandstanding cost the school dearly in good will towards the Light, and directly violated everything the Hat was trying to encourage.

Now there's a fic I haven't read - the Hat relieving Dumbledore for being self-involved obsessive who used the school for his own purposes.
