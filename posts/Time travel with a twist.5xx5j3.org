I just read a fic where Lily and Snape find themselves in the past, and both of them came from different time periods. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/]])

I'm looking for something similar but with Harry going back in time and finding someone else with him. Preferably Lily, Snape or James for a change.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

** linkffn(Ananke by Eunike) is pretty good.

It's Lily travelling to the future in the time of the Second War and then going back to her own time and making different decisions. It's SS/LE.
