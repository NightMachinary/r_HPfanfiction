I just finished reading an amazing Rose x Scorpius fanfic, but sadly it is incomplete and the author is still updating every few months. Does anyone have any good suggestions of a long COMPLETE Rose x Scorpius fanfic?


** I really like linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) ... it is long, all seven years, but I still consider it one of the best next-generation stories at all. It is light on adventure, heavy on character development and it has a lot of other subplots. Also, Scorpius turns out to be eventually a musician, so there are some songs (from TRL) attached to it (don't worry, it is not a song fic).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
