At the time where ron sacrifice himself to allow harry and hermione to go on? If ron survives, it makes harry change his resolve to save ron instead of going after the stone thief?

Well... To be honest, I just want to have more exploration of the character given an event that traumatic. It is like, those who go to third floor corridor will die a gruesome death, and harry and hermione experience firsthand of ron's death.

Or if ron survives, voldemort resurrection occurs and ron is blaming themselves to save him?

*** I don't think the charges would stick. Can't blame a school if a student climbs up to the top and jumps.
