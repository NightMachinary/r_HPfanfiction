:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't seem to find the fic but either the title or the description said something along the lines of Dumbledore proving why he was the only one Voldemort ever feared. I don't remember much of the fic but at one point Dumbledore traps Voldemort in a block of stone. I'm not sure but I think the fic was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] if that helps.


** The only thing I can think of is linkffn(12848494).

But I'm not sure that's it...

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.
