** I don't think I'd recommend the fic as a whole, but there's a couple of scenes early on in /Backwards With Purpose,/ after Harry and Ron and Ginny travel back in time to prevent the Wizarding War and save lost loved ones.

They meet Luna and Harry remembers what happened to her. The Death Eaters had cursed Luna and when they apparated away from Malfoy Manor, Luna began bleeding out from a hundred small cuts.

Despite their best efforts Luna dies while Hermione begs her to hold on. What really got me was Hermione's plea that when Luna gets better, they can go hunting for Crumple-Horned Snoracks.

Dang. Just writing that made me tear up.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
