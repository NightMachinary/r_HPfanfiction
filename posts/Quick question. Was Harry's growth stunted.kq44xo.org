I've read a few fics where harry is described as frail looking, petite, and/or short. Like 5ft 2in to 6in kind of short. And it bothers me.


** No, it wasn't. Harry is only petite in books 1-3; short and thin/small are the words JKR uses. He's simply thin in GoF. In OotP he's as tall as 16 yr old James was, who was described as tall in DH. Mrs. Weasley remarks that he had grown and looked as if he'd been hit with a stretching jinx in HBP.

There is a comment in DH, though, that he is was "now over 6ft" or something like that when takes on Runcorn's appearance. So he's canonically above average height, 5'9, and under 6'1. But if height is your thing you can probably get away with 6'1, 6'2.

Edit: I had the men shorter than average

** I think the idea that Harry is short mostly comes from the movies, since Daniel Radcliffe is 5'5".

In the books, Harry's exact height is never given, but there's no indication that he's particularly short. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/452di8/how_tall_are_harry_and_the_other_characters][Here's a post with a good summary of evidence from the books]]. Basically, he's shorter than Ron (but that's not saying much, since Ron is quite tall), taller than Hermione and Ginny, and about the same height as Draco. That all sounds like he's more or less average height.

But I think the most important point is this quote from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either," Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.
#+end_quote

So Harry was something of a late bloomer. He was probably about five feet tall at fifteen, but somewhere around 5'9" at sixteen.

** No. It's a common fanon interpretation of the abusive Dursley's trope, assuming that he would malnourished and had stunted growth as a result -- but Deathly Hallows puts that theory firmly to rest.

#+begin_quote
  *James was exactly the same height as Harry*. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley's.
#+end_quote

If he was the exact same height as James, suffice to say that his height probably wasn't stunted.

** I mean... it would make a hell of a lot more sense than to have him be average height & build. Look at his history; he barely got enough to eat in order to survive, he didn't get much time to build his muscles up (particularly, children run around, and jump etc, it's quite heavily implied he didn't).

Also, diet wise, not exactly healthy stuff, either. Not to mention potential airway problems due to his dusty 'bedroom'. Probably not enough sunlight either.

Quite likely his posture could be hunched over in an attempt to both not be seen & ducking to avoid the beatings. It would make him seem even shorter.

So in short, I don't remember if it's cannon or not, but it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Harry's growth would indeed be stunted. Physically. Don't get me started on emotionally.

*** But i thought he was pretty active as a child bcos of the Harry Hunting thing and all the chores he was given. The diet is pretty bad though. But i cant really recall if starvation was canon or not.

And isn't magic a bit of a health boost? That's why magicals are longer lived than muggles?

I'm pretty tall at 6ft2in that's why this bothers me so much. LoL. It's very hard to imagine being short.

**** he was canonically locked in his cupboard and later room for long periods of time and wasn't fed a healthy amount (not Starved and probably not malnourished but he definitely would be underweight) so its reasonable he could be frail and pale

regarding height, even if his growth wasn't stunted he isn't described as tall, sirius is tall (and taller than james), and he is described as shorter than dumbledore who is Very Tall, so harry might just be average height but combining this with movie harry being short makes fanon harry short

This is a misunderstanding of what the books mean when they describe Harry as locked in his cupboard. We know, for example, that Harry continued to attend school while "locked in the cupboard". So he's not literally in there 24/7 as often depicted by abuseporn fanfic. It's more like a grounding situation.

(Until CoS when he is literally locked up).

****** I was more referring to his 'frailness' as in he would look quite sickly considering the lack of sunlight, they probably wouldn't allow harry to roam free unless dudley was with him so i believe he might have spent more time indoors to avoid dudley, and even just nights in a cupboard would effect him, what with people stomping above where he sleeps and dust spiders etc, so he probably is sore and sleep deprived etc

******* Harry was given chores throughout the house and garden. Throughout the summer between his first and second year, he's working in the garden and it seems a normal chore for him, so it seems unlikely that he didn't get much sunlight (or activity, what with the "Harry Hunting" as mentioned above).

******** He could be pale for other reasons like vitamin deficiency. He also barely gets any food which makes him look sickly and frail

** Personaly I always imagne Harry as *Very Short* because not only was mentally and most likely physicaly abused most of his child hood but there are all of the problems listed in other comments (slouch to help protect vital organs during beatings and from living in a cubord, dusty and stale air, lack of hygene...) but it makes sence that he was starved;\\
seing as the Durslys use food to show affection,\\
1. Dudly who is the faverout and most loved is given so much food that he is morbidly obese by the age of 11\\
2. Vernon who is the second most valued member of the household (as the breadwinner in a family that acts like its from the 1950s) gets less food than Dudly (based on how Dudly is said to be getting close to overtaking Vernon in weight before he starts boxing) but still /Far/ to much for the adverage male.

1. Petunia is seen showing self hjatred many times throghout the books and fandom in general and compensation for it by using others opinion to validadte her, so it makes sence that she would be the skelital figure discribed in the books

2. Harry as the most hated member would likely be starved just to reinforce how different he is from them and to subconciously lead him to belive that he isn't worth basic human requirements like food.

I also have a headcannon that Lily was quite short and that Harry inherrited her shortness that was only pronounced more by the starvation, and to point out the issue with JK Rowlings statement not only is Harry shown to be starved in the series (I cant remember which book but I think it was 5th or 2nd where Harry was fed 1 tin of soup a day through a catflap) but the Dursleys are seen starving Dudly when trying to diet him in Harrys third year(?) when we see him getting a /single/ grapefruit slice for breakfeast and resorting to stealing his dads -again- /single/ grapefruit slice and if they would do it to their prize and joy, why not the boy that they hate and were forced to take in.

Besides, JK is known to make several contradicting statements cannon like how Hermione is always shown with white skin on book covers, how she hired a white actress and how in the chamber of secerets it says -and i quote- "her normaly white skin" during the failed polyjuice chapter and yet she is now saying that she never suggested that Hermione was white and is in fact black (don't get me wrong, I support Hermione being black; the HP univerce could use more diverse characters, it just annoyed me that she is claiming to never have made Hermione white).\\
Another example is the /Entirety/ of the Cursed Chlld which contradicts the ending of the 3rd book which then dominoes and changes everything if it were to be cannon (like Sirius being dead at the end of the Prizoner of Azkaban and who knows what changes that cause). So overall, I think we can dismiss JK's word on this expecialy as she once mentioned wanting to show Harry being physicaly abused but couldnt put it in the final edition (this fact could be wrong, I heard this in the A/N of a fanfic so take it with a grane of salt).

In conclusion, Harry was naturaly short and then abused and starved and is therefore, tiney.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
