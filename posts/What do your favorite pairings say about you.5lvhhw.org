I know for a fact that at least 97.46% of you have searched for fics with two characters being prominent in a story together - maybe not necessarily for romance, but because the way they mesh resonates with you or something. I don't know. I can't speak for you.

The friendships and relationships we value in fiction, especially Harry Potter as there are /so many options/, say a lot about who we are as people, writers, consumers, what have you. Do you know why you value Wolfstar or HPGW or SSMM and read/write them religiously? It's a really interesting exercise in self-reflection.

Personally, I like to explore more sordid affairs in literature of any kind because my life is /really dull/ and exploring the misery and difficulties of my characters makes for some fine times. This sometimes results in a TRHP binge. Then /again/, though, I also like to read into stuff like Snape and Luna interacting (platonically, ahem) just because they are so completely different and that is endearing as heck.

I just think it's neat to think about! I'd love to hear your thoughts.

** I mostly stick to canon pairings or pairings of people that had ambiguous/unknown love lives. So I guess I'm... boring? I don't know. There was so little romance in the series that I think there's enough to explore within canon or at least the murky waters of canon. There are very few pairings I'm actively against but there are plenty (wolfstar, harmony...) where I find the common tropes and characterisations very annoying.

*** I am not huge on romantic relationships either, really, and canon-compliancy does not a dull person make. :o There is so much to work with in the canon framework when it comes to platonic relationships - Harry and Remus' development, for one. Third year and seventh year show marked changes in that relationship. On a smaller scale, Fleur and Molly before and after Bill's deformity.

People who think canon is boring must have forgotten the magic of their first, second, and fifth HP read-throughs.

That said, I've never found a Harry/Hermione ship that wasn't extremely flawed (other than maybe Stages of Hope but there wasn't any real romance there), on the other hand I have found "decently" well done and satisfying Harry/Tonks and Harry/Fleur.

** Harry/Daphne or post war Harry/Gabrielle.

I think it has do to more than anything with exploring the world itself. I also happen to be a competitive person with a dry sense of humour so I can understand Snakes better than gryffs or badgers. What do we know about Daphne Greengrass? Not much, pure-blood Slytherin. Depending on what you count as canon or if like me you now pick and choose a little bit her sister marries Malloy. We know almost nothing about the wizarding world because Harry is based at Hogwarts and is friends with a muggleborn and someone considered a blood traitor. What we don't know is how popular this belief is, what really is a blood traitor, what effects if any gas it had on the Weasley. Basically Harry/Daphne gives so much scope for exploring the world while also allowing me to engage with the characters better. What does that say about me, I guess that I'm curious.

Harry/Gabi. I guess I just love stories where Harry takes a holiday to get away from everything. Again Gabi being French allows easy exploration of the Harry Potter world. Maybe that's too easy, maybe that ayes I'm lazy?

That said, I think I enjoyed that story to point, but iirc it introduced unnecessary drama (in the form of making the girls have to compete for a TA position?) and left a bad taste in my mouth; it had a happy ending, but not as happy as should have been for me to fully enjoy it, especially for fluff.

As for Fleur/Hermione, I can't say I've read that many I can honestly say I liked either, but then that's true for every type of stories. I did like linkffn(9658318), but likely because it pushed many of my buttons and unfortunately it's neither complete nor particularly long.

** My favorite pairing is definitely Remus/Sirius at hogwarts age. Idk if it is just how they are generally written or if it is their personalities from canon, but their friendship dynamic is really interesting to me. I usually like best fics that stick to canon, so there is a tragedy element to the story that is so heartbreaking but also great. IDK maybe I am just a sucker for a tragic love story.

Because of how much I love wolfstar, you would think I would also like harmony, but really I just cannot imagine Harry and Hermione as anything besides friends (or maybe one of them having an unrequited crush on the other, but I've not read a fic like that).

My other favorite pairing is Drarry and even though I know that 99% of Drarry is fraught with cliches, bad writing and OOC rehabilitation of Draco, there are SO MANY Drarry stories that the 1% of Drarrys that are good (imo) is still hundreds if not thousands of fics. My favorites are usually EWE canon-compliant fics where Draco and Harry get together as adults. And the tension of their past is so great to drive the story.

** Harry/Ginny because I wanted more romance specifically involving those two in the series. Also because I prefer canon pairings, post war, since I prefer not messing with the original work.

What does it say about me? I think the pairing, with Harry being the protagonist and the one we naturally are supposed to imagine we are in a sense, is related to my own experiences with relationships growing up. I remember when Half-Blood Prince came out, there was this girl I was really into but she had a boyfriend and I didn't think she would be into me anyway. If we were to get together, it would have been the happiest I'd ever be in life. Unfortunately, it never did happen. When I read HBP or any Harry/Ginny fic, it takes me back to that moment and I get to relive it through Harry's eyes. Years later I'd meet my wife and actually become supremely happy, just like Harry was when he first dated Ginny. Reading these stories also reminds me how lucky I am now.

** Harry/Hermione, Mostly because of how well they seemed to work in the movies and because I never for the life of me could understand why Harry would be with Ginny without having a major oedipus complex.

Harry/Luna, Once again because of the movie portrayal of Luna. I've always been the type to love quirky people and Evanna Lynch just played Luna so well. Definitely one of my favorite headcanons.

Harry/Tonks, because I've read a few fanfics over the years that just do the characterization so well and I absolutely love it.

** I searched for Hermione and Luna because they are so different, and I wanted to see them interact more than they do in the books. Sadly most writers stick Harry in between, and can't write Luna and their dynamic is lost. I don't normally read for pairings though.

Rather than pairings I search for, the ones I avoid probably say more about me, such as Voldemort/anyone, death eater/kid from Hogwarts, Snape/Hermione. Sometimes the last one is okay if there is an AU that provides a reasonable explanation(usually time travel, which is barely adequate), but otherwise I don't bother reading.

** Never understood the point of indy Harry relying on people, isn't that the opposite point? I feel that if everyone stopped worrying about his love-life at 11, there would be a general quality increase.

That said, my favorite pairings to read are Harry/Fluer (only when they don't attempt to do the heavy af accent), and Harry/Hermione. Most other pairings feel lazy to me, like Harry/Daphne, which for some reason makes Daphne a mary-sue like character, everytime. There are only a handful of fics that do haphne right.

** If a fic has shipping, I'm more interested to read it if it has rare pairs, OCs, or crossover characters paired with canon characters.

As for what all that says about me? That I'm interested in the paths not taken or in strange possibilities ... and that I really would like to see more damn gen or non-shipping centered fics out in the wild.

** If I lower myself to searching by pairing, it tells me that I think Emma Watson is hot. Then again, I've known that for a long time.
