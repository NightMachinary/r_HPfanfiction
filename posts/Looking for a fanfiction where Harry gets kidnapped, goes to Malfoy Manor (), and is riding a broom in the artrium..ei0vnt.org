What I remember is that Harry gets kidnapped, but I have no idea when the book is supposedly taking place. He steals a broom outside of a room that had mirrors for walls on the inside and tries to escape. I think Harry puts Lucius Malfoy in a body bind while he tortured Harry, and someone else had gone to summon Voldemort. So then he found the broom, got on it, and was flying throughout Malfoy Manor. I remember he specifically casts a disillusionment charm on himself to where he blends in with the shadows and Voldemort and Co. shoot spells at him while he flies through the rafters in the atrium. Then he dives behind a statue (I think it was a gargoyle) on a little ledge-corner area in the rafters and hides there. He's loosing blood fast and all, so he has to leave quickly. I believe he flies to the library and flies through the glass and escapes that way. There was definitely a scene with him jumping out of the windows in the library. Then I think he falls asleep on his broom and he's lost while he's trying to make it back to London and to Sirius.

I could be wrong, but that's all that I remember. It will most likely be on Fanfiction.net. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Thanks much (that sentence is supposed to be that way).

Edit: I know it's random, but I think Harry also spit blood in Lucius Malfoy's eye and he was complaining about it. I think Dumbledore was the one to teach Harry the Disillusionment Charm that be used.


** Might be Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

*** Thanks. It does sound awfully familiar. I must have read it before I had an official account on there. Do you know about what chapter the things I was talking about might have been happening?
