This is a bit of a twist on dumbledore binding Harry's magic and him being recognized as of age because of his entertainment in the tournament. Basically dumbldore bound some of Harry's magic and the horcrux in an attempt to weaken the horcrux enough so that by the time Harry turns 17 the horcrux is weakened enough that when the binding is released Harry can fight it off. But the goblets magic causes the binding to be released early and Harry has to fight the horcrux early without being warned about it. He does manage to beat it but there are consequences.
