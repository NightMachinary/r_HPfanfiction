Anyone have any recommendations for a HP fanfiction in which Harry (or an oc for that matter) has a loving family which he swears to protect (Maybe lily and James are alive and Harry just finds that out?) and is long? If possible, I would like pairings. Thank you.

Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity
