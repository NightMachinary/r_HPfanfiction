Any suggestions for Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fics where James and Lily don't, like, abandon their other son bc he isn't famous? I've wanted to try reading one for a long time but I can never get very far through the tag to find one I want to try, bc every time I see a fic to that tune I just get depressed.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) this is my favorite WBWL fic.

linkao3(Wait, What? by esama) this one is short and fun.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Prince of Slytherin is my current favourite story by far. There is abandonment but it's not because he isn't famous, and the reason behind James's actions towards Harry is logically explained as the story goes on. There's a lot to keep track of but the world building in it is superb, and Peter Pettigrew - someone I have never been interested in - is a wonderfully ramped up character here. Hope you like it!

***** I love the fic bc it utilizes Peter in a way no other fic, that I've found, has done.

** linkffn(13361948)

In this one Harry is raised by James, whom is a decent parent to both children. Harry is older than his brother, and remembers what happened, but doesn't say anything for some reason.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.
