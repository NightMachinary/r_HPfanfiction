** It started in the Forbidden Forest.\\
On their monthly forays with Remus, the Marauders encountered the forest's wolf pack more than once. Intelligent enough to understand humans and dogs, they taught Sirius Black how to see the world through canine eyes.\\
 \\
Then it continued in Hogsmeade.\\
Many purebloods kept dogs as a status symbol, other witches and wizards kept them for company in the dark days of Voldemort. From these canines, Sirius learned the common Lycantongue, the magical language that was as to canines as Parseltongue was to snakes.\\
 \\
It traveled throughout Britain.\\
With Lycantongue, Padfoot tapped into a wellspring of wisdom. The numerous dogs around the country, muggle and magical, could tell of disturbances to their day, their keen noses covert spies that could tell Sirius the movements of the Death Eaters no matter where they went.\\
 \\
It ended in London.\\
Pettigrew betrayed the Potters, canines bearing witness to his presence alongside Voldemort in Godric's Hollow. With a description of a rat and a rat-like man, Sirius circled Britain, until he came to a dog that spotted Peter.\\
 \\
Sirius Black was wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban, but he had left an impression on the dogs of Britain. Word spread far and wide of his capture, though no dog could report his location.\\
But, the news found its way into crup ears, magical dogs who understood human affairs, and they spread new word; Padfoot has been taken away. A pup of his pack survived the dark wizard. Find him and protect him.

*** The dogs of Private Drive hear the word: a pup is missing, find and protect.

It takes a while for them to connect the missing pup to the human child but a collie finally pieces it together.

The pup is found.

Harry grows up accompanied by at least one dog at all times; Dudley and his little gang dares not touch him. The bad dogs get scared off.

The dogs help as much as they can, the smarter ones, the strays, even stealing food for the sickly pup under their care.

Harry leaves Private Drive for Hogwarts and another Bark goes up: the pup is on the move, to some place called Hogwarts. Find and protect.

In the Forbidden Forest a beast slumbers; six eyes wake and six ears prick up: a pup is coming to Hogwarts, find and protect.

The creature called "Fluffy" lumbers to their paws and responds, baying with three throats and three voices that boom, echoing: Get of Cerberus, Hogwarts. Pup is found and protected.

***** For you? Sure.

Fluffy, as they were known, was rather smart for a dog, perhaps not border collie or poodle smart but there was something to be said about how three heads were better than one.

They knew that they could not be guarding the pup themselves, humans were rather timid creatures after all, however, they had a plan.

Once done reporting in that they, the Get of Cerberus themselves, were at the place called Hogwarts and had the pup safely in paw, they called out again.

The dog known as Fang was sleeping in front of the fireplace when the great voices woke him up.

Padfoot's pup at Hogwarts. Find and protect.

Fang vaguely remembered Padfoot, the strange not-dog who was a dog too, though he had been just a pup himself last time they had met.

Lazily, Fang got up, taking the time to stretch even as he listened. He did not like the strange multi-headed dog calling to him, Fang after all was a coward and could admit it, but one did not ignore the requests of the Get of Cerberus.

"Goin' out, boy?" Hagrid asked as Fang made his way to the door and left.

A decent ways away from the hut, Fang stopped, sat down, and responded: Fang, reporting in. What's going on?

Padfoot's pup at Hogwarts. Pack betrayed. Padfoot taken. Find and protect. Skinny, pale, male human pup, messy head-fur, wears circles on his face. Smells of our kind.

Fang cocked his head, suddenly vaguely remembering the human child Hagrid brought home a long time ago. It went away again soon after and Hagrid had been sad. A some time ago, however, Hagrid had been happy, making a treat that was 'fer little Harry'.

Fang responded: Will find pup and protect.

Little did they know someone else was listening in.

******* Right /cracks knuckles/

Mrs. Norris heard the Bark and her ears turned and twisted as she took it in. Dogs often forgot that cats too could understand their little system.

A human kit needed protection? The kit of the not-dog she had never liked all that much? The kit was coming to Hogwarts? His colony had been betrayed?

Mrs. Norris decided to keep an eye on things.

Weeks later, she had found the kit and was dismayed; he was sickly, skinny, and skittish like one of the strays that were kicked often.

Eavesdropping and questioning other cats, she learned the kit's history and was horrified.

This would not do. Mrs. Norris may have not particularly cared for the human kits that lived in her home, because they were loud and smelly and often mean, but even she was worried about this particular kit.

She made a decision; her servant was rather busy so she slunk out easily.

She knew the castle better than anyone else, save perhaps the elves, and so knew which twisting ways she needed to find who she was looking for.

In a little cranny, barely big enough to fit Mrs. Norris herself, she found Agnes.

‚ÄúMrs. Norris!‚Äù the little mouse squeaked, having been cleaning her little nest.

‚ÄúAgnes,‚Äù Mrs. Norris greeted, ‚ÄúI need you to send a message. A human child is in danger. The dogs are doing their best, but I do believe they need relief.‚Äù

Agnes blinked but then nodded grimly, quickly scurrying to where she kept her stockpile of parchment pieces and almost empty ink pots.

Dipping a toe into the ink, Agnes quickly wrote out what Mrs. Norris could tell her. Orphaned boy, Harry, abused, family betrayed, guardian gone. Wizard, Hogwarts, Scotland. Dogs on case. Norris requesting back up.

Agnes rolled up her missive, grabbed a bit of twine, and headed up to the Owlery.

‚ÄúRichard! Richard!‚Äù she hopped around, waving her arms at the non-descript Barn Owl.

‚ÄúAgnes?‚Äù he swooped down, ‚ÄúWhatever is the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúBusiness, I'm afraid,‚Äù Agnes replied shortly, scurrying forward to attach the missive to the owl's leg, ‚ÄúTo the station in London, if you'd please.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the owlets in danger, then?‚Äù Richard asked, voice grave.

‚ÄúYes. The poor boy needs help.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù with that, Richard took wing.

Within hours he was arriving in London, circling then landing in the ledges of Parliament.

‚ÄúRichard?‚Äù the attendant came up.

‚ÄúNews from Hogwarts, Jacob,‚Äù Richard held out the leg with the missive.

The mouse, Jacob, untied it, unrolled it, and read it quickly, growing serious, ‚ÄúWe'll send it on.‚Äù

Jacob turned and ran, into the building and down into his station, rousing his team.

It was easier now, than it had once been, they had computers, the humans, and those could send messages within seconds.

Jacob and his crew found an unused computer and began transmitting, jumping on keys and pushing around the mouse.

From there it was a direct shot to New York City, instead of it being a relay.

The attendant there took the message and raised the alarm, recalling all agents available.

The RAS was on the case.
