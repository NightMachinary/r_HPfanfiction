I'm looking for a story where Harry gets abused much more than in Canon and despises Dumbledore/OrSomeoneElse of it when s/he learns of their part. I'm not asking precisely for a HP/TMR or HP/LV but I wouldn't mind it. Any bitter and angst fem!harry stories that are dark is welcome.

--------------

I've read (or am reading) the following stories and this is what I think of them. Please look at the titles before recommending me a story. *Make sure you read the first paragraph before posting.*

--------------

*Princess of the Blacks* by Silently Watches, is a story that I quite enjoyed. It matches what I want, but I've read it and am up to date with the sequels. [Up to Date]

*Rumor Has It* by Parker K. Harvelle, was pretty good. I found the ending to be rushed but it seems like it's dead, so we won't know what's going to happen. [Read]

*Black Sky* by Umei no Mai, a great story that I still reading. Not exactly what I'm asking for, but is pretty close I guess. The only reason I'm mentioning this is because...I know someone else might. [Reading]

*Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus* by The Carnivorous Muffin, one of the most interesting stories so far I'm currently reading. Kind of not exactly with I want, it's borderline crack if I had to be blunt. It's funny, etc, but not as dark later in in the chapters as I read. The author skims over very important parts of the story, etc, kind of annoying tbh. Overall a good story, don't let my words deter you if you plan to read it. [Reading]

*The Lady of Slytherin-Dark Beginnings* by Nemesis13, is an okay story but with the characters acting like teenagers, quick to grudge, quick to assume, it feels off. Way off. An okay story but definitely in the back burner for more desperate times to finish off. [Haitus]

*Unbecoming* by Turnpike, not what I expected. It's alright but not what I was looking for. I'm not against LV capturing HP but still... not in this type of manner. [Stopped]

*Moratorium* by Darkpetal16, is a great story. Wished the beginning was a bit more in depth but to each their own. [Reading]

*Knock 'em Dead* by Tsume Yuki, is another story that I glanced at but with the lack of content, was devoured instantly. [Read]

--------------

None of the following stories contain a fem!Harry that is bitter:

*The Pureblood Pretense* by murkybluematter. I dislike gender bashing. In any form.

*Phantasy* by Tsume Yuki, a time traveling story? Dear god. Kill me.

*A Long Journey Home* by Rakeesh, a story that I wouldn't mind to read, even if it is a 'time traveling story'. The only reason this one story gets a pass is because it's not going back to Hogwarts or such. /This is legit time traveling./

*Equal and Opposite* by Amerision, really? I don't know if I have to even explain this one or not. I'm not looking for a denied of lust harry, I'm looking for a bitter story where harry gets abused and then later on gets vengeance/revenge.

--------------

Generally, I'm looking for something similar to *Princess of the Blacks* and *Moratorium*.

*Make sure you read the first paragraph before posting.*


** Really? I mean... this isn't just... and you've never /heard/ of...?

Huh.

**** Not dark at all? Fem!harry gets charmed/confounded into blowing Dean Thomas, holds onto his sperm in her mouth, and then uses it to create some sort of magical lizard thing later on. Not to mention how the whole world seems to rely on the imperious curse and other such devices to work... it's pretty dark. And squicky.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** I kind of don't like the whole 'time traveling' trope.

But this is pretty close in terms of mentality what I am looking for.

Although, there is no 'build up' to the bitterness. (Which I was kind of looking for)

But I did say I would take anything. Make up your mind Nekyia!

Oh well, thanks for the recommendation.

*** I rather dislike the idea that Harry is a girl but pretends to be a guy to play a role in the story. When I meant 'gender bashing' in any form, it means I dislike the whole idea of the trope. At least for fan fiction.

**** Bashing isn't quite that, though. That people are treated differently based on their sex ... well, sorry if I sound mean but no matter how some of us wish it didn't happen that it is happening does not a bashing in a story make.
