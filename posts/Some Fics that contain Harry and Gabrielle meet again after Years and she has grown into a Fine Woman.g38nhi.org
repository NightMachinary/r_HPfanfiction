I wouldnt classify it as a Harry/Gabrielle Fic. What i had in mind wouldnt be a romance Fic, but more that Harry meets an Adult Gabrielle (around her Fullage or past her fullage) and discovers, that she has grown from the little Girl he meet in the 4th Year into a fine Woman (needless to say Beautiful since she is part Veela) and maybe develops a Crush on her. What i imagined would be, that she might tease him with her new attraction. Both of them share some moments and possibly get even intim with each other....but Both agree that that what they have now is no Romance, but a Situation built on Crush and attraction. However, they dont mind and enjoy the Fun and Pleasure.

This might be specific, but atleast the Lovey-dovey stuff should be included, so she is teasing him and they have some sessions. The Attraction and Crush is mutual, but they wont stay together in the end.


** There's one I can't remember the name of where he and Gabrielle meet in some middle-of-nowhere place (I think it was somewhere cold and snowy?) and end up camping together for awhile. I think it's called something like "To get away from it all" or "Get away for awhile" - or something to that effect, anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  Gabrielle Delacour was a quarter-Veela, it was the perfect amount of Veela Gabrielle had always thought. It meant she had just enough to be considered pretty, but not enough to actually sway anyone under Veela powers. Which meant her political ambitions were safe, Veela weren't allowed to hold any political position that could sway the public. That is, until her parents and Mémé came to visit her on her very first day of work at the Ministère de la Magie.

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.

  A slightly different look at the veela using only stated facts; such as Fleur being a half veela is assumed but never confirmed in the books. Harry, Hermione and a few others have an educational adventure. As in all of my story's Harry will be happy.
