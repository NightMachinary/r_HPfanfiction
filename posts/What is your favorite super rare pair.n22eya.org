The kind that barely makes sense . They may barely talk to each other. They may have never breathed the same air as each other. You might have never even seen content for it before If someone asks you why you might not have a very intelligible response, but you like it anyway.

For me its Fleur x Tonks


** Harry/Cho. You wouldn't think it would be as rare as it is, but Cho gets a really bad rep for what happened in the books. Can't even count on one hand the number of decent fics for this pairing I've read.

** Voldemort and Tom Riddle, basically himself with a version of himself, or horcruxes getting together, or some sort of dimension hopping or time travel involved.

I think it makes sense. But a lot of people wouldn't think of shipping it.

Also, Alphard Black/Tom Riddle and Amelia Bones/Tom Riddle are basically nonexistent pairings, but I'm including them for a long fic of mine where Tom Riddle is not Voldemort.

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

  They passed through the barrier and found themselves in Kings Crossing proper, everywhere thronged by children also back for the summer holiday. Any one of the smiling adults could be Harry's relations, so Cedric kept his eyes sharp for lanky builds or unruly dark hair or bright green eyes, amid all the joyful reunions going on around them. It was hard not to be infected by the celebratory mood.Maybe a summer holiday in the peaceful, uncomplicated muggle world was exactly what Cedric needed.

Sirius gets her divorced from Lucius and she loves him for it. And Draco works on not being a royal asshat.

The story of how I discovered it was rather amusing. It was mentioned in the Fan Works section for Visual Pun on TVTropes. Came for the Visual Pun, stayed for the advertised Harmione, enjoying the unexpected.... /thinking/

Ginny/Bellatrix as shown in BolshevikMuppet's /Black Ink, Red Rose/ . Can't link because of Rule 8. Just the darkness and sheer insanity of it as depicted in the fic clinches this one.

Strangest Ao3 pairing I have come across? Hermione Granger/Book. With reference to the Diary.

Getting locked into Azkaban for the rest of her long life with nothing but misery and possible regret is appropriate thematically. It was also foreshadowed pretty heavily.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Kreacher sends Hermione back in time with the hopes that she will save Regulus an destroy the locket. Hermione figures she will have an ally to help her destroy the other horcruxes, too. But, Regulus Black doesn't turn out to be anything like she expected he would. Regulus x Hermione. Time Travel. COMPLETE!

** Don't know why but I like Harry/McGonagall and Harry/ Narcissa. Harry with these two gets the blood flowing something fierce. With Harry/Minerva, I guess I like the forbidden accept of it all. With Harry/Narcissa, getting with your bully's mom just sounds like the ultimate victory. These two ladies are pretty cool and I wished writers did more with them.

** Don't know if these count as rare but: Jegulus, Dramione and the Hermione/Draco/Theo triad.

I've read so many wholesome Jegulus one shots that have made me so happy.

The Dramione classics are just... so amazing.

And the Hermione/Draco/Theo ones I've read have portrayed the triad so well, and are so so sweet.

** I adore Snape/Tonks, but it's often used as a porn ship.

Percy Weasley/Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint is great, although I think that one makes more sense given that Percy and Ollie are roommates and Ollie and Marcus love Quidditch.

I also quite like Percy/Severus? Like I've only seen a few good Fics of them, but I love the dynamic of these two people who made mistakes as teenagers that will always follow them around no matter how hard they try to atone.

Edit: also, when done well Snape/Dumbledore can be super fluffy, though I tend to prefer mentor stories of those two. I also quite like Snape/Lockhart, but not the weird, cracky, stalkerish Gilderoy ones, y'know?
