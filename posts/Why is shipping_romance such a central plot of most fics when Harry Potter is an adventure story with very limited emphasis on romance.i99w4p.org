I have a hard time finding a story where romance is not a big part of the story. Even adventure stories are littered with paragraphs after paragraphs of the protagonist being all lovey dovey with their partner. I quite liked the fact that in the actual series, Ginny was for most part a background character and Ron and Hermione only got together at the end of Book 7. It maintained the dynamics between the trio quite natural because people when they're in love they don't really act like themselves at first.

And as much as some authors may like to describe the romantic date and the 'snogging' sessions between the characters, I just skip those paragraphs when I read a story that I generally enjoy.

What are your thoughts?


** I think that's the reason. For me my own romantic life or lack there of makes me live vicariously through my favorite characters and seeing them happy helps with my depression

** Part of it is that teenagers are, in fact, rather obsessed with who likes whom, who's going with whom, who's breaking up with whom, how do I get that special guy/gal to notice me...

Really, Hogwarts would be a hotbed of teenage angsty drama. It's actually more realistic than the adventure that JKR wrote. Not as compelling, maybe. (But then again, Twilight was all teen drama and it garnered a lot of fans. Also a lot of hate.)

** If I want adventure or the story without too much romance, I can go back and reread the books. I've found a couple fics that I enjoy without a focus on romance/ships, but idk. I just really enjoy shipping in general and prefer finding fic that focuses on it. But that's just me!

*** I see your point. When I read fics I prefer to read canon compliant ones about other characters than Harry, or Harry at a different point in life which are written in the same spirit as the original series. I don't really read AUs or time travel fics.

** It might be because Harry Potter has such a limited emphasis on romance, it leaves a lot of space to fill in the blanks with shipping and romance.

** Because most authors/readers of fanfiction stories are teenagers or young adults who are currently struggling with their own romantic issues?

**** Not all women write romance. But most romance authors are women. Except for like he said, the guys who write fantasies of a self-insert character being all OP, charismatic and with lot of Females to his feet.
