#+begin_quote
  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone who has a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be the hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

** Okay, so the worst two I remember coming across (possibly from LiveJournal) are from a friend who used to find it funny to find the most disgusting things she could think of and send them around. So, if anyone remembers these - and of course, very NSFW - one is Draco/Snape on a bed of I think, raw fish, and the other is Lucius/Draco and involves um...drilling a hole. I can't actually read that one, it's too disgusting even for me.

This was back in the day when everyone boasted about watching horrible videos and finding horrible things on the internet, and finding horrible fanfics was this girl's version of it. I can't recommend either as they are really nasty and the Lucius/Draco one is all kinds of violent and disturbing. Although also almost crossing over into My Immortal levels of over-the-top.

EDIT: Ohgod I just remembered another one as well. Slughorn/Harry, and the candied pineapple that Slughorn is fond of makes an appearance too. Search for Harry Potter squick and you'll find loads :O

** The worst I've ever read is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6398488][An offer he can't refuse]]. It's a Snape/Draco where snape rapes a child Draco and obliviates him after. Just so fucked up.

** There's the Lucius/Draco torture, rape fic thats menioned elsewhere on this thread. /shudder/ One of the most disturbing fanfictions(in all fandoms) ever written. I also read one with Hermione/Sorting hat that turns into Ginny/sorting hat. So weird. Lavender/Fenrir, in which lavender's his sex slave and he literally eats parts of her. Disgusting. I also read Hogwarts/squid.

  Harry and Hermione don't tell Ron about Grawp straight away, so he decides to find out what their new secret is by himself...   Ron-bashing. Literally so.

** There was one on restricted section where snape raped hermione during detention, she turned into a horse and then used magic to rape him with his own severed penis (or something along those lines). I was only young when I read it and it turned me off fanfiction and the internet for a couple of months.
