Malfoy called Hermione Mudblood ? Malfoy has an unfortunate adventure with the Sword of Gryffindor

Pansy insults Ginny ? Pansy falls out of the eight floor window

Crabbe and Goyle beating up Neville ? Ram and Kurt style double suicide

Daphne ruined Hermione's bag ? It's amazing how easy it is to slip some acid into her makeup kit

The Dursleys locked up Harry up ? Lock them in the house then burn it down


** "an unfortunate adventure with the Sword of Gryffindor" Thank you. For some reason, that euphemism had me in stitches.
