I remember reading a de-aging fanfiction where Dumbledore gives the teachers a holiday and de-ages them to the same age as the students. The pairing I remember is Harry/Severus.

I haven't been able to find it again. Can you help?


** I suspect the fic you're looking for is either linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1823242]]) or [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=564][Death Eater Takes a Holiday]]. The first is sentimental; the second was started in 2004 and has a high degree of SPaG and character issues.
