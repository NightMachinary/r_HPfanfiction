Slash, SI, crack fics, mary sue, whatever. I keep seeing the same threads with the same recommendations so what's something you find readable but wouldn't necessarily recommend as good?

Maybe some recommendations that aren't from ffn? If you sort that by most favorites, i've probably read everything in the first 10-15 pages.

** [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts.htm][This]] isn't even technically fanfiction, but its definitely one of my favorite harry potter-related things that I've read. It's essentially an attempt to reconstruct what Hogwarts (and surrounding areas) must have looked like, by only using evidence in the text and a dollop of historical knowledge. Fascinating, in detail, and very well done.

On the same website you can also find a lot more really fascinating analyses and essays, all by the same person. She mostly writes about Snape (and was a real-life friend of John Nettleship, who was the inspiration for his character) and has a lot to say. She also gives [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][the best figuring I've found]] for the size of Hogwarts and has her [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/links/HP.htm][own list]] of fanfiction she recommends, which will also probably give you new things because it contains a lot of pre-DH stuff, which is not something you'll find at the top of the favorites on ff.net.

So I guess my recommendation to you is to spend some time perusing that website! Hope you find it as neat as I did

** Here's one “evil” story: “Wraithspeaker” (linkffn(5702750)).

Admittedly it's not a bad one, though it's unfinished (as is this author's wont), but I don't think I've seen it recommended so maybe it's something new for you.

Also, “The Many Potters of Little Hangleton” (linkffn(10339852)), in case you prefer something more cracky.

And “Portus” (linkffn(6120841)), which I think is an interesting take on what could have happened at a certain point in the story.

** I absolutely love linkffn(Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild). Can't really call it good though. It's got:

misunderstood Salazar Slytherin, lordship Harry, Harry as a descendant of Merlin and Gryffindor and Morgan Lefay, special Patronus capable of destroying dementors, creature inheritances and a custom multi-core magic focusing piece of wood.

I should say though, that all of these are done with a twist, and there's some chapters that take place in the past.

On writing quality there are +frequently+ occasionally awkward sentence structure (don't think English is his native language, so it makes sense) and a few recurring typos (spelling crave as carve). But for some goddamned reason, I can't get enough of the damn thing. The author definitely spent some serious time doing worldbuilding for this, so I guess I can forgive the existence of damn near all of the crap I listed earlier (though crave as carve makes my brain itch in a bad way).

So far it's at 40 chapters, and just updated Monday.

I also really like Text Talks... Sorry I'm on mobile and have no idea what the ao3 linkbot shortcut is... [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]] Basically it's Sirius/Remus (these are the only two S/R fics I've ever read, actually!) and they are muggle highschoolers. Most canon marauder characters appear. It's very different from the usual fic and pretty good if you like that pairing! It's also pretty funny.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is an ongoing Hermione/Narcissa slow-burn fic. It's been pretty good so far, but the quality has dropped a bit recently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

OK, technically two of those are archive links, but not ffn. And most of them are multifandom authors, so if you read other fandoms, you might discover more stuff.

Most of those I discovered through a challenge site, [[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/][Rough Trade]], which I recommend checking out. Not everything gets finished, but that's true anywhere. That site is, again, multifandom, but there are always HP entries.

** This one is actually fantastic so far but it's a really unusual pairing so I'm hoping you haven't read it Linkffn(11476491) It's Hermione/Dolohov which I probably never would have read. There is an alternate to the story which is written first which is Lucius/Hermione Linkffn(11304578) The Lumione one was written first with Antonin as a third character and so many people love the idea of him with her instead that the author wrote an alternate story which I'm totally in love with.

It is dark so be prepared for that, though not nearly as dark as many fics I have read. It only has 327 favorites but I honestly think that has nothing to do with the story and more to do with the pairing.

Also, if you are interested in unusual pairings I have a Hermione/Arthur story that I like that is really sweet and a bit sad and a Hermione/Yaxley story. Those aren't written as well but they are stories I can read again and again.

  "Sometimes I think my life would have been easier if I just walked away and let them catch you." Following Voldemort's victory, Hermione is Undesirable No 2 and in constant danger. Forced to accept help from Lucius Malfoy, the last man she could ever trust, she learns that maybe her first impression was incorrect.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
