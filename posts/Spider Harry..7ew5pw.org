We always hear about the spiders he had to live with, I was wondering if there was a story where the mix of accidental magic, and his living conditions would make him start understanding spiders. There is great potential there via spying, and combat. As long as it has more than 20k+ words. Whether anything comes of this is up to you, as long as he understands spiders. Also it has a type of yin-yang with Riddle, and snakes.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** While on a class tour an average muggle is bitten by a magically enhanced spider to become the Hero, Spider Harry!

Green Goblin is literally a green goblin. He uses a magic carpet instead of a glider.

The giant squid in the Hogwarts lake is Dr. Octupus and is incredibly intelligent. The lake has resources that he values.

** There's a general lack of stories in which Harry interacts with non-wizzards in any kind of productive and regular manner. Except for goblins and veela. Fanfiction has an unhealthy obession with those two.

It's abandoned though. linkffn(6172754)

  Harry Potter was always called a "Freak" by the Dursleys, the wizarding world often reviled him, and the muggles ignored his abuse or added to it... After all of that abuse, is it any wonder that Harry is going to make the world regret it? W!Dark Animal H

*** I know, but sadly it seems impossible. You'd think with all the stories that refrence the spiders as is 'only friends' that there would be more, but nope it doesn't seem to exist.
