I have multiple recs and you don't have to group these together into a checklist, so long as there's at least one of my requests in there, I'm good.

1. Can anybody rec me any fics where the more obscure HP characters have a bigger appearance? For instance, like the Unspeakables work with Harry or harry IS an unspeakable. I've read some fics with an Unspeakable named Croaker as part of the main plot and I absolutely loved it (can't remember what it was, though) and another where an Auror works with Harry-pretending-to-be-Voledmort and becomes a Death Eater. I've even heard of a group called the 'Unnamed' or Harry working as a Goblin assassin(?) Who works in the division that stops world-ending prophecies (this one is brilliant, made with inspiration from the Covid virus - The Crownless King by SherlockMalfoy on AO3). Basically, I guess, what I want is world-building fics that focus on the more obscure members of the Wizarding World.

2. Any fics that focus on a family? I've read some fics about the Black Family becoming a coven, stealing Harry and doing a runner, ect. Is there any fics that 'worldbuild' on family/family history?

3. The fact that there's christian ideology/religion in a world predominately about magic -- which the Bible is against -- makes me quite uncomfortable. And honestly? It's my biggest pet peeve, it just doesn't make sense that they'd celebrate Christmas! Halloween, I can understand as it's a mix of beliefs, one being pagan tradition. But I just don't like it. Is there any fics that focus on pagan religion? Or even non!religion/anti!Christianity. I'm personally not bashing christianity but the fact that the wizarding world follows christian ideology/beliefs when the witch hunts happened leaves a gross taste in my mouth.

No harems, no Hinny. Everything else is 100% okay.

(Not part of the req but why hasn't any fanfic author written about the possibility of Harry becoming an Obscural? All the things are there, I mean the Dursley's tried to work the magic out of him, surely Harry would be afraid of his magic due to his abusive situation and thus, would become an obscural. I thought about writing this once, but I'm honestly not that good of a writer. I can't focus for long, which I am mightily bitter about).


** Now I feel like I have read stories that match each prompt you want. So it's time for me to dig through my list and try to play do I remember this one!

1. Obscure characters or groups relatively unseen? Interesting world-building? Well, I got a list for that.

Make a wish - linkffn(2318355) - A really good world-building fic. While the main focus is Harry, there is a lot of showing of the international magical community that you might find interesting. I count the international magical community as being an obscure character because it's almost never talked about in the books which is a shame.

Albus and Harry's World Trip - linkffn(13388022) - Okay Albus isn't that much of an obscure character but this story goes and shows the personal life of Albus that isn't seen as well as doing some good world-building.

Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - This story is basically a gathering of main and side characters joining together to form a more impressive DA. It's a fun story.

The Assassin Wore White - linkffn(10071063) - A one-shot of Poppy Pomfrey. It's a really interesting take on healers.

Lessons with Hagrid - linkffn(75121240) - A one-shot of Hagrid and Harry. Where Hagrid is a master of Occlumens. And how he passes this on to Harry.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer - linkffn(5915140) - This story explores the life of curse breakers by having Bill Weasly take Harry as an apprentice.

And I am sure there are more but these are the ones that stand out in that regard.

2 - 3. Now I am going to mix family history and wizarding cultural fic list together because a few of them deal with both.

Quoth the Raven, Nevermore - linkffn(6652537) - Now this could go into the previous list as we get to see the royal family and muggle character interact with the wizarding world. There is some good world-building going on too. But I put this story more mythological The Morrigan is a constant character throughout the story and touches upon the 'old ways' its a slow start in the beginning but a good story.

Beltane Child - linkffn(9415372) - This story goes to describe the Gaelic holiday Beltane and its significance in the wizarding world. Not sure how much of it is historically accurate but it is an interesting story.

Finding a Place to Call Home - linkffn(9885609) - Another interesting story, it's later in the story but there is a part that fleshes out a little bit of Harry's and Lillith Moon's family history. Though there is also some fun international magical world-building going on that is cool.

A Different Sort of Bond - linkffn(11260631) - It's later in the story as well, but we can see how a wizarding family celebrates Yule while worshiping a pagan goddess. Its not a major element but it is there.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - One of my favorite world-building fanfics out there. It explores the pagan tradition of the magical world. There is some talk of family history but nothing mind-blowing I think.

Harry Potter and the Hidden Kingdom - linkffn(12534241) - A little later on in the story, but it also gives a detailed past of Harry's family which is quite interesting.

Family - It's in the Blood - linkffn(13292346) - This story gives the authors take on how family magic works in the magical world and I think it is quite interesting.

And there is that list. I am sure there is more but this is already quite long.

In regards to the obscural Harry Potter, I seen some stories like that. But few of them were any good, I know I was reading one that was decent but I can't recall its name. It's out there, one just has to look really hard.

** Okay so this fic isn't the best and it may not be exactly what you're looking for but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283][Dragonheart Caravan]] is a fic that explores something I don't see often--squibs. It's about a family of choice group of squibs who live between the magical and muggle worlds, so the wizards we know pop up here and there. They practice some magic but not the kinds wizards and witches use. & they entertain others, sell goods, etc...

They adopt Harry when he runs away from the Dursley's & Harry is still the BWL. Honestly it's a very original story with a lot of OCs.

Cons: it's waaaay too long. There's some fetishization of cultures, some pretty bad sex scenes, & it's pretty slow.

** 1, So you seem to want stories that focus on unique characters for unique perspectives? May I ask a question here? Do you just want to find fanfics that are amazingly unique in general, with original ideas (not ocs, i don't know any oc fics)? If yes (please reply), then I'll rec you a couple of the oddities I've found over the years, I like this sort of thing. I've found quite a few rare gems.

2 Wow - I've actually always wanted this! I've always wanted to see a story, written in the style that legends and myths and fairytales are written in, of each family. I thought of a bunch of ideas alread. Have you read Blackpool? It's really a common rec but it focuses on black family history and is a chilling story.

3 In my opinion, this was caused by the muggleborns bringing their culture in. Part of the reason the purebloods hate them is because they tread all over their beleifs and bring in christianity, the same religion which burned hundereds of witches in the past. Of course, this makes sense (i'd be bitter too, in their view christianity's killed thousands), but murdering and prejudice against muggleborns is not the way to go.

4, So we seem to have the same hate of harems. Hinny is fine but I don't ship it so I skip any hinny interactions due to boredom.

5, There are several obscurial harry fics out there, I've seen many. Their quality, from what i've seen, is shite. I hope you have better luck than me and find something that is up to standard and isn't angst surprise (with the 'surprise' being more angst. Wouldn't you be surprised to find that a surprise wasn't a surprise after all?)

*** 1. I'm looking for anything that's generally unique, yes. Anything different from the 'norm' or have a unique twist on circumstances. I've read a lot of HP fics throughout my years, I couldn't even name them but I will happily re-read a fic if I haven't read it recently. I mainly focus on AO3 now so if you recommend any there, there's a chance I've read it recently. I don't mind if its a WIP/abandoned either, so long as it has a decent world length.

2. I've stumbled upon it a time or two, have been curious, but have never clicked on it! I'll be sure to check it out. I just love family-building fics. Where you get to know the more obscure characters who have an obscure and interesting history. It just seems fascinating, if I'll be honest. It's probably why I read 'political' fics. It focuses on family history.

3. I agree with the sentiment. However, there is a 'muggle studies' in Hogwarts, would it not be fair, then, to offer 'wizarding customs' as an alternative for the muggleborns/muggle raised? It would make sense that they're taught important aspects of a society they're apart of. Maybe then, even, muggleborn/raised wouldn't see the more traditional aspects as barbaric or 'evil' or something. You'd think that regardless, those who are pushing their religion on a new society would understand their point of view and realize the witch trials DID happen by a faction that believed witches and wizards as 'evil' and 'demonic'. It's terrible practice pushing your opinions and views on a whole culture without even bothering to take into account the history behind it. It lowkey makes me bitter too, some aspects of my own culture are used for spiritual practices/ceremonies and people adopt certain aspects of it without fully understanding or caring that it's basically an insult to my culture.

4. I don't like harems at all. I'm half-and-half with polyamory. There's only ever been 2 fics with that relationship structure I've liked. I also see Ginny as Harry's little sister. I don't much like the whole 'best-friends-sister' trope. It's probably one of the few tropes I don't like tbh.

5. Understandable seeing as Obscural's are made under terrible circumstances. I don't even know how I'd write a fic like that out without having heavy angst involved. I'd have to have classic HP trope intervention lol.

** This fic focuses on pagan religion among witches and wizards. Harry's trying to fit into his new culture and he learns that Christianity has become associated with the political position of Muggleborn equality, while "the old ways" religion has become associated with blood purity and Death Eaters. So Harry's trying to follow his parents' religion in semi-secret and deal with the immigration/racism politics that have gotten mixed into the middle of it.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

** Here's how I interpret the Wizaridng World having Christianity: Those parts of the bible are not original. They were added in to prevent Christian Muggles in Britain from discovering Magic.
