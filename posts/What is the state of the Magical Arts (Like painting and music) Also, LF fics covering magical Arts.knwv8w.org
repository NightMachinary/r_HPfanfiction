As the title says, there are two parts to this - a discussion and a request.

*The Discussion:*

So, I'm currently plotting out a sequence in a story involving a magical Theatre production and it got me curious - what do people think is the state of the Arts in the Magical World? As far as I remember, we hear of about two bands and only really see paintings and photographs as records of people, rather than capturing scenery or exploring themes and ideas. What art forms might Magicals have? What are those art forms like? What would it be like to be an artist in the Magical World?

Personally, I think the visual arts (paintings, photography, etc) would be a lot more focused on recording than imagining as a consequence of the animated nature of their artworks. And I think their artistry world would be a lot more akin to the old system of Patronage and commissions than our modern structure, so it'd probably be ridiculously rare to make a living as an artist, but incredibly lucrative once you do.

*The Request:*

I'm looking for fics including Magical People's versions of various Art Forms (anything goes, music, painting, sculpture, theatre, cinema, modern arts and old).

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Keep in mind that the population of magical Britain is both small and insular. As such, there probably wouldn't be much art and culture available, and most of the artists would be hobbyists, not full-time professionals. There might be a few lucky people who get rich families as patrons, but that's not exactly something that a prospective artist could really count on.

I think that if a magical wanted to make a living as an artist, their best bet would be to do so in the muggle world, at least part time.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!
