:END:
I have been lookig for this fic wherein Hermione was sent back in time to the 1940 and then got together with Tom Riddle but when a vortex going back to 1998 Tom saw Hermione got hit by a killing curse and vow to find out who killed her. I've read this fic before but I can't seem to find it anywhere now. Thanks
