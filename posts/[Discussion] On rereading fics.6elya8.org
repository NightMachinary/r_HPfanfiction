So I recently went through my old follow/fav list, and found a few fics that I thought I remembered being good, so went to read them again.

Right now, I went through 5 chapters of Partially Kissed Hero, which I somehow remember being good, and found it to be so utterly awful it's unreadable. It was one of the first fics I read, so maybe it's just that, I'll have to try and look at others that I started with.

On the other hand, there have been a few, like A Black Comedy, which I've read twice, and Seventh Horcrux, which I've read four times now, which have just as much entertainment for me on later reads.

Which fics do you think have a similar re-readability potential? Which aren't as good as people seem to remember them being?


** Well, Partially Kissed Hero has always been awful and unreadable. It's almost to the meme status of My Immortal. It's one of those stories that people who are new to the fandom read, and don't really know better.

*** That's exactly it. It is so so beyond awful, I have no idea how I could ever even get through it. I must've had really low standards then. :/

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** There are very few that actually stand up to a 2nd reading. It's actually put me off reading incomplete stories if the author is updating. If the schedule is too long, I have to re-read the fic on updates. Much of the time while I'm re-reading it... I trigger the "wtf am I reading?" meme.

** I've felt this several times throughout my life, actually. I started reading fanfiction when I was twelve. And I've looked back several times, and I believe it's the same reason a lot of people don't get tattoo's, "I look back and think I was an idiot five years ago. In five years from now, I'll think I was an idiot." Our tastes change and we mature or just change as a person because of circumstances. That being said, I still enjoy linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) even years later.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Not sure I've ever gone back and re-read an entire fanfiction except for some one shots- like The Mind of Arthur Weasley by Northumbrian- linkffn(The Mind of Arthur Weasley by Northumbrian).

I have re-read a couple fics when they were updated after a long wait and I wanted to re-read to catch myself up on the story. Both The Changeling and Grow Young with Me were just as good a second-time around- linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19).

*** You've never re-read a full fic? May I ask how long you've been reading fanfiction? I'm not trying to have a dig, I'm just curious as I've re-read almost every fic that I've enjoyed at some point over the last 5-6 years.

**** Had to look it up- I first was introduced to it somehow around 4 years ago with the Northumbrian stories (Tales of the Battle was the first thing I read). Probably just because I never have enough time to read all that I want to. You can see large gaps in between me adding stories on my favorites list through those 4 years and that's usually when I got into some series or other books (also a bit of an amateur historian with a focus on early U.S. history so I read a lot of nonfiction books from that era).

I've got 9 WIPs that I'm reading right now, 5 of those are updated weekly so they keep me happy and I like to watch this sub for others that are worth reading.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I've re-read Carnivorous Muffins Lily and the Art of Sisyphus a few times, I re-read a lot of esama's and Tsume Yuki's works as well. I like going back and re-reading fics, especially one-shots. I'm more likely to re-read fics from other fandoms though, just because I know the HP ones pretty well or I need a break from them.
