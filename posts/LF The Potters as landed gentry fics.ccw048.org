In my reread of my old ffn favorites, I came across linkffn(The Legacy of Two Generations) which is a Marauders Era fic. I might review it later but be warned YMMV at the very least it needs a beta. What I found most intriguing though was that James Potter and family were landed gentry and reminded me very much of the Darcys in Pride and Prejudice. This gave the "well off" vibe without the Lord Potter trope, and I liked it especially as on this sub recently there has been much discussing of the trope and how it turns people off. To be clear, I'm not looking for a Pride and Prejudice cross over although that might be interesting too, its more the idea of the rich purebloods as landed gentry like Mr. Darcy. I know this isn't how the potters got their money, but in this instance, I like my headcanon better than JKRs added detail.\\
Any ideas?
