Hi guys, I remember the fix featuring Harry building up his own little kingdom. There is a big point made of his magic being weaker because of lack of magic in the game of thrones world. Harry plants a shitton of weirwoods to counteract that. He has a castle and lands and all and keeps magicing walls around it. He also melts the Wall.\\
If you happen to have other interesting completed or WIP crossovers that do not require detailed knowledge of the game of thones franchise I'd be happy to read some!


** Its called the wizard of Harrenhall and is 6 chapters long. On my phone so can't link it but it should be on the first page if you sort by favourites

** As the other commenter said this sounds a lot like Wizard of Harrenhal.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
