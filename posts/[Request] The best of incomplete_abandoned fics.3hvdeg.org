** linkffn(Knowledge is Power by Nkari127)

I just finished reading this one not knowing it was abandoned (my fault, shouldn't have skimmed the AN), Pretty good fic. Harry's a dick but still impressively intelligent and pretty funny.

Here's a few others off the top of my head. Still worth reading.

  Betrayed by Weasleys, Manipulated by Dumbledore, Saved by Snape. All to win a war, only to lose the battle and die. So Fate steps in and sends them back to try again. Soul bond Harry/Hermione, soulbound Neville/Luna. Starts back in year one. Mix of movieverse and bookverse. Removed some time ago due to muse death -UNFINISHED AND UNUPDATED - sorry, muse has vanished again.
