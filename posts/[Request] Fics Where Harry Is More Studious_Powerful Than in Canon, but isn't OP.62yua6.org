There would probably be some sort of divergence from canon, but I'd prefer if it to not be too drastic. If there is a well-written fic with a significant divergence I'd still love to read it though.

Doesn't need to be (and preferably isn't) on the level of Dumbledore/Voldemort or even a comparable prodigy for his age, but still better than most wizards. Preferably not a total recluse due to studying habits. Also, I'd like for Harry to be emotionally realistic, if maybe more mature than others his age, and not some hyper-analytical, manipulative super-genius with no trust nor dependence on others. That's one of the biggest things that throws me off.

No bashing. Romance is fine. Can start anytime, preferably during Hogwarts (although introductory chapters before Hogwarts are cool).

There's probably like two fics that match all these exactly, but anything similar in premise would be awesome. Thanks!

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** linkffn(4062601)

I really can't recommend /The Wise One/ trilogy enough. It is complete, and has a total series word length of around 450k. Harry is "kidnapped" by Sirius when he is seven. Sirius takes him out of the country and they travel around the world. Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore thinks Sirius must've killed Harry and raises Neville up to be the chosen one of the prophecy, even though Neville isn't entirely up for it.

The first book takes place mostly outside Britain, though we do get scenes of what's going on at Hogwarts from time to time. Harry and Sirius return to Britain at the end of the first book for Harry's fifth year. Harry in this is fairly competent, proactive and confident.

The series features one of the best Harry/Hermione romances I've read and doesn't bash anyone, though it may seem like /mild/ Ron and Dumbledore bashing for a short while. Everyone is pretty much in character and honestly, I can't find anything to complain about it. I'd actually say it's better than canon in many ways.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing.

** If anyone's still looking at this thread, linkffn(3446796) is an excellent fic that features this to a limited extent. Unfortunately updates seem to be sparse, but it's currently in the summer before 6th year and it's well worth the long read despite its incompleteness.
