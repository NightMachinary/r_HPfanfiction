I've read a lot of fan fics looking for some of your guys favorites, to either re read or maybe some new ones. Thank you!

Harry/Ginny


** I've been a Harry/Ginny fanfiction reader since they became canon in HBP. I've been reading them for over ten years now. I know more or less all of the great stories.

I'd be happy to provide you with a copy of the great hpfan1111's stories. I believe I had them all. She was one of if not the best Harry/Ginny fanfiction authors to write fanfiction.

I would also suggest taking a look at Sink Into your eyes you might find a few you have never read there and they tend to have all of Harry/Ginny stories.

I can give a few recommendations if you'd like to narrow your genre a bit more. I.E. Time travel.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&c2=11][18.4k actually]], still by Sturgeon's law that means only 16,560 can be soul bonds.
