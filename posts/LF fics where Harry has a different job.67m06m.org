Would like fics where Harry is not an auror/teacher or quidditch player. Maybe even something as unusual as an arithmancer or potioneer or even muggle jobs like accountant or who knows a football player. Thanks.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/The-Horror-The-Horror][The Horror! The Horror!]], great little fic of Harry moving to Africa to be a potions ingredients collector, though it's complete crack.

Not a proper fic, but in Odd Ideas, a collection of maybes and one-shots, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/142/Odd-Ideas][this gem]], where pre year three in diagon alley, Harry becomes an inspector of Diagon alley in order to learn trade-magic, in which Hogwarts teaches the elite and Diagon Alley shopkeepers are blue collar. Pretty neat premise.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]], in which Harry bails on Divination along with Herms, and joins up with Runes and kicks ass at it. Part crack in that he gets absurdly good at it. Does some warding for the Goblins, enhances potion ingredients, and so on.

** There are tons of these. Try looking at rec sites, as often the owners provide occupation-specific tags. Off the top of my head, try Just One of Those Things by Kedavranox. Slash. Harry manages a magical animal sanctuary.

A fabulous novel-length story is Stop and Stare by Saras_Girl. Slash. Harry designs wizard tents. linkao3(5625616; 982982)
