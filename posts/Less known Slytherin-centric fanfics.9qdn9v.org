I'm convinced that I have read most of the well-known ones.


** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576][Serpensortia]] trilogy linkao3(4913998) is one of the very few Slytherin!Harry fics I like but I almost never see it get recced.

I have a feeling that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665][Slytherin Career Day]] linkao3(7079665) is both shorter and sillier than what you're looking for, but it is Slytherin-centric.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** Everyone (including me) likes to recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), but I only recently stumbled upon the Sarcasm and Slytherin series, which starts with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes). Very similar (like, suspiciously similar in terms of years 1 and 2 story, but I don't think there was actually any plagarism, just odd timing) and good quality, but SaS hasn't been dragged out like PoS, actually having made it through 4th year in about a year.

I also highly recommend it. I binged the first four books in about five days. Even the similar things were done differently, and there's enough plot differences that it's not the same as POS, especially as it goes on (which I've also enjoyed).

****** Late reply, but I finished rereading it and agree with you. I think SaS is arguably better written (or at least more concisely written), but PoS has a couple of cool characters that are missing from SaS.

Regulus is definitely one of them; Pettigrew is the other one. Pettigrew as a competent villain makes so much more sense and helps to explain SOME of James and Jim's behavior. I expect SaS to eventually reveal that Thorne is like Pettigrew, secretly working for Voldemort, but until then, PoS has the edge. I do like that PoS goes out of its way to explain away a lot of holes in the tropes it uses, even if it's making the story take forever.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him.

  He's a villain. He's a monster. He's a child of an adulterer god and a scorned goddess. He's a fool. He's a menace. He's so many things, and yet to his father's and his siblings, he's stupid.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
