  A small, seemingly inconsequential change can cause ripples which become a great wave.When Fleur makes the choice to kiss Harry goodbye before leaving Hogwarts after the Triwizard Tournament, it turns out that nothing from then onward would be quite the same. Some changes are better than what might have been. Others are worse. The rest are neither better or worse, but different, and the connection between Harry and Fleur which grows in surprising leaps and bounds is one of these.They forge a bond that begins as friendship, which is then tempered in the fires of the war against Voldemort, before eventually becoming something more.(AU that begins at the end of Goblet of Fire, then diverges from there. Explicit chapters/scenes are marked with asterisks)
