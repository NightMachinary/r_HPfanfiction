Something that I never liked was the fact that Dumbledore knew that Voldemort created Horcruxes but never seemed to try harder to get rid of them. I mean I don't know when he figured out that Voldemort created seven Horcruxes but I'm pretty sure it was way before Harry's fifth year at least. So the fact that he never located them and destroyed them seemed very strange to me.

And I get it, because of the prophecy Harry had to be the one to kill Voldemort, and Dumbledore pretty much knew or at the very least guessed that Harry was a Horcrux himself, but even so he could have still destroyed like five of the Horcruxes.

So that's what I'm looking for, stories where Dumbledore destroys the Horcruxes sooner then he did in canon, or at the very least destroyed more then just the diary earlier then what happened in canon.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. Very little to no character bashing.

Let's look at the timeline of events here

1. End of Harry's second year. Discovers that Voldemort had a Horcrux, and combined with knowledge of Harry's scar, realizes that something fucky is going on.

2. Less than three months later, for the first time ever in history (that people know of), a prisoner escapes Azkaban. A prisoner that all evidence suggests is going to hunt down Harry, kill him, and wear his skin as a suit. Third year is Dumbledore dealing with this and keeping the eldritch abominations from feasting on the souls of children. Most likely spends spare time trying to figure out what the hell Voldemort was doing after school, trying to figure the fucky shit out.

3. Right after that is the Triwizard Tournament, which was probably being set up bureaucratically over years before this event. Also evil terrorists resurfaced at a major sporting event not long before hand. Most likely spends spare time trying to figure out what the hell Voldemort was doing after school, trying to figure the fucky shit out.

4. Oh shit, Voldemort's back, and the government doesn't believe. Dumbledore puts his secret society back together, has to deal with government nonsense and an attempted assassination on a student. Proceeds to lose his job and have to go on the run. Gains evidence that really proves (most likely) that Harry does have a part of Voldemort's skull in his noggin. Most likely spends spare time trying to figure out what the hell Voldemort was doing after school, trying to figure the fucky shit out.

5. Finally has time to really focus on the Horcrux problem, while dying, while a student is trying to assassinate him, while trying to teach Harry what he needs to know to beat Voldemort, all before his attempt to prevent a painful death for himself and to keep the Elder Wand out of Voldemort's ownership while also keeping his student from damaging said student's soul.

Basically, from 1981 to right up until Harry starts Hogwarts, life is pretty easy for Dumbledore. Then 1991-1996 happens, shit gets bonkers and then he dies.

*** That sounds pretty accurate. I'd like to note that at the end of year 2, Dumbledore doesn't even necessarily realise that the diary was a Horcrux responsible for anchoring Voldemort to life; an idea I occasionally think about is that the diary was sort of meant as 'war plans', intended to take control of a host and lead the Death Eaters in the event the real Voldemort were indisposed. Hence why it was in Lucius's house, rather than his bank vault.

So not only would Dumbledore be thoroughly distracted by Sirius's escape and dementors and the Triwizard Tournament and the Ministry and everything, he'd also have no conclusive leads as to the source of Voldemort's immortality.

...Incidentally, my personal headcanon here is that Dumbledore didn't expect Voldemort to come back so soon; for the first 5 years he didn't work to prepare Harry to fight Voldemort (seriously, Harry's only an 11-year old at the start!), because he thought he could clean up loose ends himself; find and neutralise the source of Voldemort's immortality, capture his spirit, etc. It's only when Voldemort is not only resurrected, but manages to rebuild his forces in the space of a year, and Harry comes face to face with him for the third/fourth time, that Dumbledore realises the war won't be won before it reaches Harry, and thus teaches him about the Horcruxes.

** I've often wondered about this myself. The obvious reason is that JK Rowling made the story up as she went along; there was no grand plan or vision before the first HP book regarding the Horcruxes and Deathly Hallows. It thus painted Dumbledore in a very bad way when the last 4 books came out.

Anyway, even if Dumbledore didn't know about Horcruxes yet prior to the 1990's, he still was "the only one Voldemort feared" during the 1970's-80's. So why didn't he do something more during that time? This would probably be a good point to explore by talented writers. Perhaps a story about the first rise of Voldemort using Dumbledore's POV where the latter really IS trying to defeat Voldemort but simply can't. Then Harry Potter arrives and same events happen. HOWEVER, when Dumbledore learns about the wraith in Albania, he makes definitive steps to contain it. The world becomes massively changed afterwards. I think this would be an interesting story.
