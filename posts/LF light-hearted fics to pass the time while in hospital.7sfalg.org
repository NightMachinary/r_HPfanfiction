Not necessarily comedy, but also not necessarily not comedy. Post some of your favourites. I have some suggestions for what I like or what I would be interested in seeing, but I'm willing to branch out.

My favourite pairing is Harry/Daphne, but I'm pretty sure I've read all the good ones. Would be interested in seeing some Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks. Please, no Harry/Ginny.

I pretty sick of how fics usually portray Luna, but I'm willing to give her a shot.

If we're going for romance, I'm interested in seeing more post-canon EWE stuff.

I've been known to drop fics really quickly, so if your recommendation has a bad beginning, please assure me that it's worth pushing through.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]])

Light hearted Harry/Fleur one shot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/]])

Well regarded Harry/Luna ficlet thing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/]])

One of the better known Harry/Luna stories, has an unfinished sequel as well. I think Luna was portrayed decently enough in this fic.

** linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) and its sequel are always a nice read.

linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild) is one of the funniest things the /Harry Potter/ fandom has produced as a whole, and complete for now.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) is in the same vein as the two above, but takes itself slightly more seriously.

And I support the recommendation of linkffn(Core Threads) past the first chapter. /Core Threads/ is extremely awesome.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I wrote a pretty light-hearted Harry/Tonks one-shot a while back. There's also a spinoff/sequel but that one is a lot darker and still being written.

There's also Harry&Hermione friendship fic in which she is Harry's wingman set in fourth year.

** At first I thought the request was for Luna fics, so I had some picked out:

linkffn(1912215) / Knock, Knock! by michelle-31a (very short and cute)

linkffn(5371934) / All the Dementors of Azkaban by LifeWriter (longer, but funny)

After that, other lighthearted ones (not necessarily from your ship requests since they're not my cuppa, but maybe you'll enjoy these anyway!) include:

linkffn(2366699) / A Friendly Game of Poker by Mrs. Witter (mainly because I love the poker game's description itself in the first chapter. technically Dramione)

linkffn(11805102) / What about Our Points? by Fairywm (no ship, just made me chuckle)

linkffn(7124111) / I'm Marrying Your Imaginary Boyfriend by Wolf Blossom (Dramione)

linkffn(4509877) / Broccoli and the Art of Subterfuge by opalish (no real ship story, unless you count Harry is technically married to Ginny... but that's just backstory info. It's mostly about the broccoli and subterfuge :D And explains why MadEye looked the way he did. Bwahahaha)

** linkffn(Make a Wish; Prodigy; Harry Potter and the Golden Needle)

If you want crossovers, here are my two favorite: linkffn(Percy Jackson and the world of magic; Shadow of Angmar)

EDIT: By the way, Prodigy is definetly worth it. As is the Percy Jackson one, even though the start is a little weak and the spelling isn't quite /there/
