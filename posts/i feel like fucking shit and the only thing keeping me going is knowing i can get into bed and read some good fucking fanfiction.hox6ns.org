  Sirius Black--CoDA, outcast, family disappointment, and fairly famous YouTuber who runs a sign language channel SiriuslySigns with his best mate, James. Remus Lupin-- vegan hipster who dropped out of University and lives with his best mate Peter, and together run HowlingMoon's DIY, barmy science experiments, and ukulele tutorials channel. When Sirius becomes enamoured with Moony's singing, he dedicates a sign tutorial in hopes he'll be noticed. This leads to exchanging of shout-outs and videos, and what Sirius hopes, is a little something more.
