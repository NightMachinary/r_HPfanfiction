As discovered by Harry when his godfather, Sirius Black, went to Gringotts to adopt him and advised him to perform an Inheritance Test, thus revealing a Potter Family Secret ™, only known by those of the Potter family, (Now including Sirius because of the adoption), which entailed a particularly frisky witch doing... things... with a dragon (bear with me here, ok?) , having hybrid children, and over time having the dragon blood diluted until it reduced to a simple aptitude for flying and the air in general.


** Harry overhears Lavender gossiping to her friends;

“How long do you think it will be before Harry and Draco get together?” “I know right? They're just perfect for each other!”

Harry avoids Draco for the rest of eternity.

*** Ohh so many fanfics make him out to be the next Merlin or Merlin's only heir from his mother's side of the family. But I've never come across a fic where he's related to Arthur. Cause Arthur is a famous muggle. Just imagine Uther's face when his descendants started being born with magic. (I'm referring to BBC's Merlin here)
