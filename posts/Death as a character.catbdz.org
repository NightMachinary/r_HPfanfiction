I quite like stories that feature Death as a character in some way shape or form, /this is entirely due to the Black Queen Series by Silently Watches/, and would appreciate any and all recommendations for stories that involve Death.


** linkffn(9911469) features /two/ Deaths, so there's that.

The story is borderline crack, without actually reaching the threshold. It's a bizzare mixture of crack, introspection, and seriousness that all comes together to be an overall enjoyable experience.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Another "Voldemort Meets Discworld's Death" story. Written for the Spacebattles forum, shouldn't be taken too seriously.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167]]) has the character Death raising a Harry Potter in a universe where history went just a bit different. It's very well done but relatively new.

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321]]) Harry is Death. It's very interesting in that it skirts the line between him being the character we know from the books and the fact that this is someone who is very much Death, an ancient being who's own universe is dead and gone. It's a pretty long fic that still regularly updates.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15768411/chapters/36679557]]) is another Harry Potter is Death, but it's short and complete.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.
