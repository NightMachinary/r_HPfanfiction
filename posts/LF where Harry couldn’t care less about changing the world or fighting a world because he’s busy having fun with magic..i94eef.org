Cerberus behind the door clearly guarding something? “Damn I want a magic dog.”

Crazed lunatic escapes Azkaban and was responsible for the death of his parents? “I want a Dementor cloak so I can be a master wizard.”

***** The people in your country probably didnt know a tsunami was coming, or they underestimated it. Everyone at that battle was either a seasoned fighter or a student who had spent the last year being cursed and tortured by death eaters while Hogwarts was taken over. I think they knew very well to pay attention. In the middle of a war zone. The only reason they would be tottering around staring the crucios and avada kedavras like toddlers at a ball park is if they got confunded or were in medical shock.

****** Actually, the alarms were blaring, most people were evacuating, everyone knew what a tsunami could do (as there have been several tsunamis before and the last one happened a few years earlier).. they simply didn't believe that it would affect them in particular (similar to how some people believe covid wont happen to them). They did it because they were curious and didn't think that drowning would happen to them. People sometimes don't see the severity/danger of something for them specifically.

In the world described, I could see a Harry that has somehow survived every skirmish by "sheer damn luck" not really fearing his actual death.. I think he could get a "I always survive somehow" mentality. Besides, in the original comment I got a vibe about this being more crack-fic than anything else.

I do understand your point though.. most people at that battle in a logical fic would understand what they are doing. Except, maybe, the younger kids that were protected by de DA and older students and didn't live the worse part. I can see some younger students believem how cool a battle would be so they can prove themselves real griffindors and become heroes as famous as Harry.

Maybe it's natural selection like how the dodo died because it didnt recognise humanity as a threat. That Creevey kid who died in the battle was a sure example. Still, if Harry Potter did that in any fic, crack or not, I would wonder if he hit his head.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
