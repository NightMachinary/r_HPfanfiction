Looking for fics involving Arithmancy in some way, no matter how small.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. If a multi-chapter would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

I do NOT want Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing though, but anything else is fine.

** A Cadmean Victory linkffn(11446957) is one I vaguely remember liking- it's due a reread obviously- that had at least a bit of arithmancy, Harry switched to both that and runes in 4th year

Well, if by arithmancy you mean math in any capacity- and it really is ill defined, some fics have it as an alternative to divination, others spell creation, but if you just want a math loving Harry fic, Calculation linkffn(7619993) is utterly fantastic and this one I do clearly remember, it's short, and quite possibly the best rendition of genius Harry that I've seen.

Hm... Come to think of it, Oma's Choice linkffn(5931066), one of the few semi decent Harry Potter/Star Gate crossovers, even if Harry becomes overpowered, has arithmancy as the spell, the wand motions and words are just the easy way to do it, if you fully memorize the arithmancy and manage to push out your magic without a wand which is hard without tons of practice or a cheat (like, say, some energy source from Star Gate injected nto Harry?) apparently you get wandless magic, and of course Harry manages it through some occulmancy bullshit. Overall not the most satisfying of overpowered Harry fics I admit, the challenges don't rise up to his level- not even in the Superman method (You can't be everywhere at once/save everyone at once- which I feel is a good method of dealing with over powered characters, have multiple things happen at once that they have to deal with) but, honestly all overpowered Harry fics are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine.

Harry even creates a few spells in that one.

None are Hermione/draco or Harry/Hermione, not even the last though it seems so for a time, it's one of the very few fics that make her a lesbian and make it semi- believable.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
