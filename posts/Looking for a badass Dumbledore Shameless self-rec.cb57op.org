** I advocate for this fic. Excellent writing and a good look at a flawed, but well-meaning Dumbledore.

**** When you do bring in Harry, try to avoid teen romance. If you're open to discussion about tropes, I can PM you on fanfiction.net.

But a repentant Grindelwald fits canon and seems interesting.

****** But seriously, I like this fic. I'd love to see how you take out Voldemort. Dumbledore decisively beat Grindelwald, but did not do the same to Voldemort.

** Thus far one of my favorite moments in this fic is the meeting with Slughorn. It's chilling to see the way Dumbledore handles that problem with the kid gloves off vs. in canon.

** I have been one of your subscribers because of your writing skill and style since i got hooked and binge read your dark Harry series, despite that not being my usual cup of tea. This premise however has me sold and I eagerly await each update.

Very much second this recommendation.

** Thank you for sharing! Reading so far the story looks amazing. I'll be more than happy to follow and see where you take things. I never quite manage to get enough out of Grindelwald-Dumbledore stories.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
