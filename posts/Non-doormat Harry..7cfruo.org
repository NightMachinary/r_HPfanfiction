Any stories over 60k+ words, and where Harry is in no way a doormat. He realizes that he can't stay with the Dursley's if he wants to live. He doesn't care about points, neither does he care about detentions assigned by essentialy a bully in a grown man's body(Snape) since he has a.) faced a Basilisk, Dementors, and many other things. Realistically he shouldn't even care about Snape b.) has magical hitler after him.

So he actually starts training himself, and ignores 'petty' things like Snape, points, Dumbledore's orders to live at the Dursleys, points, detention(if unfairly given, and even then he should question what the h*** was wrong with Mcgonnagal to send three or four kids into the forbidden forest with things more dangerous than a half giant), and other small pointless things.

Thanks, Warryn.


** These always have the potential to be great, but a lot of them just end up with harry being an asshole to everyone and spending more time talking about his independence and how everyone wronged him then actually doing anything.

Lemme see if I have anything like this in my favorites.

Ahh, linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) is very much this IIRC. There's some legitimate criticisms of this story and some parts had me a little apprehensive, but some of the scenes in this story have stuck with me for ages too for how good they were, and overall I remember it being a good read.

*** Yeah, Harry lashing out at everyone for every perceived wrong is a good way to make his seven years at Hogwarts hell. The smarter thing to do would be to put his head down and pretend to care while privately doing his own thing.

Most fics don't have any consequences for Harry being an asshole, either. Like, if Harry talked back to Lockhart, he wouldn't gape at him like an idiot, he would assign detention. If he talked shit to Snape, the man would either destroy him verbally or take so many points that Harry's own house would turn against him for ruining their chances at a House Cup. And if Harry made a scathing speech in the Great Hall, an owl wouldn't fly over to hand him $100% Galleons while Dumbledore twinkled disappointedly in the background. Dumbledore would either shut that shit down, or allow Harry to make a fool of himself, and the students would yell at him to shut up already, because they just want to eat in peace.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Tbh OP, this description fits best with the motherload of shitty Indy fics, but I can think of at least one that's awesome. Linkffn(Renegade Cause)

Top shelf stuff, that one.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** That's basically the hallmark of indy!Harry. But if you want a fic that does not include all the pitfalls of this trope, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), in which he was raised by Grangers and came into school already as the 'Lord Potter'. He was generally a nice guy, but would challenge others to honor duels if truly provoked. Dursleys were sent to prison very early on, and Harry came to an understanding with Snape at the start of the school. Apart from canon rehashes in Years 1 and 2, this fic is indeed very enjoyable.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
