Any fics out there where the wards on Privet Drive don't behave as they should. That is, they either don't protect Harry at all, for whatever reason. Or they protect him from absolutely everything, as in everything is a threat.

Particularly interested in(but not limited to) effects that don't benefit anyone. At all. Thanks in advance.


** Or other way around: did ANYBODY see in any fanfiction those wards actually do anything? The ONLY exception I know about is the chapter 2 of linkffn(The Warren by DarkKing666), but that's just a plot bunny, and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel]], where it is only alluded to. It doesn't have to be outright Tom himself, just some random Death Eater, but I would like somebody to be burnt into cinder there.

*** I know I've read fics where Death Eaters have specifically mentioned being unable to find where Harry was living because of the wards. And some where the house was destroyed after he left, which implies that they stopped it from happening before. And some where Remus couldn't get near the house because he's a dark creature. But I can't think of any where the wards take any proactive measures against Death Eaters.

*** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle Part VIII) has the wards teleport the MC to Privet Drive when the Dursleys get attacked by death eaters. They had little to do with protecting Harry, and more to do with protecting the owners of the house.

** Harry Potter and the Breaking of the Blood Wards: linkffn(13348041)

The Blood Wards work as such that they subtly turn away anything that would lead Harry, or anyone else, to breaking them - up to and including making Remus forget his Wolfsbane Potion so Pettigrew gets away and Sirius can't follow through on adopting Harry.\\
Dumbledore desperately /wanted/ to break them once he realized that the Dursleys were awful (read: 2 days after bringing Harry there), but couldn't anymore - he was as affected as anyone else.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

  The blood wards around Privet Drive have a disastrous effect on Harry Potter's magical development, leaving him unable to use a wand. But there are other kinds of magic, and other paths to power. Harry/many witches. No horcruxes.
