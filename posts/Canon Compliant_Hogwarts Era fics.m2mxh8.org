Hi friends, I am currently reading the Draco Trilogy by Casanda Clare. I am very much enjoying but also very much aware of the plagiarism, the fact lots of HP fans don't like her and also the increasing lengths of the books and my lack of ability to read so many words ahah. I'm looking for recommendations of canon compliant (ie nothing too wild or graphic), Hogwarts era fics. Could be marauders era but more interested in Harry's era. Perhaps what I am looking for other longish fics from the period between GoF and OotP, as I guess that was the only time pre-horcrux fics were written.
