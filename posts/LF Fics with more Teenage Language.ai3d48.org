There are so many fics out there with the characters talking like victorian nobles and acting like stuck up pricks, and 11 year olds being politicians, but are there any fics where the characters talk more like 90s Teenagers are supposed to?

"Fuck off Malfoy you absolute bellend" would be more accurate than the common "Get lost Slimy git" cliche.

*** If you really wanted an "accurate" portrayal if teenage insults in the 90's there would probably need to be a lot of gay slurs that I think most would be uncomfortable with.

**** As someone who was a teenager through most of the 90s, I can sadly agree with this. But in our defense we didn't realize it was a homosexual slur, we just thought "gay" was another word for "stupid". Doesn't make it better, we just didn't know it was wrong.

Yes I did grow up in a small midwest town. I think I knew of one guy who was gay while I was in high school and he was basically a social pariah.

** So many deleted posts in this thread.

I was not born or in school during the period of Harry Potter, but if it is anything like the late 1990s and early 2000s, then you would see a lot of homophobic slurs and blatant bashing. Granted, I am Australian and most of us were swearing before we hit reception. I called one of my teachers a faggot cunt when I was around eight.

Sadly, most fics these days will not put that type of language in because it may cause offence. A silly reason, but whatever.

***** Sorry bro but it's true. Why do you think Myrtle was so interested in him fourth year? ðŸ˜Ž

And I checked with ceddit, it's all off-topic stuff and joke replies that got removed. Seems like the mods are being more proactive about making sure people are actually answering OP's question.

*** True enough. Though the Muggleborn would be the worst for it. We got most of our insults off of TV.

Though what I'm after is more "Fuck off Malfoy you inbred cunt" as it's more how children would talk than the weird doubletalking political 11 year olds that you get in fanfiction, and more realistic than every use of the word Slimy in fics. The one swearword in canon was from Molly Weasley of all people.

**** when you put it like that, it kinda is.\\
Oddly enough, what put me off of it wasn't her cursing. It was the professors using less formal language (abbreviations, contractions, the occasional slang) then we generally see from them and it threw me out a lot. I know it's weird reason to get turned off by it, but...*shrugs*.\\
i'm going to see if i can find it again. I know it showed up in a couple of the more popular "Independent/Whatever Harry" C2s.\\
edit: thought for a second it might've been a Wand of Uru variant, but maybe not. Hrm.

#+begin_quote
  The Girl Who Lived is young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. A story of her mischief and troubles in her fourth year of Hogwarts. New tasks, humor, fem!Harry/Fleur. Not related to my other story, Tales of Three.
