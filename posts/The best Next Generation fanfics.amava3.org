** If you don't mind /Cursed Child/ characterizations, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/frombluetored/pseuds/frombluetored][frombluetored]] is a great Albus/Scorpius fic, with a decent amount of Harry/Ginny. Plenty of great family moments, and if you like kidfic, the 3rd story has plenty of kidfic. The second story in the series is my favorite; it has Harry as a Hogwarts professor.

Some older fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]] - Focuses on Teddy Lupin and his friends in their first year of Hogwarts. Good plot and exploration of conflict between the Houses.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1471195][gladly beyond]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tehtarik/pseuds/tehtarik][tehtarik]] - Melancholy Scorpius/Rose oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6019753/1/you-are-the-solace-of-impossibility][you are the solace of impossibility]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432396/1/basilisk-love-songs][basilisk love songs]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1166731/with-the-monsters][with the monsters]] - Molly Weasley II/Salazar Slytherin, with some time travel shenanigans.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][The Noticing of Lucy Weasley]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/436397/Realmer06][Realmer06]] - Oneshot; I think the author's summary says all you need to know: "Lucy Weasley was the most overlooked Weasley grandchild. Until she punched her cousin James in the face." The author has some other great next gen fics.

*** Seconding /The Noticing of Lucy Weasley./ That's one of the very best fanfics of the lot for Next Gen--and one of the only ones that I know that focuses on Lucy...which is kind of the point, I reckon.

*** Reading it's Tea Time really made me realize how most of the next gen characters have 0 characterization.We only really saw Albus,Scorpius,and a scene or two of James and Lily.

**** Yeah, there's not enough of James and Lily in /Cursed Child/ to get any idea of their personalities. There's a bit more of Rose - unfortunately, she's mostly used as a [no-homo] object of Scorpius' affections. I would've loved to see more of her developing and being her own character, but alas...

  Positive it is some Malfoy plot of revenge, Ron and Hermione forbid their only daughter from seeing Scorpius. But when Hugo, Albus and the rest of the cousins come forward with memories to the contrary, can they continue their defacing claims?

** OP, do you mean "Next Generation" as in Star Trek: The Next Generation, or the next generation of Potters after Harry? The way you capitalised "Next Generation" makes me think of the former!

I have some recommendations for both either way:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter and the Global Revelation]] by NoahPhantom is a fantastic story and is part 1/7 of an entire series! This is the "next generation of Potters" fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402371/1/The-Forever-Mage][The Forever Mage]] by Darth Marrs, it's also part of a series though you don't actually need to read the previous story to get what's going on. It *is* a harem fic so if those aren't your cup of tea then this won't be for you. This is the Star Trek fic.
