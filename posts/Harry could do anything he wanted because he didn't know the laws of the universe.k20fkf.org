In short:

He could do anything he wanted because he had amnesia and has been told by Mcgonagall that with magic he can accomplish everything.

Snape destroyed his memories in an Occlumency lesson

Harry lives a few days on the streets,

↑ was in the beginning of the story.

** For a moment, I thought that it was [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]], where Harry learns to do things because he doesn't know that the things in question are impossible, but the other details showed me that it was not the fic you were after.

Ironically, I've read the fic you want to find and I can't remember its title either!

** Not exactly what you describe, but linkffn(The Shock of it All by Fairywm) has Harry lose his memories by taking one of Snape's potions while in shock from being selected as a TriWizard champion, and spending about a week on the streets.

#+begin_quote
  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.
