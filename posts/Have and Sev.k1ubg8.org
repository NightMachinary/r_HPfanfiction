I remember Sev adopted an abuse Harry and Sirius didn't like it and acted like an ass to them


** That's like 90% of the Severitus genre. You'll need to be more specific!

*** I believe they was having dinner with the tonks(?) And Sirius snap because Harry called Sev dad or he found out that Sev is Harry godfather. I want to say that Remus was on Sev side

**** Again, I can think of a lot of fics that have this going on - Sirius freaking out when Harry calls Snape "dad" is kind of a Severitus classic chapter.

The one I can think of that has the most conflict between Harry&Sev and Sirius, with Remus broadly neutral if I remember right, is A Brother To Basilisks, where Sirius literally cannot accept anything about Harry's life. Even if that's not the one on your mind, I think you might like it based on what you're looking for.

  AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday.
