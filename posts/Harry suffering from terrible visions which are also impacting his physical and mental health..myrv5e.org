:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read a while ago but never finished it. I remember Ron and Mrs Weasley rescued Harry from the Dursleys. Harry was suffering from visions from Voldemort. The constant crucios from the visions were affecting Harry to the point that it seemed impossible he would be going back to Hogwarts. He also kept a dairy of his vision which he gave to Albus Dumbledore. Snape also tries to find a cure to help block the visions. Harry somehow ends up wrongfully in Azkaban and Percy is very helpful. I believe the is also a part where Harry helps a little girl escape the death eaters. I honestly have no idea if I am mixing up maybe 2 different fanfictions or not and I do not know why I stopped reading the fiction. Any help will be appreciated.


** I remember this fic. It might have been deleted, because it was on my favourite list, and now I cannot find it...
