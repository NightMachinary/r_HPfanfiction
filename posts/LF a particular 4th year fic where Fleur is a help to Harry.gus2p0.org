:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm pretty sure that Daphne is one of Harry's major supporters and somehow Fleur gets involved; honestly can't remember Hermione's position.

Daphne & Fleur talked about footprints on derierres (friendly rivalry for the most part) and at the end, Fleur brings a pair of her panties and lays them on the ground so that Daphne (I'm pretty sure) can step on them, thus a literal footprint. I also believe it's a Harry/Daphne pairing, but not 100% sure.

I would have read it on fanfiction.net, if it helps. Thanks!
