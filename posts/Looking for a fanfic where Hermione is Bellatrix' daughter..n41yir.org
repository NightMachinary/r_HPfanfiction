Is there any really good fanfictions where Bellatrix is Hermione's mother?


** Since you specified "really good" fanfics, no, I do not. have anything for you. If you broaden your request to include "bad" or "downright bizarre" fanfics, I know of some.

** Parseltongue Twins by blackholebabey on AO3 is a really good series where Bellatrix is Harry's and Hermione's mother.

  Bellatrix Lestrange was always a bit mad, but one particular event pushed her into insanity. Fifteen years later, Hermione must come to terms with a startling truth and become someone she never thought she'd be: a perfect Death Eater's daughter.

** I feel bad recommending this because it's a major spoiler for the fic but this is a really good fic!!!

Hermione doesn't get raised as Bellatrix's daughter, but her heritage gets revealed later on. I wish I could have recommended this to you a different way because it was the biggest twist in the fic and I'm sorry for taking it away from you!
