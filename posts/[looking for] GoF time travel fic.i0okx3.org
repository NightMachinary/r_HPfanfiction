I'm curious to see if there's a fic of Year 4 time travel in which:

Harry Potter either dies or fails in a task which result him becoming squip. Which causes Voidemort to raise to power unchallenged. Someone decides to take action and go back in time and try to save Harry Potter and the Wizarding world from Voidemort.

Romance is optional. if there is, then harry/Female character or multi.
