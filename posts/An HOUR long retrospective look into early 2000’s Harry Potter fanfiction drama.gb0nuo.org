In [[https://youtu.be/K_DZd78WLQY][this video]] by Eldena Doubleca5t on Youtube, he goes into crazy detail about the earliest days of the Harry Potter fanfiction community and a con artist that fooled the fandom.

And a concerning fact; a household author's name is mentioned ALOT. /cough cough Cassandra Claire/

Who knew her origins reign from this very community! (Though she wasn't the best writer apparently, with plagiarism scandals galore)

(Hope this is allowed to be posted?)


** I read her fanfictions. They're terrible. Nicely written, but terrible.

*** They are truly an embodiment of everything bad in fanfiction. They read almost as badly as Cursed Child in my opinion.

** I've been reading fanfiction since before Order of the Phoenix, Cassandra Claire wrote the very first one I ever read and at the time my mind was blown. I didn't know what fanfiction was and I was led to believe that it was a leaked copy of OotP. I only figured out that it wasn't like 5 or 6 chapters in. I thought it was amazing at the time. I tried to reread the draco ones a few years abo and couldn't get even half way through before I gave it up. It doesn't hold up well.

Edit, just watching that video now, damn I was around, but as a 14ish year old didn't give a shit, when some of this stuff was going down. I remember when one of the only active forums to find Harry Potter fanfiction was on fiction alley. I also remember eagerly awaiting updates for After the End, a H/G fic from two of the authors mentioned in that video, the ones who started Sugar Quill. This is all making me feel old.

** I was a Gryffindor Tower lurker in those days and I had nooo idea all this was happening. I remember being incredibly sad about how and not understanding why it had closed down but this video finally explained why! I had noidea all this was going on... and I'm glad I didn't! I was a 14yo male, getting swept up in middle-aged women drama would've sucked!

The video is really well presented too. I was hooked and watched it all in one sitting last night. 10/10, would recommend if you were even tangentially in the fandom at the time.

** Hmm. Maybe I should get me some... additional... Reddit accounts. Fanfic writer is as fanfic writer does.

On a different note, does anyone get the vibe that the person mentioned in the video was highly inspired by Lochart and Skeeter? Perhaps with a splash of Umbridge? Must be a real fan, eh?

** "Okay, I'll watch it until the drama flashbacks make me stop."

1:49 "The whale-tail is considered legitimate fashion choice."

Pop culture defeated me before the drama did.

** I watched this! It was a really good video and an interesting dive into fandom history that I didn't know about. Shame it's only the second video of the style on that channel, I really liked the way it was done.
