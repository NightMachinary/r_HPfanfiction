This bugs me. Not as bad as using Mugwump as a serious title, but enough to make me want to rename the ICW. I do like the sound of the acronym though, and it has a nice weight of connotation by now in fanon, so I'd like to keep that if possible. I have a Sorcerers Guild already, which overlaps enough with what I have the ICW doing that I could just swap them out, and I might do that. But I just thought I'd throw this out there and see if anyone has a better brainstorm than me. (I can just remove "international" from the title of the Statute, so no problem there.)

*** The UN is a new body, although it did take over some parts of the League of Nations - the ITU and UPU, both of which pre-date the League anyway. The UN was founded in either 1942 (first declaration and agreement under that name by the Allied powers) or 1945 (charter entered into force), the League was wound up in 1946.

Maybe WWC world wizarding confederation. Or WCW?

**** Maybe something like /la ConfÃ©dÃ©ration des Mages du Monde/ (CMM)? (If someone who actual knows French can double-check that to make sure it's correct, that would be great ðŸ˜€.) All those words existed in French well before the canonical ICW was founded. Also it was apparently canonically founded in France, so French makes sense.

** What's the problem with the word originating in the Wizarding World, and only later trickling down into the Muggle world, making it appear from /our/ end as though it was coined later than it actually was? It's no different from various other advancements reached by the Wizarding World before the Muggle one.

****** The lack of influence. If you want to talk linguistics in regard to magic. Wizards are literally wise men. Long before muggles were educated wizards would've been. If we accept that the wizarding world existed and hid itself away you also have to recognize that they had an enormous impact on muggle culture.

******* Ah, yes, quite so, but /before/ the Statute. And the Statute was enacted 98 years before "international" first appeared in muggle English, meaning that if it did come from wizarding influence it would have had to remain dormant for almost a century before surfacing. That strains credulity in my mind.

********* If "international" was a neologism by wizards and the International Statute of Secrecy and the ICW were the first uses of it, and there was sufficient linguistic intercourse for it to migrate to muggle usage, it would have been recorded in muggle use closer to 1692, not 1780. That's all that bugs me.

** The muggle OED that you looked it up in doesn't have access to an archive of magical publications so is unaware of this earlier use. Or for all we know the official name of the Confederation is "Confoederatio Internationalis Incantatorium". Internationalis first appears in Latin in the 16th century.

Personally, however, I go with JKR's etymological research being about as thorough as her demographic and economics research :-)

As for mugwump being a silly title - if you want silly real titles just look at the British Parliament or at churches. Black Rod is a real job. As is Archimandrite. The real reason that Mugwump doesn't work is that it is a modern Americanism.
