:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically in the start Harry Potter is a child, living with the Dursley's, and is immortal and I forgot if it was a one shot or not but anyway his immortality was where he actually died but healed and came back and it was really well written and if i remember one of the deaths correctly it had him being pushed by Dudley down the stairs and him breaking his neck or maybe cracking his skull open. Yeah it was a really good fanfic I just really wish I remembered the title.


** Hhh I have a feeling this is not the story you are looking for because I don't remember Dudley having a part in harry's demise(s) but this thing is as phenomenal as cursed, I felt real pain reading it, a constant kick in the guts [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]
