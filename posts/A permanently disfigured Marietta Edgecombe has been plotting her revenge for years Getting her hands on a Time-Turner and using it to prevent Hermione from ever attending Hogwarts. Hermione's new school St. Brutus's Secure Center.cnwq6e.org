** "Granger! Visitor."

The gruff 'guard' (actually a thug working out a community service sentence that his criminal defense attorney had worked out to plead down his assault charges) hauled the frizzy-haired brunette teenager off her seat with a painful grip on her wrist. She was roughly hauled through the hallways, protesting in a feeble voice all the while, before she was roughly slung in a chair.

In front of the chair was a booth with a large glass screen. A small telephone was set into the booth, which connected to another phone on the other side.

It was, not coincidentally, very similar to the setup a prisoner in a high-security jail might expect to see when meeting with a visitor from outside.

Seated on the other side of the room, across the glass, was an unfamiliar woman.

Trembling, the 'student' raised the phone on her side to a mouth burdened with overly large teeth. Across from her, the stranger did the same.

"Hello, Hermione," the woman smiled unpleasantly. "My, my. This is my first time actually seeing the setup here. Not very welcoming, is it? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trapped in a horrible, abusive environment, likely for the rest of your life. After all, Incurably Criminal Girls can't be allowed to roam free in civilized society, can they?"

The young girl let out a retching sob. "Wh-why? Why am I here?"

"Because you're a criminal, of course," reported the woman. "You're /vengeful,/ with no sense of proportional response, nor accountability for your actions. That's why this is exactly what you deserve, Miss Granger." The cruel smile on the woman's face widened. "Or should I say, /Miss Edgecombe?"/

"Y-you're her. You're the real Hermione." The realization dawned on the face of the prisoner. "What is this? What have you done?"

"You haven't figured it out?" laughed Hermione Granger, wearing the appearance of a random woman she'd lifted a few hairs off, mere hours prior. "But you've been here for /months,/ Marietta! Surely you should have realized it by now. Then again, I suppose you were never all that bright." She leaned back in her chair. "Let me spell it out for you.

"If you'd been a better student, you might have been aware that you can't actually change time," Hermione began, idly inspecting her borrowed nails. "There was never a chance that you would have prevented me from going to Hogwarts. There's only /one/ timeline, only /one/ outcome. But of course, that begs the question: what stopped you? You, the future Marietta Edgecombe, with all the benefit of a full - if not particularly fully embraced - magical education, all the knowledge of the future? How could you be stopped?"

She gestured at herself. "By someone with those same advantages, but rather more cleverness. Ironic that I was Sorted into Gryffindor where I'd have made an excellent Ravenclaw, while you were put into Ravenclaw... but you're really just a particularly lackluster Slytherin."

"I don't understand," pleaded Marietta Edgecombe, age 27, trapped in the body of Hermione Granger, age 11. "How could you have known?"

"Time travel doesn't care about linear knowledge," Hermione lectured. "When you started asking about my childhood, it raised some concerns in the people you called. I'll be a candidate for Minister for Magic soon enough, you know. Many of my records are subject to certain protections, to prevent some kind of scandal being manufactured, or the possibility that I tried to hide some secret. I've been aware of the dangers of yellow journalism from a young age, you see. So I made a few preparations. When you finally got your hands on a Time Turner - another instrument subject to Ministry monitoring, by the by - I acted on them. I got back to this time a full month before you did. I made my preparations. The moment you appeared in this timeline, I Stunned you, slipped you some Polyjuice Potion with my hair in it, and cast a Confundus Charm on you. Your own preparations served quite well to frame 'Hermione Granger' for being a criminal nutcase, even at so young an age, though your erratic behavior under the Confundus clinched the 'Insane' part. Of course, I had to manage a few tricky Memory Charms on everyone from my parents to the school officials to prevent this from coming back to haunt the past version of myself. You can marvel at my brilliance, if you like. I won't stop you."

The bitter woman in the body of a distressed young girl struck the glass with her fist. "You can't keep me here, you hag! Polyjuice wears off quick enough. And when it does, I'll tell everyone. You'll never live this down."

"Oh, but I have the most /terrible/ news," Hermione said, sympathetically. "It seems that somehow, someone has gone through the timeline and replaced all your anti-psychotic medication with an experimental new treatment. It's Polyjuice Potion, in case you hadn't guessed. It's administered daily, so you needn't worry. And half the inmates here - sorry, /students/ - have some insane story about aliens and demons making them do the things they do. Yours won't particularly stand out. It will confirm that your stay should be indefinite, though... not that it won't be, anyway. You see, someone who looks /exactly/ like Hermione Granger's mother will shortly come to disown you and legally emancipate you from her family. Very common for the girls here, or so I'm told. The Grangers won't ever remember doing such a thing, and of course they'll have the real Hermione with them, so the paperwork will just get... lost somewhere along the line. You'll be in limbo. A legal nonentity. Everyone who needs to think the proper paperwork needed to keep you here has been filed will know it has been. So you'll spend your life here, until you're moved to a similar, less friendly facility after you turn 18."

She glanced around the hostile, harsh room, absent of decoration or any indication of comfort. "I don't know how something could be /less/ friendly than this, but I'm sure they manage somehow."

Marietta's shoulders were shaking, as she was wracked with full-body sobs. "You can't. Please. You can't do this to me."

"I just used your plans, Marietta," Hermione replied sorrowfully. "You did this to yourself. And after you tried to do something this horrible to an 11 year old girl, I can't trust you again. Maybe this place really will be good for you. Maybe you can change in time. I've sabotaged all your parole hearings from now until 25 years from now. If you've genuinely changed by then, I'll let you out, shortly after you used the Time Turner in the future. Try to make use of the help."

Hermione moved to place the phone on the receiver to hang up, but hesitated. "Then again, you should really be thanking me," she said, staring at the image of her past self in complete misery. "I've given you what you wanted. Look at your reflection, Marietta. No scars."

The woman hung up the phone and stood, watching as the orderlies dragged the crying girl away. "All this over a case of acne," she sighed. "I should see how Eloise is doing sometime. I wonder if she wouldn't mind catching dinner with Ron and I?"

Book 3, she enables her cat to attack Ron's rat.

Book 4, she was in the right.

Book 5, she scarred Marietta, not as a preventative measure, but as a vindictive one. She didn't even know about the pimples until she saw herself in a mirror.

Book 6, she confunded McLaggen and attacked Ron. While Malfoy should have been expelled and sent to prison for his various misdeeds in that book, Hermione was not that far behind.

Book 7, nothing again, although her logic and deduction skills took a hit.

It left scars behind, but the scars were the end result of her pimples popping, so since the magic caused the pimples, but not the scarring, it is possible to heal.

**************** They weren't healed, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been healed. It could be a lack of knowledge on Edgecombe's part, or just the fact that she didn't try that hard while in school(with Voldemort being on the rise, I doubt it was the first thing on her mind), or maybe after the war it seemed less important. We don't know. What we can be fairly certain of is that it wasn't caused by dark magic, and that it's canonically stated that it's injuries caused by dark magic that are difficult to heal. Taking all this into account says that it's highly likely that it's healable, but it's also likely that after everything that happened with Voldemort, she just doesn't care that much about some minor scarring compared to what happened to a lot of people.

Tl;dr it's only as permanent as Marietta wants it to be most likely. Permanent by choice basically.

Not a school nurse. Sure she might get the odd case from the odd spell, but she's not working in a hospital that caters to tens of thousands(the public), and has at least hundreds of patients at a time with the most exotic, and dark curses coming through their doors(whether by DE, adventuring, or just pushing the boundry of magic).
