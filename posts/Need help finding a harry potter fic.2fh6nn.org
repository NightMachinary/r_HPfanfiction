its an old series. i believe its a trilogy, not sure. Harry travels to another dimension in the second part of the trilogy and in this: - Lily is alive and married to snape after voldemort spared her - She teaches at hogwarts - Neville is the boy who lived - Harry accidentally kills lily with an expelliarmus in a cave before she can kill neville - Hermione never went to hogwarts - Harry/Katie also happens. not actual ship though - Harry is an AU and has to find his way back home to his original universe - I believe harry also has a sister The trilogy starts off as Harry Hermione, but ends as Harry Ginny

Any help would be appreciated thanks.

** I always hear about how great that series is, but I can't force myself to commit to reading 1.3 million words. Especially not when it was written entirely (well, all but maybe a dozen chapters, and probably not even that many) between GoF and OotP.

**** See? I've heard pretty loud and clear the second book was the best.

**** Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent was the first fanfic I read. When I 'found' it, it was on a p2p sharing service a month or two before J.K. Rowling released the name of book 5, and I thought it was a leak. It took me a while to find Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions (the second book in the alternate dimension referenced in OP, when I read it, I hated it. Subsequent readings (I probably read the trilogy a half dozen times before I found any more fanfictions) upped my appreciation of the second instalment greatly. It is now my favourite of the trilogy.
