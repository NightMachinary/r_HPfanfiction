** - *Renegade* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6054788/1991Kira][1991Kira]]

They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

Aya Potter and The Dark Lord By: [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/A_Perverted_Romance_Addict/pseuds/A_Perverted_Romance_Addict][A_Perverted_Romance_Addict]]

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Aya Potter is an orphan, living a simple and happy life at the Dursleys, but a letter before her eleventh birthday brings about many changes. For one, she finds out she is a witch, and a famous one at that. She is also called the Girl-Who-Lived by the wizarding populace, because allegedly she defeated a Dark Lord when she was just an infant.\\
  Now at Hogwarts, she tries her best to fade into the background and not get into any troubles. Apparently, that is not possible, because no matter how hard she tries to stay out of troubles, somehow she ends up in sticky situations anyway.

- *Heartless Harry* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5441822/ValwithV][ValwithV]]

When Petunia had to allow her hated nephew into her home, she'd expected troubles to arise sooner or later. Nothing though could have prepared her for the reality of what was to come. The boy sleeping under her roof, eating her food, wasting her money, was no normal child, oh no. It was an evil little demon hiding beneath innocent features. My take on psychopath/sociopath!Harry.
