** A Ron-centric noir fic? Interesting. Some random thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  The men behind him readied themselves as he started to count. When he reached three, a violet glow emanated from Collins' wand.
#+end_quote

So, no witches on his squad? Or anywhere among the aurors, for that matter?

#+begin_quote
  "Are you sure you want to know? 'Cause once you do, there's no going back.
#+end_quote

Actually, for wizards, there is, in fact, "going back". It's called "Memory Charms".

#+begin_quote
  "Remember sixth year Ron? I suspected Malfoy too. Think back on what he did."

  Ron calmed down after he heard that. Harry had been right then. They didn't have proof, they didn't act. As a result, Death Eaters stormed the castle. If it wasn't for that Felix Felicis...
#+end_quote

Ron, as a trained auror, might also remember that it wasn't the first time Harry was convinced Draco and/or Snape were up to something --- and it turned out that he wasn't.

#+begin_quote
  "Perhaps. But I did find something," Harry said. "Remember how Riddle got a job at Borgin and Burkes? Well, it turns out he filed employment applications to Flourish and Blott's, Ollivander's, even signed up for Auror Academy." [etc.]
#+end_quote

This is rather thin, IMO. There isn't that much money to be made in a wizarding war, because unlike Muggle warfare, there isn't expensive equipment to manufacture and sell, and because wizard conflicts easily degenerate into chaotic guerrilla warfare (because everybody is always armed, can teleport, and flying equipment is man-portable). Worse yet, a plan that relies on manipulating a certified genius into starting a war (as opposed to uncovering the conspiracy or starting the war, or just deciding that things have gotten too hot in Britain, and he can spend the next century on a beach in Miami) is cartoonishly overcomplicated.

** By about the third or so paragraph, I found myself skimming, because the action, though ostensibly quick, didn't go anywhere. I skimmed hard. Then, by the time Harry wakes up from the stunner, I found myself flat out unable to continue. The pacing is weird, but the premise comes right out of left field, and is a bit too random. I can't sympathise with any of the characters, and their behaviour is way too out of what I'd expect from them to be believe-able. I pretty much stopped reading after the point where you mention something about a warming charm. I mentally checked out.

Aside from that, please make sure to check the spelling and grammar issues before posting publicly. Loose means that something isn't tight. Lose is the present tense of lost. Waive means to give up. Wave means to move something back and forth. These are just two of the many errors scattered throughout the fic, making it not only distracting, but even more difficult to read through.
