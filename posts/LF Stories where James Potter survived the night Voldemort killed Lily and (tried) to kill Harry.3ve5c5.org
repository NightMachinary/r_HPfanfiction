Becoming the youngest Minister of Magic ever to be appointed, he became obsessed with finding the Dark Lord and avenging the death of his wife. Unfortunately, his pursuits are about to lead him straight back to the daughter he's neglected for fourteen years. Semi-AU. DM/femHP.

**** Need I remind you that we are talking about fanfiction around a boy wizard. Who goes to a magical school and uses an owl for communication.

The point of fanfiction is to read stuff that you enjoy, it could be completely bonkers. To mold an already amazing world to tell new stories. It doesn't have to be realistic or deep.

***** First one needs to suspend belief that Riddle would only stun and not kill James (Riddle was psychotic, not completely stupid). Then watch as the marauders single-handily kill off the Death Eaters, some how knowing where they all are, ignoring all magical wards there might be in place. It wasn't worth the read, the concept to the execution was riddled with holes.

It was too unbelievable even in the realm of the fictional story it was taking place in. To think that those four were just hiding all of their talent, that they could have saved the day at anytime, yet they come off as worse than those they were hunting.

I don't have to like all fanfiction, some fiction is just crap in my opinion and that story was exactly that in my opinion.

****** I think you are just here for trolling. Anyway, have you read the title of OP's post? He is not asking for quality content, he just wants a story where James survives.

And you can label anything as crap in your opinion. This is not about your opinion, it's about OP's opinion. I just linked the fic here and OP can judge it himself.

#+begin_quote
  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
