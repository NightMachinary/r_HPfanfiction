Apparently this story was finished somewhere else and never updated on ff.net, but I can't find it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine]]


** I'm in the same boat. I just finished through chapter 34 yesterday and was pissed that I couldn't find the end anywhere.

** The author used to have a pretty active LiveJournal account, but I don't know what its status is. (It was invite-only at the time and I fell off the access list awhile back.) According to this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/56/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][update of Backward with Purpose]], she also has a Facebook identity for her writing persona. I'd start there and see.

*** I checked livejournal after finishing it, but the account was deleted. Thanks though.
