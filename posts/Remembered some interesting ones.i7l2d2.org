There's a couple of nice stories where Harry inherits big grand magic rings of ancient and noble houses. I'm trying to find where these lead to him being sorted into a brand new house. I remember there being one of house peeves, and I think one of house pevrell? Or maybe house of the founders? There might also be one of house Merlin... honestly I can't remember where to find any of these
