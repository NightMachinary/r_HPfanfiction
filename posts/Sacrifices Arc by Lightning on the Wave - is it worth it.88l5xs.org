As we all know this series is hella long. I remember a couple of years ago I read this fic half way into 3rd year before I dropped it because it was boring, repetitive, and I wanted to read other stuff. But recently I've been thinking about rereading it because it had loads of interesting plot points that I hadn't seen done before but I'm not sure how much of the "one step forward, two steps back" I can take when it comes to Harry's (lack of) development. So my question is: Is the story good enough for me to risk my sanity on Snape and Draco whining about Harry being used?


** There is a lot of shit that is wrong with the story: the H/D relationship, Harry's flip-floppy (un)development, the almost comical levels of abuse, the sometimes baffling and/or simplistic characterization.

The central role of the Malfoys and Snape is an unfortunate part of the story. Snape and Narcissa get a few shining moments of their own, at least. Not going to lie, almost all scenes involving Draco and Lucius left a bad taste in my mouth.

But there is a lot a more that I found simply brilliant. How /vibrant/ the wizarding world is. The rich history. Pureblood customs. Awesome fight scenes. Awe-inspiring feats of magic. Organic /Tension/ out the ass. Drama that will make you go "OH NO SHE DIDN'T".

Secondary characters. Some of them made such an impression, they are still burned into my mind after years of last reading - like the lesbian dark witch who killed things with fire, Indigena Yaxley with giant rock eating plants, Evan Rosier (10/10 villain), Jing-xi the chinese Light Lady. I could probably name a few dozen more of them.

Above all that, beyond the content of the story, is the writing style; this is what made this story epic. It features an almost indescribable tone, something like a /solemn lyricism/, that I haven't quite read anywhere else - I even read some of the author's original works and they seemed bland compared to Sacrifices. The fucking thing is like crack, if I read a couple pages, a couple weeks later I would be finishing another re-read (I think I've read it like... 6 times now?). There were days were I spent 15-16 hours reading chapters.

As to how to read it: Start at fourth year -- this is what I did. The shit hits the fan almost immediately, there are radical changes throughout, Harry's character gets a lot more bearable. The 4th and 5th books are the septology's best, I feel.

Is it worth it? Fuck yes.

** I would recommend it just for the historical value and as an example of how far the fandom has progressed. Back in the day it was really, really popular and considered one of the best fics. It's not THAT bad to be honest. It has some very interesting plot elements and devices that weren't that often used back then, and some that aren't even used right now.

I still think it's a decent fanfiction read. Definitely in the top 100 of fics, but by modern standards it's very cliched. (Yes, there was a time when cliches were not cliches at all :D )

The H/D aspect is irrelevant. Don't even bother with it. The story doesn't revolve around it, so I wouldn't call it slash.

** I will always recommend this series as a testament to what /can/ be done.

I will agree with the other commenters - it has aged, and is full of what we now assume as bad tropes and cliches to be avoided. However, as [[/u/T0lias]] said, everything is *vibrant* and sticks out. I know each of the characters they mention, and I remember exactly what I liked about them. (Rosier in this fic just gives me the /chills/. He's incredible.)

The depth the author goes into magical politics, Pureblood rituals, and the depths of Light and Dark magic polarizes the world, but also gives it life. I truly feel this is one of the richest magical worlds I have read, despite the tropes we now see it as.

I emphatically agree. Take a week off of work and read it, even (only halfway joking here!). I have pulled all-nighters reading this series and I will do it again. I reread it every year, actually. Just jump right in and do it, though I do think you should start at the beginning, not fourth year. The journey is well worth it.

** The author didn't know the difference between 'insure' and 'ensure'. You would think this is a small issue, easy to overlook, but eventually you start flinching every time you read about how Harry wants to insure something happens. Otherwise, it's not bad. It has a lot of cliché tropes and things, as it's a product of its time, but it is gripping. Just ensure (lol) you can keep track of many sideplots at a time if you do dive in. It gets convoluted.

******* Don't blame you tbh. As I said on my other post, a lot of elements of this story just plain suck. In addition, books 1-3 are, at best, mediocre. Beginning with book 4, however, there is more than enough awesomeness to overcome the suckness.

***** When the author says eventual, they mean eventual. I don't think it even becomes a romantic interest until maybe fifth year? I haven't done my yearly re-read yet so I'm not quite sure of the timing. Besides that, Lightning on the Wave does a really good job of keeping things relatively "clean". It's not a smut story by any stretch of the imagination.
