Hiya, I am kinda feeling like I've read everything that is up to my standard and now I'm constantly reading stuff that just isn't that great, so I figured I'd come ask for recs. A good fan fiction that I will stick with has to have a few things;

-spelling, grammar and punctuation as good as a published book. Occasional typos I can handle if I must. -interesting plots that have no weird rapey vibes (see: marriage law, must fuck to survive, sex with/involving minors at all, teacher/student relationships) -I do love me a strong Hermione but I will read fics without her -Crossovers are fine (but if I haven't read or seen the other one I won't read it usually) -Not really into smut but will happily scroll past it and continue reading as long as that not all the fix is about - absolutely must be complete!! Not abandoned or wip.

I'll read most any pairing, as long as the premise sounds believable and well written. I love live love Stages of Hope, to give you an idea of the quality of writing I enjoy reading. Please just dump as many fics like that as you have! I am getting desperate for reading material :( Tia!


** linkffn(7539141)

A tense mystery-drama story, probably the only fic with both zombies and politicking that could be decent. I think it's finished but I only just began it and can't remember.

However, for more, I would suggest looking at [[http://www.darklordpotter.net][www.darklordpotter.net]] and its expansive library. The people there can be snobby, but it usually means you only get the best, and many of the books there are similar to Stages of Hope. It's far easier to find the gems that way. Check out the scryer as well, for more specific fic recommendations [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle; Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below; Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment; Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above) are the gold standard to which fics measure up (IMHO). There is nothing else like them in the entire fandom, in terms of writing quality, skilfully developed plotlines, and characterisation. The first book is a bit rough compared to the next three, but they are all *amazing*. I HIGHLY recommend them.

** You into canon-compliant one-shots set post-Hogwarts?

I'm thinking of my own fic... I can't find anything in the rules against self-promotion, but let me know if this is a major no-no on here...

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could]])

This is my favourite Harry/Gabrielle -and Hermione but it's complicated- fic and its the only time I've ever been able to tolerate a god like Harry along with guns. Lots of world building in this one and a unique take on horcruxes that I've never seen used elsewhere. If nothing else the first chapter is more intense than any first chapter had a right to be.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10290899/1/Keep-This-Wolf]])

This is hands down my favourite Harry/Draco slash, featuring a werewolf Harry and a unspeakable Malfoy. Only one sex scene near the end with lots of build up without being sappy. Features my favourite Umbridge death in fanon.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951061/chapters/1859733]])

This is my favourite smut fic and my favourite ménage et Trio. It's fun and everyone acts like actual characters - not mustache twirling villains- but your going to experience a love-hate relationship with EVERYONE.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4703843/1/That-Old-House]])

This is a really cute slice of life Harry/Hermione fic. No bashing, No explicit sex, believable children and a nice conclusion. My only complaint are the wild Deus ex Machina that they pull out of nowhere at the end of the book, the fact that the first couple dozen chapters are quite short and that it has a sequel.

All of these are long, completed and I had a great time reading them.

P.s. I've just now become reaquainted with that awful feeling when you can't find the name of a fic you loved. If anyone can remember the name of a post Hogwarts, epilogue compliant, Harry/Hermione story that features the couple deciding not to pursue a relationship because they're already married to their respective canon couple, I would greatly appreciate it.

P.P.s There's also a scene later on where Ginny runs away to be head auror in paris but I can't remember very many other details.

  DH spoilers. Hermione's wandering train of thought as she washes the dishes. 'Ron will kill me if he sees me cleaning without a wand. You're a witch, act like it! he'd say. He doesn't understand that I need the distraction...' HHr.
