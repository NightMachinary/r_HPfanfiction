** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6365342/1/Unintended-Consequences][Unintended Consequences]] is a really good one. Basically Ron and Hermoine leave Harry one night after an argument while looking for horcruxes so he finds Ginny at Hogwarts and they end up going on the hunt themselves. It's hard to impress how good of a story this is without giving away any spoilers but I thought it was great.

*** I second this recommendation. Pretty much all of the author's stories are fantastic.

** [[http://thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=859&index=1][Harry Potter and the Twist of Time]] is pretty good. It's a bit on the adult side, but not really smutty.
