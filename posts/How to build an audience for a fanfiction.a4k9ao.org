** Don't expect a ton of reviews and favourites at first. I was nearly ten chapters in before it built any traction. So don't give up and continue writing.

Write a good summary and specify if it's AU or canon-compliant, tag the primary and secondary characters and any established romantic pairs if any.

Especially important is to update often and consistently. Have a schedule. I find updating on Sunday mornings working very well for me. Or you can pick a good time slot like Tuesdays or Thursdays and update on the dot, at least at first. So people, especially guest readers will come to expect your update on a certain time and come looking for your fic.

You can cross-post on AO3 too, because some stories bizarrely work really well on one website but not on the other.

One little tip I realized only later, is to make your story look professionally edited. If it's a multi-chapter fic, give each chapter a name and number, differentiate each scenes with a line-break and refrain from A/N at the beginning of each chapter (A/N at the beginning of first chapter is completely fine as you can give a detailed summary to attract more potential readers).

Reply to every review, even if it was just a single word, as this encourages repeat reviewing.

Also, never hold chapters for hostage saying you won't post without a certain number of follows or reviews. You're writing because you like it and want to share it with others. If you get some reviews along the way, then hey that's a sweet treat, but not a complete necessity.

** Write good stuff. Without that, you're pretty much sunk. Seek to be as professional in quality as you can manage.

Be an avid reviewer on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. As an author, I've often clicked on reviewers' links (particularly those who offer substantive, useful reviews) and see whether they've written something I might want to read. Authors often write some of the best reviews, as they know what they themselves would like to see, and I've been a reader of fanfiction for longer than I've been a writer. When popular authors start linking your stories, you'll get an outsized knock-on effect in terms of exposure.

Join a writing group or two. DLP works for some. I got a ton of help from the fellow writers (jbern, nonjon, BajaB, CheddarTrek, Voice of the Nephilim, Draco664, Heather Sinclair, etc.) at AFC. Another is the Teachers Lounge on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. When possible, do reciprocative reading and reviewing of others' work in your group. Build your footprint, increase your cross section.

Participate in writing contests. People who check out contest pieces may check out your other pieces you've written. And if you win, so much the better for your exposure.

Manage your public persona. Be gracious and calm in public and, when possible, don't be a prima donna. If people think you're an inveterate douchebag, most won't read your stuff no matter how great you think it might be.

** Start with a good, honest summary. Few will check out an “I suck at summaries, just read it” fic. Same goes for a good title.

Make sure to tag your main characters, any romances, and the genre so that the fic will show up for someone looking for new work of a certain sort.

Update regularly. Somewhere between once a week and every other day will give you the best chance to be seen regularly so that eventually someone moderately curious will click.

Expect to start slow. A few reviews and follows for the first few chapters may multiply exponentially by later chapters. So don't give up early, especially as you have so much already written.

Happy posting!

** Agree with what everyone says here, but would also say create a Tumblr. There's a really intense fanfic community there and good author engagement with readers can go a long way.

*** How to get into that part of Tumblr? The only place I found entertaining was the Bellamione shitpost community (even though I don't ship it). Everything else felt like:

- "my pairing is better than yours" circlejerks (no matter which pairing, this is cringeworthy)

- AUs where everyone is black (as opposed to a representative depiction of Britain in the 90s)

- A deluge of slash

- Death Eater whitewashing

- Canon/Weasley pairings

I mean, I made a blog there supposedly dedicated to Harry Potter, but somehow I ended up with mostly Mass Effect stuff on my dash because the quality of the content was lightyears ahead. People keep creating amazing art for that fandom, while HP felt like a bunch of recycled GIF-sets and drawings of Black Hermione. I haven't found a single decent blog for any of the popular f/m Harry ships.

**** I mean, you curate who you follow, I'm sorry you didn't find the right people for you.

Personally I have found it invaluable for interacting with my readers to the point they have created fanart for my OC. I also like canon pairings and don't mind seeing pairings I don't necessarily agree with.

Obviously. I have some experience with Tumblr, but I really didn't find a single HP blog for the pairings I am interested in (I had no issues with the same in the ME fandom).

Most either randomly throw Malfoy into everything or go on huge tangents to state why pairing X is the OTP and everything else is shite.

** Ditto on pretty much all the advice people are giving here. I would add that there are often requests posted on this subreddit (people looking for specific kinds of stories), and it's acceptable to share your own fic in those cases when it applies as long as you're honest about the fact that it's your own story.

** First off, as I believe several others have already mentioned here: don't expect tons of followers, favorites and reviews right off the bat. Usually, most people won't even bother clicking on a story that has less than 50,000 words (unless it is a one-shot or two-shot fic, of course) as they realize they will most likely get stuck waiting for new chapters to be released. Most would rather wait until your story has accumulated some chapters before they begin reading.

​

Second, have a clear schedule (I suck at this). Upload chapters either weekly, bi-weekly or monthly (last one usually only works if your chapters are lengthy and take a while to read). People hate having to guess when the next chapter is coming out, and prefer knowing in advance when to expect the next piece of content. This also makes life easier for guest readers who don't have an account.

​

Third, try to make your story look and read as professionally as possible. Don't get me wrong, grammar mistakes are perfectly acceptable, as long as there is not an overwhelming majority of them. Formatting your story to look as clean and organized as possible also helps.

​

Fourth, have a clear plan and write a good story. I know that might sound like the most obvious tip ever, but really, you'd be surprised at the amount of recycled garbage there is out there. Even most of my own stories fall into this particular pitfall. Try to write something that sets your story apart from everyone else's. Something that people maybe haven't read a thousand times already.

** Make a recommendation post for it on this sub; whenever you see a Request thread here that fits the story, don't be afraid to cite it. If you're feeling brave, make a thread for it on /DLP/, but be warned that some of the reviewers there are orthodox or perfectionist to the point of bullying.

Getting your fic indexed on TVtropes is another good way to attract new readers, but you need to make sure the page is well-maintained.

** Honestly I don't think there's a magic formula. If there is, I haven't found it. In over four years of posting fics I've never gathered much of anything and I've tried pretty much everything that's been advised in this thread without any perceptible effect. It's easy to conclude that a fic with few comments is simply bad---and I'm afraid most people will assume it's not worth reading, but I don't think it's that simple. Some people hit the sweet spot and some don't. Ultimately you have to believe in what you're doing, and sometimes that has to be enough.

** Include a lot of popular characters with little content for them (any of the Tonks, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Pansy, Fleur) AND include Harry. It's not difficult to gain some traction that way, as long as your concept is somewhat decent and original. Humour and romance is a good recipe for popularity ("Drool" got me over three hundred favs after one chapter and it was horribly written back then).

Of course, don't just randomly add stuff to farm popularity. You need to be sold on the idea, otherwise, you will lose interest.

** Maybe post it here too, get some people to read it and give their advice, that way the clicks on the story will increase, so will your writing, and it'll be more seen over there. Dunno really haha

** Other than what has already been said, don't answer reviews in your posts, follow basic grammar rules (ex. start new sentence when someone new speaks, etc.), and try to minimize AN's.
