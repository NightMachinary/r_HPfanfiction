Happy New Year.

Went to read the only story in this verse on AO3 this morning and it's disappeared? Anyone know if they've taken it down, or what happened to it? The series itself is still listed among theirs, but there are no actual stories in it despite the info saying there is when you look at it. When I go to tab into a chapter of it from my history, it tells me I don't have permission to view the page so I'm just a bit confused and wanted to see if anyone else had an answer.


** According to the author's Tumblr, the story was reported by someone and is currently pending review. I'm guessing because of a Ko-fi link in author's notes or something like that :(
