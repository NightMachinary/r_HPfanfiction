I'm not looking for a crossover here between Harry Potter and 24.

Basically the premise of this prompt is to turn the events of Gringotts Break-In to the end of the Battle of Hogwarts (the whole of Deathly Hallows Part 2 minus epilogue), which takes twenty-four hours, into a season of the TV show "24".


** “Right now, a terrorist is seizing control of the Ministry. My friends and girlfriend have been targeted, and people I know and work with may be involved in both. My name is Harry Potter, and this is the longest day of my life.”

...

“DAMMIT +CHLOE+ HERMIONE!”

For real though, my first thought was mildly unrelated with a plot to attack the Quidditch World Cup, plenty of opportunity to not allow Head Auror Potter to do his job. And of course Minister Charles Logan sells out his country for reasons.
