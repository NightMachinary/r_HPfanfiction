Just finished my latest fic and want to share some appreciation for the hard work my fellow fanficcers put in. Flick me a link here and I'll read and comment as I am able.

No underage but anything else is fair game.


** linkao3(Luna + Hermione drabbles)

I write in Hungarian, but it's a drabble collection I'm always translating to English when I write a new chapter. My English and writing skills are both quite poor, so don't expect much. I'd be happy even if is you read just one or two chapters and told me your opinion. Only if you're okay with F/F, of course.

  One year since I started writing. I decided to do a Drabble for each day of the month of October!! Multiple pairings.

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have a lot in common. Both of them are Half-bloods raised by abusive muggles. Both of them are Parselmouths. Both are sorted into the house of snakes. What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash

  A different upbringing leaves Harry with a unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and a passion for all things magical. A different upbringing leaves wizarding Britain unaware that the newborn who sacrificed himself that night wasn't truly dead. A different upbringing leaves the world blind to the dark times that loomed over the future, and deaf to the mutterings of death and war... AU

** Aw, I have to pick?

Well, it's a close call between my various fics, but I'll have to go with !linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

I love all of my fics, but I'm especially proud of the way I've fairly realistically developed a rapport between Harry and fem!Riddle in this fic.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.
