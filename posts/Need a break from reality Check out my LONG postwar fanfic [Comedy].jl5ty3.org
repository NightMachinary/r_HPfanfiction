If you're looking for a long binge, look no further!

*Title*: Loose Cannon

*Summary*: He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

*What to expect*: Humour, romance, lots of dialogue, character growth, seduction, recovery from trauma, magical exploration, world building, Quidditch

*What you won't find*: Lemons, outrageously OP Harry, fawning over lordships, major bashing, mortal peril

*Status*: It's not done yet, but I've already posted nearly 750K words, and I've written more than 1M. Updated weekly.

** This is really really really great! A very welcome surprise, considering that I found it when I was looking for a smut with plot guilty pleasure fix. It was so awesome that I read every chapter available in about a week (it was like 700k words at the time).

Please don't break my heart and keep writing until completion!

Btw, Lydia is my favorite OC. I hope that there's some kind of sweeter closure to Harry and her's relationship in the future (:

******* Embarrassingly enough, almost none of my characters were carefully designed. They mostly just show up and reveal themselves as I type -- Lydia barely resembles my original notes for her.

** This fic should suck. One long slice of life with no driving, compelling force to keep you reading or move the plot forward.

Sports in text form always sucks and Quidditch is the dumbest sport ever.

A rash of OC's we don't know and don't care about. A Harry that is simultaneously underpowered by fanfic standards but also has the standard bullshit "Harry gets a super-awesome super-rare power up and is super-duper amazing" trope.

It /should/ suck.

And yet somehow it's unbelievably amazing and one of the most readable, bingeable fics I've read. Ever. In any fandom.

It just pulls you in so thoroughly and so gently that you don't even notice that somehow you've read over half a million words and enjoyed every minute of it.

This is a remarkable work. Thank you so very much for sharing it with us.

*** Awww! Thank you!

I suspect heaps of readers have been turned away by the description (/"Quidditch? OCs? No thanks!"/). Frankly, I probably wouldn't read a fic based on that description -- most OCs are either one-dimensional or blatant self-inserts, and I skimmed the Quidditch scenes even in canon. And if someone warned me that 1 million words didn't even cover 4 months, I'd nope right out of there.

I'm a little bummed my fic hasn't caught on more widely, since we can all use a break from mortal peril right now. But my spouse has repeatedly said it would eventually find its audience, and that's gradually happening.

Anyway, glad you like it, and thanks again for the entertaining review.
