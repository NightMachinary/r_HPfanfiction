[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357627/1/Scorpius-Malfoy-and-the-Improbable-Plot][Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot]] by Opalish.

Well written crack is hard to do, but this one is hysterical. Tears of laughter a few chapters in or your money back.


** As long as we're picking out quotes:

"Good point," Ginny conceded, lips twitching. "Oh. Wait. You don't think this means Lily will end up in Slytherin, do you?" As one, they glanced at their daughter, who stared back with an innocence so patently fake that it literally hurt.

"I think Lily's blackmail folder and extortion ring means she'll end up in Slytherin," Harry replied fondly, before turning to the troops. Lily beamed at the compliment.*

AND

Harry Potter," the Dark Lord murmured, with a terrifying smile. Yet, Harry noted, he still feared his daughter's smile rather more, particularly when it was used in conjunction with the words 'slumber' and 'party'

AND

There were limits to what the Dark Lord and his followers would buy from a Potter. Presumably, at least, because Merlin knew he'd run mental rings around them when he was still prepubescent.

*** and

"Hermione doesn't like to lose," Harry half-explained. There was a reason she'd always refused to play chess with Ron, after the first few losses. "She can get..."

"Frightening," Victoire said hollowly. "Do you remember, the time my mother got Board Walk and Aunt Hermione..." She trailed off, unable to discuss the trauma---the years had not completely healed that wound. It was a mental scar everyone in their family shared.

"I still hear the screams at night, sometimes," Teddy confessed, his arm tightening protectively around Victoire's shoulders.

"If I ever marry into your family," Scorpius informed them, "And it would be hard not to, given that it makes up about half the Wizarding World these days... Well, I shall take my spouse far, far away, where the rest of your kind cannot hope follow. And if you do try to find us, I will not be merciful."

"Fair enough," Harry allowed, and hastily finished his ice cream.

** It doesn't say 'complete' and it hasn't been updated since 2009. Have you read all the way through? Is it worth it, even if it's unfinished? Because I already have too many abandoned fics behind me. There's something about being left hanging that undermines my ability to enjoy it.

*** I read part of it. There's no real plot, but it's pretty hilarious (I think that was the author's intention).

** Oh my god, this is brilliant.

/"Remind me why I didn't just stay at work Friday," Harry groaned, and Scorpius grinned with more than a little malicious enjoyment of his pain. "I could've slept at my desk. Stayed until Monday afternoon. Or September 2nd."/

/"As I recall, you wanted to. And then Mrs. Potter said she'd kill you and your children without hesitation or remorse if she didn't get away from the shouting for a solid forty-eight hours, and that no fair trial would end in her conviction 'cause you'd all deserve it, you bastards, and how can you expect her to work in this noise, she's got a deadline in three days and if she misses it she won't be held accountable for the grisly and terrible things she will do to you," Scorpius recited with an innocent smile that wouldn't have fooled a Confunded Hufflepuff firstie./

/"Right," Harry said, and let loose a sigh the likes of which had he'd not exhaled since his own turbulent teenaged years. "I've had enough of this, now, and it's going to end," he added with the same sort of determination that had tripped up Voldemort's plans year after year and yet, Harry already knew, would falter in the face of petulant teenaged whining./
