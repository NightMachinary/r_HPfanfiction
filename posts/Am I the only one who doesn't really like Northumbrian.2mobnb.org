His characterization always seemed slightly off-key to me. It's hard to explain, but the characters act in ways that don't make sense given their motivations.

Sometimes it seems like fan fodder, Ginny and Harry (and other characters) act in ways that advance the story and keep things interesting but don't tally with their past motivations/behaviors or their canon personalities.

For example, in Strangers at Drakeshaugh, Harry and Ginny continue to inexplicably invite Jackie/Mike into their lives and invite them and other muggle families to a housewarming party where wizards are also present. It's fun to see Harry and Ginny and their friends/family from a muggle perspective, but it just seems out of character for them to throw a party like that in the first place. It's so contrived.

And I couldn't even get through Grave Days. I get that you want to advance the story, but the characters basically just moved on with their lives without going through a mourning period. Harry is hashing out the details of Auror training with Kingsley literally the morning after the battle. And Ron is laughing and joking literally hours after his brother died.

Why is he recommended so much?


** I think some of these objections are simply the fact that in /Strangers/ Harry and Ginny are older. They're used to married life, parents, and comfortably middle class. Of course they're going to be different to how they were at 17.

I haven't read any of the fics other than /Strangers/ so couldn't comment on those.

Unfortunately, no one is JKR. No matter how hard they try, I've not found a fanfic that has any character close to their canon equivalent. Some do it better than most, but nothing is even close to 100%. I like how he writes his characters so it doesn't bother me here.

I don't think it's weird to invite old friends and new friends to a house warming party? There's every reason for Harry and Ginny to be friends with Jackie and Mike. They have kids of the same age, going to the same school, that have already become friends. The parents are of a similar age and hold the same values in common. I can't see Harry leaving the Muggle world completely and would bet he'd want his kids to be comfortable in either world. Whenever two friend groups mix it's awkward but it creates the chance for intergroup friendships which are nice. I also think it was a chance for the author to show that Muggles and wizards can get along.

Everyone experiences grief differently and there is such a thing as delayed grief! Some people can best weather grief by throwing themselves into their work and carrying on. Others are more visibly and immediately affected.

I don't think Northumbrian is perfect, but he is canon compliant, a decent writer, and I like his characters. I also think he does a good job adding to the wizarding world. Some authors just don't resonate with you and that's fine.

** What I admire about Northumbrian is his enthusiasm for canon pairings and situations that mesh within the events of canon. His stories usually refer to one another, so he's built a world inside a world.

** Nope. Couldn't get into it. Of course, i dont care about hp/gw ships, so i might be biased. But mostly, i just couldnt get past the presentation. Too many one shots.
