Does anyone know of someone looking to beta a long Harry Potter fanfiction? I've officially run out of chapter length books that start before Harry's first year, so I'm writing my own. Any help would be appreciated! It will be a series length Fanfiction, in which *quite* a few things are changed from Canon.

1. The first thing I'm changing is the vagueness surrounding the magic of love.
2. Second thing is Harry was more heavily abused than in canon.
3. Due to this he learns a very small amount of wandless magic. It takes him years of trail and error before he gets results
4. But when he does, he uses magic to scare his aunt and uncle.
5. And eventually, at around 9 years old, makes his way into the wizarding world.


** You need to be more specific. What's your fic about? What kind of beta are you looking for?
