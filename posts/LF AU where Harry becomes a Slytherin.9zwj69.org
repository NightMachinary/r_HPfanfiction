I am new to fanfiction since I started for different material after being disappointed by the recent original work put out about the universe. Is there a God tier FF out there that can satisfy my needs and is widely regarded as one of the best?


** the most popular I think is mira_mirth's On the Way to Greatness ! linkao3(559219)

my favourite is the Serpensortia series, which has a pretty canon Harry and excellent characters. linkao3(4913998)

there are loads tho. you might benefit from just searching for the tag â€˜Slytherin Harry' on ao3 and going from there.

** If you like Prince of Slytherin, you'll also like the Sarcasm and Slytherin series, starting with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes), as they are pretty similar up through the beginning of 2nd year.

I'd also recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), which has the Horcrux in Harry's head waking up at an early age and affecting his life from then on. Darker than PoS or SaS, but very good and much more cerebral.

For a shorter story, linkffn(Ruthless) is an interesting take on how magic can have unintended effects featuring a Slytherin Harry.

Finally, the Perfectly Normal series, starting with linkao3(The Definition of Normal), is a great example of a Harry that's sorted into Gryffindor but displays all the traits of a Slytherin: he's cautious, secretive, and calculating. He's also the only 11 year old I've seen in fanfiction to realize that if you're a secretive and ambitious person, getting sorted into the House KNOWN for being secretive and ambitious might hinder your goals XD

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** You might enjoy my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It features Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin, and a healthy dose of worldbuilding and politics. I'm almost done writing the third in the series, and the combined wordcount so far is about 170k.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain.
