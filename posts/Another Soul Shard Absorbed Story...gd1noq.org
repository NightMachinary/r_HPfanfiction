This dialogue takes place during the First Task of the TriWizard Tournament.

*/[For Context]/* The Champions, to ensure fairness, were Obliviated upon arrival and transported to the area where the dragons were being held. There they were Compelled to venture through the forest to find the dragons and retrieve the Golden Egg, whilst colpletely unaware they were competing in the Tournament. Said task takes a few days and Harry is explaining his attitude to Fleur, Viktor and Cedric during their travelling:

*"I vaguelly remember telling it to a girl I liked, haha! She had such a cynical view towards it. No... present tense. I LIKE her. She has a pretty name, something out of Shakespeare I think?"*

*"Oh, I'm very scared, very frustrated. I wanna wring my hands at the sky and punch a hole through whoever decided to mess with my head. But it's not fair to subject you to that. And besides, wouldn't you prefer a nice smile?"*

*"I just think... if you don't have it in you to smile and laugh your way through your misfortune, then maybe you shouldn't do anything..."*

*"Sometimes I find it really hard to muster up a grin. When I was little, I could go days without a smile or frown. It creeped out the other children, and the carers would tell prospective parents about my 'episodes'. Nobody really wanted to deal with me after they found out, a couple even sent me back after seeing me go through one."*

*"Yeah, that only really made it worse. They started happening more frequently."*

*"Oh? I think it's because I have trouble lying. I kinda clam up when I don't want to tell the truth, and I couldn't act or play pretend to save my life most days. It took me a while to figure it out..."*

*"Is it a fake? I smile because I want to, it just happens that sometimes, when I'm smiling, I'm not actually happy. But I still WANT to smile, is that a bad thing to do?"*

The basic premise of this prompt is simple.

During the attack on Godrics Hollow, the soul shard was immediatley consumed by Harry's larger soul, integrated (as best as it could) into the larger entity. Harry thus becoming a Potter/Riddle hybrid then and there and developing through childhood as such.

He had no access to his memories (save for the occasional nightmare where he would experience events in Riddle's life) but his spells and skills were deeply ingrained in Harry's body like muscle memory, making his eventual *"learning"*of magic very easy.

However, the big change was to Harry's personality. As the sociopathic mindset of Voldemort and the seemingly intrinsically loving and empathetic one Harry developed simply could not mesh, leading to a sort of bipolar disorder that: the Dursley's refused to acknowledge, the orphanage was not willing or able to treat and Hogwarts staff had no way of understanding.

The idea here is that Dumbledore Dumbledore mischaracterises it as sociopathy and turns many of the staff against Harry, thinking he's a step away from psychotic. Their attitude leaks into much of the students attitudes towards Harry and very much effects how he acts and feels throughout school (dealing with few friends and lots of bullying and neglect).

Crackfic, but it is almost exactly like this. Harrymort does noble shit without realising he's doing it.

#+begin_quote
  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
