I have been on a ‚Äòreincarnated fic' kick lately and an idea popped in to my head, what if Salazar Slytherin was reincarnated into a girl? Would she beat Tom Riddle?

** The problem I have with a lot of reincarnation fics is that they always avoid several glaring issues/problems that such a setup would need to explain (or they hand-wave it):

1. Why this or that person is being incarnated in the first place, instead of literally thousands of other individuals? With the Founders this presents an even greater issue of why they would be more suitable than so many other individuals who haven't missed the last millenia of history/culture/society. Do you really think we would be comfortable around people with behaviors and ideals from a thousand years ago? Even wizarding society would immediately recognize that aberration.
2. Why now and as these people? This is especially odd when as any of the main Hogwarts students too. They are, for the most part, irrelevant in terms of magical ability or influence or political position. And why would Harry being Godric Gryffindor make anything better? Or why would Salazar Slytherin be able to stop Tom Riddle for whatever reason? The only way to make all of that somehow work is (1) slap random power-ups and/or personality changes on the reincarnated (2) make the characters terribly illogical or OOC or (3) fundamentally alter the world to make the plot work, all of which makes for boring storylines.
3. The reincarnation schtick also runs into why hasn't this happened before? At its core, reincarnation is just the idea that when you die, you are reborn immediately in a new form, which depending on your world view is anything from random to divine allotment. Most fics with this premise never follow that idea, instead more or less they are just generic time-travel fics but forward in time instead of backwards, with the corresponding character power-up being the rule not the exception.

Rant over. Feel free to enjoy them if you like though. I simply find that they avoid the more interesting aspects of what such a scenario would entail (ex. how does a lifelong male adjust to being female, in an era with an entirely alien view on gender roles/behaviors), and are otherwise interchangeable with random fix-it time-travels fics.

*** I agree that reincarnation without an explanation is stupid but being reincarnated each time after death could be cool if they somehow managed to have them remember their last lives using magic
