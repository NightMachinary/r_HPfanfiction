Wanna enchant things, but you don't have the years of theoretical and practical knowledge to even attempt to get started? No problem! Just find a “cooperative” enchanter and steal all their memories! Years of knowledge downloaded in seconds, all for the low, low price of free! Apply now.

(So basically a fic where the MC gets super powerful by just legilimancing them)

Fem!Harry and/or femslash is welcome, but not necessary.

** I just read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]], and if you're okay with a drawn out, slightly incoherent story, it has exactly what you're looking for and one of the absolute coolest interpretations of legilimency in the whole of HP fanfiction (IMO). If you're just looking for that I would say to just read the first half, as the second half focuses more on metamorph and martial arts magic. It's one of those ‘Harry discovers magic before hogwarts' fics but it takes it in an absolutely off the wall direction that I think is worth at least checking out.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
