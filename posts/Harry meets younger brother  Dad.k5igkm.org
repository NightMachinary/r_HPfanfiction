:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The story starts from Harry's younger brother POV in the different dimension. There's an accident in class that pulls Harry into this dimension. I remember there's also a part where after this Harry is pulled into this dimension (possibly involving a mirror??) James is sitting in the hospital wing, staring at him. Their Harry died as a baby.

Now here's where it gets fuzzy and I might be misremembering things: I think this wasn't on fanfiction but a separate, different site (and not ao3 either!). I think James realizes as a result of Harry's lightning scar that that night Harry would've survived the killing curse, and what actually killed him was when James tried to escape with him, the killing curse hit them and James fell down the stairs with baby Harry who broke his neck. Even more fuzzily, I think James might be a seer?? (Might be confusing it with another alternate reality fic!)

This fic wasn't finished but I remember it being really good and I am dying to find it. Any help would be much appreciated!!!!

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.
