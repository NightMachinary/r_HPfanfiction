The dust jacket says the Cursed Child is the eighth book, but we all know that most people don't agree. What parts, if any, will you take from it as canon? What parts are not canon to you? Did you enjoy the script at all?


** I enjoyed it if I consider it to be expensive fanfiction. There are some parts that I will incorporate as canon. If something disagrees with both my head canon and I don't like it, I don't consider it to be canon. If it's just one or the other, I regretfully incorporate it as canon. For example, the trolley witch being some weird monster-I don't like it, but it doesn't disagree with my head canon, so canon it is (to me). Some things that I'll accept as canon:

- Astoria's death
- The Malfoys loving each other
- Albus' Slytherin sorting
- Albus and Scorpius friendship
- Draco being on neutral to /somewhat/ friendly terms with the three
- Hermione eventually being Minister (but not as quick as the Cursed Child)
- Trolley witch is a strange monster
- Amos' health is declining and he's in St. Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards
- There are rumors that Scorpius isn't a Malfoy

Things I don't consider canon:

- Voldemort's child/Delphi
- Changes to time travel laws
- Ron's depiction
- Harry's fear of pigeons
- The Cursed Child plot

I'm sure I'll add a bunch to the lists, but that's what's sticking out right now

*** Harry fears pigeons because of all the Pidgey's he caught in Pok√©mon GO. It triggers him.

I agree with most of your points except: Scorpius not being a Malfoy. I haven't seen or read CC, but they're defs father and son from DH.

  Scorpius not being a Malfoy
#+end_quote

I agree, Scorpius is definitely a Malfoy! I just think it's interesting that there are rumors he is not. I don't think anyone in the wizarding world believes those rumors because he resembles his father so much, I think they just use them to cut at the Malfoys. They must hate the Malfoys- they were a high profile family with two members in the Death Eaters, well known to be involved in that group and ideology, and yet they escaped from the worst of the consequences. They have to have some way to blow off that steam so I think that's how the rumors started or were perpetuated. Even though they probably don't believe it, it also allows them to "justify" their hatred and fear of an uninvolved child. It's a terrible insult if you think about it. They're accusing Astoria of being unfaithful, Draco a cuckold, and Scorpius of being the child of Voldemort.

*** I agree with most of your list actually! The few things I don't agree on are Hermione being minister,(always pictured Percy in that role,) and the rumors of Scorpius not being a Malfoy, (c'mon, he has the appearance and I'd find it hard to believe Draco would accept him if he wasn't.) The last one I disagree with is Albus' Slytherin sorting... I know, I know, but after that conversation in the epilogue he had with his dad, I don't understand why he'd go Slytherin when he's clearly dead set against it. Honestly, most of the Cursed Child made me die a little on the inside.

**** I hadn't thought Hermione could be minister either, and certainly not that fast. I would have thought she'd push really hard and quickly for reforms thus alienating many. I don't like it, but it meets the criteria so that I have to accept it at least in part!

As to the Scorpius rumors, I can see them happening to an extent. With Astoria being so fragile and the popular sentiment going against the Malfoys, I can see vicious, mean-spirited rumors happening. Not that people really believed it, but that they enjoyed gossiping about it and hoping it needled/bothered the Malfoys. I can see Draco overreacting and taking it as if people believed it especially if the Prophet is partaking

It's okay, the Cursed Child is just another bit of fanfiction ;)

***** That probably happened in the timeline where she didn't marry Ron. She would be too head strong, too uncompromising, and too radical. Her political goals failed, and she had to settle for the DADA teaching position.

Her marriage to Ron would have mellowed her out somewhat. Being married into the pureblood powerhouse Weasleys certainly helped her political career too.

** I dont consider Cursed Child canon. to me... its a glorified fanfiction story that JK wrote. However.. that being said it is canon.. but I refuse to utilize any of it. It was a massive disappointment to my inner child who adored the books, and cheered and cried when the series was over. It hurt to read that... and I honestly think I need to walk away from the series because of how little the author seems to care. It feels like the cursed child was written in a week, and the rest of the series was written over the course of years. I have my issues with the series.. but it is still a work of art, and the cursed child is that painting that got put in the museum because of the artist not because it was any good.

** Wow, I actually liked CC better than most people here, even if that just means it was decent and not great. There were some definite problems, but talking canon--it's all technically canon, but we can allow it to be a secondary level of canon, like the movies.

This means, #1: JKR screwing up the rules of time travel *again* is *not* canon. (She already did it once with the Pottermore description.)

This raises an interesting philosophical problem of whether CC "really happened" since the book rules of time travel would make it impossible, but I'm going to stop before I get in trouble for meddling with time.

However, what I consider canon is not the same as what I'll use in my own stories. For example: Monster!Trolley Witch? No way! That made no sense, and it was Tom Bombadil-level unnecessary to the story. I actually thought it was a dream sequence when I first read it.

On the other hand, Astoria's death: I had mixed feelings about it in-story, but I thought of a great way to incorporate her "illness" into /Lady Archimedes/. So it's kind of a mixed bag.

**** Maybe not changing them in the strictest sense, but when she posted on Pottermore about time turners, it made no sense. Time turners are able to change history when it was implied in the book and /very/ strongly implied in the movie that they create a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop][Stable Time Loop]]. Hermione was the only student ever to use a time turner in Hogwarts when we know for a fact that other students also took all the electives (at least Percy and probably Bill and Barty Crouch Jr.) Neither of these things fits the canon description.

The movies are canon where they do not conflict with the books.

Neither Cursed Child or the videos games will ever be canon to me. The games because they stray wildly from the original series to meet technical and budgetary restrictions. CC because it honestly feels like a random play that someone borrowed the Harry Potter universe names for.

** I enjoyed it. I definitely thought about how it fulfills a loooot of fanfiction tropes as I read it, but it was still interesting. It helped to remember it was a play and think of how it would display on stage.

The characterization didn't bother me too much, honestly. Not everyone grows up to be more mature and completely free of their vices. Plus it's not like they had time to show a ton of character development to start. Y'all would be complaining if the trio started off acting completely mature and unlike their teenage selves too

It's sort of all canon by definition, but I think I'll just ignore it and stick with the books in terms of writing, unless I venture into next gen fics.
