I think it was Harry/Voldemort slash. They're quite the dysfunctional little family. Bellatrix is Harry's "mum" and Voldemort keeps crucio'ing her and having to obliviate Harry.


** Not exactly what your looking for, but take this.

  Voldemort has taken another route...one he had not considered. With the murder of Lily and James, Harry was taken away by Voldemort and raised as his own son, only his masterful pulling of the strings has kept his continued survival hidden so long, but what will happen when a different Harry Potter comes to light? What will happen when the son and daughter of the Dark Lord enter the world together...

  Redo of story 'Shadowed Malice' originally posted over six years prior. Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  11 years ago, my 'brother' survived the killing curse. 8 years ago I was given up for adoption. 5 years ago, my orphanage was destroyed in a bloodbath. 4 years ago I found my place at the Dark Lords side. And now, i'm going to Hogwarts, I am Harry Potter
