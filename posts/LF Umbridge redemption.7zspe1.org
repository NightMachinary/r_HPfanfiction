Are there any fics where Umbridge either wasn't really bad or becomes better?


** What could she possibly do to redeem herself after a year filled with torturing children for better PR?

*** Don't let the movies guide you too much. Not that it excuses her actions, but in the books, she only ever tortured Harry and Lee Jordan. Only in the film does she use the Blood Quill on students as a default punishment.

**** Because that's so much better. Also, didn't she attempt an unforgivable on top of her authoritarian takeover?

***** As I said, it absolutely does not make her any morally better, I just wanted to make a factual correction because a lot of people confuse movie and book on this issue (precisely because using the Quill on everybody doesn't /seem/ like it would even give pause to book!Umbridge).

****** I didn't even remember her giving out blood quills, but I am fairly sure that her whole reign can be classified as torture. She built her own Einsatzgruppe for Merlin's sake.

** Umbridge is one of the most hated characters in the fandom. Very few people dare to show her as anything but vile (interestingly the same doesn't hold true for much more vile characters... there's thousands of fics that idolize Voldemort)

Here's one where she is secretly on Harry's side:

Fair warning: The fic is abandoned.

I have to agree with Hellstrike though, redeeming her is probably impossible.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

*** Alright, so is this story any /good/? Should I read it?

  Harry behaves OC and Peggy Sue'is at times.
#+end_quote

---'m afraid you got /both/ terms wrong. "OC" is an o"riginal character"; you mean "OOC", for "out of character" . And a "Peggy Sue" is a character who mentally travels back his time to his younger body; the male version of "Mary Sue" (which I assume is what you meant) is "Gary Stu".
