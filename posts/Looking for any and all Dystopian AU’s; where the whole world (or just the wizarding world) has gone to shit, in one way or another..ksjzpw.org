Linkffn(Prince of a Dark Kingdom) is probably one of the most well known dystopia AUs in the fandom

** Linkffn(Stages of Hope)

It quickly becomes clear that Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna's dimension has gone to utter shit, and it remains so even after they kill Voldemort. They return to the dimension they'd accidentally travelled to rather than stay.

Snarry. Harry's surviving in a world where the Muggles have won and stripped most wizards of magic.

One of the most well written fics I've ever read and it was written around 2002. It holds up extremely well and can easily be read as an AU.
