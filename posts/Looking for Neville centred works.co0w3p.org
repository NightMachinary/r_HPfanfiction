** Linkffn(Asking for Roses by Dogstar101) is a great Neville/Hannah romance following year 5 with a side arc of mystery. Complete.

Linkffn(You'll Be the Death of Me) is a Neville/OC 6th year fic that really gets pretty heavy but is nonetheless excellent. One of the better romances in the fandom. Currently updating.

Linkffn(Seven Years Bad Luck by Feelin Glayish) is a Neville/Pansy post DH which is alright. Fair bit of cute interactions. Complete.

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

  If you look into the broken pieces and cannot find your reflection, the magic of seven years bad luck will take effect. In the spring of '91, Neville Longbottom broke a mirror. And in their 8th year, Pansy Parkinson broke one too. Neville/Pansy

** linkffn(Why Neville Really Hates Baker Street) is a mostly Neville centric fic, but it is a crossover with Sherlock and post-hogwarts if you don't mind that. I found it to be pretty enjoyable, and I went in with knowing the barebones of Sherlock Holmes. (But I think this one was based off the BBC version, if it matters). Give it a try!

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.
