**** I'm not good with names so maybe you can change those as you see fit XD

Aero : Cast a blast of wind - much like incendio does for fire.

Clousto : Makes targets finger/toe nails grow really fast.

Cluthe: Gives the target leg cramps /charlie horse in muscles.

Bonscy: Allows you to bond two untouching items together, such that if you move one the other moves in the same way despite the distance between them. i.e. Pick up a pencil on your desk and one on your friends desk moves the same way.

Ventriliquo : Allows you to cast your voice as if coming from the direction your wand is aimed.

Elmekia : small lightning blast that can pass through protego shields.

Otium: stasis charm. Preserves current status of an item. Cast on potions/food to keep them at proper temperatures/ stop potions from mixing if you have to leave.

Illusio : projects a silent image from your mind. ~hologram

Harmic: Alters vibrations between two objects such that they can occupy the same space without interfering with one another. could hide an object perfectly within a rock, or even cast on a person to have them walk through walls.

Perceptio: increase/decrease perception of time.

** Here are some nasty ones from my doc of spells

Perfora corporis- "perforate the body", fires several piercing attacks aimed to puncture vital organs.

Excorio carnes- "peel the flesh", flaying curse.

Conturbatio- "panic/disaster", causes mass hysteria, confusion and impending sense of doom. Best result when cast in crowded area.

*** Also Erectus Maximus. Jolts energy through the subject, used to revive the weary. Given that a common side effect is blood rushing towards extremities, it doubles as a quick fix for erectile dysfunction. Could be used in conjunction with the exhaustion point system, or to wake an unconscious player and give them 1hp, or as some kind of power buff on a player's next attack etc.

** Sursus Cado :: The Gravity reversing charm. Also useful is Latus Cado for orientations other than up. Can be cast on others or one's self. The counter charm is Cado Recte.

Expecto Vastatorem :: I await a destroyer. My headcanon for the fiendfyre spell.

Combustum Aeros :: Be burnt by the air. The burning air curse. A curse that causes air to burn the person it is cast on. Especially bad because everyone needs to breathe.

Videre Lucem Maius/Minus :: I see the larger/smaller light. The heat-sight charm. Allows one to see into the infrared or ultraviolet light spectrum. When using Maius (infrared) one can see the radiation caused by heat.

Ambula Cunctanter :: Walk hesitantly. The stumbling hex. Causes the person who is affected to stumble and falter when walking. Ambula Recte is the counter charm.
