:END:
So I read this series of fics maybe a year or 2 ago and want to re read them. Spoilers if you want to read it but It's the best way I can think of describing it to re read.

So harry went by adam I so believe. He got his letter a year late and became friends with Ginny. He was believed to be the heir of slytherin until he rescued Ginny. He ran away from the orphanage he was put back into to stay at weasleys. In PoA remus was able to figure out he was infant Harry Potter bit didnt tell him until end of it. He was triwizard champion still i think. Is held captive sirius dies trying to rescue him. He gots to st mungos where his identity is revealed and he still is adam at school but harry when needed if that makes sense.

Hope someone can help it was really good thanks.
