I personally love the Canon Lily and James story-since there isn't much told there's a lot to write about/be creative about! However I hate the fics where Lily is seen as a holier-than-thou character and sometimes even a Hermione 2.0. Other than both of them being book smart, there's not much else that's similar! Lily was quick, witty, and almost certainly had to have some issues of her own. Which is what i'd like to read about, as well as a romantic plotline with James.

Future thanks for any recommendations!


** I want this too. Tired of seeing James as the only flawed mildly realistic guy out of the 2 in fics.

*** I agree, I never want Lily bashing fics but I'm tired of seeing her portrayed as basically the angel who could do no wrong. She is human, she has to have some flaws.

** Hmmm... well there's An Unexpected Attraction by thegingerhairedlass. It's basically a telling of James and Lily falling in love from their sixth year all the way to the Halloween night of their deaths. It's pretty long but also complete, so that's a plus. It's a lot more teen drama-ish in the beginning but gets darker and more serious as it goes on, but overall I really recommend it.

  Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first...at least that's what she thought.

  Potter was going to say that he wasn't my boyfriend. I couldn't let him do that. For the love of Merlin, I could not let him do that. I had to stop him. He couldn't tell her the truth. So I did the only conceivable thing I could think of. I kissed him.

** Linkffn(the bet by auntleona0) and linkffn(the grindylows)

Same author. Her Lily has depth and definite flaws. And both are L/J.

The Bet is complete, long and canon compliant.

The Grindylows reads a little variant (there's some messing with the timeline, and in its current spot of the fic, Sirius is dating Lily--which is like the /most/ non-canon thing I can imagine ðŸ˜‚), but it's not time travel or anything.

(For Lily, I think you find more depth in longer works. It's hard to give such a seemingly perfect character nuance in your one shot.)

** Dirty Blood is a brilliant story. You should read it! ( linkffn(Dirty Blood) )

It is about the Marauders and Lily and her friends in their fifth year, so no real romance with James yet, but everybody is equally in need of growing up and has their issues. I personally find Lily the most unlikable out of the cast at times, but in the best possible way. Read it, it is brilliant!

â€‹

Other than that I hope the Lily in my own story isn't too much like a Mary Sue, in that story I focus on Lily and all the issues she has and how and when she has to grow up and prove and improve herself. If you want to I can post a link. Sorry for the shameless self-promo.

â€‹

But aside from that, really read Dirty Blood

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.
