So, "[Character] works through trauma of his childhood with the support of his family of choice" is a favourite storyline of mine, but a lot of fics along these lines in the Harry Potter fandom tend to be a bit... melodramatic for my tastes. Maybe melodramatic is the wrong word, but I'm not really looking for "Vernon beats Harry almost to death and then he tries to commit suicide and gets raped and forced into prostitution and..." <- you know the type. What I'm dying for is anything that treats the abuse that we see in canon in a realistic way, and has some level of focus on how Harry is affected by it. Doesn't need to be the main focus of the fic!

I would prefer no excessive character bashing, but other than that I don't really have any preferences for pairing/time frame/ etc-- anything that treats the above subject matter in a more serious, restrained way is great. Also open to "rescue" type fics, where Harry is taken from the Dursleys or is able to leave for some reason (e.g. moving in with Sirius or Snape or something).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] linkffn(11317075) - canon-compliant, post-war (mostly deals with war trauma, but the Dursleys' abuse crops up too), has a sequel

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3260644/1/Claustrophobia][Claustrophobia]] linkffn(3260644) - set the summer after 5th year, canon-levels of abuse

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019][Digging for the Bones]] linkao3(598019) - this one may be too melodramatic for you (the abuse is a bit worse than what we see in canon and there is a suicide attempt), but I thought I'd include it just in case

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12365453/1/The-Memento][The Memento]] has my favorite realistic take on how the abuse would have affected Harry: An eating disorder from not getting regular meals, trust issues, learning difficulties, an intense phobia of dogs (which makes the Fluffy encounter interesting), etc. It's heartwarming how McGonagall and Harry's new friends help him to the best of their ability without knowing the details of his childhood.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry by The Seeker]]

Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.

** I think all of Celebony's works have Harry abuse pretty dramatically and all of Melindaleo's touches upon it in a feel good healing way with friends and family. Both authors have been recced already.

But for nondramatic mentions of abuse..

Linkffn(the rise and fall of Harry j Potter) has rita Skeeter publishing the HP books and then his family freaks out a bit! It touches on Harry's past in a humorous way.

Linkffn(within doors) has Snape noticing some kind of abuse and helping a bit though not really doing a full jumping to the rescue thing.

Linkao3 (where there's a will) not sure if this fits exactly but Ron and Hermione help Harry with his will and he doesn't want Dursleys to have his things.

Linkffn(across the universe) where HP goes to alternate dimension and his parents find out he lived with dursleys

... Ill post again if I think of any more. This is also one of my favorite things in fic!

  All was well. Truly, it was. Harry Potter was so happy that not even Rita Skeeter's newest biography could spoil things. Okay, fine, so maybe he'd 'forgotten' to mention parts of his past to his loved ones. It wasn't like this disaster could end in Azkaban sentences or pygmy puff invasions, right? Right. He was worrying about nothing. --- Pre-Epilogue, canon ships.

** To be completely realistic, the most common likely trauma he'd have would be claustrophobia (minor or major).

Other things he'd grow up with would be mistrust of adults and relectuance to ask for help ( both of which he exbited in canon to some extent).

He went through neglect from lack of attention and blatant favoritism. They didnt starve him. They did try to hit him, but didnt much care if he did dodge or got out of the way. They typically regarded him as a very annoying fly.

Things didnt reach a hateful/abusive point until the 3rd book onward, or whenever the Aunt with the dog shows up and he blew her up like a blimp.

*** You don't reach the point where you can try and hit a twelve year old in the head with a frying pan or grab/throw/drag an eleven/twelve year old without having previously been violent towards the child.

He was definitely starved. Not over weeks or months, but again Vernon is quite comfortable with 'Go - cupboard - stay - no meals' after the zoo incident. Harry doesn't get out of the cupboard until the summer holiday have started. This could be three-four days (assuming that Dudley's birthday falls on the Saturday not the Sunday that it actually did in 1991) since schools were likely to have broken up the week after Dudley's birthday but potentially as long as a week since Dudley has also broken three of his birthday presents. That's not something you can be comfortable with unless you've done it previously.

There's also a component of emotional abuse going on.

Marge's visit in PoA wasn't her first and certainly wasn't her first time being abusive. She thought hitting a five year old was acceptable and the year before PS, her dog was allowed to chase and keep Harry up a tree for hours.
