It was set during Hogwarts years just before the final battle. Hermione Ron and harry along with others are in grimauld place. Sirius is alive and is with them too. Snape keeps visiting, and doesn't like that Sirius is flirting with Hermione. There was one particular chapter where Hermione wakes up and comes to the dining room in her sleeping shorts, to find Severus and Sirius chatting. Sirius is a little inappropriate with her, but she doesn't realise. Snape gets very angry at her. Does this ring any bells?
