Without giving too much away, if you liked The Lie I've Lived by jbern there's a good chance you'll enjoy this story. Same pairing, less irreverent than TLIL and more focus on the romance but snappy dialogue and the author doesn't fall into the trap of telling not showing. Plenty of well-described action scenes.

Currently ongoing.

**** Lol it's a good story, I think the summary just turns a lot of people off of starting it. It's definitely better quality than a lot of stories with 2k+ follows/favs so maybe straighten up the summary and I bet the story's following explodes. Thanks for writing

*** This is a good example of how not to write a summary.

#+begin_quote
  Everything has to start somewhere, and this is where my story begins, my love; where our story begins.
#+end_quote

No clue of who tf is speaking here, or who he's speaking to.

#+begin_quote
  Know that I will never forget my roots
#+end_quote

Is he/she a tree? Actually a sentient tree would be cool.

#+begin_quote
  and that magical night
#+end_quote

If you're a magic user, aren't all nights magical? Or perhaps this refers to the night Voldemort attacked the Potters.

#+begin_quote
  The story of a love between a broken prodigy and a beaten down flower
#+end_quote

From this I get that the "broken flower" is probably Fleur? But in canon Fleur was not "beaten down" and Harry (if the broken prodigy part refers to him) was not broken, nor a prodigy, so all that stuff exists only in this story... so this part refers to things that only someone who has already read the story can deduce.

#+begin_quote
  of a war between two prodigies
#+end_quote

The only two prodigies that exist in canon are teenage Tom Riddle and young Albus Dumbledore. Hermione and Snape probably come close but don't make the cut.

#+begin_quote
  a boy burdened by fate and a monster with hidden faces
#+end_quote

Harry and Dark!Tonks?

#+begin_quote
  of a family of misfits
#+end_quote

Weasleys or Blacks?

To summarize the above, the only thing one gains from reading the summary is confusion. People don't like feeling confused, so they probably give the story a pass.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life.

For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.

**** Awesome, I love hearing directly from the author about it like this. Thanks for replying!

Mind answering a few more?

1) How many "books" do you expect this story take to completely finish?

2) Will each "book" contain a relatively standalone story arc (like Canon), or will it be more of a single overarching story split up by year simply to make it more approachable?

***** I think 3 books or however I end up signifying the three main plots will suffice for the story, though the last one will be the shortest.

Each 'book' will have a single story arc but I plan to deviate from the canon quite a bit and even throw in a small CoS type adventure/mystery to propel the character arc.

Thank you for the questions! And feel free to ask any time.

Ps: I have published a new chapter if you'd like to check it out.

The 4 main characters chosen are Harry, Fleur, Sirius & Dumbldore.

*** Because discussion is the most relevant tag and flair of those available lol. If your interest in the story isn't grabbed between the author's description and my elaboration on the story, then this post ain't for you.

And The Lie I've Lived is one of the top 20 most popular fics of all time on FFN, so I can't really help you there if you haven't read it.

**** What pairing it is tends to be top in most of the ‘should I read this?' decisions, that's all. I hadn't heard of it because of the pairing, I suspect.

I commented because I felt like it was weird to see a post tagged discussion and have hardly any of the main post be discussing? But sure I can scroll on by, no need to take it personally.

***** that's fine I'm not worried about downvotes lol. The point I was and am trying to make with this post is that this is a romance fic with a lot to offer besides romance and trying to give it exposure to an audience which would have normally passed it over due to the fluffy story summary.

As far as being vague about it being Harry/Fleur I kind of figured it was implied with “Flower” and her being the second character after Harry.

But believe it or not, a lot of people on the subreddit will actually pass over fics just for being romance-centric, which I get, sometimes you have to be in a mood.
