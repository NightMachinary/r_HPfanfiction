  It was not Harry's heroism, Ron's desperation, her mother's love, or her brothers' toilet seat humor that brought her back (though the toilet seat helped). Ginny breathed deep at night. She wept.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] is Chamber of Secrets told through Ginny's diary entries and Tom's replies to her. Pretty much perfectly canon compliant, IIRC.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] is year seven at Hogwarts through Neville's perspective, dealing with what went on while the trio was on the run. It has some elements that weren't addressed in canon but doesn't, as far as I could tell, contradict anything in canon. It's well enough canon compliant that certain scenes match exactly with those in Deathly Hallows.

I imagine there's a good chance you've already read one or both of these, but they're the only one's I know of that really fit the canon well.

*** I've read the Snape Chronicles and part of Year of Darkness and I wouldn't call either 100% canon compliant.

Year of Darkness: the students seem a bit..too rebellious? Not frightened enough of the Carrows. Also, in the very first scene Seamus somehow knows Voldemort's family and blood status, but that's not well known information at all! Only a handful of characters actually know Tom Riddle's story in canon.

I very much enjoyed the Snape Chronicles, but it's very white-washed. The childhood scenes and middle years (1981-1991) are fantastic, but other bits put me off. There wasn't enough bad blood between Snape/Sirius/James, and I really don't see a James/Snape truce happening in their seventh year; in this story, he seems to hate Remus more than James. Snape also was /not/ canonically upset/remorseful about Sirius' death. It's also canon that he had friends in Slytherin, and he joined the Death Eaters of his own volition.

It's a well written story, and I loved the literary allusions and professors' banter, but Snape isn't supposed to be a vastly misunderstood bullied boy with no friends who was tricked into becoming a Death Eater. Of course, it helps to consider that it is written 3rd person limited omniscient so it's likely that Snape is white-washing himself/portraying himself in a better light. Sort of like how Harry paints Hogwarts as 'Gryffindors are the best, Slytherins are evil, Hufflepuff exists?!' in canon.
