As in the title, I'm looking for new decent quality HP Crossovers.

I recently Came Across a new HP + SG1 Crossover fic linkfn(12790836) and it's a empire building fic, which is scratching that particular itch since it seems linkffn(11132113) 'The Difference one man can make' hasn't updated in an age.

So I'd like to continue the binge of crossovers, any one have any RECENTLY(let's say last 6 months or so) published fics for us to share?

Thanks in advance!


** Game of Thrones crossovers that are WIP or Complete:

Linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock)\\
Linkffn(The Binding of the Fates)

MCU Crossovers\\
Linkffn(Child of the Storm) has a sequel linkffn(Ghosts of the Past)\\
Linkffn(Avengers: Battleground)\\
Linkffn(Heroes Assemble!)\\
Linkffn(Fates be Changed) finished about 9 months ago but is a very nice story about Bruce Banner raising Harry with the Avengers showing up later.

This one is definitely not new but is a fun crossover with Supernatural that I rarely see recommended. Linkffn(Hunter by Sakurademonalchemist)

** There's only two chapters, and it's very unlikely there will be any more anytime in the near future, but this is really interesting concept wise. Its a HP BNHA crossover where Petunia is a pro hero. Basically wizards and the wizarding world are still the same, but non wizards all have quirks and the muggle world is the BNHA world with pro heros and villians, etc.
