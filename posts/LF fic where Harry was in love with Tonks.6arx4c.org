I'm racking my brain trying to remember this fic, but all I can remember was Harry was in love with Tonks but never did anything about it, she married Remus, etc. They both die and Harry and Andromeda are talking to each other and Harry talks about his love for Tonks.


** I just went through it again with Ctrl-F because I wasn't sure if i was thinking of the right fic and just wanted to post the relevant section because it's amazing. Anyone who doesn't love Tonks will find out why they should and anyone who hasn't read 'A fine spot of trouble yet' will want to.

  Suddenly a hard, wet laugh left his lips as Harry banged his head back against the bed he lay on. "Do you know who my first crush was? My first, real crush, not just being smitten with a pretty face?"

  Andromeda studied Harry for a moment, before leaning closer and lightly stroking his hair for just a moment. "If I had to guess? My daughter."

  "Right on the money! Oh, she was brilliant! She lived! She was life!" Harry laughed again, a wet, bitter laugh as he hugged his arms suddenly tighter across his chest. "That summer before fifth year... I was like a bloody moth to the flame. Not that Tonks really knew it. But, I was just a kid, and she was an Auror, and by then, with Cedric dead, I know I wasn't living in a fantasy world anymore."

  "So, I just smiled and tried to be a kid. Filed in with my friends, and I acted like a kid does." Harry shook his head slowly, softly. "Oh, how much I wanted to hurt Remus when he hurt her. The last link I had with my parents, the last piece of my family, and I wanted to hurt him for hurting a woman I barely knew, because he dared to just barely DIM that light.

  "But then, they were taken from me too. The last of the Marauders and brightest light I ever knew. Ripped away in what should have been the best times of their lives! And they left me to watch over their son." Harry clenched his fingers tighter as he suddenly pulled his knees back to his chest as he could feel Andromeda's hand soothingly rubbing against his back. "Seventeen years old and I had to take care of the son of the last of my father's best friends, and a woman I wished could have been mine.

  "That's the first time I wanted to forget," Harry said it so softly as he squeezed his eyes shutting tightly sobbing out the words. "When that hit me, when I realized that, I just wanted to forget all about it."

I believe there's another scene with Andy and Daphne in which they talk about Teddy and how Harry is always reminded that that could have been his child but i can't seem to find it right now.

** It is A Fine Spot of Trouble By: Chilord, bit of an odd fic but entertaining enough.
