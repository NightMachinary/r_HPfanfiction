What if the Hogwarts Heads had to rotate through being Heads of the other Houses. Maybe a month each. They each have their own preconceived notions about what it will be like and they are utterly destroyed.

Hufflepuffs are seen as idiots, as sweet duffers who would never hurt a fly. But instead they keep getting escorted to the hospital wing because they worked till they dropped. And when it turns out that one of their own has been bullied by another house its like trying to corral an army or stop bees after their hive has been smashed. They're more vicious than any houses besides slytherin and their curses range from inconvenient to downright /nasty/.

Ravenclaws are seen as studious and haughty which isn't wrong for some. But they are downright /insane/. They have the largest betting pools, smuggling rings, and parties. Why do homework when you can build a model of the venetian sewer system? The /experiments/!!! They are responsible for most of the school rules, especially the overly specific ones. Its like herding cats from boxes...damn impossible. Everyone constantly fails classes and never does homework.

Gryffindor is the only house with a reputation that actually matches the reality. Thing is...its still hard to deal with. Over a hundred hotheaded teenagers in a small space. Fights, duels, game tournaments, shouting and loud music. Its the loudest place in the castle and the most dangerous with all the pranks and inventions everywhere.

Slytherin is known for being cruel and traditional. While house politics do happen its not as severe as it could be and really only happens from 3rd year up. The gossip and information hub that is the slytherin common room is crazy. No one in the castle has secrets within the dungeons. Especially that which can be used for blackmail. And the students are too sneaky for their own good.

How would head house head deal with each house?


** Oooooh i want to read this now. I believe it would be really hard for Snape to have his preconceived notions destroyed.

*** Oh definitely!!!! I think that he would have so much trouble with the Hufflepuffs. He's a person that definitely made younger students cry on a regular basis and they would either snub him or outright attack him when they finally have the chance and he tries to deal with interhouse issues. He'd be forced to realize that theyre not pushovers and through very active means at that!!!

** It's not quite what you're looking for, but Snape, Head of Hufflepuff, plays with these ideas a tiny bit.

  Why would Albus ask Severus to be the Head of Hufflepuff? Why should Severus accept? How would a Severus succeed in working with this house?
