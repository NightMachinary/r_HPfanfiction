:END:
A long time ago, I read this Hermione/Severus fanfic where Hermione time traveled. I can't remember the title or author, so I'm having trouble finding it! Dumbledore sends Hermione back to fix things, and (of course) she fell in love with a young Severus Snape. Past Dumbledore sends her back to the future when he realizes she's pregnant. Meanwhile, in the future, it turns out that Snape's memories of her had been blocked until the day she traveled to the past, so he didn't remember her while she was his student. I think he also has a letter explaining things? Not sure. In the end, they end up together I believe. Has anyone read this fic? I know there's a lot of other time traveling fics out there. Thanks!
