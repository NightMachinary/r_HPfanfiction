Not bothered about the slash or who's in it (obvs preferably at least HP) as long as it's got the camping element that was focused on in the books. Thanks!


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]) has a big camping - or at least living in hiding - aspect IIRC

*** Not OP but I just read this and it's AMAZING, I was so sad when it ended. Tbh it ended rather abruptly, but I see why it didn't continue, too.

**** I'm kind of worried about that Harry/Draco tag. Are the pairings important?

***** Kinda but not really, there is a chapter where Harry and Draco get really close and humor ensues. Mostly though Harry likes Draco well enough but doesn't like his attitude or "posh" appearance. You could ignore the pairing and still enjoy the fanfic.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
