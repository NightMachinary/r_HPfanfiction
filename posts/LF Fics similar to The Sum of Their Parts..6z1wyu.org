** Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find similar fics despite my effort.

The second part of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), bears some similarities, but the protagonists were facing significantly better odds.

**** That's something characteristic of the author. His plots are very good, they just seem to take ages to play out.

**** Padding out a story can be a good or bad thing. It all depends on how the author writes it. In this case, Starfox5 did not do a good job in that regard. The story drones on and on. I've tried to read it numerous times but I just can't get more than two or so chapters in.

The overdone and cliched Harry/Hermione pairing isn't even an issue for me.

***** I really can't take your opinion seriously when you didn't even notice that this is, as the story synopsis clearly states, a Ron/Hermione pairing.

****** I wasn't even discussing The Sum of Their Parts. I was referring to the Harry/Hermione pairing in /your/ story. It appears I did not make that clear.

******* And I pointed out that my story has a Hermione/Ron pairing. As the synopsis posted above states.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
