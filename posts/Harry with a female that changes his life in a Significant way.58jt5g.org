** I like [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] and it's sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] for this request.

It's an early example of Harry/Daphne and one of the few Jeconais stories I can stomach - this still carries his signature "everything works out like a fairy-tale and look how cleverly I wrap it up" move but it's got style, and I think it's more well written than his earlier (or most of the later) work.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun): Harry-Bellatrix in marauder era. Decently written fiction. No bashing. Lots of wizarding historical stories.

Linkffn(Dancing in the Green): one-shot with 36k words. Just 4th year. This fiction needs a sequel.

** I would say *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), fits your criteria pretty well:

- The girl was a Slytherin, from a dark pureblood family, and his former nemesis.
- She turned his life around, although the same thing applied to her as well.
- No character bashing, Dumbledore was kind ok.
- Pretty long, almost 400k words.
