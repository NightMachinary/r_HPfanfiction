Because the original ones are frankly unrealistic. Imagine you're playing and your chasers score 14 times, earning 140 points but then maybe the seeker (on the team that hasn't scored anything) on the opposing team has a better and faster broom than your broom and then their team wins while your tram is way better. It's just frustrating


** The biggest example I can think of is the first part of The Firebird Trilogy linkffn(8629685).

Snitches get you fifty points so it's helpful but not a dealbreaker, and the quidditch section is actually pretty entertaining overall.

Vital Paramus and The Quidditch World Cup also feature slightly modified player roles, though the snitch is still a game changer.

At its core quidditch is not that bad: it's a weird cross of dodgeball, polo, and capture-the-flag but on broomsticks. The problem is though that Rowling wanted to make Harry the most important person, who decides how the game goes regardless of anyone else. “He is really great at the most important position on the team, and his success or failure is what decides the game in the end.”

Rowling designed quidditch around making Harry the most important person on the team, since it's his perspective we follow.

Most of the time though, quidditch is in service of other parts of the plot, just as it is in canon. In PS, it sets up Snape as a red herring. In CoS, it lets him speak to Dobby again and see Colin be brought in. In PoA, it prompts Harry to learn the Patronus Charm and sets up his first crush.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

*** You can actually write pretty decent Quidditch scenes if you write the commentary instead of the game scenes (and use British football commentary as inspiration, not the HP canon one). At least that's what my reviews say.

** Sorcerer's Muse has changed the Quidditch rules in her actual series. There're no Seekers at all. In the Author's note at the end of this chapter, the rules are explained.
