Like, I've seen fics where the Twins are shown as the ‚Äúgood‚Äù Weasleys, but I don't think I've ever seen one where Ron is the good one.

And like, I think that could be interesting. There'd be a sort of connection between the Dursleys mistreating Harry and Ron being very uncomfortable with the actions of his family. Hell, you could make parallels between Ron and Sirius, with both of them having shitty families and befriending a Potter.


** I wouldn't say the Weasley's are 'shitty'. At least nowhere as bad as the Black family to Sirius.

It's more a case of 'too many children and too little cash'. There is still love, but attention is divided heavily and Molly and Arthur have a bad case of horrible priority.\\
They earn a ton of money in a random prize, and instead of being smart and saving it, or try to make money of that money, they spend it immediately on a vacation. On luxury.

*** I'm specifically talking about a *Weasley-bashing* */fanfic/*. Not about canon.

‚Äã

I fully know and understand that in canon the Blacks are far worse than the Weasleys. I /like/ the canon Weasleys (yeah, they're not perfect, but they're not bad people).

  Hand me downs and thrift store goods weave tension in any home. Ron learns to deal with poverty in his own unique ways for the better and the worst and learns a thing or two about self-worth along the way. One shot. Cannon Compliant.

** Can't remember what it's called, but there's a Timetravel fic where the prophecy got revealed because of a change, and Harry isn't seen as a saviour by a lot of people, and is treated like crap and hated by the Weasleys til Dumbledore literally forces them to see Harry's memories and grow the fuck up. Ron is on Harry's side the entire time, and I'm fairly sure Ginny is too, and they actively hated their family for a good part of it because of how Harry got treated.

** How do you bash the weasleys but not Ron.... Like wut? Fred, George, bill and Charlie are all well liked characters with no flaws that are worth of bashing. Molly has some flaws that could easily be bashed, ginny is pretty neutral, not easy or hard to bash. Ron is easy to bash because he has such huge and glaring character flaws.

Not sure how anyone could write a Weasley bashing fic and /not/ bash Ron...

If I straight up called someone dumb for requesting a trope, that's one thing. If I called a trope stupid, that's one thing. But in niether of these comments did I do those.

*** Fred and George take the Pranking too far but instead of thinking it's wrong, they believe themself to be doing the right thing punishing those that have done them wrong with "pranks" that are more focused on the pain instead of the laughing aspect of the Prank.

There something to bash them for.

Don't know about Bill and Charlie because I haven't read the Potter books in a long time just seen the movies and they weren't really fleshed out in those.

*** Categories don't have to be the same throughout. Just because you write one character one way doesn't mean you can't write the others differently.

Also, character quality has no connection with how much you can bash them. Sure, it might make it easier or harder, but it's not like characters are completely solid. You can rewrite a story to make a terrible character good, and you could bash a character who was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù in canon. It'd be out of character, but bashing doesn't care about being in character.

...

But hey here's a possible character rundown anyway:

Bill and Charlie are relatively unimportant to the plot and to be honest can be mostly overlooked and the story would still work. However, if you wanted to, you could still bash them pretty easily. Maybe they really want financial security so they can pursue their passions and they don't care how the money is obtained.

Fred and George are so easy to bash. Like seriously I'm surprised that they aren't bashed more often. Just make their pranking be overly cruel (tbh you only need to reframe their actions for this to work, not even change then much). Also, they sold love potions (basically date rape drugs) in their shop.

Percy is practically already bashed by canon at times but it wouldn't be hard to make it worse by making him stricter and more pedantic.

It's not directly towards Harry but Arthur's opinions on muggles being ‚Äúsilly‚Äù or whatever is super condescending and could easily be bashed.

Ginny and Molly already have pretty common bashed versions (love potions), so you could just use those.

Then you just... don't bash Ron? Write him as a good friend who chooses to help Harry over his family. If you think he's a bad person in canon, just make a new version where he's better. Clearly you have no issues changing characters if you're bashing people.

...

Also I feel like Ron is overly hated on by the fandom at times. What did he do that's so bad as to be bashed constantly?

He's sometimes jealous of his rich, famous, and more popular friend. That's hardly unexpected. I'd probably be jealous if my friends were far more popular than me and they never had to struggle with money while I had to use old, worn-down supplies.

He left Harry at the beginning of the TWT, but he returned later. Tell me you've never gotten into a fight with a friend over something dumb and then only made up with them later. He also left during the Horcrux hunt but that was /while under the influence of a Horcrux/, so hardly a normal situation.

He's a bit lazy about classwork, but a lot of kids are. Not everyone is going to have Hermione-like studiousness.

Sure, he holds some prejudices (against werewolves, against Slytherins, etc) but it's not like those are uncommon in the wizarding world. Canon constantly depicts the Slytherins as evil, and prejudices against groups like werewolves is implied to be far more common than acceptance.

The fandom seems completely willing to redeem Draco - who has done so much worse shit (insulting muggleborns for their blood, mocking Harry for stuff like passing out to a dementor or losing his parents, having Buckbeak executed, trying to kill Dumbledore, nearly killing multiple students, etc) - so why not Ron?
