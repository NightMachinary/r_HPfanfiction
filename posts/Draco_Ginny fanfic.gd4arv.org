:END:
I'm looking for a Draco and Ginny fanfic I read years ago. In the story, Lucius hired Ginny to find Draco. Ginny ends up finding him living in muggle London with amnesia. Does anyone know the title?


** Ugh, I know what fic this is but can't remember the name, I do remember it was deleted from FFN and the author deleted the rest of their fics, I'll keep searching for the name
