I don't remember any character mentioning it in canon, but it seems to be in every other fic I read.

  He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorise the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...

  Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented self-stirring cauldrons and they'd be free ...

  "That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager."

  "Come to watch Harry in the last task!" said Mrs. Weasley brightly. "I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?"

  "Oh...okay," said Ron. "Couldn't remember all the goblin rebels' names, so I invented a few. It's all right," he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, "they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn't hard."

  He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four (In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century?), thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end. He had a stab at question five (How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere.

  He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten: Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.

So goblin rebellions do get mentioned more than anything else, but they're not the only thing on the curriculum

They are mainly mentioned in year four. Important wars take a big place in history class. For example: My country has a whole semester of WW2 in history class, because that was the most recent and most important war for the development of my country historically speaking.

I always imagined that the goblin rebellions had a similar importance for the development of the wizarding society. We just don't know about it because a) Binns is a bad teacher and b) Harry isn't an eager student of history.

******* "The first appointed Supreme Mugwump was Pierre Bonaccord. His appointment was contested by Warlocks in Liechtenstein, due to his opinions on stopping Troll-hunting and rights for Trolls. Liechtenstein, which had been dealing with several nasty Troll communities at the time, refused to attend the first conference, causing trouble for the new institution."

****** This is a not-uncommon misinterpretation of memory reconsolidation. Every time you remember something, you open the memory to the possibility of being changed.

A lot of people believe they have extremely detailed memories of big events like nine eleven or JFK or things like that.

But it turns out something like 70% of people remember watching the news on a normal day when suddenly the news cut to the event and they saw the first plane hit the first tower. In real life, that footage wasn't aired until the following day, the twelfth. The footage of the first plane wasn't simply not aired live, it wasn't aired on the eleventh at all.

And there's the relatively well known example of Candid Camera setting up fake parking meters beside people's cars after they parked and went away, and when they came back none of them said "there was no parking meter here when I parked," they almost all "remembered" their justification for their "decision" to not pay the parking meter, like "I was just going to run in and out so I didn't pay."

Think about yesterday. Try to plot out a minute by minute, no, second by second account of literally every word you said and every thing you looked at and every video you watched and every word you read and every thought you thunked and every word someone else said to you. You can't. We forget /everything/. You don't remember 95% of yesterday.

When you recall a memory, you're actually reconstructing the memory. Since you've forgotten most of it, you fill in the gaps. Maybe when you recall the same memory again a few years later, you also remember some of the things you fabricated to fill in the gaps. That's not at all the same thing as remembering the last time you thought about it.

Remember nine elven right now. Let's say you previously remembered it on the tenth anniversary in 2011. You absolutely altered the memory in 2011, inventing events to fill in the gaps between the real events that you actually remembered, subtly altering the actual memories of actual events to make them line up with what you invented.

But right now, you're not recalling the memory of your previous recollection in 2011. You're recalling a memory that was altered in 2011. That's not the same thing, but I can see how people would misinterpret it that way.
