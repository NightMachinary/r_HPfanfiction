First time posting here, I'm looking for a fic and I simply can not seem to find it...

Some time, maybe a year ago, I read one of the best Dudley continuation stories I have ever read. I can't remember most of it, but it was about him moving away from his parents, joining a circus (as a strongman I believe) and meeting his wife. They later have a magical baby.

I know this isn't much, but I hope one of you might have read it and know where to find it (I have no clue on what website I read it). Keep in mind, it might have been deleted, so it might not be around anymore...


** I didn't find a story with a circus in the summary, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dudley-s-Magical-Child/103232/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][here's a list of stories featuring Dudley having a magical child]].

*** Yeah, I found that page while googling for it, but I didn't find it there.
