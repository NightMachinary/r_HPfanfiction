I don't really know how this works but I'm looking for a fic that was or still could be on fanfiction.net. It started with Harry at Hogwarts and he didn't look like James, he made a patron to discover his True family he ends up being Lily's son but with Rabastan instead of James. I forget how but he ends up home with his dad and sleeping with the the dark lord. I remember loving this fic and I have tried so hard to find it so I'm asking if anyone on here knows of its name/location. Please help.


** I beg the people of Reddit to help me in this despreate search, that has been on going for three years my username on fanfiction.net is seapatrol and even if you can't help me I would love any and all information of Recommendations you have.
