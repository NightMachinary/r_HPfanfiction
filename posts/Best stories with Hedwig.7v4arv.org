I always love seeing Harry's interactions with her and wondered if there were any fics that focused on that.

Thanks in advance!


** Hedwig interaction is criminally under represented. Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë has Harry go an adventure with only Hedwig and the Sorting Hat for company, and in Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool she has a relatively large role. linkffn(7287278) linkffn(8175132)

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8524600/1/][Hedwig's Tale]] by RoseDragonWitch is a wonderful story that I think you're looking for. It starts off the day she was hatched as well.

  We all know Harry's story from start to finish; but what about Hedwig's? It couldn't have been easy for an owl to care for Harry. Little do we know is that she has always been there watching over him. This is her story through the years.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

  The real hero of Deathly Hallows was Hedwig; this is her story. A canon-compliant, Deathly Hallows era, spy/military/action/thriller with Hedwig as protagonist. Hedwig/Phantom .

** "A Boy, a Girl, an Owl, and a Train Compartment" by BrokenWingsHealed lives up to its name. Harry meets Luna on the train in a slight variant on OotP, and she and Hedwig take an instant liking to each other. This is the first in a series of stories depicting Harry and Luna as a couple, although that future connection is only hinted at here. The subsequent stories are mostly set post-Hogwarts and so don't really feature Hedwig.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.
