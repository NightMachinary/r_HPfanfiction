Is it just me or is Harry's desire to be "just Harry" come from living with the Dursleys and their pathological desire to be normal? I've never seen this addressed in fic or discussion but I recently remembered a fic where the Dursleys raised Harry as their own & he refused to go to Hogwarts and it got me thinking. This is a facet of Harry that's either kept in tact through drastically altered circumstances or thrown out entirely but not explored. Harry's aversion to fame probably stems from the Dursleys passing on their normalcy complex


** In canon he wanted to be just harry only after the bodies started piling up. Before that I don't think we ever see him minding it. We didn't really see him liking it either though.

Harry did enjoy being special and the center of attention when it was something he earned. Like when he won at quidditch.

*** If I remember correctly he liked his scar because it was unique before he turned 11. That might be a sign showing he liked standing out.

Honestly. I think he likes being famous when it's convenient for him and hates the attention when it's not. I'll respect if he says it.

*** It is, and one of the weirder bits at that. Why would you actually create an inferior version of Harry compared to the existing one? No one ever thought that mediocrity was an interesting character trait.

Harry doesn't want to be normal /or/ "just Harry", he wants to be the one to kill Voldemort. That's about as un-normal as it gets.

**** Petty sure that the “just Harry” thing is a way of making him fit into the reluctant and overly humble protagonist trope. Never saw the appeal personally, but to each their own I guess.

*** It's never explicitly stated in canon other than when harry meets hagrid the first time but its pretty obvious through that all harry wants is a normal life or as normal as one can get as a wizard

**** It's not stated in canon at all. "Just Harry" comes from the 1st movie. And as Triflez points out, he had no problem being the center of attention when it came to quidditch.

***** This. Harry has his fair share of ambition. He's never appreciated his fame, but whenever he does things to earn the attention, he's happy about it.

He's also the Head Auror by 26. That's after just 8-9 years in the department. As anyone in the workforce can tell you, it doesn't matter how much talent you have, it takes ambition and politicking to make your way to a serious leadership position.

****** A lot of him being head auror and then head of the DMLE was cronyism

******* I know it's very popular to set this narrative that Harry becoming an Auror was some kind of world expectation + Rowling betraying her Tory leanings, but in canon, Harry is well suited for the job.

He has a nose for trouble, investigates and puts together various pieces well, and seems to genuinely enjoy Defense Against the Dark Arts. Remember in PS/SS, he's the one that puts the clues together on how Hagrid got the dragon egg and why that means that Voldemort/Snape found their way past Fluffy.

I can also see him thinking that he wants to hunt down and capture Dark Wizards to prevent another Voldemort from happening again, and if he can prevent another family from going through what he went through, he'll consider that a good day's work
