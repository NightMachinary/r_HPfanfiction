Exactly as the title suggests - people with scholastic experience, what advice would you give to someone trying to write a teaching/classroom scene? What makes a good teacher? What makes a bad teacher (other than being Snape :D)? Do you favour anecdotes, the Socratic method, etc? Practicals or theory? Should it be a canon-esque 'learn thing he'll use later' scene purpose, or something that elaborates more on worldbuilding and magical methodologies?

The questions are just suggestions of what advice you might give, but feel free to give any advice you've got. I'm genuinely curious, and maybe stashing up for my eventually writing of one. :D


** From a writing standpoint there is a fine line between world building and exposition vomit. Personally, I think that the best classroom scenes should accomplish at least two things. They can be a mix of, intercharacter devopment, plot hooks, foreshadowing points, and exposition, but shouldn't ever be only for one of those.

Strong world building makes a strong world, but unfortunately doesn't directly correlate to strong writing. If you've worked out a super tight magic system for your fic it can be tempting to add lectures that exposition dump the system on your readers, but it wont work well as a scene unless the exposition of the lecture is relevant to the future of the plot, orbis accompanied by character development.

*** Heh. First rule of worldbuilding - damn near 90% of whatever you plan will never be directly seen by readers (or players, for those in tabletop gaming, which is where I first got the rule from). It just provides the foundation for everything you get to see. So, yeah, world-building exposition for the sake of world-building exposition is something I very much agree with you is a Bad Idea.

I think you summarise it pretty well. Exposit to inform the reader, but also to affect/foreshadow something in the world, plot or character. And always primarily the latter and secondarily the former, I'd add. Informing people of something without giving a point to it is how we get "When am I ever gonna use trigonometry in the real world?" complaints. :D

**** In order to scratch the itch to exposit things that aren't relevant to a story I write little "lectures on magic" or treatises that go into detail on the thing I want to talk about. That way I end up getting it down and out of my head, formalize it, and I have a resource if I ever want to use it in an actual fix. Though I would need to cut down severely if that ever happens.

Going back to the rest of your question, the way I write depends on the teacher I'm writing for. When I write Snape, I start the lecture with a series of questions that are either trick questions, or too of hard of questions, before Snape provides the answers that I want to give. McGonagall I have start with some hard but answerable questions and a demonstration followed by the explanation. The OC professor I write is not interested in hearing too much from his students and generally lectures in a preplanned way, believing that his lecture will answer any possible questions and gets thrown off if someone wants to ask something or take the lesson in a different direction.

***** That's an interesting idea. I do it all the time for my worldbuilding in D&D games (basically provide my players a communal Mass Effect-style Codex with the world details after we set them down, since some of them are really, really crap at making notes). Never considered doing it for prose writing. My writing resources tend to be more commonplace notebooks of scribbles, bulletpoints, and diagrams, with the occasional map for working out combat scenes or 'ridiculous coincidental misses' (eg. Dr Who with Donna and the Doctor).

That... is also an interesting idea. I like the idea that teaching style/skill is less regimented and regulated than modern teaching is, since a system not-too-far-removed from the old Master-Journeyman-Apprentice system would probably be that way. Would make sense of why the teachers always seem to be left to their own devices too, since it'd be 'their class, their decision' tones to everything. Fit the method to their personality, since the method isn't strictly defined and thus there's more room for individuality. Makes sense, thanks!

** The great thing about teaching is that everyone has experienced it... even if you weren't schooled in a traditional environment. Think back to your best learning experiences... chances are those occurred when you were allowed to figure things out on your own. In those situations, you were guided just enough so that the learning process wasn't totally frustrating, but given enough freedom to learn through doing.

Hogwarts tends to skew toward traditional teaching methods of students in large groups listening to a teacher lecturing (Binns is the worst for this) but the scenes where the real learning takes place is when they are given the opportunity to try things for themselves... the practical labs such as Wingardium Leviosa, every moment in Snape's dungeon (he was a terrible teacher because he was verbally abusive, but he did create lessons that were self-correcting), transfiguring matchsticks into needles, flying lessons, hippogriffs and unicorns, blast-ended skrewts, beetles into buttons, and looking through telescopes to chart the night sky.

*** Sure, but it's been twelve years since I was taught at age eleven and I remember bugger all of my actual lessons before my last year of A-Level. Plus, I like reading other people's opinions on things like this. It's really interesting.

I think I see what you mean - you feel that real learning of magic takes place in practical labs over theoretical lectures, basically.

** I gotchu.

As a teacher, the way school scenes work in HP remind me way more of my college/university experience than what goes on in my classroom. If you're looking for what a normal class period with a bunch of 11-17 year olds might look like, I'd suggest switching up activities in lessons. Teenagers (and people in general) tend to get bored when you have them do the same thing for a long time. If you're bored, you're not learning. So switch it up.

If you want to create the effect of an environment where real teaching and learning is going on, the best thing you can do is VARY what's going on in the classroom. A good teacher knows when to step in and when to back off and let the kids do their thing. The older the kids, the more you act as an advisor. For all ages, though, the LAST thing you want to do is stand there and talk forever. You'll bore the kids, and they'll stop learning. Also, your voice will go.

Unless the activity was a group project or I was specifically giving them in class work time, I'd NEVER have a group of 14 year olds spend an entire class period on one activity. Topic, yes. Activity, hell no.

If I were Professor McGonagall, I'd probably structure a lesson on turning toads into teapots in 10-20 minute intervals like this:

10 minutes: Kids come into class, hand in work, etc. There's a set procedure. Maybe they all know to get their textbooks out or something.

5-10 minutes: discuss the goals of the day, what the in class activity will be, possibly briefly touch on homework(though maybe not with a kid like Hermione in my class; I'd be worried about stressing her out and derailing the class with her questions tbh).

10 minutes: independent activity that provides basic information about the process of turning toads into teapots. Maybe it's important to know which leg you want to turn into the spout, etc. Some sort of reading guide so that kids know what info to look for as they read.

10-15minutes: discuss the reading. This can be in pairs, a small group, as a whole class, etc. Whatever works best. Have them compare answers. Bring the whole group together so everyone has the same info.

20-25 minutes: try it out. Fail. Go back to reading, try and figure out why. This is when I'd be walking around and providing help/guidance to kids who are flailing around and singeing their robes. Students who excel can act as â€˜assistant teachers' and help with this part, meaning I'd probably put Hermione with Neville the whole dang year. I noticed Rowling does this in canon, which makes me think she's DEFINITELY got experience being or having a Hermione in the classroom. :)

10 minutes: bring the whole class back, have kids share what went right and wrong, provide tips, etc. Maybe they do this in small groups. Kids will brainstorm ways to improve. (I'd likely have some sort of checklist/parchment they could record ideas)

20 minutes: try again! Record what you changed about your spell casting! How did that affect the toad?

Last 5-10 minutes of class: reflect on progress and come up with three ways you will try to improve for next class!

The principles are the same regardless of what you're teaching. As you can see, I definitely haven't fantasized about teaching magic at Hogwarts. Nope. Never. Another suggestion: I've always head canoned that professors casted sonorus on their throats before class, because I really don't see how it would work otherwise, especially in those big, drafty rooms :)

Oh, and there's always some teacher who hangs around in the staff room all the time and makes you wonder if they actually have classes.

I hope this is what you're looking for! If not, let me know and I'll try and answer!

*** I mean firstly, I've known some people who were really, really able to project well both in classrooms and on stage. It's not unimaginable that they'd be able to talk for long periods while projecting. Listen to Brian Blessed talk, for one celebrity example. :D

Secondly, yep! That's the kind of thing I'm looking for. Writing a classroom scene that blends into the plot is one thing, but making it educationally sound is what I'm looking for and your comment says precisely how you think that should be done.

Thirdly, thanks for your comment!

*** When does Rowling put Hermione with Neville? I only remember that one scene where Hermione offered to help him during potions. But maybe I thought you meant that Rowling uses this method where a teacher asks her to help someone.
