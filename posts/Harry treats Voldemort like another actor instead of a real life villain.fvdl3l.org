Imagine that if, during the final battle, or even somewhere in between his resurrection and the battle of Hogwarts, that when he calls out Harry, that Harry stands up yelling “Cut!” and then berating Voldemort for not getting an updated script, saying something about the producers decided that Harry wasn't dramatic enough and they had changed his name to Hadrian (or anything else that's been in fanfics). Voldemort is, of course, completely confused and it leaves him open to a curse from Mad-eye or Bill Weasley?

It's just something that came to me this morning after a long shift on nights, but I'd be glad to read anything that someone could come up with...


** This reminds me of that fic with many alternate Harrys during the ritual in the cemetery. One of them was a YouTuber and he was glorious.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** /After the final battle/

Harry: Oh yeah, I've loved working with Voldemort! So professional, always remembers his lines. It's too bad this is his last film project -- loved working with the guy!

** Cut

What in the name of Merlin do you think you are doing? Who had the bright idea of making you the dark lord? Even Trevor the toad is better than you. You call that Hippogriff dung acting? And what is up with your accent or stuttering or whatever the hell it is. /Avaduh Kedavra./ Even I was better than that when I was 15 months old. Either he goes or I go. I can't stand this sub par no name drunk you picked up from a dumpster.
