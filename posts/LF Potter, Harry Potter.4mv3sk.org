Looking for a fic where Harry Potter is a "James Bond" type character in the magical world. Hermione would be his agent Q. Not sure if a fic like this exists but it would most likely be an interesting read. Thanks

** I don't recall that exact plot, but there are a few where he is a spy.

"Agent Double O Hex" - Harry is raised by his uncle Bond, James Bond. Hermione is his nemesis. Both attend Hogwarts when they are not trying to "kill" each other and causing international incidents.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]: No-Magic AU. Hogwarts is school for spies. James Bond is real - James Potter was 007. Hermione is the gadgeteer, hacker and data analyst of Team Potter. Ron is the strategist. Harry is the boy who lived twice.

I've written [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl]["Harry Potter and the Spygirl"]], where Hermione has some second personality hiding in her head with a spy's skillset. Harry gets trained in the business as well.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.

** Linkffn(7774132) has a very James Bond slant to it.

  There are times when "Oops!" is the last thing you want to hear. When you're in the middle of having a demon fox upgrade your body is one of them. A funny tale of consequences and accidental breakages.
