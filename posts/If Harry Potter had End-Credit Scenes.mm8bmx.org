1. /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ End-Credit Scene

· At Malfoy Manor, Lucius is in his study, reading an article on Arthur Weasleys' proposed Muggle Protection Act. Sneering, he looks through his desk, at an array of cursed items. Seeing something, Lucius smiles. “That should do it,” he says grinning wickedly.

1. /Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/ End-Credit Scene

· On a stormy night, in Azkaban, two nervous guards hear an unsettling noise from one of the cells. Uneasily, they approach, and yell, QUIET! The noise grows and soon they hear a voice. “He's at Hogwarts. He's at Hogwarts.” The voice repeats.

1. /Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ End-Credits Scene

· In Albania, a rat scurries through a dense forest. The rat changes into Wormtail, tired, but relieved he is safe and alone. Just as he is relaxing, he hears a voice, “Long time, Wormtail.” Nervously, he turns and replies, “Master!”

1. /Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/ End-Credits Scene

· Mid-Credits: Minister Cornelius Fudge is bossing his underlings around, beginning the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. One of his underlings asks how he plans to deal with someone as powerful as Dumbledore. With a sneer, Fudge replies, “Get me Undersecretary Umbridge.”

· End-Credits: At Azkaban, a Death Eater approaches a cell and asks a mysterious figure if she feels it. Looking at the Dark Mark on her arm active on her arm. The figure turns with a smile, revealing Bellatrix Lestrange.

1. /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ End-Credits Scene

· At Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix falls to the ground after being tortured by Voldemort. A number of Death Eaters have been tortured due to their failings, but one, Narcissa Malfoy, remains unharmed. Voldemort commands her to go fetch her son. Narcissa looks horrified, until, with a wicked smile, Voldemort replies, “Don't worry, I will not harm him. In fact, I have a special mission for him.”

1. /Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/ End-Credits Scene

· Mid-Credits: On the Hogwarts Express, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sit in silence and sadness. Harry looks out the window and sees Fawkes flying into the mountains, disappearing into the clouds. Harry is left to realize Dumbledore is truly gone.

· At Hogwarts, Headmistress McGonagall sits behind her desk, reading the list of students joining her this year. When she spots that a Weasley and two Potters are joining the school, she looks horrified. “Maybe it's time to retire,” she says to herself.

** I mean, PoA's credits would give away the end of GoF, because we would be expecting Voldemort to return from the start then.

Both credits in GoF would be amazing!

HBP's last scene would be nice if we saw Mundungus stealing objects from Grimmauld Place and Kreacher trying to get them back, but without emphasising the locket. Just him grabbing everything in sight.

Though, we shouldn't see him selling anything, because when Kreacher says in DH that Mundungus stole the locket, we still don't know what happened with it and expect it to be with him. So seeing him selling the locket would spoil the twist.

DH's credits is my headcanon lol /James Sirius Potter/ is starting Hogwarts and he is related to Fred and George. This is like the ultimate fusion of troublemakers. McGonagall could foresee the headache he'd give her, but the decision to retire came when he set something on fire before the end of the Start of Term Feast.

I feel like the end-credits scene for HBP should be more along the lines of Mundungus taking things from Grimmauld Place though. Especially for people who haven't read the books, the moment where it is revealed that Umbridge is the one with the locket is a big moment and provoked a strong emotional response from the audience, so I feel like this should remain a surprise until the exact moment. Just my opinion though! I really like your ideas for all of these :)

PoA: Bertha Jorkins is in an Albanian bar when she tilts her head as if she's heard something, and rises from the booth where she's reading over a Ministry form for notifying the Muggle government about importing four dangerous creatures - three dragons and a sphinx - into Scotland in late November. She gets up and heads to the back, near the restrooms; she shakes her head as she thinks aloud that she was hearing things - and as she turns around, Wormtail is there, an evil, lecherous look on his face as he says 'Bertha. So long since I've seen you outside of class...'

HBP: the cute waitress at the Cafe Harry was at is the last person there. It is obvious that she is waiting for someone (Harry); after several seconds, she sighs as she gets up from her seat - and the lights in the Cafe go out several seconds after she goes into the back.

DH, Pt.2: as the boats with Albus, Rose, and Scorpius travel across the lake, we see Moaning Myrtle watching the annual tradition from the clock tower. As she stands there, we see two other ghosts - Fred Weasley and Cedric Diggory - glide up to stand beside her and watch. All three smile at the sight.

#+end_quote

What makes Umbridge such a great villain is that she's not an Evil villain. In D&D terms, it would be lawful evil. She's a bigoted but otherwise everyday incompetent bureaucrat who let power go to her head. Likewise in the end credits for the HBP, she's not going to take the locket from him, it'll be Fletcher who tries to bribe Umbridge, or perhaps she finds it in an inventory locker and thinks it looks pretty, and then the locket calls out to her.
