:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Lily lives because Voldemort spared her (?) and she had her memories wiped of James and Harry and was living with Snape. After breaking through the memory wipe and compliance spells, she starts to plan on how to kill Voldemort. It's dark and she is involved with Snape sexually but still in love with James.

In the end she duels Voldemort and kills him by breaking and charming a vial of poison back together. The plan was that the vial would break upon her death because it was her magic holding it together and the poison would leak onto Voldemort, killing him.

Regulus, Sirius, Snape are all alive in the end.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
