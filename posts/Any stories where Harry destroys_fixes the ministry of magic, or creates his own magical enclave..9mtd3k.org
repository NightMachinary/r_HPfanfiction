I know i'm asking for a little bit of fanon with this request, but the government in HP is pretty bad, at least until the end. Yes I also know i'm asking for a unrealistically intelligent Harry, and probably a unrealistically powerful Harry as well. It's just what i'm in the mood for. A 'fix-it' fic as it were. Also i'd rather that if the story is incomplete, Harry has at least made a large diffrence in the government, or has at least got some people working on his enclave with it being partially done.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** As for fics having him making his own magical enclaves, "For the Love of Magic" is certainly one, but I don't like it at all so I will not link it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]] by Bobmin356, linkffn(8837257), is a lot better, but still uses some of kind of Deus Ex Machina to overpower Harry. I'm not found of this plot device.

Of course, there is always the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban][Lord of Caer Azkaban]], linkffn(2107570), in which he (obviously) turned Azkaban into his new home. From the same author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On an Island in the Sun]], linkffn(9279255), is a fun read too.

*** +1 for On an Island in the Sun, with a crazy supportive Dumbledore, who thinks its a clever loophole and helps Harry using that loophole. I particularly like Dobby's preparation for speech to House Elves ""Dobby has found the promised land," the little elf began, "the great and wonderful Harry Potter sir is making a place where house elvies may clean all that they can." Dobby frowned at his expression in the mirror, it just wasn't quite right yet. "Dobby had better take things from the top," the house elf said to himself. He nodded to himself and turned back to the mirror. "Dobby has a dream . . ."

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** I really should make a list of fics i've read already. I know about this one fic where harry is really OP, builds an island, starts collecting people and magical beings finds some magic from merlin's time on a museum, tortures some ministry people who try to force him to some tropey stuff, mad scientist luna gives them magic nanobots that will make every magical have non magical children. Hides the island for 1000 years while time goes faster or slower inside, can't really remember.

​

Another one follows pretty much the same plot but they go to the moon, harry is reaaally OP with several wives, one of them being soul bond voldemort but in a non romantic way. They pretty much build a magical utopia where travel to the earth is regulated, like you can go there but if you want to live there you can't come back. I think they also stole all magical babies too in some automatic magical way but I may be wrong :B
