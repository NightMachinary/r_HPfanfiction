And what do you not like? In terms of tropes, characterization, plot... anything really.


** Harry Potter magic is incredibly powerful, I hate when it's nerfed to make a crossover viable.

** I really hate when fics ignore that the books are set in the 90's with no explanation.

I love when fics don't ignore canon friendships, even if the fic isn't about that. I also like comparing them with crossover relationships. (i.e. in a HP/LOTR crossover, would Harry view Sam, Merry & Pippin as substitutes for the Weasleys and not see them as individuals?)

If the character is in another world with no chance to go back, I like seeing (realistic) angst about that. I also like characters making stupid mistakes fron trauma and struggling to fix them.

** Don't nerf HP magic. That being said Steelbadger's fantastic The Shadow of Agmar manages to stop HP magic taking over instantly through brilliant means.

Leave Hogwarts behind. Leave Harry Potter's world ideally HP world with its anti-muggle charms etc make it very hard to have a muggle universe work in any way. Also compare what a character from a fantasty or historical title can do in HP vs what Harry can get up to in theirs. What does having a sword waving hero do in Harry Potter? He gets banished away, apparated away from, they can't do anything. Harry Potter magic on the other hand, it can do a lot.

Embrace the differences. Have each other find things wierd. Nothing is more jarring than when the characters find everything normal. That doesn't mean they can't adapt. Havoc Side of the Force is great with this.

I strongly dislike stories where Harry is not an adult in the crossover. I don't care for Harry raised by Darth Vader or simmilar interesting. As a result of Harry being an adult we know he did some growing up. That means he can be /slightly/ out of character without it being jaring. Voldemort was such a huge part of his life it makes sense for him to be a different person without Voldemort out there. I believe whatever Harry would have experienced in the years between Hogwarts and the crossover will have shaped him as a person. I strongly dislike these stories because I do not see the point of doing a Harry Potter crossover without a trained magic user.

Have Harry have clear goals that make sense. Harry finding himself in the middle of a war shouldn't take sides until he knows more or if he does he should regret it if he picks the wrong side. Why would he even fight in someone else's war? Does it parallel his conflict with Voldemort in any way? Is he simply trying to end it as quickly as possible to protect the innocent victims? If so why is he fighting rather than just going to the leaders directly?

Have Harry morally object to things. Slavery in GoT for example is probably more important to him than a fight over a stupid chair.

Harry Potter magic is amazing and versitile. A fully trained wizard with some experince is crazy powerful and was only kept in check because both sides have magic. You really don't need Harry to go on twelve spirt walks come back covered in stupid tattoos that you tell us are really powerful but actually do nothing important. If they're a good wizard they're good enough already and everything else seems silly.

** I love it when Harry is dumped in a different world as he is and learns to deal with new situations with his magic. Basically, I want Harry the Wizard leaning too deal with his situation on the new world, so no Harry losing his magic and turning himself in a Jedi!Harry, Witcher!harry, muggle!harry, etc. Harry retaining his magic is a must or it is not even a Harry Potter crossover.

I am also a big fan of characters driven stories, seeing Harry dealing with new people and society with different values is really interesting.

** I don't like when people exaggerate the effect magic has on electronics. I see this problem a lot in MCU crossovers. While I can believe a highly magical place, like Hogwarts, would interfere with electronics, I can't think of any example in canon where the presence of wizards or the casting of spells interfered with electronics.

** I love crossovers where the impact of adding in hp magic to whatever powers exist is looked at and not just handwaved away because one type is just more powerful. Linked to this is that having a wizard in one setting or a "visitor" in hp setting should Change canon, not just have a plot rehash with same things happening but now there is magic/jutsu/guns/the force/etc. Yes of course say a big event like say white walkers in asoiaf will likely still occur with wizards present, but the civil war(s) beforehand should certainly be impacted.

** I want to see crossovers that involve the trio, not just Harry. Preferably it would involve the Wizarding World.
