** I wish you all the success in the world. Here's some tips, Most of the satellite HP fanfic subs use [[/r/naut][r/naut]] Here is a [[https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit][link to the github for it.]]. To replace the link at the top with a image I used the following piece of code

#+begin_example
  .pagename a {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 69px;
  width: 407px;
  background: url(%%logo%%);
  vertical-align: bottom;
  text-indent: -99em;
  }
#+end_example

To get the logo I went to [[https://flamingtext.com/logo/Design-Harry-Potter]], make sure to turn off the clouds in the background. I think I used a 46 high font. Change the Height and width in the code to match the pixels of your logo.

*** And you are also allowed at [[/r/AntiRomioneShippers/][r/AntiRomioneShippers/]]... it's for people who dislike Romoine, for any reason. Prefer Ron/Luna? Think Hermione should die in a fire? It is not for any one ship, just anti one specific ship.

**** I like Hermione, though I prefer her as a lesbian. I'm not partial towards who Ron gets paired with so long as it isn't Hermione

Oh silly me, and here I thought that the sub about pairing Harry and Hermione was about stories where Harry and Hermione are together.

On that note, you will obviously also start a crusade against [[/r/Dramione]], [[/r/Tomione]] and all the other subs about pairing Hermione with anyone other than Ron, right?

***** With 3 posts all by the same guy, and out of the 6 people replying one has Dramione in their name and another a Slytherin reference. That does not look like the main crowd from [[/r/HPharmony]]
