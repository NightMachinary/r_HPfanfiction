I don't really know much about this fic other than it's where harry is in another country (America I believe) where he meets with a magical council and they place the memories of Voldemort's horcrux into “a book” within his mind and he wears a dream catcher designed to prevent people from entering his mind, this is before (I think) the sorting.

If you know what this is please let me know.
