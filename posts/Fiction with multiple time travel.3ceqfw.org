I want a time travel fiction where MCs timetravel multiple times because they fail each time. One and only condition is i want it to be completed and long(>100k words).

Thanks in advance :)


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon by willyolioleo) should do the trick, I think.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Besides BWP book 2, which [[/u/JWBalls]] already mentioned, I know of another that /almost/ fits the requirements. (I won't offend by linking it--while complete, it's not 100k+ words.)

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
