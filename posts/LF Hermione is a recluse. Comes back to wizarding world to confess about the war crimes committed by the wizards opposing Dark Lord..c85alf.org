Hermione waits for the death of Neville Longbottom, who was Minister of Magic. Then confesses war crimes committed by the wizards opposing LV. He's the last one to die of all the people she wanted to confess about. There's one part where Ron and a few people torture Lavender Brown or some other girl from their year, in one of the prisons where they keep captured POWs. There might have been a hint of Luna and Hermione relationship or something.
