Basically, as the title says, I'm looking for good fics where Harry gets sent back in time to the Marauders Era. I know there's tons out there but so many of them seem to focus on how Harry has to 'preserve the timeline' and thus can't do anything. I want to read one where he can use his foreknowledge to change things. He can still make mistakes and some of the consequences of his changes could be bad, I hate stories where he goes back in time and doesn't even attempt to save his parents. That feels so OOC for me. I also love stories where his past parents find out who he is.

​

I'm up for basically any pairings, though no slash for Harry. I don't mind slash if its in background pairings, just not the primary one.

​

If anyone could help me out with any recommendations for stories to read, I'd appreciate it.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

Harry isn't obsessed with preserving the timeline per se, but he does think about it. Nicolas Flamel tells him that paradoxes are a government conspiracy.

Luna probably loved that.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** There is always Delenda Est linkffn(5511855).

As an aside, why are the only decent (and completed) Harry time travel fics Harry/Bella? I don't mind, just found it odd.

Delenda Est does have sequels, although I've never read them and the story pretty much complete without them.
