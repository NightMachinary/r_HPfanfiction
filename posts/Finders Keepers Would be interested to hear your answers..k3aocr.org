** Like for many in the fandom, the [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Draco_Trilogy][Draco Trilogy]] by Cassandra Claire was my first introduction back in 2001-2002. Was totally blown away by the insane quality and crativity of a fan written novel.

I don't go out of my way to tell people that I read fanfiction, but my partners over the years have always been aware. Same for my friends.

** I don't even hide the fact that I write fanfiction that much, just my writings.

I'm past my 5th year of fanfic reading, started with Undertale if you'd believe it, followed shortly by HP because, y'know, books of my childhood and all that. First fic I read was a dumb "what if X", don't remember what but I loved it, but my first really massive fic was a "Harry is not the BWL but he actually relly is!", ecxept he really wasn't, and the BWL was his sister. Never managed to find it again, so I'm sad.
