** In this fandom, Tom Riddle/Lily Potter from linkao3(October). Tom met MoD!Harry and never went full Bin Laden Instead he became a Muggle Studies professor in Hogwarts, met Lily and had a daughter.

In other fandom, Tywin Lannister/Sansa Stark.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

I can't find it anywhere, and sometimes my bookmarks have disappeared if the page has been deleted.

Feel free to search on your own, though. And please give me the link if you should find it.

For a little more information, I believe the title was one word. There were parts from the dementor's perspective, in which Harry was reffered to ambiguously. It's sorta bestiality, the dementor is doing what it's doing to feed off of Harry's emotions, so it can make another dementor. There was some special room in azkaban where this all happens. That's all I remember.

  Harry Potter has made a Youtube channel, at the insistence of his friend Luna. A small one-shot that is mainly humor with a little crack? I mean it isn't canon at all but it is funny.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** Obligatory Dobby/Sorting Hat but seriously, Lucius and Remus. It was in a fic where Harry goes dark and Remus and the twins follow him. Had some other pairings but that's the weirdest out of the two I remember. The other was drarry.

(Side note: unsure if this was the same fic but- Snape x Voldemort. Seriously.)

Edit: Okay so I just remembered that there was a Harry/Dementor fic out there. It was a smut fic, one-shot, and I'm 90% sure it was part of a kinktober series or something like that. I've read it twice, for whatever reason, and it was decently well-written. I think it was on ffn, but it might be on Ao3, it's been a long time since I've even thought about it.

  (Complete) The love of the Minister's life disappeared just before the end of the First Wizarding War. When he finds her again, he can hardly trust his sanity. His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home. Hermione soon finds herself in the early 70s surrounded by future followers of the Dark Lord.
