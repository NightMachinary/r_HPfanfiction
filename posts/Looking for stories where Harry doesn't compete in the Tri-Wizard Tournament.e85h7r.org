I understand why Rowling did it the way she did, maybe she didn't even come up with certain things yet, but at the same time; re reading the book, it feels so strange that Dumbledore and the others allowed Harry to compete in the Tri Wizard Tournament, especially since it's well known between Dumbledore and co that Harry is wanted by Voldemort.

Maybe they put Harry under the Truth Serum, or something to that affect. Doesn't have to be exactly that, but something. So Harry doesn't end up going to the Tri Wizard Tournament. Maybe the fake Mad Eye Moody, goes crazy with the idea of Harry not competing and ends up giving himself away, or tries to kidnap Harry or something else.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Would rather not have Dark Harry Potter, if possible.


** Nobody 'allowed' Harry to do anything. His name being placed in the Goblet forms a binding magical contract which obligates him to take part. None of the authority figures involved could do anything about it. Canon makes no mention of what the penalty for not taking part would be, but the implication is that it's somehow worse than being stuck in a tournament with an established death toll.

And no, they couldn't have put him under truth serum. Well, they could, but it would be pointless. It doesn't matter in the slightest that Harry didn't put his name in the Goblet, what matters is that it came out.

*** Yes I know, but I was meaning a general thing or an AU story that could be made to work.

*** You know That part never made sense to me. That he had to is such a weak excuse

If it was that easy, just throw in Tom Marvolo Riddle and confund the goblet. And bam, you have instant dark lord cure

***** I know which one you're talking about. Though the name escapes me as well

But during my search i found this one which plays with this concept and is quite a good short read
