Ideally, the new character would romance Hermione, and this fic could take place around the time of Hogwarts.


** I'd recommend A Curse of Truth

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth]]

By: butalearner

An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

Rated: Fiction M - English - Drama/Humor - Harry P., Hermione G., OC, Daphne G. - Chapters: 28 - Words: 198,847 - Reviews: 680 - Favs: 1,046 - Follows: 502 - Updated: Mar 3, 2013 - Published: Oct 6, 2012 - Status: Complete - id: 8586147

It's a self-insert but it's good, I promise, and has a love triangle between the OC/Hermione/Harry.

But I'm not sure about the romance part.

*** A Curse of Truth looks highly unorthodox, but intriguing, thanks for the help.

*** A Curse of Truth is probably the best SI fic I've ever read and I recommend it highly.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][The Natural 20]] has an OC who has been summoned from a universe that functions on a RPG mechanics (so it's the default trio+OC). 265,512 Words, WiP.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] --- IIRC, this one fits your criteria also, but I'm not sure. You can check it for yourself and see if it's relevant here or not, but I'd not recommend reading further than Ch 11-12, because the quality considerable worsens after that. 251,803 Words, Complete.

** Just started it, and not really any plans for Hermione/OC though they will have a close friendship. If you want to give it a shot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10672126/1/String-Theory][String Theory]]
