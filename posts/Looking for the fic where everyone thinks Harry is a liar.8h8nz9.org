I've been searching forever for this. Please help me. Draco is some kind of specialist mind-healer for St. Mungo's and one day Harry is arrested and brought in for him to heal because nobody can figure out why he's become a serial liar and a law-breaker. Draco figures out he was cursed for people to think he's a liar, but he had to fight through a lot of past resentment and what seemed to be hatred and resistance from Harry to get there. I don't remember the title of the fic but I do know it was pretty long and a slow-burn. Also was a Drarry.


** Is it this one?

It's A Reckless Frame of Mind by Lomonaaeren.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682349/1/A-Reckless-Frame-of-Mind]])

There's also a sequel called A Determined Frame of Mind by Lomonaaeren.

******** Ah... thank you! I was going nuts with the bot ignoring me, but you've given me the clue I needed.

The thing is that I did not see the slashes in my own post. I use Chrome, not an app, and when I make a reddit post by default the text box where I write the post was using something called the "Fancy Pants Editor". That editor obviously inserted the slashes but they were invisible to me. As soon as I clicked on switch to Markdown and tried again it worked. :)
