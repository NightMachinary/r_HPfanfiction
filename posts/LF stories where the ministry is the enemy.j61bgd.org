Protagonist can be light or dark or whatever, they can also fight against Voldemort or Dumbledore or whoever, as long as destroying or toppling the ministry of magic is one of their priorities.

Seriously fck the ministry, I'd like to see any form of resistance, rebellion or war fare. Propaganda, pranks, terrorism, assassination: yes please.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

** Well, in my story "Divided and Entwined", the Muggleborn Resistance is fighting the Ministry as well as the Death Eaters - mostly because the Ministry is riddled with Death Eaters and is hunting them for "murdering upstanding citizens". The civil war involves assassinations, false flag operations, ambushes, bombings, guerilla warfare and open combat.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum Of Their Parts]] it is about Harry, Ron and Hermione fighting a corrupt and incompetent ministry, which even after the war does not know how to do anything right.

Edit: he is also, more relieved with your request, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10179471/1/][The Art Of War]], where the trio (in fifth year) start a rebellion against the ministry and the Death Eaters. This one is much bloodier and more real, up to a point. For example, at one point there is a shooting in which Narcissa is killed and Lucius is seriously injured.
