  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

*** That's the first time I've ever seen anyone rec that other than myself. That makes me happy. I feel like this fic hasn't aged well but it does have its good spots. Nathan Cassane remains one of my favorite OC's. It just feels right to have a strong powerful wizard other than Dumbledore both existing in Britain but also relevant. It also does a great job of having Voldemort (and the ministry) being more competent and also much more ruthless. Voldemort will target 'weakness' whether it be family or a loved one and he will be effective in that.

The accompanying one shot, /Speak Softly, Love/ remains one of the best back stories for a character I've ever read and is simply astounding.
