:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Did I completely imagine this fic? Is it something bizarre I came up with in a dream? I can't find it anywhere but maybe someone else remembers it (or can just confirm that I've gone mad): the story was something to do with Harry working in the kitchen at Hogwarts and he, I think, just thinks he's one of the house elves? But when it comes time for his first year and he doesn't show at the sorting people realize something isn't right?

Seriously, I've been searching for half an hour almost and nothing. I'm afraid I'm losing touch with reality ðŸ˜…


** That sounds better than the crack fic I read when he gets sent back in time and Phineas Nigellus Black turns him into a house elf named Hokey so he can't stop the rise of Voldemort

** Oh man, that does ring a bell! I'm not sure if I ever saved it, though. Probably wouldn't be much help in finding it, unfortunately. But you're not crazy!

** What was the rating, overall word count, any other notable characters, and keywords (for summary) you might remember?

Where did you read it?

*** Unfortunately I never got around to reading it, all I know from it is taken from the summary. It was one of those fics I saw pop up a few times, didn't think it was what I was looking for and skipped over. Suddenly I'm massively curious about the story and of course I can't find it. ðŸ˜…

**** All I'm finding right now are house elf smut so...this search has already traumatized me more than others. I'll keep looking, though.

***** Oh dang, my condolences, friend! House elf smut is like a fanfiction landmine. You're skipping along having a great day and then suddenly, BAM! You'll never be the same again!

Now I don't feel so unfortunate about all the fics I've found just being about house elves stealing baby Harry or Harry learning elf magic. ðŸ˜¨

  Harry has always thought that he was a normal boy. Then Hagrid came and told him that he was a wizard. But that can't be right, can it? When he learns about House Elves, though, Harry is sure that he has finally discovered what he really is. And surely working at Hogwarts will be nicer than staying with the Dursleys...?

  Everyone at Hogwarts is in for a surprise when they meet Harry Potter; his upbringing didn't turn out exactly how anyone expected. AU!
