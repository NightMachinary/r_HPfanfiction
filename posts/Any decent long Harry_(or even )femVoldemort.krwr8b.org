Can be with redemption arc, but no "She was actually a good guy and it all was Dumby plot" Have read Power is Control and sequels, Thunderstorm and Limpieza de Sangre


** Hey I think both of these stories are great, both have a Fem/Riddle or Voldemort, maybe they appeal to you.

AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply.

Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next.

Time Travel AU: Harry Potter had always led a miserable life. That was before his best friend and godfather had their souls sucked out by demons right in front of him. As if things weren't bad enough, he suddenly finds himself in the year 1942. Things only become more complicated when, among others, an enigmatic prodigy fixes her unwavering attention upon him. Harry/Fem Riddle

** linkao3(Unseen Perspective)

Voldemort's actually a pretty chill person, and she is pretty decent (if empathically challenged), but she's not "evil". She bothers Harry by popping over the Little Whinging and taking him out to lunch with her teenage daughter.

Dumbledore's not evil, either. He opposes Voldemort because he disagree with her methods

*** Isnt it generic WBWL fic? I recently started and it started with bullshit like prestigious wand shops in that bad magic street and asshole James who kicked out Harry just for lulz with stupid argumentation. I like bad Sirius and good Peter tho, so I may return there if there isnt boy-who-lived-and- all-good-guys-bashing

**** I think it is kind of worse than that. From what I remember, there are mandatory 11-years old children acting like politicians, Harry is of course more powerful than almost everyone else, everyone invites him for social gatherings and so on, and on top of that there is this super powerful OC noble family that takes liking to him, invites him for their parties, and their super powerful daughters take a liking to him as well and tutor him.

Oh, and the story has almost half a million words and it's still in the second year.

And on top of that, if I'm not mistaken, there is the obligatory 'there is no dark magic, there is only intent' speech on the first DADA lesson.

But still, there's no harm in trying out at least a chapter or two

***** That's what irritates me the most. I don't hate it totally but, seriously. And it's not just there is no dark magic. It's 'there is no good or evil, only power,' which, if you ever hear anyone say, make a quick exit, they're probably evil. Those who reject the existence of any form of evil, subjective, objective or anything, are 87.345% likely to be a dark lord. Harry's just here, and occasionally being a supervillain, and we're supposed to go, 'yep, I'll root for this guy.' I'm willing to say that there is no light or dark magic if I have to, but no way can I say that a character rejecting all morality for the pursuit of power as an eleven-year-old is reasonable. It's like they read the Voldemort speech in the first book, and didn't understand that good and evil didn't mean light and dark. It's so dumb! I don't get how they wrote that! Are they going for Harry being a hypocrite, as in his own moral system he has a concept of good and evil which he judges those around him with, but at the same time claims a lack of morality in order to prevent guilt from his pursuit of power for an inherently selfish goal of his own assured freedom at the expense of everyone around him. This leading to a conflict with himself which creates tension as he tries to construct a moral system which he can follow in a world where he wasn't allowed any goal beyond his own freedom. And I've put more thought in than the author, who uses it as a throwaway quote without any explanation.

**** Minor spoilers

It's not. I don't think it's as good as Sarcasm & Slytherin, which shares like half of the plot points, but it definitely isn't a pure let's insult all the good guys. They aren't nice to them, but in this world, there is a definite reason for their actions, because there's a different prophecy. Now, I've got my own issues with characters like Dumbledore taking prophecies seriously, but it's not done out of idiocy. They present the characters as actual characters making these decisions. With how much I spoiled above I won't get into it too much, but the point is that Harry is a kid. A talented kid, but still a kid, who very much needs to learn. That's a strong point. If you like good Peter, you won't get it, and no bad Sirius either, as he's still made it to Azkaban. While it has flaws, I still think it's worth reading, and at least earns the title of decent.

For a fic I recommend on the lines of the kind of drawn-out world and Voldemort being a legit character that you want, I'd recommend The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali, which isn't finished, but has a good first 19 chapters. It's an evil Dumbledore, and the author has some annoying writing quirks (in my opinion) but shines in Harry's characterization.

edit: I agree with the guy above about every other point though, and I hate it now. yay

I hope this helped
