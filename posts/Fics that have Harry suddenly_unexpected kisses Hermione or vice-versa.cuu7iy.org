i would imagine him being in some sort of Mental state, so he is not crazy, but also not quite himself. Maybe he would even suffer memory loss or something like that. So, when he is able to walk again and Ron and Hermione (or just hermione) come to pick him up, he suddenly kisses Hermione. All expect of Harry being suprised by this reaction, but it wouldnt be classified as cheating or infidelity, since he does that in a state of Illness.

I could think that at some point a Dialogue like this happens:

Hermione: "And Harry doesnt bad kiss either"

Ron: /cough cough/ yeah, right

The fic doesnt have to contain Ron/Hermione or even Harry/Hermione, as long as something like that happens.

I would accept a vice-versa version too, but i cant imagine about any scene with Hermione. Ok, maybe i can, if Harry survives a Dangerous Situation with injuries and she kisses him for Protest because Ron is mocking her again. I must think about Star Wars in this Situation, when Leah kissed a practicaly frozen and injured Luke in front of Han. So a similar situation.
