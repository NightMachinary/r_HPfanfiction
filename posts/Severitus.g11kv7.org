** linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) and linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) are both really good and complete. I also like linkffn(Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof) but it hasn't updated in over a year.

*** I know this is an old post, but I just wanted to thank you for recommending Swung by Serafim. It's not one I've seen and it's not like I'm new to this fandom. ðŸ˜„ I'm only halfway done and I'm despairing cuz it's so well written that I'm actually wishing I won't get to the end. So... long story short (pun not intended!), thanks! ðŸ¥°

*** Yeah I think Swung By Serafim kind of fits the bill. It's a good story

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  AU from the end of OotP. Dumbledore decides that Harry must go into hiding to ensure his safety, and Hermione insists on accompanying him. Dumbledore's plan? Harry and Hermione are to be magically adopted by Snape, becoming his children legally, magically, and physically. My version of the Snape-adopts-Harry story.

** Hmm if you've read all the main ones I'm assuming you've been on the website Potions & Snitches? They have a great collection over there & you can search by Snape flavor (mentor, dad, guardian, healer, etc...)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of][In Care Of]] has a cool set up with Severus being stuck in bat form & Harry taking care of him unknowingly at the Dursleys.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/][Resonance]] is a great one that I read once a year.

And you're probably familiar with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]] by Aspeninthesunlight. Very long but very worth it.

Some of my smaller, unfinished faves have been:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23388586/chapters/56046196][The Best Affinities]] about Harry being Snape's apprentice. (Not finished but still going)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/922767/chapters/1792728][Leo Enter Serpentes]] with a Slytherin Harry

** Linkffn(Brother To A Basalisk) has Harry as friends with Hermione and Ron if I'm recalling correctly. It's lengthy and I haven't been keeping up with it, but it's really good and Harry has a pet snake!

I've read so many Severitus fics but I never keep track/bookmark them so unfortunately I can't help more. Sorry :/

  AU of PoA. Eventual HPDM slash. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle. He follows it- and everything changes. Updated every Friday.
