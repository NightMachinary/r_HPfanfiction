It's not a too complicated or restrictive prompt, but if you want I can add details: "A young, brilliant, and ambitious Dumbledore is sorted into Slytherin. And the story changes completely."


** Dumbledore would have a lot of influence in slytherin, and not very much in gryfindor. He could easily become prejudiced, but he seems to have too light of a heart to do that, so I'm not too sure.

*** Dumbledore didn't have so many regrets when planning with Grindelwald. The path of redemption began after Ariana's death.

**** Grindelwald seems to be an extremely efficient propagandist, though

*** It's implied he had blood-purist leanings as a kid, due to the incident that put his dad in prison.

**** If not blood-purist, then definitely anti-muggle.

** I honestly think that Dumbledore should have been a Slytherin. I'm not a Dumbledore-basher and I love his character, but he is pretty cunning/manipulative in canon. That scene where Snape becomes a spy for the order, and obviously with him setting up Harry's death and the Deathly Hallows.

*** Slytherin's focus though I think is mainly ambition and cleverness/being cunning. Manipulation is more of a side product of this (and how many Slytherins that we see really are manipulative apart from the somewhat clever ones) Not that I think that Albus wouldn't have been one of them. Generally I think (young) Dumbledore would've been put there for his ambition .

***** I mean all that "for the greater good" plans would support that theory. I suddenly had the weirdest thought. Like what if Dumbledore saw himself in Tom Riddle. There was still a lot of resentment for himself that Dumbledore felt at that point in time, you know with Grindelwalds power growing and Albus knowing he had a part in that and maybe that's also why he was so suspicious of Tom. In the end Voldemort was just a child who wanted some attention. He said that "Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the others" and maybe that was because Dumbles saw himself in Tom. After all, the obsession with Death (the Hallows and Horcruxes) and angsty teenage-planning-for-world-domination phase (Voldemort's just lasted a bit longer) fits

*** Agree, Dumbledore should have been a Slytherin or at least a Ravenclaw.

**** I always thought he was more of a Ravenclaw but I can see hwo he would be put in Gryffindor by the hat in hindsight. It took a lot of courage to meet everyone in school eye to eye at eleven with the whispers about his father who was in Azkaban for cursing two Muggle boys and so. I think it was more of a choice of /little/ Albus to end up in Gryffindor. I think he wouldn't want to be put in Slytherin to fuel the rumours around his family anymore and it might have been the choice - wanting to be brave that had him end in Gryffindor. He was a couragous individiual as an adult because even while he might have been hesitant/cowardly at times he always chose to be courageous in the end. I think though that Slytherin and Ravenclaw might have fit him better but as Dumbledore himself said; it is our choices that define who we are
