I think it begins at Harry's sorting. I don't recall if he comes back in time, however, Cedric and Nymphadora (I think?), after their deaths, interrupt the Sorting in their younger bodies, and say that Quirrel is a traitor or something. Then Remus comes in (having also time traveled after his death) and reunites with Nymphadora. There are others I'm sure, but that is what I remember.
