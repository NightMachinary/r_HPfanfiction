** Ugh, no thanks. I can't stand blatant Ron bashing, and I'm not a huge fan of the evil!Dumbledore thing either.

*** Check out his profile for reasoning behind the Evil!Dumbledore, its brings up good points. But I can understand how people feel its cliche and boring

**** You're right, he does. I guess if that was the only thing about this fic that I didn't like I would give it a shot.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart/Lord/Harry Canon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne).

** Very good grammar and spelling, but over-the-top writing and heavy on the clich√©s. Many good plot ideas. Author seems to try too hard.

Technically well written, but the plot leans more towards quantity than quality. A good one-time read, but no favourite.
