Has anyone stumbled over fics which crossover multiple (at least 3, preferably more) fandoms that are interesting and not a pile of rubbish/bad smut?

It's tricky to find them on FFN with their limit to two fandoms per description, and I've always been terrible at wading through Ao3.


** It's not particularly popular, but Prodigy by ChipmonkOnSpeed is HP crossed with a ton of American crime dramas and House. linkffn(3415504)

  AU- Given up after that fateful night, a prodigious Harry Potter ends up in America, working as a Lab Tech/Federal Agent. Now his family wants him back, but can he trust their motives? Can he trust his own? Multi-crossover.

** I stumbled onto SuperPotterLock during a crossover binge I was on. It had a /lot/ going on, what with all the characters in the story. No smut, but it did have a bit of the obligatory JohnLock predestined slash (literally). Might be something going on with Cas. I'm pretty sure his sister's the devil. It's still going on too, around 4th year.

** linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter) is a three-way cross with Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon. It has a completed sequel that contains a large number of small cameos from other anime. Ranma fanfiction is where I started, and a lot of it gets crossed with Sailor Moon.

linkffn(Eldritch Asylum) is good but unfinished, and likely to remain so. It's primarily a Ranma 1/2 story crossed with Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos.

On my "get around to it someday" list, I have:

linkffn(Gods Among Us by arturus) which is crossed with Stargate and Battlestar Galactica: 2003, and

linkffn(A Jedi, a Wizard, and a Scooby walk into a bar), which is, obviously, a cross with Star Wars and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

  A Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover, if that wasn't obvious already. Fair Warning, some chapters will have mature themes in them. Honestly, probably not as good as "The Havoc Side of the Force" by Tsu Doh Nimh. If you haven't read that yet, go do so, like right now. If you have already, maybe you'll enjoy this as well. It can tide you over until the next chapter of that masterpiece.
