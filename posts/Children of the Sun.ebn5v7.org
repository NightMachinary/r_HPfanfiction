I'm not very good at expressing myself through writing, so here goes nothing:

In a world where each witch and wizard have their own familiar (that is a manifestation of their own soul, a bit like daemons in "his dark materials") this author has the gift of making you feel as if you're glimpsing into an actual existing place. They use these "off-hand" descriptions or comments that make their world real and so much fuller for it. This author does not explain you're in a different place, he puts you in it; "He used his hand to gesture to the familiar, as he knew pointing at them was very rude", or "She still found it unsettling to see a wizard without their familiar by their side".

...and that is just my favourite thing about it.

It is very well written (I found only 1 typo/spelling mistake).

Its plot is very interesting, yet not heavy reading (it could've easily given "Firebird" a run for its money in the dark au genre if it had a different tone).

Featuring; Hufflepuff Harry that can be cunning, brave and smart in order to forward his ultimate goal for justice and equality.

Greater Good Dumbledore that isn't bashed (but is removed from the story quite early, he might return - I haven't finished reading the series)

Adults that can be trusted.

And an adorable familiar named Golden that likes stealing Harry's eggs.
