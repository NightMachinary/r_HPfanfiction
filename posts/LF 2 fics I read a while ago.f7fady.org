:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So these are going to be awful descriptions since I haven't read these fics in at least a year and a half.

Fic 1 - sword of gryffindor bonded to harry and he can store it in his right arm and he gets really powerful (somehow) and at the end Voldemort attacks Hogwarts and there's a wormhole (don't remember why) and harry goes through. Part of a three part series where he does some dimension hopping, kills Voldemort again in another universe and then walks in a desert for a few years until he kills some other evil thing that had something to do with black roses or some other black flower and he kills it with a second sword of gryffindor that also bonded with him in the alternate universe he was in in the second part.

Fic 2 - harry can talk to the Voldemort horcrux in his head and it isn't a massive dick. It teaches him and he gets kind of evil but also not and he meets Hermione in a muggle school (think it was primary but not sure). They kiss, shit blows up and then they're evil together.

Thanks in advance and also if I used the wrong flair I apologise I don't really understand how it works


** I really want to know the first one.

** This is a long shot because it's been years since I read this but... is it possible that Fic 1 is Harry Potter and the Sword of a Hero by joe6991?
