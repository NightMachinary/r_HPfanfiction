Harry is sitting in the great hall during breakfast and his crow familiar comes along and harry naturally feeds it a mouse at the house table, Everyone else is disgusted by Harry is just shrugs and says its only natural and they should get over it. Harry then proceeds to walk away with his crow in his shoulder ignoring calls from the teachers to come back.


** can't remember the name but essentially after fifth or sixth year, Harry discovers he is a necromancer and can summon spirits to do his command and suddenly just goes on a violent murder-spree across the entire British wizarding world, using the deceased and calling back the death from the afterlife to destroy and murder others.

I enjoyed it as an edgy teen that didn't know quality if it came up and bit me in the ass, but now I just feel pure unfiltered cringe at the memory of it.\\
Seriously, he was such an edgelord he made Lily kill Snape and Aria kill Dumbledore.\\
Oh yeah. The spirits had no free will. They were essentially slaves to his bidding and made him worse than Voldemort could ever pray to be.

*** Oh yeah, do you also every so often stumble over a fic in your bookmarks which you thought was so good when you read it, only to discover that it plays into all the cringy tropes you now despise (apart from the one or two exceptions which are well written/put a unique spin on it)?

**** It is completely understandable why people dislike harems... However!

I'm actually rather fond of MC/harem, but the females involved MUST have a mind of their own, and at least a half decent characterisation. It all depends on whether or not you can write a proper character dynamic.

And please, do not rely on smut to drive the story! Some people say a harem story with no smut is pointless, but I completely disagree. If writers have to rely on porn to keep their story interesting, it's probably not that good.

I'm actually writing one, myself and I refused to have any smut in it. I wanted the story to be character and plot driven, and I wanted to give each leading lady a character of her own. Too many of these stories are written in such a way, that all the females in the group are carbon copies of each other. I'd like to think I managed that.

Now, I understand that a harem is completely unrealistic, and that it is very much a (juvenile) male fantasy, and that the reasons given for the forming of the group are pretty much always kind of stupid. But I tend to enjoy them, regardless.

The worst thing was Harry casually transforming in the main hall into his animagi form that was a nemean lion, a griffin or something like that.

I REALLY hate when they use magical animals as a form of animagi for Harry. Sometimes it's worse, there are two, one common and one magical ...

** Basically about 99% of everything on wattpad, especially if I am trying to find something like dark or slytherin Harry etc. There's a whole row of fics with pretty interesting plots that look like they were written by 8 year olds on a sugar high. Honestly, I used to be so disappointed everytime I found one of those, but now I just abandoned the site because I can't find anything that isn't what you described.

*** Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc!"

"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are *etc.*, *&c.*, *&c*, and *et cet.* The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

** "Harry is a secret mastermind who has hid his true brilliance ever since first year, and now he's inviting Bones, Fudge, and the Prophet to watch him do something in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament"

Ok.

"Harry spouts a bunch of triwizard mcguffin legalese that basically means everyone has to sit down and be quiet and let him do whatever during the task or they lose their magic, starts throwing a tantrum and mocks/derides pretty much everyone present"

Ok I think I see where this is going-

"Harry recaps the first three books of a bad Manipulative!Dumbledore fic. Dumbledore tries to intervene even after Harry spouted some more legalese, Amelia Bones digs her wand into Dumbledore's gut and starts crassly demanding that Dumbledore give her the elder wand or she'll give him a swirlie. The Evil genius manipulative mastermind/OP defeater of Grindelwald immediately surrenders and becomes a broken man. Harry's powerpoint presentation/tantrum completely overhauls wizarding society, wrecks Dumbledore's whole operation, and generally pwns the noobs"
