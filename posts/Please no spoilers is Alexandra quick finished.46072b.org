Hey guys I started reading the amazing Alexandra quick stories but noticed that there are only 4 out of 7 books published on FF.net. is Alexandra quick abandoned like prince of the dark kingdom?

** Inverarity writes his stories to completion and only starts posting when they're complete. This can lead to long delays between stories.

**** I've only met one of them (GRRM), though I've interacted with Inverarity off and on over the years. I'd say the latter is far more personable.
