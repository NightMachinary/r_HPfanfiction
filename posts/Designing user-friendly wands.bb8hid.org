In thinking about practical user experience, trying to carry an extremely valuable but fragile and long stick around at all times is annoying. Normally for long and thin objects on our persons we use lanyards, and if we need to access them quickly, we have quick-release technology to facilitate that, but hanging a wand around your neck just doesn't look like it would work well imho. Holsters at our hips seems nice, but they're a pain and get in the way and are easily sat upon. Pockets located by joints, whether hip or elbow, have that same problem.

Fanon tends to default to wand holsters which take advantage of space extension charms, but permanent space extension charms in canon seem to be more of a luxury item (at least I'm having them be so in my AU) and everyday wizards and witches need a better solution.

I thought of charms in robe sleeves that stick to wands when the wand isn't being touched by your hand, so you could just slide it in and pull it out freely, but unless all robe sleeves are voluminous and are worn at all times, it's not a universal solution.

Then I realized that I'm looking at this from the wrong direction. Instead of charming all the things you might end up wearing (which might include muggle clothes, which likely are illegal to enchant as muggle artifacts) why not look to the one common denominator -- the wand itself? It's already magical and a major expense, why not focus on making wands universally storable?

Yes, it would be AU, but I think it makes sense that wandmakers would take it on themselves to design their wands to be convenient if they're expecting them to last a wizard their whole life.

So, any ideas on how wands themselves could be charmed for ease of storage?

My first thought is the classic where it simply exists in extra-dimensional-space until summoned and returns there when its owner becomes unconscious (can't be taken or disarmed that way). But that's a bit more advanced than I'm wanting I think. And I'm sure the Aurors wouldn't like being unable to confiscate wands of captured criminals (they could require a backdoor charm that allows the Ministry to recover a wand, though, which leads to the possibility of that being exploited, so that could be fun to explore).

The sticking-to-cloth-until-grabbed charm might be the easiest and most straightforward. Maybe that's the default, and for extra money Ollivander adds the other charms?

Voluminous sleeves seems to be a nigh-universal feature of wizard's robes. And why /wouldn't/ they be worn at all times? Remember that movie ravings aside, robes are the standard clothing of the Wizaring World, /not/ something you put /over/ a shirt and jacket.

*** I agree that robes would be more common than generally presented, but the problem arises when having to interact with muggles, and hiding one's wand then. I'm having a license be required for muggle interaction and it could include requiring a wand holster, but muggleborns and such still would need a solution and wand holsters might not be within their means.

******* Huh. Touche. I hadn't actually thought of that. They do literally everything with their wand, and hardly ever put them down. That makes for some interesting avenues of investigation. Like eating with wands and dancing with wands.

Another thought: what about just making muggles unable to see wands? That's a basic charm they put on a ton of stuff. Then they can open carry or stash them any old way and not worry about muggles being confused.

******** I like the last idea. Wands being invisible to muggles. It's totally not because I think using a vehicle for your magic to be lame. It is a staple of the HP world, but someone pointing a stick at me isn't as threatening as their hand glowing with power or even someone holding a staff.

****** IIRC, Lupin pulls his wand out of an inside pocket in his robes in the POA movie during the boggart scene. There's also the throwaway gag in book 5 where Moody warns against storing your wand in your back pocket since he knew someone who blew a buttock off that way. This leads me to believe that "in your pocket" is a fairly standard place for wizards to store their wand, oddities like Luna aside. (/Which/ pocket being a matter of personal preference, I suppose.)

******* Yeah, that seems to be the canon assumption. My problem is that loose robes and long pockets are inconvenient (being fumbly to access or put away, and prone to things falling out of them) without extra charms applied to fix the problems. In which case why not just put the charms on the wand itself?

***** I assume they see the /stable and permanent manipulation of space/ as a difficult subject that requires long study to manage. So, people who /can/ do it become experts who sell their service at a proportional price, leading to questions of affordability. I would imagine poorly done expansion charms could implode or distort in some way, leading to distrust in cheaper options.

...no it doesn't? The idea is that the wand is attached to the length of your forearm, not sent into some bigger-on-the-inside hidden space. I don't know why you'd even think that --- if we begin to assume we're storing wands in extended-space, might as well just make your pockets bigger rather than bother with specialized holsters, anyway.

***** Go take a ruler and measure out 14 inches on your forearm. I just went and double checked, but that went out way past my palm. The average wand is 9 to 14, with some going over 15, and even 9 would be very uncomfortable, particularly every time you bend your elbow. Besides wands being straight and one's arm being very not straight (even if you're not super muscled, there isn't a convenient flat surface there).

** A shoulder holster would seem to be the way forward, surely? Fixed just where you mean to draw it with elastic to let it shift with your movements at the bottom end.

Getting it enchanted with a long-lasting disillusionment charm would be a good investment. Demiguise wool straps and mokeskin lining for the high rollers who want it invisible, smaller than the wand it contains and apt to bite anyone trying to steal it.

**** Pretty much any holster/scabbard that works for a longish knife works just as well for a wand. So a shoulder rig, something down the thigh, boot-top, strapped to the off-hand forearm for the shorter models, across the small of the back. Undetectable extension charms are within the magical scope of a reasonably talented schoolgirl, so your holster doesn't need to be as deep as the wand is long.
