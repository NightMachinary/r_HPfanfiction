** You really need to give more specifics. What constitutes as 'good' highly depends on your tastes. For example, I'm sure there are many 'well written' fics with the Hermione and Snape pairing, but I will never, ever read them.

I personally favor stories with smarter and more ruthless protagonists, lots of strategies and tactics, and significant amount of body count, especially for the 'bad guys'. I also enjoy fics that involve overthrowing the government of Magical Britain. Therefore, I would recommend the following:

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Good is very subjective.

Generally good are fics that are recommended by the "Dark Lord Potter"-Community: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/library_list.php][On their website]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][FFN Community]]

--------------

Sine of my personal favorites are:

linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh) in which fem!Harry travels back 7000 years in time. It contains several historical set-pieces and some chapters in the modern timeline.

linkffn(Oh god not again) is my favorite "Harry possesses his younger self's body that is not abandoned.

linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon) is one of nonjon's earlier works, and it parts it shows. However, it has one of the best worldbuilding-setups I've read about, and nonjon isn't hesitant to explore new characters, places and plot which sets him apart from a lot of authors.

linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) is by the same author, and is his most popular fanfic. Most people have a love it / hate it relationship with the fic, but it features an original plot, funny moments and other cool stuff.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is my favorite sad fic. It's has extremly well written characters that really get to you.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived By The Santi) is sadly abandoned, yet a very good read. It's also unafraid of building worlds and characters, features a realistic Potter-Family and a seriously cool Durmstrang.

Note that some of the fics I recommended here have only three starts on the DLP-Library list, which generally means they consider them "Guilty Pleasure" and "not really recommended", but I see them as some of my favorite stories.

This is why this is so subjective, and I'd recommend you try to make a bit more narrow request in the future.

Everything listed there is very well written as well as being the best in in the fandom.

After that I would recommend going through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP's C2]] which is also full of amazing fics. As far as a personal recommendation goes I would suggest linkffn(The Journey From Oidhche Shamhna by FirstYear) which is easily the best founder's fic.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?
