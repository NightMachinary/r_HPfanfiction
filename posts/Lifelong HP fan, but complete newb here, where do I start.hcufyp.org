Hey all,

I'm 29 years old, grew up reading and re-reading HP. Currently listening to the audiobooks by Jim Dale with my wife as we take our newborn on drives.

I need more. More HP in my life. Where is the best place to start? Does most of the fan fiction follow canon? Does that even matter? I would think it would be important but I'm open.

I tried a google search but got overwhelmed trying to sort what was what and where to start.

What are the best ones out there? Please send any recommendations!

Thank you!


** V. long comment - *Strap in*

Having read most of these comments, I think a lot of people are getting a little ahead of themselves (and you) by recommending fics (fan fictions) and throwing lingo at you. The books have been out for over a decade now, and there is a lot of material out there to sift through; Harry Potter has the most fan-written content of any piece of fiction in history (to the best of my knowledge) so I am not surprised that you were overwhelmed.

Because of the weight of material out there, the most important thing is to know what you want, and how to get it. I'm going to try to include a (largely) fool-proof method to at least cut down the volume into manageable chunks. Additionally, I want to try to explain some of the groupings and themes that can be used to understand the general trends that you'll find on your journey. Finally, I'm going to try to decode some of the lingo that gets thrown around on this subreddit and the wider internet, and that can be stalling for newcomers (as great a resource as this subreddit is, it can become a bit of an echo chamber, as everywhere on the internet can be)

*So, to point one; how to find your fic.* (If you read other fanfiction this section is largely unnecessary for you, if you're brand new to fanfiction as a whole, read on.)

The two giants of the fanfiction worlds are AO3 and FFN. I would recommend AO3 (Archive Of Our Own) as a starting point and then move on to FFN.net (Fanfiction.net). AO3 is much more easily navigable and finding specific types of fics is much easier. While I generally prefer FFN nowadays, that website is like something out of the early internet sometimes whereas AO3 has lots of big helpful buttons, and from what I've seen, most fics (certainly most of the good ones) can be found on both websites. AO3 will allow you to sort by all sorts things; the rating of the content (General Audiences, Teen+, Mature, Explicit, None), the sexual orientation of the pairings (couples) within the fic, tigger warnings, and completeness of the fic are the main ones, but it also allows you to filter by other things too. ‘Tags' are little notes written by the author about what the themes of the fic are; ‘Slytherin Harry', ‘Dark Harry', ‘Next Gen' and ‘Marauders Era' are examples, and I'll cover what these mean later. When sorting for a fic, the selected fics will automatically sort by date updated (newest to oldest) but I find a better way to sift through the chaff (and boy is there a lot) is to instead sort by kudos -- kudos are basically ‘likes' for a fic, and the best liked fics are generally the *best* fics, and so get the most kudos. It makes it much easier to find something good, that's about what you like.

So, the best thing to do is to have a general idea of what you want first and then use the filters that you can apply (you can apply as many as you like) to select for that (or exclude what you don't want) and then sort by kudos to get the best of that genre/theme that you've selected. And to select that theme...

*Point two; knowing what's out there.*

I'm going to try to start big and work downwards, for manageability. As I said before, there is a lot of stuff out there, and it covers all sorts of topics, and times and some of it sticks religiously to cannon and some of it throws cannon out of the window. Additionally, there's a lot of debate about what counts as cannon and what doesn't (Cursed Child, Pottermore, JKs tweets etc ad infinitum), and furthermore, there's a whole lot of bits and times of cannon to write about.

So, firstly, there are three basic time frames, which break down into subcategories; before the books, during the books, and after the books.

Before the books includes fiction about the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them characters and universe (but that's a whole ‘nother kettle of fish) and the Marauders Era fics. I.e. fics about the marauders and the surrounding cast; these fics will often include stories about the Marauders at school, the wooing of Lily Evans, a relationship between Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, the first war against Voldemort, and the betrayal of Peter Pettigrew. These fics often follow the general pattern of canon (so that Harry's story can be set up), although this is absolutely not always the case; there are a number of ‘fix-it fics' wherein the author will attempt to prevent the events of cannon from occurring, usually by the insertion of a character with foreknowledge of the plot of the books.

Fics set during cannon are much more varied in whether they stick to the cannon or not. Most fics will stick to the general timeline that is established in the books, but often this will be incredibly loose, and in many fics progress through the years, these fics will become more and more divergent from the cannon, as the events of the characters affect the development of the plot in new ways. This is the most widely written about era, and therefore has the broadest possible selection of themes. A lot of these fics could be seen as asking the question ‘what if...' and seeing where it goes; what changes is Harry is female, if he goes to Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, if he's raised by someone else, if he meets someone else in Diagon Alley/Gringotts/on the train, if he goes to a different school. These fic will usually either start from sometime in Harry's childhood, at the start of Hogwarts, or sometime during year 4 (it is considered a major divergence point). There are, of course, a thousand other types of fics in this era, but I could write a whole essay, just on that, rather than how long this already is.

Finally, we have post-book fics. These can either continue the story of Harry and co. or include the stories of their children. *I personally think that these would be the best stories for you, as they conform to cannon, but are just, as you said, ‘more Harry Potter'*. Again, these can be incredibly divergent, as very little, if anything has been written by JK about what happens after the seven books end (obviously there is the Cursed Child and the epilogue, but these are often debated or ignored in fanfiction). There are some really excellent fics in this genre though.

Additionally, there are pairings -- the couples found within the fic. Some are loved by the fandom, some are reviled. There's a cult following of Drarry (Draco and Harry) and HHr (Harry and Hermione) among so very many others, and the validity of these are hotly debated all the time. You need to be aware of the pairings of a fic -- I personally don't care, but if you do you should be aware so you can find/avoid those fics.

*And finally, to lingo!* (Its past three, I'm tired and I've just written an entirely unnecessary essay. I'll edit to add more that I think of in the morning. Forgive me if I'm getting short now.)

WBWL -- Wrong boy who lived

OTP -- One true pairing (falling out of favour)

EWE -- Epilogue what epilogue

Pairing -- Couples in the fic

AU -- Alternate universe

Crossover -- a fic that mixes with another fictional universe (Marvel, DC, Dr Who, Star Wars etc)

Crack -- comedy/mickey-taking fics

Mary Sue -- overpowered character

Curb-stomping -- when the main character walks all over a character, mostly just because the author doesn't like that character, and defeats them with no effort

Bashing -- when a character (usually either the Weasleys or Dumbledore) are made out to be terrible, manipulative, awful, stupid people (again usually because the author just doesn't like them, or uses it to make an excuse for the main character to show their superiority -- look how good my version of main character is in comparison.)

SI -- self insert (these can be good or bad, but they're hard to get right)

OC -- original character

**** Agree - there's a lot of overlap between a self-insert and a Mary Sue.

If you have a character that everybody seems to like, and to tolerate even their weirdest and most ridiculous "quirks", despite them having done nothing within the narrative to justify being liked, or even known to the other characters, then you probably have a Mary Sue. And usually, this is a character that the writer either sees themself as, or wishes they could be.

***** Although on a side note good authors can write good self inserts. One way I've heard it put and quite like is that a Mary Sue is just a main character of a poorly written story. If the only way things happen is because the entire universe is bending to the plot, that's just bad writing.

****** Yeah, I didn't mean to imply self-inserts can't be good. Most authors, especially if they're creating original characters, will draw on their own experiences and personality to create those characters, to a greater or lesser extent.

And the success of the HP world is, in my opinion, because it lends itself so well to self-inserts. We all see ourselves in the HP world - hence the popularity of fans sorting themselves, finding out their wand, patronus, etc. It's only a short step from there to creating a fiction casting yourself in the main role (I've done the same thing myself).

I think it's just easy with a self-insert to fall into the trap of making that character just /too much/. e.g. Ignoring the rules of the world to the convenience of that character, making them universally liked (by the "good guys" at least), as well as philosophical, genre-savvy and talented...

*** This is a great guide. I agree that ao3 is the best site to start on because there's so many sorting options and more description of the fic so you can decide whether it appeals.

I think the most important point is deciding what you're looking for, (for example I started wanted to read about the marauders,) and deciding what length fics you want. Do you want a short slice of life canon fic? A long book length fic? Once you've got the filters in just read descriptions until something appeals and try it

**** I must admit that its much easier to sort by genre when using FFN; the ability to choose that you want an adventure story over a romance story is very useful for what I understand you're asking for. That's largely why I used 'theme' as opposed to 'genre' when I wrote my comment.

Something that should be noted if people are reading this from the above is that while *FFN is better for finding different genres, AO3 is better for finding specific themes.*

I think the best thing to do on AO3 would be to exclude the tag 'romance'. That way you'll exclude any fics where any sort of romance is the main theme of the story, but you should still get fics where there is some character and relationship development, but it won't be the main impetus of story progression. Additionally, if there are any specific relationships that you dislike you can individually choose to exclude those. You can use specific tags like 'horror' or 'slice of life' to select for genres with AO3, but due to the nature of AO3 and the freedom authors have to define their works, there can sometimes be some discrepancies in the way that works are tagged (but by the gods I could write a whole other rant about tagging on AO3)

I'll just mention that in addition to post-Hogwarts stories, a beginner might be well served by /canon-compliant/ stories set during the books. Things like Ginny or Neville's perspective on book 7 (or 6), Severus Snape's history, or entirely separate stories told in other places like Ilvermorny.

You ought give him/her props as his works go the extra mile in terms of world-building and I quite liked the fact that Harry, the Weasleys and members of the DA grow up to become quite influential in the ministry and the magical community at large. Strangers at Drakeshaugh is goddamn splendid. I quite liked the young mum's POV and how she befriends Ginny Potter and her not-so-ordinary family that's moved to their neighborhood!

- Harry raised by the Malfoys would come off across as more haughty, aristocratic and perhaps more concerned with appearances given their status.\\
- Harry raised by Moody would essentially make him into a magical Jason Bourne or Courtland Gentry in terms of personality, where he would be more paranoid and cautious of others
- Therefore, AU Harry would be a different take on canon Harry and would render him pretty much an OC, making it jarring for readers used to canon.

At least a few of Harry's acquaintances would've married muggles or unknown wizards.

I also don't like how Ginny had kids so young. She was a professional quidditch player, and typically sports players wait to have kids until they retire because being pregnant and having to look after young children would make it almost impossible to continue playing and you can only play sports professionally for so long before you get too old. And yet for some reason she had kids at twenty something.

As for relationships- of course Harry deserves happiness- there's no need to get pissy. I even believe Harry/ Ginny */could/* work if Ginny had more screen time (or is it page time?) in books 3, 4 and 5 and developed a friendship with Harry first. And if someone sat down Harry and using small words, explained to him the difference between love and lust in book 6.

Ron and Hermione though... no. Just no. There is no way this works for more than a couple of weeks of passionate sex. The only way this works is if Hermione gets pregnant and is unwilling to leave the father of her child.

****** I'd like to believe that Ron was like her anchor. I'd also like to think that Ron was very devoted to her. That much is apparent in the books. Hermione - I'm simply imagining here - would certainly grow up to a focused and career-driven woman who would not have sky-high expectations about love and romance. Plus the fact that going through what they did would have created a lasting bond between them. A down-to-earth, always ready for a laugh, best friend, which Ron is, would seem like an ideal life-partner to her.

From a literary standpoint, I suppose JKR wanted to shake things up by having the girl fall for the sidekick. Sidekicks usually get a raw deal in fiction. Its like the writers believe that they should be exceedingly grateful to have been part of adventure at all. She wanted to change that.

EDIT - Hermione would have also valued trust, affection and loyalty over a short-lived fiery romance.

***** I don't think it sucks but lets be honest the epilogue is a little disappointing. Even just ignoring the pairings, it's very vague about almost everything besides some kid names and who a couple people married. Like thematically I get it, Harry finally has the boring normal life he's always wanted. But it's not really an interesting conclusion to an adventure.

****** I get what you say. I read the books as they came out, and even today I'm just aching to find out what happened after the war. I want to find out how they tore Lucious Malfoy a new one, how they tried Umbridge and carted her off to Azkaban, how everyone grieved and moved on. The list is endless.

I don't know if she meant to do it, but by writing that Harry has become a family man with a wife and children, and of course, the responsibilities that go with, JKR inadvertently stated that the magic happened and ended during Harry's childhood and when he grew up, he became like everyone else, that he had to think about his wife, his kids and paying bills (not that these are bad things). Many people would have quite liked to see Harry and Hermione (I'm not sure about Ron on this one) as people who were absolutely bloody disgusted with the system and were at constant war with it. Again, this is a very infantile and immature line of thinking. A constant war with the system and general rebelliousness cannot be sustained by most people. But I, for one, would have quite liked to see Harry as this person who, at the end of the books, says, f/uck the wizarding world, fuck the ministry, fuck Voldemort, I'm going to see the world and have me some new adventures! better ones!/

But, of course, there's nothing to suggest that he, in fact, didn't do any of these things. The Epilogue, IMO, is rather open. True, Harry has a family. But, he could also be a number of other things. He also have done a number of other things. He, if you think about it, could not be the real Harry at all, but Draco Malfoy who's been impersonating Harry since the end of the war and having Goyle polyjuice into him (I mean, Goyle wouldn't get anywhere near a girl if he looked like himself, so there's the incentive). It's all left, dear reader, to your imagination.

***** My issue with it is that it ended too happy. War is hell, and I think more should have died. Not going to the extremes that some fanfics do, where basically everyone dies, but more. Frankly, I think either Ron or Hermione should have died (but not both) to really drive home the point that war is hell.

Basically I wanted more of a melancholic or bittersweet ending than the relatively rosy one we got.

** Also, you can try searching /here/ for the kind of recommendations you're looking for when you have a specific idea of what you're looking for. Either by making a request, or going through old ones like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gsij3h/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_fanfics_you_never/][this one]].

Most fanfics will follow canon in some way, some more than others. You can bet that if a fanfic centers around Harry in his first year of Hogwarts that he'll receive and name Hedwig, Hermione will end up in the bathroom with the troll, and that he'll try to stop Voldemort from getting the Philosopher's Stone.

Just try to keep in mind the proper uses for flairs.

- Recommendation - When you've just finished reading a fanfic, and enjoyed it, and want to share it.

- Request - Looking for any fanfic that fulfills a given criteria. Sure you can search both Archive of Our Own or FanFiction.Net for Luna Lovegood-centric fics, but sorting through twenty or so recommendations in response to a request is easier than sifting through a couple thousand search results. Also you can request just about anything, even things that don't have easily searchable tags.

- What's That Fic? - This flair is used when you want to find a specific fanfic based on what you remember about it, like you remember a fanfic where Harry starts dating Jean Grey from the X-Men(Marvel) and ends up with them joining forces with the Justice League(DC) to take down Voldemort and want to reread it, but need help finding it again(NOTE: not actually a fic, to my knowledge, just an example).

** Hi! There is a TON of content out there since Harry Potter really rose to fame at the same time as many of these fanfiction sites.

There are a lot of fics that follow canon but there are MANY more that don't. AUs (alternate universe fics) can be really good ("Grow Young with Me" by Taliesin19 is a coffee shop AU that is a favorite). One-shots are stand alone stories that don't have more than one chapter. Often, authors will group one-shots into a collection which can be read together or seperately.

You also need to know what you want the story to focus on. Post-war follows everything after the Battle of Hogwarts and (many times) focus on the couples ranging from canon (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, etc.) or non canon (H/Hr, H/Daphne, etc.). Marauder's Era focuses on.... the marauders era obviously lol. Some of these focus on Lily/James, some on Sirius/Lupin, some on original characters that interact with the marauders but this category is anything that takes place during the time the marauders are at school. Next Generation Fics focus on the children of the "main" characters (Harry's kids, Ron's kids, Neville's kids, etc.).

Those are the main time categories but there are tons more. Crack!Fics tend to just be ridiculous, funny, and light-hearted and usually have little to no plot (in general). Dark!Harry fics are exactly that: where Harry is a dark wizard.

I like Archive of Our Own (ao3) the best as a platform but there are a lot of classic fics on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] (ffn) as well. You'll just have to search around the figure out what you personally like.

I tend to like canon the best with the occasional AU (especially AUs where Harry is a Hogwarts professor). Now for my favorite authors/stories. My fav authors are Northumbrian (ffn), FloreatCastellum (ao3 & one-shots on Tumblr), kmbell92 (wattpad), and silverfirelizard53 (ao3). My favorites individual stories are "Blackboards and Broomsticks" (ao3), "Grow Young with Me" (ao3 [mentioned above]), "Backward with a Purpose" (ffn), and the series of one-shots "Nineteen Years Seems Pretty Far Away" (ao3).

P.S.Like another commenter said - make sure you are on the lookout for fics that use fanfiction to "promote" inappropriate topics like pedophilia, incest, etc.

linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer) - Harry becomes a Dark Lord in order to secure a better future for Teddy. Ron and Hermione are there by his side.

As far as I can remember both fics are gen or canon pairings. I think it's easiest to start with gen fics until you figure out what ships you like, especially in the HP fandom.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** (Sorry for the long comment in advance! I hope you find any of it helpful though. Reading fanfiction is all about personal preference and as you get into it you'll find the fics, pairings, and tropes you prefer. There is something for everybody!!)

As some others have mentioned, I recommend going on fanfiction.net and Archive of our own (ao3). You can start with sorting by favorites or reviews to show the most popular ones. That's a good way to get a general overview and see which ones many other people have liked.

You can also add filters for characters, and genres. On fanfiction it's easier to sort by word count if you want to find short one shots, by filtering <5000 words. On Ao3 I like to filter out relationships I don't like which I think makes it easier to find stories.

And for following canon or not it depends on what you want to read. There are a lot that follow canon and a lot that either rewrite the series or diverge at some point (most of the time at GoF).

One way I like to find fics is by going to the authors profile of a fic i like and searching through their favorites. I've found a lot of stories that way!

(Ps. One thing to watch out for is abandoned fics before you become too invested in them. You can see when they were last updated. That's not to say you shouldn't read them just know in the beginning that it's incomplete.)

Since I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for I'll tell you some of my favorites. (I'm partial to not following canon though). They might not be exactly what you're looking for as a first time reader but you can see if you like them or not and that might help you figure out what you prefer. Some of them might be kind of out there then what you are used to with canon.

Linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair)

A short one-shot but I think is beautiful and follows canon.

Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter)

The author DisobedienceWriter on ff writes good, though kind of long fics. I really like them though as the had really different ideas for the time and most are complete.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes)

The account was abandoned but the author is using a new account to finish the series. This is a wrong boy who lived (WBWL) fic. This is a pretty popular trope where Harry has a twin and the twin is considered the boy who lived. This also has a Slytherin Harry. The story is currently on fifth year. It does have bashing of other characters. This is my favorite fic series but I can understand why it might not be for everybody.)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by TheSanti)

This is a Harry goes to a different school fic, in this case Durmstrang. It isn't complete but it's a really good fic. There are more chapters than is posted on ff so I'll see if I can find the link for a full version. This a really popular fic and gets mentioned a fair bit in this reddit.

Linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow)

This one is a bit darker than many others and as a first time ff reader might be a bit more out there than some. Voldemort was never defeated and is in power, and Harry goes to Durmstrang. (Still updating)

Linkao3(Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW)

Harry was raised by lily and goes to Beaubatons. The paring is Harry/Voldemort though so I don't know if you'd like that. It's not my favorite pairing but I love the writing, characters, and a tory besides that. (Still updating)

Linkffn(SiriusandJames by The Third Marauder)

This is a canon compliant, 4 chapter story about Sirius and James friendship seen through the eyes of others.

Linkffn(Not Slytherin Enough)

A short one shot but I really like it, and can be an easy story to start fanfiction off with.

Linkao3(the heir of something or other)

Part of an one-shot series on different takes on Harry Potter. Still fairly short but fairly well written and could be a jumping off point to see what you like.

Linkao3(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

This one is kind of sad but kind of different than others. Harry and Nevilles situations are reversed, Neville is the boy who lived and Harry's parents are in St. Mungos. Harry is obsessed with curing his parents. A longer fix but complete.

Sorry that was so long!

Once you find a fic type you like you can also search the communities on fanfiction.net. The are generically sorted by most followers when you first view them but another good way is to google it.

For example: if you like Slytherin Harry then google that with fanfiction and a few different communities will probably pop up.

I hope this was at least a little helpful. There is something for everybody but it can take a bit of searching to find out what you like best. There are a ton of fics so try not to get overwhelmed by all of them. Also by searching the subreddit you can see which ones get recommended a lot.

I hope you like some of the ones I recommended and have fun!!

Edit: The ones from ff.net didn't link and I'll see if I can fix it but you can search them on google if you wanted to (especially Cauterize!)

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

** For someone completely new to fanfiction, I would highly recommend FloreatCastellum's work. In particular, I think you'd enjoy her [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][Slice of Life]] fanfictions, which are short stories depicting the life of the Potter-Weasley family post-war. You'd also probably enjoy [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286][Missing Hogwarts Moments.]] For their longer fics, you can check out their [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][ffn]] profile. In particular, I quite enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]].

These are all very casual fanfiction, so if you like that sort of stuff it should keep you occupied for awhile. There are various genres in Fanfiction, so it's important to do a bit of exploring to see which one you like best. The easiest way to do that, I reckon, is to search what sort of fanfiction you like in the subreddit. For example, if you're interested in next gen, just search "next gen fics" in the search bar. Everyone has their own tastes in fanfiction - for example, I particularly enjoy time travel fanfiction.

If you're looking for other high quality fanfiction, you might want to have a look at this [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjpJsBshvv5sSTHsbHQ269e3DW2ZReBH20AT7NufJYw/edit][top fanfictions list.]] (It was not made by me, but I forgot who the author of the list is.)

** Here are some of my favorite fics, plus fics that I would generally consider classics in the fandom, most/all of these would be good to read as a beginner fanfic reader imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] - by the same author and have similar tones/themes, so you could read both, or just one and them move on to something else before eventually coming back for the other. In The Accidental Animagus, Harry becomes a cat during a bout of accidental magic as a child and runs away from the Dursleys and gets adopted by the Grangers. In The Arithmancer Hermione is crazy good at math and thus can invent her own spells.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] - Hermione is sorted into Slytherin. Fic is long abandoned but was quite good so still worth a read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To shape and change]] - Snape goes back in time and is a mentor to Harry. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the way to greatness]] - Harry is sorted into Slytherin. Long abandoned but imo one of the best versions of this premise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] - Completely original story set in the US that takes place in the HP setting, along a similar vane to HP where a girl find out she's a witch and then gets into tons of adventures and danger at school. Started before there was any canon info on wizarding America, so quite different. Currently 5 out of 6 or 7 books are completed, and they are all great imo. Very unique/good story with great world building.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - a WBWL fic, which is a genre of fic, where Harry has a twin brother who is thought to be the boy who lived instead. But Harry is the real one (though in this fic I don't think it's clear yet which one is the real BWL yet). Typically Harry gets sent to live with the Dursleys for some reason, while the twin lives with one or both of their parents who survived. Which sounds like a ridiculous premise, which it usually is, but in this case the fic does a decent job of explaining how that happened without making Harry's parents or Dumbledore evil, like most of this type of fic do. There's another somewhat recent popular version of this called Den of Snakes that a lot of people like, but it explains the premise by just making Dumbledore and James evil/idiots, which I don't like personally.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] - Sort of similar to a WBWL fic, in that Harry has a twin, but in this case Harry lives with his parents too, and isn't neglected. However he has a bad time at Hogwarts in Ravenclaw house and switches to Durmstrung. This fic is really good, but hasn't been updated in years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] - Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, and it retells canon from her perspective. Events stay extremely similar to actual canon, so her being a Slytherin doesn't really change anything, but it's still interesting and well written and worth a read imo.

[[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] - Kind of dated now since it inspired a lot of similar fics with similar tropes, but this was the fic that originally did them, so it's worth a read. Harry Potter takes much longer to win the war and most people he cares about are dead, so he travels back in time to 1st year so he can do a better job at it. Incomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always]] - Similar to nightmares, but Harry, Ron, and Ginny all go back in time and it's complete. Has a pretty interesting sequel too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] - Set in a fairly AU version of the potterverse, where riddle went the politics route instead, half bloods and muggleborns aren't allowed at Hogwarts. Harry is a girl instead, with a fairly different personality. She is super into potions and wants to study at Hogwarts since their potions program under Snape is much better than the one at the American school she can legally attend. However said American school has a better healer program than Hogwarts, and her cousin who is Sirius' child, wants to study there. So they switch places. Sounds weird, but very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] - sort of hard to describe, but basically Harry is an incarnation of death that decided to try being human, and doesn't remember being death, but also doesn't really get regular humans. So while she(it's a fem!Harry fic) basically has god like powers, most of the conflict comes from her not really knowing how to interact with people normally.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255912/1/Legacy][Legacy]] - The Founders are all reborn in the canon time period. Thus far Salazaar is reborn as Harry and Godrick as Cedric. The other two haven't been revealed yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council][Harry Potter et al and the keystone coucil]]. Five different versions of Harry, which are all somewhat typical archetypes for point of divergence fics, in five different dimensions can communicate mentally. They help each other as they all experience the Harry Potter plot events simultaneously, but slightly differently due to the difference in their dimensions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's her Name in Hufflepuff]]- it's a self insert fic, which basically means a regular person from our normal dimension goes to a fictional universe with knowledge of said universe. Often by reincarnation, but in this case they fall through a dimensional door and magically deaged to 11. They end up being sorted into Hufflepuff, and it's imo the best SI HP fic if you exclude the ones that are long abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] - the writer Taure is really good. Basically it's a fem!Harry sorted into Slytherin. It explores magic in more detail than canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - The horcrux and Harry basically merge. The fic is humor based, not serious, so the end result is somewhat immoral but not evil like actual Voldemort. The result thinks it is Tom, but clearly doesn't act like real Tom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] - Harry gets rescued from the Dursleys by Sirius several years before Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]] - Dudley gets a hogwarts letter too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] - Harry Potter is stuck in a crazy timeloop, very AU but pretty interesting. He is trying to prevent Voldemort from summoning a horde of demons and destroying the world.

** As another person who found fan fiction a lot later than that others, I too wanted more Harry Potter. A truly excellent story (in my own opinion, of course) is The Sum of Their Parts by Hold My Beer - linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]])

This fic is continuation from canon but ignores the epilogue. It's darker than the Deathly Hallows and doesn't dance around a lot of issues. The story is complete, which is always a bonus, and leaves you wanting more (in the good way). Their are no major romantic plot lines. I hope you enjoy! Let me know what you think.

** The way I see it, there are 2 main categories of HP fanfiction. AUs a.k.a. Alternate Universes, and canon-compliant extra material like sequels, prequels, and side-stories.

Personally, I prefer to read AUs.

As for introductions to HP fanfiction, I started off with linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay), but I introduced HP fanfiction to my mum with Sovran's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]], which she now hates me for because it's not finished and she loved it.

I'm going to reply to this comment with my list of favourite HP fics that I copy and paste when it makes sense to do so, hopefully you'll find something that piques your interest.

*** My Unordered Top 20 HP Fics: a copypasta.

F = Finished

O = Ongoing

H/A = Hiatus/Abandoned.

H/A: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable, and ultimately wholesome as hell. *I have the flair for a reason.*

O: Before I read Meaning of One, [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Nightmares of Futures Past]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.

O: linkffn([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/][Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay]]) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Has the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

F: This goddamn cryfest. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

O: [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353][Path Diverged]] and its [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365][sequel]] have a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch of differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

O: Inspired by linkffn(10610076), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922][The Heir Of House Black]]) is another Peggy Sue, however, Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in-depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

O: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418][Time Twister]] series starting with linkao3(10021610). It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

O: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002][Magical Metamorphosis]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in-depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and the general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body.

F: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of][In Care Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

F: linkffn([[https://ww.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/][That Which Holds The Image]]) is the only crossover in this list, that being with Doctor Who. That being said, you don't need to know a thing about Doctor Who to enjoy this story. Essentially, one of the most powerful monsters from that show is Harry's boggart, and the monster has some unique attributes that make them immune to the Ridikkulus spell. Honestly, the less you know, the better.

F: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes) is a classic comedy fic. Instead of the main character being Harry, it's the part of Voldemort that became the Scarcrux. Hilarity ensues because Harry is insane, but not evil.

F(sort of): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/][Like A Red Headed]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/][Stepchild]]) Harry has red hair, and so is mistaken for a Weasley. They don't mind, and in fact, they adopt him. A classic crackfic, that's basically a fever dream crafted by Fred and George, and McGonagall is close to having an aneurysm.

H/A: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/][Three's the Charm]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

O: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14041326][A Dramatic Reading]]) and its [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14082594][sequel]] linkao3(14082594) is tagged as a “reverse parody,” in which it takes the premise of Umbridge finding and reading out loud to Hogwarts the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, and attempts to takes it seriously. There are a bunch of fics out there like it, but this is by far the best executed.

O: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/][Strange Visitors From Another Century]]) In an accident in the DoM's Time Room when they're trying to rescue Sirius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up stranded during the time of the Hogwarts Founders. Salazar doesn't have a good time when he learns what the future thinks of him. They learn that there have always been and will always be Dark Lords.

O: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/][The Perils of Innocence]]) is a fic where Harry, and then eventually Hermione and Dean all either live at or become a common visitor of a Muggle facility for disadvantaged kids. Only for both the doctors and the kids to realise they can do magic. McGonagall doesn't know what she's in for when she arrives with letters.

O: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][Basilisk Eyes]]) is a Blind!Harry fic that focuses on learning how to live with a disability Harry wasn't born with. I think the best part of the fic is the fact that Harry is actually blind and doesn't have Magic Vision^{TM}, and is written by someone who seems to have personal experience with blindness. All the OC's are honestly great as well.

O: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057502][The Quiet Ones]]) in which Harry is raised by Sirius and all the other death eaters in Azkaban. Yet when Dumbledore and the rest realise that Harry's been in Azkaban all this time and go to investigate, they find that all the Death Eaters are... well... perfectly sane and non-violent. Not to say that there weren't hardships, because there were definitely hardships.

O: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651][How Like Home]]). Harry follows Sirius into the veil and lands in an Alternate Reality where Voldemort never existed. A great look into how Harry would react to a world which he has desired for all his life, where his parents are alive and love him very much.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides...

** The best advice I can give is decide what you are looking for and then use the tags to find it. AO3 (archive of our own dot com) has a very easy tagging system to use.

So for example, do you want to read something set in the Marauders era where Sirius and Remus are a couple? You select "marauders era" and "Sirius Black/Remus Lupin" and all fics that have those things as a topic will come up in a list. You can then filter to completed fics, or high word count if you want a long story. If you want a story where it explores what would happen if Harry was in a different house, you can select the tag "Slytherin Harry" or "Hufflepuff Harry" etc.

Some fics follow canon very closely, but with a slight change. So a retelling of PS but Harry is in Slytherin, or Harry is a girl, as examples, will have similar events to the book but with slight differences. Some completely change canon - Sirius gets out of Azkaban when Harry is small and raises him - done properly, that should make Harry quite a different character (more confident, has a parent he can trust etc). Some throw canon completely out of the window - Harry is a dark wizard and hates Dumbledore so helps Voldemort.

Also just watch out - some fics have really dodgy content in terms of underage sex and stuff. I do wish paedophiles wouldn't use our fandom to write out their gross illegal fantasies but the great thing is you can use the tags to avoid stuff you don't want to see - so you can select to discount any fic that has underage relationships in it and they won't show up in your search for example. Fanfiction.net has much stricter rules than AO3 and you're less likely to come across gross stuff on there, but the tagging system is harder to use IMO.

*** I love how the started neutral then turned into a purist rant. Lol.

Anyway, I'll be informative instead of incendiary.

If, when someone says underage, and means under 18, they're risking having people disengage from their argument because it's technically incorrect in most of the world. Age of consent varies a lot by country and even by states in the US.

If, however, by underage, they mean one character or both are under the minimum age of consent in the era/country/state the story is set in, then sure, they should definitely use the term underage. And tag it. Definitely tag it.

Anyone wanting to have an accurate rant should also consider googling the meaning of pedophile, since it means "exclusive or primary attraction to prepubescent humans" not "attraction to pubescent/post pubescent humans under the legal age of consent". For example: exclusive/primary attraction to under 5s is Infantophilia; 11-14, is, I believe, hebephilia and if you're looking at people who are exclusive/primarily attracted to the 15 to 19 age group, the correct term is Ephebophilia. Wikipedia (or any other trouble source) will provide the facts needed to make an argument that isn't based in incorrect use of language, and make points more credible.

**** I don't really care about being "credible" when it comes to people who get off on the idea of sex with underage children tbh and I don't care what child abusers wish to classify themselves as. If someone is writing about two eleven year olds having sex or a man in his 70s having sex with a 14 year old, then as far as most people are concerned that is paedophillia and they don't want to read it. They are just two examples of things I've stumbled across in fanfic this week and they were both written with the intent to arouse. That is disgusting to most right minded people.

I'm sorry if my choice of the term paedophile to describe someone who wants to read stories about sexual content with children may have upset some paedophiles. Oh wait, no I'm not.

Most people don't want to read stories about sex with children, because most people are not child abusers. If that offends you, well frankly that sounds like a you problem not a me problem.

Readers should always, ALWAYS, be warned of truly underage pairings in fic. I would agree with you in 100% not wanting to read either of those fics and readers should 100% be able to avoid them using the tagging system in AO3, or, as you mentioned, opting for a purity-conscious site like ffn.net, which polices explicit content.

It's worth noting, however, that use of correct language is a key factor in building support for your cause. The more right you are, the harder it is to disagree with you. I was not defending people who like underage pairings, I was trying to strengthen your argument. You've passionately decided I'm a monster, though, it seems, which is a shame.

****** Going around correcting people on what nonces would prefer to be called isn't a great look.

Most people communicate using common parlance. The common parlance for someone who has or wants to have sex with an underage person is "paedophile." Everyone understands what that word means. When my point was "watch out for stories that have sexual content involving children," it was perfectly acceptable to use the broadly understood term of "paedophile."

It's worth noting that no one had disagreed with my post and there was nothing to defend, so you just jumping in with "well, technically this particular type of child abuser is called this, rather than a paedophile" looked more like you were trying to defend the people who write this stuff. It came over as "won't somebody think of the poor paedophiles."

Most people do not care what the correct term for "levels of child abuse" is, they just don't want to read stories about it. My intent wasn't to educate on different types of sexual attraction to kids of varying ages, it was to warn someone new to fanfic that this stuff exists and if you accidentally stumble across it, it can be shocking and upsetting. For those purposes, the word I chose was perfectly cromulent.

And why would I use the wrong word and give someone who's a hebephile a chance to say, "that's not me, I'm not that bad."

Anyway. I also wish that people didn't sully fanfic with the glorification of abuse, and if we ever want that to change, if we want there to be rules, we need to argue for that as clearly and accurately as we can.

** Without knowing what kinds of stories you'd like, I can only recommend the method that I used in the beginning. Start by browsing FFN and AO3 archives and read just about everything with an interesting summary/tags. Don't start filtering until you've read a pretty decent number of fanfics (or when you realize there's no more tags that interest you).

Kind of like going into the bookstore and browsing every aisle, then focusing on the YA section because there's only so many cookbooks one can read before they start clawing their eyes out. Just because most of us like cookbooks doesn't mean you would too.

** A simple way to get started is searching and sorting by favorites, but be aware that some have seemingly dropped off the face of the internet meaning such a search won't find them (I'll give an example of one particularly loved epic that's been partially deplatformed near the bottom), while others might have ironic votes due to being so bad they're crack. A few notes of terms you might want to be aware of:

Ship means romantic/sexual pairing. Many ships will use some form of combo name, while most are pretty obvious if you think for a moment (Harry/Ginny is Hinny, Harry/Daphne Greengrass is Haphne (she's virtually unknown in canon, but in fanon she's the Ice Queen of Slytherin who is almost never a true blood purist, or at least not so die-hard that she doesn't change), Draco/Harry is Drarry) some might not be quite as obvious, such as Harmony means Harry/Hermione, or Lunar Harmony adds Luna.

Slash means homosexual ship.

Harem means multi-ship, typically more than 3, these often involve unrealistic reactions from others and/or extreme power imbalances between those involved (quite a few feature outright slavery, many of those also feature a Harry too noble to take advantage) but not always (I've read one and heard of another where the boys of Hogwarts react badly to Harry getting a harem and "stealing" all "their" girls lol).

Concubine is a term often used for slavery.

Mpreg means male pregnancy.

Bond is often used to refer to some form of magical connection between characters of a romantic or sexual nature, such as soul mates, albeit sometimes it can also come from Veela fanon where life debts make them into slaves more or less.

Alpha/beta are terms that relate to strong dom/sub relationships, often with bonds, typically slash (at least I've yet to see a heterosexual fic that describes itself as alpha/beta).

Crack means humorous, especially absurd.

There are a lot of tropes, from Harry's inheritance being a lot bigger than canon (I've even read one where he literally got his own island nation and prepared to mobilize it for war), to misunderstood Slytherins (admittedly the ones I mostly read on this front are Haphne which since Daphne is not characterized in the canon barely qualifies, but yeah see [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco In Leather Pants]] if you're curious), to Dumbledore and others being insanely manipulative and betraying Harry to ludicrous degrees, to the Goblins being insanely helpful with just a little bit of niceness, to time travel do-overs. On a sad note related to that last example of a trope, what is arguably the best do-over, [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/][Nightmares of Futures Past]] (link goes to author's blog), was nonsensically removed under false pretenses from FFN (they claimed copyrighted song lyrics but there were none), but be warned that particular example is also a bit dark especially in that the time-traveled Harry has PTSD.

** Welcome to the HP fandom! This rabbit hole is nearly bottomless, but also, unfathomably wide. As such, you need to explore for yourself to learn what genres of HP fiction you will enjoy.

So not a content suggestion, but maybe a lifehack: Get @voice app for your phone. Browse the desktop version of fanfiction.net (link at the bottom of the mobile site) make sure you register if you want to be able to read the M rated stuff. And use your browser's share to... option to send the webpage to @voice reading list.

Now you've turned all of your ffn stories into audio books. Make sure you pick a voice you can tolerate for hours at a time.

Ffn also has a mobile app, but it's a pain to use, and i ocassioanlly visit other fiction sites and do the same.

** Well, what's your poison? HP is a huge fandom so there is fanfic for everything- mystery, action, humor, parody, erotica, etc. The two most used sites are fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org. The second one is mostly smut and lots of underage/nonconsensual smut at that so I tend to avoid it. A good place to start is from the most favourited fics- something ought to catch your interest.

Damn that AO3 link. Anyway, if you're looking for personal recommendations Nightmares of Futures Past is amazing- it was the most favourited fic on fanfiction.net, but someone got jealous and deleted it. Other fics I like include The Pureblood Pretense, Escape, Honour Thy Blood, A Cadmean Victory, Harry McGonagall, The Cupboard Series. Also a bunch of shorter fics I don't remember the titles of.

Nightmares of Futures Past: It's a time travel story. Some might even say it's */THE/* time travel story. I haven't read it in ages but basically an older Harry finally wins the war but has lost most, if not all, of his friends so he travels back to first year.

The Pureblood Pretense: Harry is a girl and her parents are alive and Sirius isn't in Azkaban. Riddle is a politician and Hogwarts only accepts purebloods so Harry switches places with Sirius' son to attend Hogwarts. It starts a bit slow, but give it a chance. The first three books are complete and the fourth one is ongoing.

Escape: The ministry plans to force people in marriage contracts. Hermione has to choose between Malfoy and Snape so instead she runs off with Harry. Some people don't like it for whatever reasons, but I love it. It's complete, reasonably long, the final battle is actually /planned/ and Snape and McGonagall have a good friendship.

Honour Thy Blood: At the end of Goblet of Fire Harry is rescued from the graveyard and trained by a friend of his grandfather. There is lots of combat in this one and some people may feel that Harry is a bit overpowered, but I still like it.

A Cadmean Victory: It's been a while since I read it, but after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet his friends abandon him. He discovers a portrait of Slytherin in the Chamber of Secretes and the portrait starts tutoring him. Overtime Harry befriends and enters a relationship with Fleur. This fic is darker there is gore and combat and Harry is more ruthless, but I love fics with Fleur.

Harry McGonagall: McGonagall waits for Dumbledore and Hagrid to leave and takes Harry to her family in America. I like it because McGonagall does the right thing and doesn't leave a baby in the middle of the night on a doorstep. And Harry gets to grow up with a loving family. He still goes to Hogwarts and befriends Hermione.

The Cupboard Series: Harry is abused by the Dursleys. I don't remember much, but things quickly escalate after Year Two- Harry leaves Hogwarts and after time starts his own school. It's a pretty unique plot and the series is complete.

The Prince of Slytherin gets recommended */very/* often around here but personally, I think it has overstayed its welcome. It's super long- over a million words and not even Year 3 is done. The author seems to enjoy punishing the good guys and that's just not something I enjoy reading. It's a Slytherin Harry who has a twin who is the Boy-who-lived fic. The twins' parents are alive, though Sirius is still in Azkaban and Pettigrew is a lawyer/ barrister/ solicitor and secretly smart on the side.

** I'd recommend starting with some popular tropes, then if you like a work, you could go to the author's profile and read their other works. You could also search up some key words on ffn/ao3/any other website and see what you get. Or you could read through the posts on this sub, mainly prompts and requests.

Good tropes to start with would be those that are canon-compliant, like the Harry Potter After The War trope or missing scenes that weren't included in the books.

Don't start with the heavier and longer fics/AUs until you're more or less familiar with fanfiction.

And I'd recommend looking up fanfiction terminology so that you're not too lost when reading a summary or something similar.

I'm actually not that impressed by the current top ten stories. I personally liked Methods of Rationality, but it's pretty divisive; some love it, some hate it. Several entries, like Harry Crow and Poison Pen, contain quite a lot of character-bashing, which some people like but is generally regarded as a negative, and for me, at least, To Shape and Change was pretty mediocre (not /bad/, but I wouldn't have put it in the top ten). The first half of Delenda Est was really good, but then the second half dropped the ball. A Marauder's Plan might be ok, and the premise of Sirius raising Harry is one I like, but by the time I was a few chapters in, I found myself comparing it to the Innocent series and deciding that Innocent did a much better job (I'm not a fan of special Black family magic, and having Regulus leave helpful instructions about his Horcrux theft seemed a bit too convenient).

The story that used to be #1 on the list was one I actually really do like, but FFN deleted it for bogus reasons (someone submitted a report claiming that the author didn't own the story, which is nonsense, but the FFN staff don't respond to attempts to contact them). You can still get a PDF/eBook of it at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

** Going through my favourites list and picking out ones that I'd consider popular and complete, also ones that I've reread many, many times. I will also try and give you a wide variety of pairings.

My best advice for finding "good" stories would be to go to the top posts of this subreddit and to sort ffn by favourites with all ratings enabled.

A lot of fanfiction follows canon to a certain point and then diverge. Three very common divergence points would be sometime before (or during) the sorting, after Sirius dies at the end of OoTP, and around when the Goblet selects the champions.

A Black Comedy linkffn(3401052) The veil in the Department of Mysteries goes to an alternate reality. I always found it funny, although the humour is somewhat immature. I believe most of us here have read it at some point.

The Lie I've Lived linkffn(3384712) Harry/Fleur. Not my favourite Harry/Fleur, but I'd call it a classic and probably my favourite of that pairing that is complete. One of my favourite things about the fic is that it has different tasks for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Delenda Est linkffn(5511855) Harry/Bellatrix. Weird, I know. There's only a few fics with that pairing I'd call good and time travel is involved in pretty much all of those.

A Fine Spot of Trouble linkffn(6257522) Harry/Daphne (essentially a blank slate character, that at this point has an established fanon characterisation). I like this fic for all the reasons I originally liked the pairing. That mainly being that it makes Harry and Draco brother-in-laws.

The World Without Me linkffn(2156663) One of the first "good" stories I had read. I believe it was one of the top favourited HP stories on ffn at one point, although it's a few pages back now. After a different final battle, Harry is sent to another reality where he died as a baby.

Vitum Paramus linkffn(9444529) Harry/Gabrielle. Also a Quidditch fic, as are a few other fics by that author. Warning, it's kind of an everybody dies fic with most of the extended Weasley family disappearing in a portkey accident. Not going to call that a spoiler, considering it happens in the first chapter.

Harry Potter and the Summer of Change linkffn(2567419) Harry/Tonks. Very old story. At the time it was written it was great, in my opinion.

Evitative linkao3(Evitative by Vichan) Newer fic and I've seen it recced here fairly often recently. Harry/Draco although the pairing is hardly a factor in this story. Although, I'm sure the pairing will matter more once the sequel is posted. Involves a Re-sorting and lots of dark magic.

If you want Harry/Ginny, but in a very different (darker) way. I'd reccomend quite a few of the stories by Brennus on ffn. I liked "The Thorny Rose" (3 part) series by them. Their most popular story is Hail Odysseus linkffn(10645463), which I'll admit there was one scene in there that I found very weird and put me off the fic for a while.

Most here would probably bash them, but if you want to try and read some Harry/Hermione fics then check out RobSt on ffn. I read a few of his when I first started reading fanfictions about a decade ago and I recall them as being fairly well written. Cliche ridden, but if you haven't read many that should bother you.

If you read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi, that was already reccomended in this post. I'd reccomend reading it from this post linkffn(13159120) which has the extra chapters that The Santi posted to the DLP forums and never posted to ffn. I haven't reread it in a while but I believe it was abandoned right before the Yule Ball.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** my only advice is to keep in mind Sturgeon's law

#+begin_quote
  90% of everything is crap.
#+end_quote

and more so in fanfiction, sure there are some gems out there that are practically ready for professional publication but for the most part, the laws stay true.

now for some recommendations:

Most of Northumbrian's works are canon compilant and quite well written.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]])

#+begin_quote
  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates monthly.
#+end_quote

Innocent ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]])

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
#+end_quote

Grow Young with Me ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]])

#+begin_quote
  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
#+end_quote

A Dramatic Reading ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading]])

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, /and minimal quotations/.
#+end_quote

The Unwinding of Percy Weasley ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/1/The-Unwinding-Of-Percy-Weasley]])

#+begin_quote
  Percy is given an untidy and absent minded assistant named Audrey Larrabee to help promote himself in the Ministry. Will he be able to handle her seemingly complete apathy for the Ministry? Or will she be able to help him in ways he never dreamed of?

  Severus Snape succumbed to Nagini's bite. He expected to finally be at peace, but the universe had different ideas and decided to place him during the time period right before he called Lily the M-word. Little does he know that Lily has some secrets up her sleeve as well. The plot situation is inspired by "Come Once Again and Love Me" by laventadorn.

He might have eventually chosen the right side, but that doesn't change the fact that he was a sad, pathetic little man who bullied a child he orphaned out of a childhood grudge against the boy's father. The fact that lily used to be his best friend just makes it even more inexcusable to me.

Then I remove all the tags but harry potter. Then I sort by favorites and go down the list. As I read I might decide I like the authors writing and look through whatever else they wrote. Then if I dont find anything I want their I will look through what fics they have "favorited" or saved. If I cant seem to find anything Ill come here and search up something I want to read. Like maybe I want to read fluff so Ill search up fluff in the subreddit. Or maybe im feeling some overpowered harry and Ill search that up. Thats the way I navigate my fanfiction now. When I didnt know about the app or this sub I would just search up what I wanted to read in google and dig my way through everything. Kind of a trial through fire thing. I think a lot of other people have different methods but this has worked for me the last 2 or so years.

** My personal two favorites are quite long, but stick relatively close to canon. They focus on Hermione and Ginny, with a focus on being a math prodigy that translates to arithmancy and being sorted into Slytherin, respectively. They're rather long (both with sequels), but are supremely well written with amazing development and characterization. If that doesn't sound like your type of thing, I can recommend others with characters you might enjoy more, I have a large list of favorites and it takes a few fanfiction a to really find what you enjoy the most. There are those who enjoy post-war before true epilougue, complete AUs, slytherin fics, time-travel fics, as well as a mix of all those focusing on characters other than Harry. There's even a few where very little changes, but the small changes make it worthwhile. I find myself loving those focused on the lesser known characters, though the time travel ones are a guilty pleasure. Once you find your favorite trope, let me know and I can hopefully recommend some that are amazing. I hope that I can be helpful finding something that will cause you to love fanfiction as much as the rest of us!!

linkffn(the arithmancer) linkao3(the changeling)

I'm also sure others have commented on the merits of ao3 or ffn, but in my personal experience, when getting recommendations the site doesn't matter too much. The searches are easier on archives, with the tagging features, but there are amazing fics on both! Happy fic reading.

** I'll think of fics to recommend later but the most important advice is be aware of the utter heartbreak of incomplete fanfics. Fanfiction.net is the hardest because unless the author says it's abandoned in the summary you never really know due to how the pages are set up. So always look at when a fanfic was published and when it was last updated.

The second thing is learning the lingo. My favourite story to tell was when I was 13ish and I click on a fanfic that said something like “Kagome and Sango are friends but yadada plot will they become closer?” And it had ‘Kag/San' Yuri Fic in the summary. Now at this point in my life I like to joke that I didn't have my sexual awakening yet. That will come later when I watched Mean girls for the first time. But as long as I can remember I've always had crushes on everything. Boys, girls, animated movie characters and even Mr. Clean when I was 4. but I used to be overly affectionate to friends and family so I never thought anything of it. I just liked and really liked people. I didn't even know that liking girls was a thing. And when I started reading about Kagome and Sango in a hot spring. Well I was as red as tomato and I closed the website so fast. Then quickly deleted my browser history. Tags are important to know. Lol

** Fanfiction.net has a massive fanbase with just about anything you can think of. It's not as overwhelming, in my opinion, to sort through as AO3 (archiveofourown) since it doesn't let you tag and the sorting options are more limited. You can choose a pairing, a genre, a word count - you can even exclude these things as well. It also gives you a chance to read more types of stories and get a feel for what it's like.

I will recommend this particular story though, as it's my all-time favorite and incredibly well written. The author updates regularly as well and I think it's about as long already as the entirety of the original book series. I know a lot of POS fans actually like it more than the original, myself included.

But, to understand and realize many things in fanfiction, read some manipulative Albus stories. The old man really is horrible, and these fanfictions delve a lot deeper into Albus's machinations.

But just start with different tags on ao3. They're great.

** Here are some of my favorites:

1. A Black Comedy - linkffn(3401052)
2. Mercenary (and its sequel, Hit Wizard) - linkffn(4544334)
3. Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them - linkffn(8197451)

All three of those are beautifully written. Some of them are longer (ABC), some shorter (Mercenary), some are more humorous (ABC, Mercenary) while the others are more serious (FEAWTFT), but all of them share one common trait - they have a /soul./

I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I must recommend Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality. Beware, this fic is seriously divisive, but every fanfic reader has to try it eventually. It does not conform to canon.

Antithesis, like sad stories, read this it's amazing. Harry's brother is thought to be boy who lived, Harry grows up in an orphanage. Does not comply to canon.

Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin. Harry's brother is thought to be the boy who lived. Lots of politics and world building. Does not comply to canon.

Ah hah! I have found it the link to a site which shows the amount of times a story has been linked from this subreddit. [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/]]. This link starts you out on the most recently recommended fic so fiddle around with it until you get the most recommended of a time!
