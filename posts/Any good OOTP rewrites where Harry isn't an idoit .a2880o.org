** Since OP is not exactly upfront about their issues with OotP, here's what I think is the best 5th year story around. Short term fix-it timetravel with some struggle and a superb depiction of friendships. The objective is to rewrite the timeline to reach a better outcome.

There's also "Weary Wizards", but that one ditches the canon plot (which is the logical conclusion of "smarter" protagonists).

Have you ever heard a proverb/saying that elephants don't know their own strength? Umbridge tossing either HP or HG at the giant, and the giant catching them will leave them crushed under the giant's strength. Umbridge wouldn't need to do anything at all, literally all she'd have to do is banish the two students towards the giant.

#+begin_quote

And why would Umbridge have to fight a giant who's somehow restrained in a forest? She can toss the students at him, go back and tell the authorities that HP and HG led her to a giant in the forest, and come back with reinforcements which will kill the giant for her.

I'd assume so. 20 or 30 on 1 are excellent odds if you're among the 20, even if you don't have magic. Also, what does this have to do with your previous comments? I never mentioned BL anywhere.

*********** Centaurs raping women is what they are known for in the antiquity. That's where this whole assumption comes from.

I'm saying that someone magically capable would have no issues wiping the Centaurs out. Lestrange would just unleash Fiendfyre or throw around killing curses like they are going out of fashion. Hell, Harry and Hermione would trash them (vanish earth to create a foxhole, jump in, one person casts a shield or transfigures some kind of roof, the other curses them). We are talking about bowmen/mounted archers vs magical grenade launchers here. Rorkes Drift had worse odds for the British and yet they won the day with a smaller technological advantage. But Umbridge was taken without killing even a single Centaur.

She is an incompetent fighter, that's why I don't see emerging victorious. A giant could easily catch her inside the forest since she can only escape on foot. And while the teenagers might end up injured by the giant due to the reasons you mentioned, there's no reason why he should attack them over Umbridge.

And I'm saying you have no idea how fights work. Fighters don't think, 'Oh, okay, these centaurs are archers and I have the advantage because I have magic, so I dig myself a hole, and shoot out of it while shielding myself!' when they're faced with an ambush. They literally do the first thing that comes to mind, and this is universal with all fights, not just fantastical ones.

Bellatrix Lestrange, no matter how powerful, will not win against a herd of 30 archers all by herself, especially when surrounded. Even if she uses fanfic authors' favoured Fiendfyre or however many killing curses, she will get tagged, and there is every chance that any of those arrows can be fatal.

If you still insist on believing in her ability, ask yourself whether two soldiers, one with a flamethrower, and one with an assault rifle will escape out of a situation where they're surrounded by 30 archers, all with arrows nocked and ready to fire.

#+begin_quote

I don't remember the exact specifics, but the reason why HP and HG were able to get away from the giant when they meet him for the first time with Hagrid was because the giant was restrained to the ground somehow. All Umbridge has to do is remain outside of the giant's reach, and she'd be fine.

************* You are forgetting that shield charms exist. Because they turn the odds in the favour of whoever has magic. While an argument can be made that they would not stop a bullet from a rifle, an Arrow, or even thirty would be unable to pierce it.

Also, with transfiguration you can create a whole trench/pillbox in a second, leaving you completely safe. [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Kugelbunker.jpg][Worst case scenario recreate one of these]]. You can then transfigure an opening to throw curses out.

Let's assume for the sake of the argument that shield charms are effective against physical projectiles, and somehow envelopes the caster in protective magic instead of projecting the magic in the direction the caster is pointing their wand.

What then? While the shield charm is in place,she can't do anything else either - she can't attack them. And since she's on the defensive from the very beginning, she's going to get killed without even managing to take a single kill herself. Because the instant she drops her charm, she gets shot with a dozen arrows. An archer can shoot well over 60 shots per minute with enough training.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You're assuming Grawp will let them escape. Giants don't have the same cognitive capacities as humans. In the event of Umbridge banishing the duo at him and letting loose a series of banging noises and flashing lights from her wand, the giant is going to think he's under attack and lash out at whatever's within reach.

That is pure bullshit. 60 Rounds per minute is more than you get with a modern semi-automatic rifle, and this isn't a field battle situation where you shoot in the general vicinity and hope to hit something. The highest rates you will find for archers are 20/minute, and that was neither sustainable nor aimed.

Let the centaurs exhaust their ammunition reserves (30 arrows at most, so it's just two minutes) and then pick them off one by one. Or unleash Fiendfyre, which is at least to some extent homing and then raise her shield. Do the flame wall thing, which coincidentally should deal with most of the arrows.

Waiting out an enemy barrage before counterattacking has been a thing since the invention of Trench warfare, if not earlier. And that isn't taking movie canon into account (the misty flying thing), which would allow any caster to get out of the encirclement, get into some cover (eg a tree) and fight from behind it, leaving only one direction for the enemy to come from.

Now you're assuming that the centaurs will waste their arrows like imbeciles. Why should they do such a thing? When they see that their arrows aren't hitting the target, they'll stop firing, but keep their arrows trained on Bellatrix. She literally won't be able to do anything.

#+begin_quote
  Fiendfyre
#+end_quote

Again with the fanfic authors' favourite spell. You know, this is supposed to be a difficult spell to control. If Bellatrix does control it (which she probably can), it still takes time to manifest and do its thing. It isn't an instant kill spell. That small span of time is all the herd would need to dispatch her. The depiction of Crabbe's spell leads us to believe that it is slow enough that Ron and Crabbe are both able to run away from the spell as it forms and goes out of control.

#+begin_quote
  Do the flame wall thing, which coincidentally should deal with most of the arrows.
#+end_quote

What flame wall? Conjure a sphere of fire to protect her from arrows from all sides? Arrows are made of steel - they can pierce fire just fine.

And if this "flame wall" idea of yours is cursed fire hot enough to melt arrows instantly (like fiendfyre), then she might as well commit suicide. She'll get cooked within seconds. No human can survive conditions like that, magic or no magic.
