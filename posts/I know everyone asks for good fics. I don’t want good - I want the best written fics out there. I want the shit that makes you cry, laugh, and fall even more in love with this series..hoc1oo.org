Well that was the longest title i've ever written.

Pairings be damned here. I don't care if it's canonical or not. While I prefer longer fics - tonight I just want everything. Whatever has the best writing, plots or whatever. Stick it below.

If you want to, tell me why too.

** ​

Twenty-nine by Endrina ticked many boxes for me. She also has another fic, Twenty-six which is longer in the same 'universe' as it were. I strongly preferred Twenty-nine to Twenty-six but they are both good.

Chronologically, Twenty-six comes first but you can read them in either order and you'll get a different experience either way. I read Twenty-nine first and felt it was the 'better' order, but can't explain why because of spoilers. I'm told that people who read Twenty-six first were equally enamoured.

linkao3(51162523)

I'll admit that I have a tendency towards poor bookmarking and struggle to find my favourites again. There's a good fic where an older Harry, Hermione and Ron go back in time for a re-do but things keep getting messed up.

They are mysteriously helped by person known only as The Asp. Followed by a sequel from the perspective of the Asp which adds far more depth to the original fic.

Then another slash fic, All the Young Dudes. It's a slow burn though. I would say the character development, particularly of Remus is very good.

linkao3(10057010)

Text Talk is very good for a fic mainly based on Texting.

linkao3(1651109)

Unfortunately, all my other bests - the truly brilliant ones - are lost to the world, or unfinished. It's odd because I mostly read gen, yet apparently I bookmark slash very well...

The one unfinished fic I will offer is Blurred Reality which I can only describe as the Black Swan of Harry Potter. It's only got 6 chapters and clearly had much more lined up, but it also tells you just enough that you can infer an ending - even if the writer had intended more twists. I think I was drawn in by the psychological horror elements, but in truth I can't watch them at all so it's possible that anyone who can stomach them won't find it as good.

These are all completed and are of decent quality. There's enough variation that I'm sure there's a fic in there for your tastes. Of all of them, Realignment is my favorite. If you would like some incomplete recommendations as well or some more completed fics of dubious quality, feel free to ask.

** One shots: Linkffn(I know not and cannot know --- yet I live and I love) --- I recommend this wayyy to often, but I swear its the best oneshot I've ever read.

Linkffn(Minerva's Boys by alexannah) --- quite touching, not entirely sure about the characterization since I haven't read it properly in a while

Linkffn(The line by glespa) --- it portrayed the Slytherins really well

Linkffn(Evil be thou my good by ruskbyte) --- I can't explain why I like it so much

Linkao3(Overemotional: in defense of Cho Chang) --- the whole series is gold. It made me cry so much (I don't really cry much when reading)

Linkao3(Living on by wingdance) --- the concept of Lily adopting other children is quite cool, and I wish there was a sequel for this

Linkao3(to rise in perfect light) --- its sweet and sad and touching, and I don't know how to explain why I like it so much

Linkffn(Brother by eedwrites) --- kind of bittersweet??? but also somewhat funny

Linkffn(Constant vigilance by Kevin3) --- I wish there were more fics like this, it was hilarious 😆

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the garden) --- it was all for that one pun xD

Linkffn(just a random tuesday) --- okay this isn't a one shot but its good. It's really amusing, how Professor McGonagall reacts to Umbridge's nonsense.

Longer fics: Linkao3(i won't just survive no you will see me thrive) --- I liked how the author wrote James' reaction to Harry being in Slytherin without give it me too much secondhand embarrassment but also not making him overly accepting of the idea.

Linkao3(Be the light in my lantern by starfishstar) --- I loved it so, so much. The characterization of Remus is on point, and I like how it depicts the werewolves. (its a series)

Linkoa3(The accidental animagus) --- haven't read it in a while, but I really liked it

Linkao3(Because why not by starspangledmeatball) --- again, its also been a while since I've read it, but I seem to remember that it was quite unique and written quite well.

Linkffn(the changeling by annerb) --- it was so good, the last few chapters made me cry and I almost never cry when reading.

Linkffn(Midnight by the Weasley watch by excessivelyperky) --- I like the characterization here, and really want more similar fics.

Linkffn(the house of potter rebuilt) --- this one doesn't have much conflict, but I really like the way harry solves the Voldemort horcruxes

Tightly Knit by KMbell92 on Wattpad --- this author has more than 6 books set in this AU, and each is over 100 chapters long. It's really worth it.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  Six months after escaping Crait, the tiny Resistance force has been hiding on the Outer Rim planet of Arisaig, trying to regroup and plan their next move. Rey and Ben have made no contact since the last moment on Crait. Rey is trying to continue her training, but is finding it more difficult to understand her place without a teacher. Her thoughts slip back to the throne room every so often and she wonders if she made the wrong decision for the right reason. Knowing she is putting the rebuilding Resistance in danger, Rey decides to leave and find the closure and answers she has been searching for. Little did she know, or maybe she knew it all along, they would lead her right back to him.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** If at all interested in Sirius Black and/or the Black family, my absolute favorite fic series with them is called the Black Sheep Dog (~500k WC so far). It has hands down the best Sirius + best Dumbledore characterization I've ever read in fanfic, excellent flowing dialogue, and a variety of very fleshed out characters that exist only as the barest sketches in canon.

The second series is still updating, but the author updates fairly regularly and there is a lot of writing to catch up with in the first place.

** linkffn(8346230) - This is the fanfic that makes me cry and fall in love with the series. It has grammatical and spelling errors, but it remains one of my favourites of all time. The relationship between Harry and Sirius makes me long for that time of parental relationship with my own parents. Their commitment and trust is so wholesome that I can almost imagine myself there.

linkffn(6243892) - I have my own issues with this fic [such as the ending], but I remember reading it and feeling the mystery of the original books. Few fics give me the sense of adventure of the original series; this one does.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) - This is the fic that made me fall in love with Remus Lupin. It's wolfstar and canonical and the characterization is some of the best I've ever seen. The fic is wolfstar and the lead up to it is so well done.
