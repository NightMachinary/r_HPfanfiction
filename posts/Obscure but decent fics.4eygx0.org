  Every seventy years members of the Order of the Bath, a British order of chivalry, are being killed off. That is until Harry is brought in to hunt the killer or killers down. Harry/Padma. *Complete*

Top 10 writing in the fandom. You have to power through the first few chapters if you're uncomfortable not knowing wtf is going on; things make sense later but there isn't really a touchstone for common FF tropes that will guide you here. This fic's kind of unique that way. The writing is suuuuuper good, though.

  A young man realizes he's been the victim of a prophecy. He struggles to make sense of his place in an unfamiliar world. Sound familiar? Nothing's familiar to this young man. Nothing except his aunt Arthur. New readers: give this one some time.

** linkffn(Resurrexit)

You're probably wondering why it only has 30 something reviews. Don't let that scare you off; the entire darned thing was posted in one day. Really good dark mystery.

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!
