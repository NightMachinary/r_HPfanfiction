A long time ago when I was still in my ridiculously OP Harry stage I read a fic and it's sequel both by Mione5 called Heir of the Four Founders and The Curse of Count (something I can't remember). These stories are no where to be found online and frankly I'm in a bit of a nostalgic mood, does anyone by any chance have them saved or downloaded and can send me them? I'd be deeply appreciative.


** I found this on scribd. No promises as I've never read the fic. Good luck.
