In case you didn't know, you can go to your profile account page on ff.net, and if you click on favorites and then favorite stories, you can see all the stories you've ever faved. But you can also sort that list by date added. When you sort by date added, what's the first fic that comes up? Mine is linkffn(4063335).


** I really should get around to making a profile on there eventually.

** That fanfic you linked looks really interesting. I'll add it to my to-read list.

The first story I fav'd was linkffn(A Long Journey Home). Back then it had barely a hundred follows and nobody knew about it. Makes me happy to see how popular it has become.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** It's actually three parts, the first one is focused on Rose more (iirc) but the second and third fic are more general next gen. There's no death eaters but it's not fluffy either. You kind of hate the entire family and you want to hit each and every one of them (including the parents) but at the same time you understand how they got to that place and you love them. Like you want to root for them even though they don't always make the best decisions.

It's like if you took the average fluff next gen and downgraded everyone's parenting skills.

It's really compelling though. Highly recommend, especially the second one.

** linkffn(6853748) A Harry/Hermione/Gabrielle fic? Anyway, from what I remember, I thought the writing quality was really, /really/ good, but the story is only three chapters and got literally no-where before it was put "on hold" 5 years ago (I think Hermione isn't even in it until the last chapter).

I think I favourited it because I hadn't worked out the difference between fave and follow yet, but there you go.

** Mine was linkffn(A Butterfly Effect). That sure is a strong start. If you haven't read it, it's a fem!Harry but with a tone as mature and dark as the last books from the beggining. The author's version of Quirell is legitimately terrifying. Quite a bit on the long side, but a must read to my mind.
