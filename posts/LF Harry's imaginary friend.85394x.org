Looking for fics where Harry has an 'imaginary friend'. Basically, its an entity that Harry (and mostly only Harry) can see and hear and possibly interact with (that is, touch). Methods of 'how', as a suggestion or prompt:

- They could be a real imaginary friend that his young lonely mind came up with for companionship
- Harry has a link to another being somewhere else in the world or realities (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7201522/1/The-Wizard-and-the-Lonely-Princess][The Wizard and the Lonely Princess]] by Harry Leferts)
- It is the result of some ritual such as becoming an animagus (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954433/1/Snake-in-Lion-Skin][Snake in Lion Skin]] by Wolfwhispers)
- Harry is playing host to an entity (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal with a Devil]] by Silently Watches +or his canon guest+)

Bonus if its an actual imaginary friend/tulpa and thus can access Harry's magic, because it is still technically Harry as far as the magic is concerned, or magic makes the friend more... real, like it can touch things or the goblins or ghosts can detect it even if they can't see it (like in TWatLP above), though others seeing/hearing it is alright as long as its not everyone who can do so (like in 'Snake in Lion Skin' above).

[[/r/tulpas]] is a laugh riot btw. Not quite as good as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/5d1swn/serious_urgent_best_way_to_get_rid_of_demon_after/][the best of /r/occult]] but still pretty fun.

*** Thank you very much! Not surprised to see so many Toms in there, but glad to see some others too. And to be honest, I threw in tulpa more to be inclusive, as I'm doubtful there's any stories that include that terminology, let alone origin. I'm not quite sure what to make of your The Lesser Sadness comments though, such as what you mean by superdark wizards (I at least googled to figure out what OotS and Varsuvius were).

They are 3 insanely powerful malevolent OCs, all former Dark Lords. Their backstories are briefiy expositioned in the first chapter when he is offered portions of their soul to combine with his own. Ultimately the only important part is that they are horrifyingly evil and have a massive influence on his decisions and spellwork.

***** Ah, so it would fall under "host" in a way. I see now.
