:END:
He wakes up and his parents are around and he has a sister (I think younger?) and he basically spends the vast majority of the story utterly convinced he's either dreaming or hallucinating in some way. The possibly hallucinatory family are a little miffed by this, but are generally accepting of their relative's weirdness.

It's definitely on Ao3 or FFNet, and I don't think there was any pairing (but I'm not 100% sure on that).

The next bit kind of spoils the big plot twist, so I'm putting it in spoiler marker thingies.

Eventually, he finds out that he is dreaming, and it's due to a spell cast on him by Voldemort in an attempt to trap him in a fantasy world so he won't want to return to reality. Cue a very "We'll be here whenever you need us" Labyrinth-style ending sequence before he decides to wake up and move on.

And to open this up a little - if you have any other fics that have Harry meeting his family and the integration/transition process not being easy for whatever reason, I'd be grateful. :)
