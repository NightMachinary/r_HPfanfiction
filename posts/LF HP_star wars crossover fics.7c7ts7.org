Recently I got up to date on Havoc side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh and I'm looking for similar fanfics. Harry goes to starwars especially, not starwars enters the wizarding world. Harry who somehow becomes immortal (MOD, Magical accident, a quirk of prophecy, him being Fate's little bitch, nanomachines, ancient force technique...) is preferable and smart enough that he finishes his half-assed education on magic in hogwarts before he goes out to the stars.


** Only about a week ago a similar thread was opened, wont be many other recommendations I would expect. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7asb3d/lfrequest_hpstar_wars_crossover_fics/]]

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

*** in honor of the last two hp/sw fic request threads here where I shit all over this story, my nanowrimo story is now a hp/sw fic. So at least when this thread pops up every week there will at least be one different rec in it hopefully.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341), match your criteria very well. In addition to Harry, both Hermione and Luna would gain Force powers, wield light sabers, and unleash force lightening.

Another work by the same author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]], has MoD Harry unleash his fury on the Empire. But it happened way after Hogwarts era.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** It's Star Wars enters Wizarding World rather than the opposite, but I'll still drop a link to linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon).

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.
