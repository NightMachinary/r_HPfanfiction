There are many fanfics out there where Ron hates Harry after he is sorted into Slytherin. But then I found this fanfic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421695?view_full_work=true]]

I think it's a very funny fanfic but actually fitting Rons character choosing Slytherin for being with his friend - especially when you think about that Harry was his first friend. He only had his silblings and maybe Cedric (who was older) and Luna (who was younger) in the neighbourhood. And he has some qualities to thrive in Slytherin: He is ambitious (look at the mirror of erised), he is at least a little bit cunning (chessgame!) and he is a pureblood (he doesn't care about it, but many Slytherins do)

So I wanna ask: Is there any fanfic out there where Ron chooses Slytherin for Harry and which is a little more serious then the one I read?


** Eh, I can think of Slytherin Ron fics if you want those in general, but this might be the only one where he explicitly joins because of Harry

*** I know some of them; I liked A Darker Shade of Red and I think Choices and Fate (both with Seer!Ron in Slytherin) were okay.

But I really want to see a fanfic where Ron and Harry are together in Slytherin (and it's no all dark and edgy)

Really love the trio in this fic, especially Ron. The world building also left quite an impression on me!

*** I'd like to see some. I think it is an interesting concept if it isn't just to make him evil.

** Here's a Slytherin Ginny that was well written, and I really enjoyed. Some Harry/Ginny interplay but not the "Ginny follows Harry around" type. I know its not what you asked for but I am thinking you might like it anyway. The bot's not working for me, so here's the description and link:

The Changeling

By: Annerb

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why
