** I need to get up to date. Havent finished chapter 9 yet. Does Harry get more powerful, or at least a wand again sometime soon? Or is it just more wandering for a while?

*** He does eventually get a wand in the end of chapter 25

More powerful happens too and slightly faster. Nothing absurd, but he certainly ain't a pushover either.

** Haven't picked up fanfiction in years but this might draw me back though I am a bit leery because I remember the story just starting to bloat without any real progress

*** I've watched the movies but not read the books. (I know. I am ashamed.) Still, enjoyed this a great deal even without recognising all the names and lore. The Harry in this feels real and canon-ish.

*** It is not really needed. Most of the lore doesn't even come from LotR or Hobbit but from 'The Silmarillion' which tells the whole history of middle earth from it's creation. But reading this isn't necessary either and when questions arise: the author has created a website with lore information.
