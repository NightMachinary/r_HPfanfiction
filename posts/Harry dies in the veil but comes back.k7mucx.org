Sirius doesn't die, Harry comes back because the Horcrux inside of him was destroyed


** He doesn't come back, but if you're looking for stories where Harry falls into the veil and dies, there's always [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13736484/1/Hear-Me][Hear Me]] It's one of the few stories I've seen that has him go through the veil and die.
