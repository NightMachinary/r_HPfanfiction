I can remember a few odd details here and there- Draco leaves malfoy manor (or gets kicked out somehow?) and travels around muggle England. He has no concept of anything that is going on, so a lot of it is him learning. He stays at an inn by a sea (?) maybe just in a touristy town. He does menial labor for awhile. I remember him getting big into gardening?

I really enjoyed this fic and I'm sad that I can't find it!

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I loved this fic until the ending... It was just too abrupt and felt unresolved. But I absolutely loved Draco trying to figure out how the whole muggle thing worked.
