I was just checking Hermione's wiki page to make sure I had the right place when I realized Hermione's hometown is never stated. So why is it that I (and most fanfic authors) think she lives in Crawley?


** Because someone used it once, and someone else thought it was good and used it too, and then it snowballed. You'll find this is the explanation for 90% of fanon stuff.

*** Fair Enough. That's kinda what I thought but with this fandom you never know.

** For my part I favor the Grangers living in Winchester, as suggested in the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/][Secrets of the Classlist]] essay on hp-lexicon. It's one county over (in Hampshire instead of West Sussex).

*** I find it funny that, according to the essay you linked, one of the possible towns that Lavender Brown could have grown up in is Crawley. So I'm choosing to run with that in my headcanon now.

** RobSt supports Crawley Town FC.. Pretty sure he kick-started that one.. As well as doing a fair bit to popularize naming Hermione's parents Daniel and Emma..

Edit: and the reason, I think, of Shorthand of Hermione being Hr is that H obviously gets pinned on Harry, because his name is literally on the cover, and using He, those being the first two letters of her name might be confusing because it happens to already be a common word in the English language, so someone went Hr, and the rest of the community kept running with it.

** Fanon can be very powerful... there's lots of things that only happen in fanon, that became so popular that people think it's canon.

For one thing, nowhere in canon did anyone ever say "I swear on my magic," and there's no evidence at all that the Black family was richer than the Potters.

My headcanon is that Hermione lived in Hampstead... largely because when we see Hermione's home in the first DH movie, the outdoors scenes were shot in Hampstead. That doesn't mean it's canon that the Grangers lived in Hampstead, but it works well enough as a headcanon.... especially if you don't want to use any of Robst's ideas.

** I always thought she lived in London for some reason. Am I the only one? Like in the suburbs.

*** That's my headcanon too. :) I place her in Hampstead, which is located in London. Largely because, as I mentioned above, when the DH movie showed Hermione leaving her home, it was shot on location in Hampstead.
