Okay first off. I cant Remember if it is a Cross over or not. But might be.

The theme was Something Like a Group of girls go to a cave to hold Some kind of burial for a Grandmom or something that died and asked them to do this. SÃ¥ they do. Harry Potter appears. He is then taken to a hospital Where de talks to a shrink. Its in the future. Think he ends up falling in love with One or more. And Something About a disease

Please help
