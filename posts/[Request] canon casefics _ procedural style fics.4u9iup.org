I thought it would be interesting to have a fic in a sort of crime detective procedural style ala Sherlock or CSI or Castle TV series Like a TV series style? but with the post-war auror corps instead, and with a side focus on the various canon pairings, but haven't seen many of these fics. Preferably, fics with short individual cases lasting a few chapters long, instead of just one main long case (although having both in a fic would be a bonus).

- must be post-war!
- slice of life/dashes of humour prefered, something light hearted and not too angsty!
- extra brownie points for harry/ginny, ron/hermione, or harry centric fics


** I'm not sure this is exactly the thing you're looking for as it is an over-arching plot and a bit angsty (though there are funny moments too), but my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] is Harry centric and follows him as an Auror 3 years after DH, with his trainee, an OC. It's Harry/Ginny too, but there's not a huge focus on romance.

  "After the war, I thought it would be easy. Work with the Aurors, get married, have children. Buy a big house, play Quidditch with the kids---be a family man. But, well, you know how it goes. Terrorism. Drugs. MI-7. England. And of course, here I am, stuck in the middle of it. Some things never change, I guess." Post-DH, EWE. HP/HG
