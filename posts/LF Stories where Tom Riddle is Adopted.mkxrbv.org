Search inspired by the other post with the prompt about Dumbledore's meeting with Tom going differently.

I know I've read at least one story where Harry went back in time and adopted Tom, but I don't remember anything about it other than that.

But anyway, could be adopted by muggles, Dumbles, time travelers, whatever. Would prefer them to be loving and non-abusive.


** Okay, I really love stories like this so I tried to find as many as I could for you. I think I've got a pretty good variety here.

So, in no particular order, here they are.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]] . This one is my favorite out of all the ones I'm recommending to you. Voldemort goes back in time and adopts himself. It's still in-progress but it's almost done and the author updates regularly. 10/10 I highly recommend it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4457149/1/Last-Chance][Last Chance]]. Dumbledore adopts an eleven year old Tom Riddle. It's sadly unfinished, but still worth a read imo.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26700229/chapters/65129239][Over the Summer]] Muggles adopt a 15 year old Tom Riddle. It's short, but very good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26213683][Unprepared, Standing at Stranger's Doorstep]] In this one Tom Riddle Sr. adopts Tom Riddle. It's a one-shot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12604867/1/][The Glass Serpant and the Dark Horse]]. It is another one where Tom Riddle Sr. adopts Tom Riddle, but it is much longer. I am unsure if it is finished (sorry), but it is 40 chapters long. It also goes into Tom x Harry eventually, so there's that.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6700824/1/][Like Father like Son]]. It is ANOTHER Tom Riddle Sr. adopts Tom fic. I am actually reading this one currently, but it seems pretty good so far!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21215447][Tom Potter]] Tom Riddle travels to the future, and Harry adopts him and raises him alongside his other three kids. It's a one-shot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10547350][Oh my Little Riddle]] Another one-shot. This one is sad. Basically, Harry's dying and Tom reflects upon his getting adopted, and wishes he was a better son.

I hope you find some good ones on this list!!

** I've got one that kinda fits this. I'm reading right now and it's pretty good. It's an AU where Hermione was born in the same year as Tom, and her influence on his life slowly changes things. He does eventually get adopted, but it happens later in their Hogwarts career and only begins to impact the plot more than halfway through the fic. It sounds like it's in the ballpark of what you're looking for and it's well-written with fairly believable characterization, and the author has done an amazing job at keeping details accurate to the time period.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  Tricked into holding what she'd thought was a broken time-turner, Hermione was sent back to 1926. She was stuck in time and lived in the Leaky. While struggling to build a new life, an odd couple caught her attention. No way could a man love such a woman so intensely, right? A simple answer: Love potion. Little did Hermione know that she was intervening to the newly-wed Riddles.
