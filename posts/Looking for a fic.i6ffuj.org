:END:
Harry becomes friends with dudley, Ron takes muggle studies, Ron gets a new wand, there's some Dudley POV ,Harry sends Dudley a christmas present.

I hope that's enough information.


** Could it be "Seasons of Change" linkffn(9969014) ? Harry sends Dudley an introductory book about the wizarding world for Christmas in first year. I don't remember anything about muggle studies though.

#+begin_quote
  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.
