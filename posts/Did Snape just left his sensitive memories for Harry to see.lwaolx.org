** Well it's enough of a curiosity that gives those who don't believe Snape was/can be redeemed justification for their suspicion that the memories were a setup. Eg why not leave memories that show James Potter (who Snape hates) in the worst light possible for his son (who Snape also hates because he looks like James, and is a reminder that Lily chose James) to easily examine when you go and leave Harry alone with them.

What better way to torment the son of his most hated enemy with memories of his father being a bully?

Remembering that Snape didn't ask Dumbledore to save the Potter family, he didn't ask him to save Lily and her son, he just asked him to save Lily. So Snape didn't care if James and Harry died. He just wanted Lily. And his treatment of harry proved his pettiness and his hatred.
