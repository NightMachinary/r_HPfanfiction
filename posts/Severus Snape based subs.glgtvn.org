Hi, I don't mean to be a bother or come off rude. I know many (and by many, it seems to be most) people are not very fond of Severus Snape. Now, I will fully admit to being a “Snape Apologizer” if you all promise not to drag me in the comments and treat me disrespectfully.

I don't think I have to justify why, and definitely not in this post, why I really love his character.

However, I simply come here to ask if any of my fellow snape-loving people on this sub know of any other subs that are more positive to his character - including fics and even just discussions. I feel as if I am at the wrong end of a witch hunt when I disclose my favoritism for one of the most hated men in the series (and even more so when I mention I ship Snamione.)

I hope I do not offend those who dislike him or get kicked from this sub. I simply want a sub in addition to this one that I may explore this opinion with like-minded people.

*/this was crossposted in both HP Fanfic and HP subs/*


** It's so sad you feel the need to justify and apologize so profusely for your love for a goddamn fictional character. I hope people on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] have been nicer for once, because from my experience they really aren't.

But to answer your question, I don't think there are any reddit subs HP-related devoid of Snape hate. You can create that sub though! something like [[/r/HPpositive][r/HPpositive]] or [[/r/HPlove][r/HPlove]] haha

*** Nope, that sub was actually the reason I posted this here. I'm so tired of seeing posts where they either talk badly of him or basically bait us to comment on their posts asking why we like him -then harass us for it.

Anyway. Thanks for the response and being kind' I've been wondering if I should just leave the the sub. I'll check out those though!!

**** Yeah [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is quite terrible. I periodically sub because I crave HP content then unsub because of the hate and negativity, especially about Snape. Then I realized it's not like there's any kind of original content anymore there so I don't think I'll ever go back. This sub has legit provided me with much more better new content, ideas and headcanons, which makes sense because it's a fanwork sub. I like it much better here.

***** I enjoy this sub. There's less hate and everyone has unique content that even if it doesn't have anything to do with snape, it's still good.

I love this sub. A lot.

And I'm glad that if you don't support or love Snape, you all are less likely to lash out in hate comments. I don't mind civil discussion but to be downright mean like that sub....yeah.

** Honestly, I don't really think this sub is that opposed to him, especially when you can change characters so easily by saying that it's an AU.

Of course, if you're looking for a teacher/student relationship it can be a bit more complicated but I'd be extremely surprised if you were met by torrents of hate and disapproval by posting discussions about him as this sub feels on the more older side of fanfic subs, making more mature and calm discussion more frequent than on other similar subs IMHO.

Now, if you're looking for a place to post memes and fanboy/girl about Snape, I'm afraid you're looking for a circlejerk and I've got no idea where to find one.

Hope you'll feel at ease here.

*** How well-received my own posts focusing on Snape are is a complete crapshoot on this subreddit. It used to be even worse, but plenty of my posts are still downvoted. OP is entirely "justified" in feeling a need to apologize for his opinions -- I think it's ridiculous, but it's definitely not groundless.

At least I'm no longer downvoted into oblivion for happening to like Snily, so I guess there's that -- the sheer mention of the ship seemed to be frowned upon at one point.

**** Lol. So far, this sub is much kinder than the actual Harry Potter sub for the most part. It is always 100% a crapshoot on what will be well received and what won't when it comes to him. I mostly just want to be able to post freely about him without people harassing me about it and I also don't want to see every other post dedicated to talking smack about the guy and baiting others who like him to comment.

I completely understand the Snamione thing. People don't like it. Think it's predatory, whatever. I also happen to think they're witches and wizards who live way longer than muggles and once they are of age, whose to say an age gap relationship is wrong? Personally, I can admit that perhaps me being okay with it is that I am in a relationship with a man 12 years my senior.

But yes, I feel that I should apologize and explain myself each time when discussing snape in general and it's unfair.

***** I really don't think you should apologise or explain yourself whenever you talk about snape, to be honest, I personally ship snarry and in my opinion if people have a problem with that than it's their problem, and that is definitely not an excuse to harras people bully them.

I believe that everyone can have their own ship and chracter preferences and allthou I don't like cairtain ships or think that might be disturbing I don't harras people and I really believe everyone else would do the same, if you aren't capable of respecting other people ships or loved I really don't think you should apologise or explain yourself whenever you talk about snape, to be honest, I personally ship snarry and in my opinion if people have a problem with that than it's their problem, and that is defiantly not an excuse to harras people and in my opinion bully somone.

** I don't know if there's a subreddit dedicated to him. I do know that there are Discords with a focus on Snape fanfics, however -- you have several picks for that -- discords with a focus on certain tropes/ships such as Snily, Severitus, Snarry, Snamione (and I even found a Snape/Sinistra one once but it was dead), and ones that are about fics with him in general, etc.

** Right there with you, Snape is my #1, numero-uno, chief-papi, favourite character. Second favourite is likely Voldemort, then Mad-Eye.

I'd personally /love/ a Snape-specific sub. Or a "writers corner" for HPFanFic Authors to theorize about characters they are writing. I have so much trouble writing Snape, but he fits extremely well into many of my stories.

*** Yeah, it's a pity that talking and writing about Snape has become so associated with constant attacks and defensiveness. Long ago, when I started in HP fandom on LiveJournal, the pockets where Snape fans congregated used to discuss his motivations and character in personal journals and in communities dedicated to him. There was a ton of meta. Of course, the series was still in progress then, so a lot of it was canon speculation. I was largely in Snape/Harry fandom, so canon wasn't really a concern of ours, but most of us enjoyed other Snape pairings as well.

These days it seems the conversations are shaped by having to react to tiresome negative opinions and escalating insults. On HPSlashFic, where there's a decent percentage of Snarry writers, I've probably written a thousand words of meta about Snape simply because the question "What's the appeal of..?" crops up periodically. Meaning why Snape or Snape/Harry. Sometimes it's polite curiosity, and sometimes we're expected to justify a ship the questioner finds unacceptable.

Tumblr was horrible about Snape, but even his fans, who produced reams of meta and fanciful speculation, could be way too intense. The tendency to over-identify - which is, of course, a hallmark of fandom - was exhausting on both sides.

Right now I don't know of a place where Snape fans of every stripe gather together, be it slash, het, or gen. If you read and write slash, you might check out [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]], but I'm not aware of a comparable het or gen Snape sub on reddit.

Discord seems to be the place a lot of writers gather, but the chat format doesn't work well for me, so I gave it up. You might check around for an invite. I'm pretty sure a Snape discord exists, but I don't have the link anymore.

** I hate canon-Snape with a passion. In no way does this give me the right to shame people for liking him. You are valid, my friend.

As a sub, there is probably one called [[/r/snape][r/snape]] and if you are looking for fics, I'd recommend Severitus. It started off as a challenge, but is more of a genre at this point.
