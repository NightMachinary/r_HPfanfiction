:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the details I can remember out of this one is this: it was pretty canon compliant, but Harry had a sister or something, and she ended up dying at some point maybe, and also Harry ended up meeting Lily's ghost who showed up or was there the whole time! And anyway the biggest and greatest part of this fic was the twist ending and it's mainly why I want to find it again!

The ending has Harry waking up in like the Burrow or Grimmauld Place, and it's like the ending to the wizard of oz and it turns out it was all a dream! Voldemort had put a spell on Harry to create this huge dreamworld and made up his fake sister all to try and get info about the Order and Dumbledore and stuff out of Harry's head. either that or harry's dreamworld sister was actually a mental guardian or something. i can't remember which!

It was pretty much the only story I've ever read where I loved the "it was all a dream" trope. :D

So yeah please to the heavens, if anybody knows this fic, link it.


** Was the sister's name Violet and in the dreamworld Neville was the BWL? And the trio was able to complete the Horcrux hunt because they were in the same locations as the dream?
