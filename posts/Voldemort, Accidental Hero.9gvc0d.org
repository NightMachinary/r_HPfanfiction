I've had this weird idea for an avengers crossover where Voldy wakes up in the middle of the battle of New York and just starts tearing up the aliens and is considered a hero. And he keeps trying to do villainous things but everyone loves him. Haha just a thought I had to share.


** There's one where he does this with Captain America in WWII. He gets captured by HYDRA after a bad apparition after killing his father, ends up working beside the howling commandos in prison, joins the good guys from there. I can't remember it's name now. Dammit.

Edit - linkffn(12490736) here it is. Come Together.

Doesn't appear the bot is working (or I messed it up). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together]]

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
