** I've attempted to write this pairing 3 or 4 times. Probably have done over 100k words of it, but I just can't really get it to work properly in any of them while retaining the feel of both worlds.

**** The longest idea I manage to write ended up at around 40k words before I realized it was going nowhere. I've found there two be two major hurdles, in that Dani is 13 in the books to start with, and that there is a canon perception that Magic magic is largely thought to have died out when the dragons did, so having a singular wizard exist would make him OP.

So, you go with the show ages, which is fine because otherwise there's some serious pedo problems, not to mention that GRRM doesn't like fanfiction so that means you should use the GoT show rather than ASOIAF (though I usually just take the best ideas of both, like, the Lady Stoneheart plot is dumb in the books, while Barristan Selmy dying randomly in the show is also dumb.).

Now, I personally find it more interesting when it's Harry going to the other world, rather than the lamesauce that is Dani going to Hogwarts. But, then you have a singular person with wizardry in Westeros or Essos. I don't think it's impossible to make work, since the common folk won't know his true power and will assume he's just another shadow-binder, or a follow of the Red God. But, it likely will take a better writer than me to pull it off convincingly.

Anyways, my best premise pretty much just Harry looking for an apprentice, which means someone with the blood of old valyria. The only way Harry can convince Viserys to hand over Dani to him instead of Drogo is to give him some dragons, so Harry searches around until he finds one in the shadowlands beyond asshai. Otherwise, Harry would have to deal with Drogo's sloppy seconds, and we don't want that for our hero, do we?

So, as you can see, there's a reason this idea never went anywhere, because it's pretty bad.

I thought Michelle Fairley was recently sighted on set for Season Six of GoT which could mean LSH is coming to the show as well, but it could just be another rumour from [[/r/asoiaf]]

You should be commended for getting as far as you did with the idea. It sounds like quite a challenge. You make a really good point about Harry being naturally OP as the only wizard in that universe.

Well, yes. If you were thinking about a smart, resourceful, powerful but most of all fully learned wizard. In effect, just about everything Harry Potter usually is portrayed like in fanfiction.

Take a second or third year Hogwarts student, put him in Westeros or somewhere else on that world and you'd be surprised how little of an unsurmountable challenge that wizard will present to any group of half-way decent fighting men as we know them from ASoIaF. The more notoriety that young wizard gains, the easier it will be to defeat him.

I think Rowling's story up to and including the Tri-Wizard tournament showed perfectly how little prepared an under-aged wizard truly is for life outside the safety of Hogwarts castle. No doubt there were plenty of dangerous situations to overcome for Harry and his circle of friends, even in their early years, but those were rather different from what his life in George R.R. Martin's created world would be like. The many situations where Harry faced his danger in a one-on-one manner like he did at Hogwarts would very likely allow him to overpower any such opposition in Westeros, true. I don't think that this is the point though.

Neither Harry, nor I suspect most other Hogwarts students at that age, are capable of surviving in a potentially very hostile environment if they are by themselves. Would such an adolescent wizard be capable of detecting poison or defend from an arrow shot at him from an ambush? Both are a valid concern, because there is no indication that young wizards even know how to hide themselves from non-magicals, much less be able to defend themselves from groups of them. Much of what happened in Dumbledore's Army during Harry's fifth year doesn't fill me with confidence either, when you consider the kind of spells they chose to train themselves in as a defense against potential Death Eater attacks.

Then there's the issue of magically combating a larger group of enemies, who would be quick to stick a few holes into any wizard they can get close enough to. If one disregards that the only truly awesome area of effect spell (the Patronus charm) isn't applicable against humans, as per Harry Potter canon we have no indication that any third year student would know or be capable of casting those kinds of spells. The most common kind of magic is only moderately powerful and usually targets singular objects or people. That's a serious if not fatal drawback once you stand against a dozen warriors with swords, spears or other pointy weapons.

So yes, after thinking about it for a little bit, I can see many reasons why an unprepared adolescent wizard from the Harry Potter universe would have difficulty surviving there, much less be over-powered except for specific circumstances.

In that situation I'd also rather take Hermione, because she has a good memory and she is very well read. Well, maybe if Harry had a multi-compartment trunk with a huge library and no aversion to actually read a few textbooks I'd think differently, but those are some rather well-used clich√©s ;)

***** You could take the route that The Black Prince author does and have Harry be born into the world of ice and fire after dying whatever death you want on Earth and retaining his memories of using magic. His proximity to Dany and the dragons could have interesting effects on him.
