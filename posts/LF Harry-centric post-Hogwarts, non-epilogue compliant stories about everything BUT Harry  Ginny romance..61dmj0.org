LF stories that deal with recovery (personal or social), politics, justice, rebuilding, etc. A boiler plate romance (Ginny, Hermione, etc) should not be central to the story, though unusual romances (Narcissa, Andromeda, etc) are welcome.

** linkffn(7558470) is an interesting fic that takes place after DH. Romance is heavily implied, and there is some attempted manipulation of Harry, he handles it carefully. Somewhat political/rebuilding focused.

** This is one of my favourite types of fanfiction, here are my favourites:

From Southampton to New York and Beyond by Dorothea Greengrass - linkffn(12300252) Currently updating: A post war fanfic where Harry takes a cruise to escape from the UK for a bit after the war and finds Daphne is on the same boat. This is just really well written fluff between 2 damaged characters. Give it a go. There's no "ice queen" either, well beyond a few mentions about school, which is a definite plus.

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19 - linkffn(11111990) - Currently updating: You'll have most likely already seen this recommended around here but I'll do it again. A fantastic story about a single father Harry and a muggle he meets in a cafe. Really well written and the gold standard for both romance and OCs in the fandom.

Narcotic Effects by Mehetabelo - linkffn(2127558) - Complete: A short Harry / Narcissa post war fic. One of the best of this particular pairing.

Contractual Invalidation by R-dude - linkffn(11697407) - Complete: The best marriage contract fic between Harry and Daphne. Really good characterization and story.

Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7 - linkffn(9444529) - Complete: Harry is a quidditch star and after a tragic accident he has to look after Gabrielle. It does really well at dealing with the pain of loss as well as a few other issues. Really good OCs and a great characterization of everyone else involved.

Breach of Contract: Twelve Signs by The Matt Silver - linkffn(6166553) - Complete: A post war AU thriller involving Harry and Tonks. Can't talk too much about it without spoiling anything, but it's well written and has a great story.

Seven Names by Angelholme - linkao3(5265569) - Complete: One of the few fics that I've seen that deals with War Crimes. Very interesting take on it. Set far in the future but uses flashbacks and a court system to tell the story. Well written.

I'll post some more when I remember them

** Can I ask if you want a fic that just doesn't focus on romance or a fic that specifically doesn't focus on Harry/Ginny? I too am always up for a good political fic, even if it doesn't really focus much on any pairings. But if you have a specific aversion to Harry/Ginny, I'd be interested to know why.

As far as a good personal recovery fic, it would be difficult to find one that doesn't rely at least somewhat on romance as surely that would be part of his recovery.

**** I hear you. The post-battle Harry/Ginny reunion story has been done to death and there really isn't much more than can be told without it being repetitive. Rowling barely covering the relationship during the books does open it up a lot to post-battle stories that actually explore them as a couple, and there are some really good storylines, but to be honest there isn't much out there that explore those topics. For example, I haven't come across many fics that go into their year apart after the war (Ginny at school, Harry at auror training) and the pressures that puts on their relationship, particularly as two attractive, famous people who also both have hints of jealousy.
