I am curious if there are stories that much more heavily involve the Department of Mysteries as a driving force. I am generally looking for 1 of 2 things.

One would be a story that heavily explores the Department of Mysteries itself through some means.

The other is a bit more complex. I would love to find a story where Harry somehow partners with the Head Unspeakable or Unspeakables in general. One where perhaps Harry goes "off-canon" due to mistrusting Dumbledore and partners with Unspeakables instead of listening to Dumbledore. Perhaps he has power, political or magical, or perhaps he develops his own "Faction" within the Ministry backed by DoM employees. Or perhaps they provide the information Dumbledore always hid.

Im flexible on recommendations as I am simply curious whats out there with regards to the Department. I would however prefer that there be some sort of romance in the story (no slash), and prefer that the story be more mature+ and not "held back" by the author. Lemons and Smut are fine although must come second to the DoM involvement of course.

Thanks ahead of time!

** Not going to link bc I'm on mobile but check out The Summer of Change. It's HP/NT and about half of the fic takes place within the DoM while Harry trains there.
