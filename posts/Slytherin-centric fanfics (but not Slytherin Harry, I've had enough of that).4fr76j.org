**** The Green Girl is good until you read ACA and realize what good fanfiction actually is. I read the whole thing and liked it but couldn't get over how cruel Hermione is, and as [[/u/yarglethatblargle][u/yarglethatblargle]] said, it was frustrating that Hermione was accepted as a Slytherin, no questions asked. Then I found ACA and The Green Girl simply pales in comparison.

It's kind of like comparing the They Shook Hands series to On the Way to Greatness for Slytherin!Harry. TSH is okay... but OTWTG is worlds better because the characterizations are so much more believable.

I don't think ACA is exemplary if what you're looking for is believable characterization. It's basically Hermione in name only, and the others don't act much in character either.

**** So, it's interesting. Part of me wants to say that The Green Girl is not as good, but that isn't really true, they're just different. Obviously both are OC, but in different ways -Green Girl features Malfoys that accept Hermione's background, which doesn't seem to hard to believe - the thought of the token black friend comes to mind, and it's presented as politically expedient at the time. I will say that Green Girl is a Dramione, and gives a glimpse of how infuriating Harry might have been to others. But yeah, I enjoyed/enjoy both, it's just a bit hard to compare.

***** Far it be from me to tell you to Stop Having Fun, but I don't think it's just a matter of being different. In a nutshell, TGG is just a generally weak story: the author goes out of her (I think it's a "her") way to avoid giving the protagonist any meaningful conflict or challenge; and, on the one hand, completely throws out huge pieces of canon characterizaton, both individual and collective, to create unrecognizable de facto OCs and INOs, but on the other hand clings to canon plot rails despite the massive changes to the situation. And, there's lots and lots of pointless character bashing. It's very much a Mary Sue fic.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices]]) is a Slytherin!Ron fic that I've heard good things about, though I haven't had a chance to read it.

In linkffn(Brightest Witch in the Darkest House by Belial666), the author replaces Hermione with a bright Muggleborn OC who is a bit more ruthless. The bad news is that the author subscribes to a lot of bad fanon, starting with AuthorityWorshipping!Hermione fanon, which is what prompted him or her to to replace her, rather than merely tweaking her a little; but the good news is that the bad fanon is mostly contained in the author's notes, and doesn't affect the plot too much.
