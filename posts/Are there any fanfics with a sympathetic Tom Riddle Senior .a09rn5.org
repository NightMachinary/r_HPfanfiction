He seemed like an ass but I always felt a bit bad for what happened to him.

He was raped and then wanted nothing to do with the result. I can find no fault with that.

*** It's beyond rape, even. A million times worse than rape.

He was drugged into loving and starting a life with someone. Dreams of children, growing old, and grandchildren.

Then one day he wakes up - it's all fake. All of it is fake. He doesn't believe it, anymore. His love is a witch. A detestable, rapist of a woman.

He runs.

He gets home.

Magic isn't real, obviously. No one believes him. He's the guy who knocked up “that girl” and then ran away when he got cold feet.

Her mistake is forever in his mind.

Then, one day, a decade and a half later, a reminder of her evilness shows up at the fucking door.

“Rape” is much too kind of a word.

*** I meant before that, he seemed a bit snobby. I don't blame him for leaving, he must have panicked.

**** He seemed a fairly standard product of his time and social class.

Summary:

After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** linkao3(11731053). Tom Riddle Sr adopts Tom after he already started Hogwarts. The Riddle/Snape pairing didn't seem to be more than friendship iirc and there's inheritance but he was sympathetic here?

  In which Tom Riddle Senior never could fully put Merope's claims of being pregnant out of his mind and set out to bring his child home, unwittingly changing the fate of both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds and laying waste to the machinations of a certain scheming old man.
