I'm looking for a good marauder fic. I'm a traditionalist so James/Lily only please!!! Something that I think would be really cool is a novel/novella that spans their entire time at Hogwarts!


** I don't know anything that spans the whole time, sadly, but MarauderLover7 has a seventh year fic, but also a few one shots of the marauders at Hogwarts, which are fantastic imo. His/her page is here: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/MarauderLover7]]

** Check out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] if you haven't already. It's kind of Remus-centric, but it focuses on MWPP from first year onward. It's definitely Marauder-oriented with only tiny amounts of Lily, but it does span a part of their time at Hogwarts not covered as much.
