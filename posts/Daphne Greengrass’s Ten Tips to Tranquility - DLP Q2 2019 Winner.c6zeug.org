DLP recently finished its contest and this was the winner. Highly recommend to anyone. No pairings, just a great writing and a rather unique spin on the Ice Queen trope.

I think it's not yet published on ff.net or ao3, so here is a direct [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/entry-11.38549/][link to DLP forum]] (requires registration)

** Just wanted to chime in quickly and double down on this. It's an absolutely fantastic oneshot, from a pretty good competition, all told.

** Thanks for the rec. Having never read anything relating to Daphne other than DPaSW, I really enjoyed it - for a moment there I thought Daphne had OCD or psychopathy, but was pleasantly surprised by the magical twist the author offered. Dumbledore was also on point. Solid one-shot!
