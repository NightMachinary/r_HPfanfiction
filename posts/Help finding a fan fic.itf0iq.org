Looking for a story where after the war Harry discovers Snape alive without a body in his memories that he gave Harry as he was dying. They are able to make a tiny Snape appear in the pensieve and then give him an actual body. It would be on another AO3 or fan fiction.net. Any help is appreciated! Thanks
