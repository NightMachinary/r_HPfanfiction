I posted a few days ago asking for recommendations but I called it by the wrong name! Can anyone recommend finished novel length fics where Harry etc return to school after deathly hallows to finish their final year. Any pairing is fine but not too much angst if possible.


** Well there is this one by LeQuin called Strange Reflections.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697878/chapters/39161320][The Nightmare Club]] by Elle Gray. Drarry, and it's more about relationships than academics, but very well done.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione and Ron are going back to Hogwarts to do N.E.W.T.s, Ginny isn't. Harry hasn't decided, until he has, in front of the Wizengamot and now he's responsible for Malfoy as well. A tale of enemies who learn to get along, get it wrong and get it on. Everything is purple, some things are on fire and no-one is sleeping properly. But don't worry, there's tea!
