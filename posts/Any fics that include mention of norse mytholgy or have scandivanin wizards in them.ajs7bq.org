** For the sake of sensitive censors, I'll just tell you to search for HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir on ficwad.com. It has over-the-top sex hijinks but also a healthy respect and involvement with Norse mythology, including the Huldr, Jormungandr and other related *dr's. And, of course, bicycle racing, because what else could be better for a hybrid godling who needs to unwind?

#+begin_quote
  After slipping diagonally through time and space to a familiar time in an unfamiliar world, Harry finds himself fighting to save a future that's not quite what he remembers? Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with homebrew X-Men and Inhuman elements because studio politics suck.
