:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Totally can't remember the name of this fic, been looking through my library for it. It was on ff.net and Harry was much more confident in this fic, he gets together with Fleur early on if I remember correctly, and it was during GoF.


** Harry Potter and the Other Champion. He gets together with Fleur about ten chapters in and actually calls Katie his 'best sistend'.

  AU Fourth Year: Harry has been entered into the GOF. With his best friends and quidditch team by his side, can he handle the tournament, a nefarious plot to kill him (again), and a blossoming relationship with the Beauxbatons champion? Follow Harry as he fights for the cup, and for his life. All rights go to J.K. Rowling. Everything in bold is from original story.
