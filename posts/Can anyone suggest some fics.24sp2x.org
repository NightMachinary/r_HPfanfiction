I was hoping to find fics that are similar in style or humor to the Shoebox Project one that is so well known and revered. Fics that involve harry/draco or sirius/remus are also welcome. Hopefully multi-chaptered or completed, well written, and really stays with you. Thank you!


** I don't know about Harry/Draco but here's my rec list for Sirius/Remus.

AU:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/315289/chapters/505632][Long Live Living (If Living Can Be This)]] by exaliburned - Multi; "It's the final summer before university, and Sirius has a sneaking suspicion he's missing something. A summer of pillow-forts, drinking & numerous re-watches of Dirty Dancing ensues. Non-magical AU set in Warwick Castle." This is probably the most similar to the Shoebox Project.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/492426/chapters/860560][Time is a Fine Invention]] by bluepeony - Multi; NSFW; "Sirius Black expected university to be simple; a medley of moonlight trysts and Good Times. What he didn't expect was the yearning for home, the strains on his friendships, or falling for the hot-tempered History student Remus Lupin."

For Want of a Nail:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/41159/chapters/53845][Beyond the Veil]] by Atalan - Multi; Sirius doesn't die when he falls through the veil and must find a way to return or be consumed by something that lurks in the dark. The plot isn't the strongest and there's some characterization and other deviations that I raised my eyebrow at but it can be overlooked for the relatively happy ending. It also provides an interesting take on the origins of the dementors.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/41160][Scenes From Another Life]] by Atalan - Oneshot; Sirius doesn't go after Peter on the night of the Lily and James' deaths and three lives change for the better. Not really romance centric but a good read nonetheless. The interposition of the past and present is quite clever and ties things together nicely.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/72733/chapters/96368][The Maddest House]] by busaikko - Multi; NSFW; Voldemort doesn't die after the attack on the Potters and Sirius has to raise Harry in the Muggle world with Remus as their secret keeper. Probably my favorite "raising Harry" fic. It deals with the relationship breach between Sirius and Remus pretty realistically and baby!Harry is absolutely adorable.

Canon Compliant (mostly angst for obvious reasons):

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11196][A Creature Void of Form]] by ignipes - Oneshot; "Christmas, 1994. Two men, a cave, a hippogriff, some blankets, a hot meal, a blizzard, a bottle of vino rosso, and a conversation."

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/30991][and gravity,scientists say, is weak]] by Penknife - Oneshot; NSFW (sort of); "Sirius used to want everyone to look at him."

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/217585][Faded laughter against her ear]] by Sharpest Rose - Oneshot; Ginny finds a portrait of Sirius as a young man.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/345245][Molly Weasley]] by hawksjolras (createadisaster) - Oneshot; Molly comforts Remus after Sirius falls through the veil. Best read with the above fic. They'll definitely reduce you to tears.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/319467][The Problem with Eggnog, Uncommon Thoughts, and Sharing a Bed with Sirius Black]] by xylodemon - Oneshot; NOT ANGST; definitely NSFW; "In which Sirius is possibly naked, and Remus' mind is not the safest place to be."
