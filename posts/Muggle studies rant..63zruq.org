I'm looking for any story where either harry or hermione have enough with muggle studies and make the teacher feel one inch tall with a rant about how much he/she has wrong with it. We've seen stories where harry rips albus or severus a new one, but no one has ripped the muggle studies proffessor a new one that i've seen and i wish to see an ignorant fool put in there place.


** What gives you the impression that the Muggle Studies professor is an ignorant fool?

*** Don't we kind of have that in canon, though? When Hermione drops it because it's useless to her - she says something about how she thought it would be about a wizarding perspective but it ended up being useless information?

Or am I mixing fanon up?

**** That's definitely fanon. In canon she even recommends that Ron take it.

*** I don't. I just am in the mood for someone to be berated that is not albus, severus, weasleys. You know something different. Also while i don't know if they are ignorant seeing how little wizard raised even arthur know it doesn't look promising.
