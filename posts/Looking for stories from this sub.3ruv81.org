I'm looking for some fics that are consistently updated, so I figured that any authors in this sub update pretty frequently. If you're working on an hp fic, feel free to post it, genre, time, and universe don't matter too much to me.


** I try to post weekly, but life catches up with me so sometimes it's about two- three weeks. I'm actually up right now finishing my next chapter haha. Anyways, here's mine.

*** Is 'Graces' intentional? I've only ever seen 'Grace' as a girl's name before.

**** Haha it's intentional. It's pronounced[ˈgɹɛɪ.siz] gray-cees. The reason for her name is explained in later chapters. I realize it's not done in the traditional Black or Malfoy fashion. I honestly just made up the name. I thought it sounded cool.

** I try to update every month or so. But there are lag periods. However, I only have 6 to 8 chapters left to write and I want to get as much done as possible this year. In December this fic will be a decade old. Crazy!
