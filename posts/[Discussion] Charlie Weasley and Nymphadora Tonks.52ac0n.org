I'm sure this has been asked before, but what is your idea of Charlie Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks's relationship during their years at Hogwarts? Most people know that they were in the same year, but do you believe they had any other ties to each other? We all know that Charlie played for his house team, but what about Tonks? When they flew to Grimmauld Place in TOOTP, Tonks was the one to fly in the lead of the formation. She would have to have been a pretty skilled flier for Moody to let that happen. She was also an estranged member of the Black House, and we all know that she had no issues with those who are typically frowned upon by purebloods (blood traitors, werewolves). Both were also members of the Order of The Phoenix. What are your thoughts? Quidditch rivals? Best friends? Past lovers?


** I think what's implied in the books is that they didn't rally knew eachother. They knew /of/ eachother, Charlie being the best Quidditch player of the school (we're told) and Tonks being a metamorphmagus.

But that's boring as hell. It's so much more fun to imagine that they were actually best buds or whatever

** IIRC in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day by Little0Bird]] one of the plot lines was Charlie's grief at losing his good friend Tonks. He and Tonks had been in a relationship during hogwarts or right after and had lost their virginities to eachother I think. He also had a bunch of sketches of her, and it was implied that she was the one that got away for him. My headcanon is that charlie is gay, but I love the idea that him and Tonks we eachother's first loves and Charlie left for Romania after their breakup or something.

*** I LOVE that headcanon for Charlie and Tonks. Sad, but so sweet. And I ship Charlie and Oliver Wood so hard (even though I totally have dibs on Oliver...)

** I don't think there was a relationship. It just seems like that all because they're pretty much the only two names we know from that era, then they must be romantically linked. I feel like that is lazy thinking.

** My headcanon is since she's a Black, even a blood traitor, charlie didn't try to get to know her, assuming she's a supremacist, even as a half-blood---if that is all known.

Edit: Typo fix
