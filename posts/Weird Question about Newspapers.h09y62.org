So I'm reading a fic right now which features a newspaper article, as many HP fics do. I've always wondered, my British fellow fanfic readers, if the way that news articles are written in fic reflect the way they are written in local British papers, is it aping the way JKR wrote the articles in the books (its been a long time since I read the actual books), or is it just a product of writers who don't really read or pay attention to news article structures?

I took an intro to journalism class once and so when I see things like the news articles written in the first person or addressing the audience ("I interviewed the Boy-Who-Lived and you won't imagine what I found out dear readers!"), it makes me cringe. Since it's so widespread in fanfic newspaper articles, I wonder where it comes from.


** I'm honestly not sure. She certainly doesn't seem to write like that in any of the articles that are mentioned in canon...

*** I think she writes in first person for articles like Rita Skeeter, which are more opinion based articles. It's not uncommon for articles to have writers who write in this style.
