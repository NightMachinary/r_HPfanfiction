I wonder if there are decent fics out there dealing with the founders, the building of Hogwarts and the life of wizards in this era.

It can either be with or without characters from the original cast, but I assume that most fics will have Harry timejumping.

Gimme your best. Thanks.


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=270265][Legend]] by Celticbard is one of my favorites. /There is legend. And then there is truth. In 9th century England, three wizards band together, not to found a school, but to concoct one of the greatest lies ever told./

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=776&chapno=1][Before the Beginning]] is an excellent oneshot about the founding of Hogwarts.

The Journey From Oidhche Shamhna. My favorite in the genre, and no, it's not a 4 way pairing.
