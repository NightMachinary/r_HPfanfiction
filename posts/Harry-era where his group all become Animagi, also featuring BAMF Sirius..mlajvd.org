:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I distinctly remember reading this fic when I was on an AU binge a while back. Some specific things I remember:

- Hogwarts-era, and Harry had a somewhat different group of friends. Pretty sure Hermione was definitely one of them, but the rest of the group was different from and larger than his canon friends. The group had a specific nickname, a la the Marauders. (I have a vague memory they might have been nicknamed the Chimeras?)

- it featured Harry's group of friends all eventually going through the animagus transformation. The group nickname may have been acquired after this, or as a result of this.

- Sirius Black was a major character in the story, post-Azkaban, and was very much Lord Black, large and in charge. As I recall he was very much a BAMF, and there was some amount of Wizengamot/pureblood politics - he was determined to shake up the Wizarding world, and IIRC eventually intended to oppose Voldemort pretty actively (or actually did.)

It's more likely to have been on AO3 as that's where I do the majority of my reading, but could have been elsewhere.

Any pointers gratefully appreciated!


** Was it linkao3(Survival is a Talent)? The Chimera thing is ringing a bell and I /think/ this was the fic. (EDIT: Yes, they do call themselves the Chimeras at one point, can confirm.)

*** Aha, thankyou. I think I might have got the Sirius-centric bits conflated from another fic, but this was definitely the fic I was thinking of from the Chimeras thing. Thankyou!

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
