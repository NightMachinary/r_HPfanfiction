Stories like evitative where Harry gets resorted in his 5th year. The only reason why i didn't finish that fic is because it's slash and i'm not really into that.

Any recommendations?


** linkffn(10859310) - Only one I know of. No slash, I think it's gen but could be wrong

  After Harry runs away from his relative's during the summer and gets in a fight the first day of school, Snape argues that he needs to be watched more and have more guidance. His argument backfires when Dumbledore suggests Harry be in Slytherin for a term. Will Harry see another side to the Slytherins? And will Snape finally see the real Harry? Third Year. Mentor/Guardian Snape
