1) Good guys won but the world was worse afterwards 2) Voldemort and the Death Eaters or some other bad guys won, how do we fix this? 3) It was an accident! 4) Love of protagonist's life dies and he or she wants to bring them back 5) Some greater being is unsatisfied with how the protagonist lived their life and sends them back 6) Curse leading to time travel ala Groundhog Day 7) Let's prevent this character from ever existing or experiencing this event so he won't wreak havoc in the future 8) Experimenting with a time traveling device 9) Meeting a character (usually from another story) with time traveling powers and going with them

... What else have I missed? Of course, there are some stories where the reasons are a combination of the things listed above.


** Most common variations fall into one of three categories:

1. Screwed-up future where everything went to hell and a hand-basket, so someone engineers an attempted do-over via magic or such (NoFP is the epitome of this).
2. Canon divergence at some point where something sends the character back due to early death (ex. graveyard, DoM via Veil, etc.).
3. Accidentally messing with some artifact or such that throws the protagonist back in time some arbitrary (but usually convenient) time period (ex. Oh God Not Again!)

Arguably, I would say the best fics tend to be either one's that take the concept completely seriously (not horsing around) or not seriously at all (whether as comedy or pure!crack, this is generally a winning formula). Fics that play the middle ground or are just power-wank tend to be pretty interchangeable (the sole exception to this may be Dodging Prisons and Stealing Witches, but that is due to quality of writing and originality overall).

Now, what I would like to see is particularly original (mostly ideas). Here are some that I can say I love:

1. *Outside time-traveler perspectives*. What I mean are fics like linkffn(Realignment) and linkffn(Anticlockwise by Casscade). Showing what its like to see a time-traveler come out of nowhere and flip the tables. Not only that, how does one deal with that outsider perspective?
2. *Time-travelers from the past coming forward* to stop Voldemort when he rises again. This is a difficult premise to make work admittedly, but offers a very different way for things to play out (i.e. travelers have no idea what to work with other than knowledge of previous war or individuals).
3. There is a certain formula that goes like this: person (usually Harry) dies in the future beyond hope or whatever, wakes up to find himself confronted by diety/entity/magic/death/etc., said being wants to send them back to fix the screw-up (often because they don't like Voldemort's horcrux idea), often with special advantages. Again, see DP&SW for example. But why is it always assumed the entity is a force for good? Time-travel inherently wrecks the nature of reality (even in canon - see HP wiki on D. of Mysteries). *What happens if the entity is in it to screw with reality, to see what chaos they can bring* (set up Ahriman or Eris for example). Now that is a fun idea. Unfortunately, the only fic that even approaches this idea is linkffn(The Lesser Sadness), which is an absolute gem despite its brevity (seriously read this one).
4. *Time-travelers make things worse*. So maybe they come back, and there interference leads to not dealing with the blood purity/classicism issues in Britain, or even allowing for the rise of other dark wizards. Or even just dealing with the aftermath (realistically) of time-traveling to the past and how the world (or even the Ministry) would react to that eventually.

*** Your first idea reminded me of linkffn(Many Thanks by Madm05)

I really like your other ideas as well, though I'm not sure how the second suggestion would even occur in the first place unless by accident or some sort of Seeing ability. The lack of knowledge somewhat reminds me of linkffn(The Second String) where Harry travels back in time the summer before 5th year and therefore knows nothing about horcruxes, etc. and almost nothing about the first war, which is also a different perspective than usual and potentially interesting to explore.

I especially like the fourth point you suggested, but I'm sure there would never be very many of those because a lot of people (not everyone, but a lot) see the fun of time travel as being able to make everyone happy and that fic would be soooo dark. The knowledge that your actions directly caused the world to be demonstrably worse would be soul-crushing.

Having written that, I am reminded of linkao3(Abyssus Abyssum Invocat by ladysunflower) where that is essentially what happens.

** A long time ago I had a plot bunny for a post-epilogue time travel story that was based around a Death Eater going back in time to assassinate Harry.

From my plot bunny doc:

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH epilogue compliant time travel story where it's a Voldemort sympathiser who goes back in time, not Harry. There's a break-in at the Department of Mysteries and Auror Harry goes it investigate under his invisibility cloak. He arrives just in time to see a mysterious wizard in the time room fiddling with an artefact. A magical backlash knocks Harry out.

  When he wakes the world has changed. His scar tingles: Voldemort is alive. He quickly realises that he is living in a dystopian world where Voldemort was never defeated.

  After some near-misses with the authorities, Harry finds the remnant Order, who are very suspicious of him. Harry learns that he was killed in his summer before sixth year, assassinated by a mysterious assailant. It becomes clear: the wizard in the Department of Mysteries went back in time and killed Harry.

  Harry tries to persuade the Order to make one last effort: they have to get Harry into Voldemort's Ministry so he can break into the Department of Mysteries, go back in time and prevent his own assassination.

  The Order is sceptical, as their spirit is broken. Everyone is different to how Harry remembers. Remus and Tonks, for example, cannot bear to look at each other: Tonks is their mole within Voldemort's ranks, impersonating Narcissa Malfoy, whom the Order assassinated years ago. Remus can't stand that she is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy as part of her cover.

  But eventually the Order relents. They assault the Ministry and make it to the DoM at the cost of many lives. Harry uses the time machine, goes back in time and prevents his own assassination.

  And is stuck in the past. The alternate dystopian timeline is now but a figment of Harry's memories. It has corrected itself out of existence.

  Epilogue: Harry, still in the past, goes to meet Albus Dumbledore. He confesses everything. Dumbledore explains how it is that Harry survived the change in the timeline: Harry's blood in Voldemort's veins. Voldemort being alive once more meant Harry could not die. This combined with Harry being under his invisibility cloak at the time of the change resulted in Harry both surviving the change but also not being displaced by it.

  Harry confesses he has no idea what to do now. He misses his kids.

  Dumbledore asks him some probing questions. He was able to walk into an Acromantula nest at the age of 12 and survive? He was able to take a portkey out of the graveyard, though Voldemort would not have planned for the portkey to be two-way? He broke into the Department of Mysteries aged 15 without any trouble? He was able to evade Voldemort's Ministry for months at the age of 17?

  Harry understands. Like his experience with time turners, this was always meant to be. His presence in the past was already factored into the future. Harry would protect his younger self, guiding him from the shadows, unaware that he ever existed. He would return to the future the long way around. He will see his children again, on the day that his younger self disappears into the past.

** What we don't have is a full on Crime Syndicate (Crisis on Two Earths) plot: Where another dimension contacts the main one for help. Bonus if the other dimension has flipped roles (so Harry is evil and Voldemort is good).

Yes I know we have that one where it does flipped roles, but that one involves a magical accident, not "Heroes, We need your help, please come save our world".

There have been a couple "Justice Lords" storyline, where an evil/grey Harry somehow enters the universe of canon harry and proceeds to mess things up. It doesn't work anywhere near as well as it did in Justice League :(.

You know what is missing from most time travel story? Loss. Seriously, 99% of the stories have a happily ever after with nothing bittersweet. Even the ones that do "I'm going to delay the pairing till everyone grows up" still has everyone pair off. There should be more "By going back in time, i've lost the love of my life forever. (S)He is right there, but with all my extra experience it would never be the same.

Or you know, just swapping pairings without it being part of what is being fixed. 99% of them are either "The world was horrible, including the love life of the characters, so time travel fixes that" or "Somehow everyone ends up with the same happy people they had in the previous timeline". It is ok to have a character be in a good, happy relationship in one timeline and then after you mess with time, have them end with someone else, and still be in a good, happy relationship.

'course, I'd imagine that would mess with some people's OTP ideas...

(This applies to non-pairings as well, but it is most obvious with pairings)

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** 1. Boredom.

2. Genuinely wanting to SEE how things would be different with small changes. No altruistic or "good" reason, more like a scientist watching how ants burn.

** This is a very unpolished premise but this is the general idea: during the final battle Harry as he kills Voldemort is somehow transported like 15 yrs into the future. He now has to deal with the fact that everyone has moved on, and that he was thought to be dead.

etc. etc. He attends his last year if Hogwarts and blah blah plot.

(obviously all Weasley next gen kids exist except James Lily and Albus)
