#+TITLE: It was April 1. Molly Weasley walked out of the Burrow with a bouquet of flowers. She made her way to the top of a hill. A lone tree stood there, and at the foot of it was a gravestone.

The engraved words on the gravestone said "Fred Weasley. 1978 - 1998"

Molly knelt before it and laid the flowers.

"Happy Birthday Fred. If only I could've helped you...."

Tears began to well up in her eyes, before flowing down her face.

"Leaves from the vine,\\
Falling so slow.\\
Like fragile, tiny shells\\
Drifting in the foam.

Little soldier boy\\
Come marching home.\\
Brave soldier boy\\
Comes marching home."

** I can only imagine how heartbroken Molly would have been... especially as she was always the toughest on the twins considering they were the least academically successful and even when they achieved professional success they were going against the socially acceptable norms in a time when if you wanted to stay alive you had to keep your head low. Even if Ginny is implied to be somewhat like them, being that she was the first girl born in the Weasley family in generations, I think Molly was more lenient with her.

With that being said, I never really understood why the fandom makes such a big fuss about Fred's death. He was a minor character killed off during a major crisis when other more important characters such as Lupin or Snape were killed and because it was in the middle of the battle, the author didn't really dedicate more than a few sentences for Harry's grief over his death.

The way Harry felt when Sirius or Dumbledore died was completely devastating to the reader... but not so much for the people who died at the battle of Hogwarts. In fact he seems far more accepting of the fact that some people are dead with his thought that there will soon be times for celebrations but for now he has to mourn the dead.

*** I think it has a lot to do with it being relatable. Most people don't fight in wars, are orphaned and then loose several parental figures. But many people have siblings and can imagine how devastating it would be if they died.

*** The last book fails to have a proper grieving chapter at the end. Every other book gives Harry a chapter in which to cry, yell, reflect, and/or mourn. In the last book, the ending is abrupt and doesn't give us this. The epilogue certainly isn't this either.

People have analysed the effect this has had on readers. The prevailing understanding is that certain deaths end up forgotten/minimised because we don't see how devastating they are. The most hard hitting death is Dobby exactly because we see how hard it hurts. When Fred dies we actually see the pain experienced by the Weasley's even if for a few sentences and that resonates. Others like Snape, Lupin, Tonks just never had that moment where we the readers get to mourn with someone. It just doesn't hit as hard that way.

** While Leaves from the Vine is one of the most heart-breaking scenes I've ever watched, and Fred's death is one of the saddest parts of Harry Potter, I really don't think mapping Molly onto Iroh works here. One of the layers of tragedy to Lu Ten's death is that it is partially Iroh's fault, Iroh was a general and a warmonger, and he was happy when his son decided to follow in his footsteps. It was Lu Ten's death that forced Iroh to confront the war he was waging, and turned him into the mentor we saw trying to help Zuko in the main series.

None of this applies to Molly, she didn't want any of her children to fight (though she understood that she couldn't stop them when they were adults), and Fred died defending Hogwarts for a cause that Molly still believes in, unlike Lu Ten who gave his life for an ideology Iroh has now abandoned.
