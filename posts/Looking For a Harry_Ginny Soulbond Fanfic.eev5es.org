Another request. I know it's either a soul bond fix or something similar. The only think I remember clearly is that at some point, there is a vote, and Harry is not allowed to take both the Black and Potter seats. Ginny tells him to take the Black Seat, and she Takes the Potter seat via a soul bond or marriage.

Edit: I remember also that The secret vote was Narcisa Malloy, and she would only vote their way if there was enough votes.


** I once read a fic where a Veela described a soul bond as a fictional cliché in trashy wizarding romance novels that no one but airheads take seriously. Something I think we can apply to Fanfiction
