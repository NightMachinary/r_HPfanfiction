As the title says, I am on the hunt for some good, soul tearing, heart breaking angst. Preferably Draco or Harry angst (slash or no slash I just want that angst).

Basically any good angst around one or both of those characters. Also, any 'eighth year' or 'seventh year do-overs' would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
