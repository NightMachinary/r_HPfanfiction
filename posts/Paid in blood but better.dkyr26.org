I am looking for a story that is a lot like Paid in blood but with a better more satisfying ending as the ending to POB really annoyed me. Any recommendations?


** INFO: Who is Paid in Blood by? Is there a link to it? Can you give us a summary in case someone who hasn't read it might know something similar? Maybe even tell us what you liked and what you wish was different? There are well over a million HP fanfics out there, and I hadn't seen this one before.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9474009/1/Paid-In-Blood]] it is by Zaterra02 (After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.) it is a story where an older darker Harry with the help of Dobby go back in time to protect his wife (daphne greengrass) Harry in this is not evil but isn't afraid to torture people and murder them in cold blood. Ron and Hermoine are the main antagonists in this story along with Neville being a side one. They are the reason his wife died. I really liked the portrayal of Harry and Daphne in this Harry being a Dark lord hellbent on protecting the one he loves the most, the brutal deaths in this are a added bonus. The only part I didn't like was the ending which I won't go into as you may want to read it yourself.

**** Agreed the end feels like it doesn't belong to the story

**** That sounds interesting, I haven't read a ton of Harry/Daphne. I don't read for the pairings normally but more for an interesting plot or good writing if I can find it. I wish I had something to recommend and I do like time-travel, but the only things I can think of (time-travel, darklord!Harry) that sound even close are not that close and some are slash.

** Story: The Renegade [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12954156]] It fits with your wants but is still in progress. Feels like a re-do of Paid in Blood imo, but it's still good, once again imo.
