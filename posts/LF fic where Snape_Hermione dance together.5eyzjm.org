I'm trying to recall a fic I read where they danced together at a Yule Ball or some sort of ministry event...they were both very in character and it was written beautifully. Sorry, can't remember much more.

TIA


** That describes almost every snape/hermione fic. Do you have any other details?

*** Does it? My bad. Although that's great! I'd love to read more where they dance, so any recs would be good. The one I'm thinking of has Hermione feeling a bit one-sided in her affections for Snape...like she feels a bit invisible to him, but when they dance he says something along the lines of "you're all I notice".

But as I said I'd love to read more where they dance if you know any good ones, I'd be grateful for the rec :)

**** hmm... that doesn't sound familiar.

linkffn(4407394) has dancing and a ministry ball.

linkffn(9646277) has a yule ball where they dance.

linkffn(5041998) also has a yule ball where their relationship comes out.
