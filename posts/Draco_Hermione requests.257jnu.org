In most Draco/Hermione stories I've read Draco turns to the light side. I would like stories where Hermione goes to the dark side to be with Draco.

Thank you.


** That sounds interesting. I haven't read anything like that personally. Over at Dramione Fic Lists on Tumblr, there is a 'Hermione: Death Eater' tag and there are a few fics listed there. I don't know if any of the stories fit your premise exactly but maybe you'll find something close. [[http://dramioneficlists.tumblr.com/tagged/Hermione%3A-Death-Eater][Link]]

Edit to add: at the bottom of that tag page is a story that may be what you are looking for. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8773567/1/Desperate-Measures][Desperate Measures]] - M, 36 chapters - When the war against Voldemort drags on, what lengths will Hermione go to, to be with the man she loves?

*** That's interesting! I'm looking for some good fics (most of them are written by a teenager, and draco is lovely and cute... and that's impossible even if he's in love...), and maybe you found something good. thank you too!!
