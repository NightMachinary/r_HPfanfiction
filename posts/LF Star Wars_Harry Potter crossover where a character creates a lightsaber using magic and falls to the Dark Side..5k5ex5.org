** "Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942): Palpatine turned Harry into a vicious Sith. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. They would commit many atrocities later in the story.

In its sequel "The Stars Alone", linkffn(12040341), all three of them were capable of fighting with light sabers and unleashing Sith lightening.

**** It's a typical Darth Marrs fic with lots of sex and violence, and all its good and bad.

But it's basically what the OP is asking.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** Linkffn(the lightsaber by telemicus sundance;sith'ari by marquis black) the first one fulfills the creates a lightsaber requirement and, as a bonus, is finished with the current arc. I haven't read the second one in a long while so my memory is a bit sketchy on it.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)

  It all started with shooting stars, and would end with the rise of the Sith'ari - the perfect being of the Dark. Perfect strength. Perfect power. Perfect destiny. Imagine it? With the aid of a long-deceased Sith Lady as his mentor, Harry will become it.
