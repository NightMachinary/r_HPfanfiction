This came to mind when I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13561893/][a Naruto fic]] where a Self Insert was inserted into a !neglect fic (as in, the parents survived... had more kids and Naruto is ignored/hated by the parents)

--------------

So, ideally it would be about the MC recognizing what type of fic they are in and then working out a better end for themselves including snarky commentary on what's happening.

as an example I would enjoy reading about a Self Insert into a Harry who would have ended up with Snape, but has no interest in it and has to deal with tropes trying to match them up... or having to deal with fake!friendly!Goblins or something like ron bashing where the bashing is actually kinda stupid (MC notices Ron eating with mouth open, spitting food everywhere... and observes the original!MC sitting there raging at him unnecessarily).

But I would be happy with any fics that fit the title... as in: Insert with in-story acknowledged non-canon elements.

--------------

I've already read a few HP-fics that fit:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13099094][Red Running Fool]] - Self Insert into a evil!Ron fanfic (does not really stick with it, but I enjoyed it)
- /Reading of fanfic/

  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net%20/s/11378042][Reading - The First Time He Saw It]] - I didn't enjoy it, but it fits I think...
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6150150][What the Hell is Fanfiction?]] - Nor did I enjoy this one... but I think it fits too and maybe there actually exists some /Reading of/ * that would be cool

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886][Strange Reflections]] - Spoiled!Harry&Family inserted into canon-ish world... from the viewpoint of the Harry they try to screw over.

I have a feeling that I should remember more... but can't right now.

  Once I heard that phrase uttered in dozens for fanfics I knew that this was going to be a struggle. Time to make the most of it. When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade...make life take the lemons back. SI as Naruto in a !Neglect Fic. Rated M for language because I don't want to censor myself.

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
