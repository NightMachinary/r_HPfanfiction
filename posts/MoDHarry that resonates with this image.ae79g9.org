I know it's an old, reposted zelda image, but I like it and it makes thematic sense for a MoD!Harry.

I'm curious if anyone remembers any stories which focus (or at least explore) how an immortal Harry would deal with losing his loved ones and never himself aging.

  Harry is invited in the Gobstones Club, a club that has, apparently, not invited anyone else since Albus Dumbledore.

** I have recently read linkffn(9860311) A long journey home. It has an unaging fem!Harry, and dealing with the mortality of those around her is pretty much /the/ central theme.

I read the first 8 chapters which cover the first two stories, plus a humorous little side story. I heartily recommend this one.

**** I /suspect/ she still is.\\
As you mentioned, its sorta vague.

She specifically says "And now, after all that time, here I stand... /growing old!/"

But there are is few pieces of evidence that points to something else.

Specifically, I think she is a Phoenix/Human hybrid.\\
And exactly how that happened other than: A +wizzard+ phoenix did it, I have no idea, but there is a lot of evidence supporting this. There are a lot of hints spread around in the story, but the big one is: Myrddin thinks so, and thinks a method of killing a phoenix would "cure" her of immortality. (ch 6)\\
He wasn't sure, but it was his best guess after 50 years, I'm guessing he is right.\\
Now, without knowing how she became so, we can only guesses at if she kept it after closing the loop, but the phoenixes are feeling guilty and thus I'm assuming it wasn't directly caused by time travel and will thus not be removed by closing the loop.

There are a few other details that could support the phoenix theory and a few hints that support immortal in general, but they are much more circumstisial compared to Myriddin's conclusion.

***** I get it. I all depends on everyone's tastes. I suppose some people get immersed in that universe because it appeals to them. It's not something that you feel guilty for if you don't enjoy it. It's the same with games. Some people enjoy shooters, others enjoy RPGs, others enjoy adventure games. It's all a matter of personal taste.
