I honestly believe that most writers who write this subconsciously believe this too. That's usually why they have Ron act even more bratty to compensate. Because, otherwise, having the canonically non-confrontational Ron would make it all too obvious.

The guy has proven on several occasions that he will very literally put his life on the line for you. Ever since Harry met Ron, Ron has been by his side at every possible chance. Even creating the chances himself at times like when he saved Harry from the Dursley's in book 2. He stole his parents car in the middle of the night to go check on someone he only knew for 7-8 months because he didn't answer his letters. He is obviously devoted to Harry, possibly a little too much so.

How can this version of Harry not be read like an absolute sociopath by the readers?

** Honestly, like most disputes in the series, the in-world conclusion is pretty simple - they're all idiots who fucked up in one way or another, each with some vaguely relevant logic behind their actions. :D

The out-of-world conclusion is even more simple - Rowling has all the consistency of liquid Helium. Sometimes characters are loyal or smart, other times they're neither thing simply because that was what she needed to push her plot forward.

It's one of the many reasons why fandom perception varies so frickin' much.

People each see those things happening, draw different conclusions and observations based on their experiences and worldviews, then try to make it all make sense and fit together in their concept of the characters and story. And while that attempt might make sense to them, it won't necessarily make sense to anyone else because interpretations and headcanons and concepts of the characters vary wildly from person to person. The thing you gotta remember is that, to the people who write these fics, those interpretations are either interesting or make sense to them.

eg. The Ron-not-believing-Harry thing. If someone sees Ron as a lazy, lackluster person that's basically a single rejection from being a Death Eater, then that scene makes sense because he's 'finally showing his true colours'. So, they make it so the previous stuff was him playing a part or faking it for whatever reason (usually Evil Dumbledore or Potions Molly).

If they see Ron as overly loyal like you, that sudden change doesn't make sense. So, they maybe explain it as teens being teens and thus they make Harry behave like that too, to avoid being seen as Bashing Ron and keeping that consistent 'teenage drama' thing going. Or they take a Horcrux type route and explain it as some influence or other.

I imagine that's why it's so rare to find crossover between bashing and redemption here. I've never seen a fic where Borderline-Death-Eater Ron is actually redeemed into a loyal and decent person akin to the more positive view of Ron.

*** I think we also have to remember that the characters in that book are children, and that we don't really see much of their lives - the books speed through weeks/months, so something like Harry and Ron's spat in book 4 /feels/ a lot longer than it is.

Like you say, we can view Ron's actions a few different ways - but I'd mention that the meta-fandom's perception of it is also important in fashioning those views. For instance, the 'Ron is the loyal one' idea is one that I think developed in the fandom, trying to find a distinctive positive role for him in the Trio - and then trying to fit that back into the text, where it doesn't exactly work (like, Ron is loyal for sure, but defining him as /the/ loyal one of the Trio doesn't make sense to me).

Similarly, the 'Evil Ron' interpretation is not one that people naturally would get from the books or movies - it would more be like a dislike of Ron. But through more interaction with the fandom and negative views of him in fanfiction, obviously that could go further and further until we get to the death-eater adjacent versions of him.

** I've read exactly 1 story that did the slow forgiving of Ron well - and they reconciled eventually. Otherwise, it is just as you said, Harry feels like a prat. A Harry that does not forgive Ron just feels wrong to be honest. It really goes against one of the biggest foundations of his characterization and makes these iterations of Harry so enraging and difficult to read.

***** By 4th year does he? He does in first year, Harry is going either way and Ron goes with him. Second year though, it was his sister. Ron was always going to try to do something whether Harry was there or not. And in third year, a dog literally dragged him into the fight. And in 4th year the Death Eaters attacked the cup he was at anyway.

Sure he was in dangerous situations with Harry, but the only time he took a conscious choice to stand with Harry during those times was when he was a glory hungry 11 year old. His reflection shows he wanted glory more than anything at that age. And 11 year olds are terrible at risk assessment.

Personally I prefer good friend Ron over Ron bashing, but Ron bashers don't exactly have to struggle to justify Harry and Ron not talking again after that fight in 4th year.

Hermione was just attacked and an adult just told them following the spiders would answer their questions. They didn't have reason to believe they would be following the spiders to their death. Hagrid specifically told Harry in his first year nothing would hurt him in the forest if he had Fang with him.

As for Sirius, Ron was already in the situation. Crying in a corner or trying to sell him Harry would not be a very gryffindor approach. It was brave, but it doesn't necessarily reflect loyalty.

*********** At the same time I don't think he could stand there and watch a death eater kill Draco in front of him without doing anything.

Ron is brave and stubborn and pretty smart when he needs to be, but his anger and inferiority issues can hurt those around him and it's perfectly understandable if after Ron dissolves the friendship Harry doesn't take him back as soon as he has the best showing on the first task and Ron shows up to point out the very thing Harry told him in the first place.

Personally, I would forgive Ron, but he wouldn't be my best friend again 2 minutes later and I can't fault someone for not forgiving him. Especially someone with Harry's history trust is important.

That said, canon Harry has a lot of love and trust, and as I said I prefer good friend Ron, so I don't read too many Harry doesn't forgive Ron fics, but given the average quality of fan fiction I can belive that attributes are inflated a little making Harry come off Bratty. I just don't think the lack of forgiveness itself is the problem.

** Ron puts Harry in danger as much as he saves him from it.

- He's the one who agreed to a duel on Harry's behalf when Harry hadn't even learned any spells yet. (This may be a lesser "crime" since Draco also didn't know any spells; but he COULD have.)
- Deciding that taking the flying car was the only solution for getting to school. Really?
- Mouthing off to the acromantula, causing them to attack. They were going to attack anyway, but Harry was working on a diplomatic solution when Ron ruined it.
- He's the one who dragged Harry off to face a basilisk instead of, I don't know, ASKING AN ADULT for help.
- Getting dragged off by Sirius-the-grimm. Not his fault, but still, Harry was put in danger because of Ron.
- You make it sound like it's all one-sided, but it's not.

And honestly, a Ron has been an absolute pillock for an entire MONTH, both in private and in public. I think it's NATURAL for Harry to want him to grovel before forgiving him.

What a lot of people seem to ignore is that childhood friendships are usually volatile. They have spats and breakups and "he's not my friend" before they find common ground again. To say Harry is a brat for not wanting to suddenly be Ron's friend is putting it all on Harry --- just like Dumbledore saying Harry has to make allowances for Snape instead of telling Snape to pull his head out of his ass.

**** "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations. " "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

"Well. . . no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?" "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

"Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak. . . because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?" "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it. "

Ron raised his eyebrows. "What would they do that for?" "I dunno," said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me. "

Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair. "It's okay, you know, you can tell me the truth," he said. "

If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either. . . . "

"I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

"Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you. . . . I'm not stupid, you know. "

He tells him multiple times that he didn't do it and yet ron continues to ignore it.

** Yeah, just took a look at linkffn(11922615) and there Ron kept from Harry Charlie's message that he is coming with dragons (aka attempted murder by neglect). Which is clearly ludicrous, although it shows another hole in JKR's story: it is quite likely that Charlie would mention to his family (especially his Mum, who would be very eager after this information) that he is coming to Britain, and then the mere fact of him coming suddenly back to Hogwarts would be a leak (because I don't think anything including couple of dragons would stop Mrs Weasley from mentioning to her Harry that he is going to stand up against a dragon).

**** Of course, but would they forbid Charlie to inform his only mother that he is back in Britain?

***** Probably not. But they would probably forbid him to inform his family about dragons. So the whole thing with Ron or Molly knowing and telling Harry ahead of time would not work unless Charlie is just excitable as Hagrid when it comes to dragons.

****** Which given what little we know about him points resoundingly towards him being exactly as excitable as Hagrid when it comes to dragons, he undoubtedly would.

******* He might still be more level headed. Arthur and Percy did not tell the kids about the Triwizard Tournament, albeit at the time no one knew that one of the kids would end up actually competing.

***** Tbf, Charlie would have had to be spending literally all his time working with the dragons, not much time for any visits
