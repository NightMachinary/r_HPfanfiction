When it comes to HP Fanfiction, what trope is your guilty pleasure?

For me it's probably the one where everyone has secretly grouped up to take Harry's money and life, but Harry wises up and gets revenge.


** Reincarnation fics. It's so hard to find a good one, but when you do it's amazing.

  Harry spends the whole summer before fourth year feeling restless. He chalks it up to the weird dreams he's been having, assuming Voldemort is responsible. And for some dreams, that's true - but what about the other ones? The ones that feel... familiar?Back at school, things change one morning in September, when he and three other students wake up with the memories of the four Hogwarts founders in their heads. They don't know why they've returned, or how it happened, but they know one thing - they changed the Wizarding World before, and they're going to do it again. It's about time they shook things up a bit.Tagged underage for Harry/Cedric (14/17)

***** Time travel and reincarnation both fall into the overlap of being very interesting, but also very easy to remove all/most tension and disbelief (eg - pulling a powerful ability out halfway through the story without the need to show how the MC obtained it). Reincarnation is the more niche one, so I imagine it's hard to find a good one.

Personally I'd have to say any redeemable Slytherin OC or canon Slytherin redemption arc is my favourite guilty trope (I still hate JKR's portrayal of Slytherin to this day). Not every Slytherin has to be a nice person, but none of them are cartoonishly shallow villains who solely exist to befriend Draco and hate the Gryffindors.

Also, crossovers with an ancient, jaded, and bored OP!MOD!Harry who just has chaotic good fun. Like “I could have just taken away their guns and armor, but wasn't it so much more fun to replace their guns with rubber chickens and then turn their armor into soap bubbles?” Like Q but with more good deeds.

  Harry Potter has been hiding in plain sight all his life, since he carries the soul-mark of Minister Tom Riddle on his arm---and a fulfilled soul-bond will double both partners' power. His parents and godfather are fugitives, members of the Order of the Phoenix, and Harry is a junior Ministry official feeding the Order what information he can. No one, least of all him, expects Harry to come to the sudden notice of Minister Riddle, or be drawn into a dangerous game of deception.

** Probably Diagon Alley shopping trips. Sometimes they can be cool and introduce magical artifacts, new shops and new characters.

Most suck though and end up with the mc spending 1.2 million galleons for a trunk with an island in it.

** Honestly the lordship trope if limited to 2 or 3 house's. I like the attempt at wizarding politics. (I'm lumping in the trope 1 wife per house thing) My only complaint is why are s it usually the other heiresses used like Susan Bones or Daphne Greengrass. For me politically it would make more sense to marry Astoria to Harry then Daphne. (Maybe a lower born husband takes the Greengrass name or the Bones name) For me if other houses wanted to ally with Potter maybe have a surprise second pairing like Ron/Daphne with the politics being he's a friend's with Lord Potter-Black (maybe Prevell) Ron also being the sixth son of both Lord Weasley and Lady Prewet. (Maybe the Weasley are land rich and cash poor nobility) I'd honestly like to see different pairings with the Lordship tropes. Maybe a Katie Bell (maybe Ginny is a friend of Harry and ends up with another lord) Parvati (was friends is known to Pansy maybe family in a wealthy and looking to marry up)

While it may sound stupid but I'd like the idea of due to Ron's friendship with Harry the Weasley family kinda turns into the Habsburgs and married well. With Hermione I could see her either seeing the possible logic of splitting up the houses between multiple houses to limit the potential power of one family (could be the mumbo jumbo to make it legal) as the houses become separate from each other each generation. Or I could see Hermione as someone who screaming that it's potentially backwards and needs to be changed.

** Political stuff. More about subjects and how exactly they work. Worldbuilding in general. So-bad-it's-good-fics. Time travel, though I'm very picky with those. Harry gets a good childhood (either good Dursleys or different parents entirely). Sirius lives. Manipulative Dumbledore. OC's. Magical creatures. Founders. More magic and how it works. Angst (again, very picky). Compotent ministry. Different jobs. The occasional really random idea. Crossovers (come on it's fun). About the paintings, like how the hell do those work? I need specifics! And of course more worldbuilding. I really like worldbuilding.

** Lord Potter-Black thrown into the deep end of Wizengamot Politics. But the ones where there's real politics, where he has to learn and gather allies.

I hate the ones where he snaps his fingers and everyone falls over themselves to please him.

** My favorite trope is the “wandless magic since childhood one”, closely followed by “genius!Harry” and “Magic!wank” though the last one is so rare when compared to muggle!wank that I'm not sure if it counts as a trope. I am also a huge fan of time travel.

** Hermione time-travels on purpose and tries to change the events/ by accident and tries not to change anything while romancing people she meets.

And almost anyone is game. Remus, Sirius, James, Snape!

I just like to see how many diffrent outcomes can come from similar premise.
