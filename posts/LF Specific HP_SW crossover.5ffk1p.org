Hey, I'm looking for a Harry Potter in the Star Wars universe story I remember reading awhile ago. Harry is being trained by the New Jedi Order and goes on his first mission with Mara? but someone dies. He then goes into angsty!Harry for a chapter. That's all I remember about it... Thanks in advance!


** Don't know this specific one, but check out Darth Marrs. He writes some good hp/sw stories.
