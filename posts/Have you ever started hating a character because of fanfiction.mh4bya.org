In canon, I wasn't terribly fond of Hermione, but I didn't hate her either. But these days I'm really sick of her. She's everywhere. Either as Harry's romantic partner in badly written romance fics, as his friend, or even enemy. I understand that the majority of fanfiction writers seem to be female and many of them use Hermione as a kind of self-representation, but there are so many other female characters. Can't people choose one of those? Also I get it, Emma Watson was hot, but Merlin's unwashed underwear! Do people really have to use Granger? There are other fish in the sea.

***** Nobody dared usher a word. All waited with baited breathes, looking, excited, yet still terrified, at the table where stood two very important wizards.

On one side, Harry Potter, The Boy-Who-Lived. Rumours had it that he had slain a Basilisk under the school. That he faced a spirit as dark as the night, protecting the philosopher's stone. He had won the Triwizard Tournament, which claimed the life of a strong, experienced yound adult.

On the other, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the only one to have more than one middle name in the magical world. Supreme Mugwump, defeater of Grindelwald, and the only one the Dark Lord ever feared. Some would claim him to be the strongest wizard of his age.

Slowly, Harry Potter raised a hand, approaching it towards the middle of the table. There stood the very thing that threatened to break the fragile peace between the two wizards. The last piece of the last Treacle Tart there would be this month. That it was December 31st didn't matter. /It was the last/.

Albus Dumbledore shook his head. Slowly, he raised his wand, a move which Harry mirrored.

Harry Potter frowned. Albus Dumbledore smiled sadly. "I am sorry my boy. I cannot let you just take it. You must understand that it would be way better with me."

"You know nothing, professor Dumbledore!" Harry all but screamed. "I saw it first, and I claimed it first! No ammount of dark lords you killed will change the fact that I will not leave willingly without this tart."

Dumbledore sighed. "So be it. I am sorry, Harry, my dear. This is for the Greatest Good."

-----

Harry Potter woke up with a headache. As he slowly looked around him, he remembered the events that transpired yesterday.

"Yo Harry!" he heard behind him, and as he turned around, he saw Dean coming towards him. "I can't believe he beat you again! I saw you training your dual-bread wielding last night. Well, the night before."

Harry sighed. He did that a lot, lately, it seemed. "Yeah. Can't believe professor Dumbledore is so good at food fights."

It turns out his Dragon nature is invisible to muggles, but makes him mostly invulnerable. The result is basically Harry Potter with no angst or much danger. It's pretty fun.

******* Absolutely. Looking back now as a 21 years old I wonder how did I love him so much. I understand why he left Harry with the Dursleys, for starters, but I will never, ever forgive him for not checking on him, not caring that he was abused, that he hated that place. I hate that he didn't try to get Sirius a trial, that confined him to the house he hated the most. That he was manipulative enough to leave Harry mostly in the dark about the horcruxes... I don't think he's bad. But i think he isn't as good as many people make him. He didn't really care about individuals and, again, as much as I understand why, I'll never not think that there could have another way out.

***** Dumbledore the entire reason the British Isles were in such a fecking mess.

He's like Batman and the Joker, he needs Riddle around so that he can be the great Supreme Mugwhump and ensure that the Light prevails. Every time I see good Dumbledore I think bits of my hair turns white.

The guy literally left Harry in a abusive home, let Snape almost get killed and directly made him join the DE's for revenge, and created a DL. And kept Riddle being a half blood a secret, which would have stopped any DE movement.

Albus is a character that you come to hate the more you read about him and realize all of this. Genial grandpa who is actually a serial killer, lol.

And then used a oath on him to keep him practically in slavery.

The more you read fanfic and canon you realize how many shitty people are in charge of a school of children and Hogwarts did nothing more than churn out angry people who hated each other even after they graduated.

All of the senior teachers even the school nurse had to see how Sev was treated but did nothing, but they kissed Harry's ass so much he didn't need to use tissue.

******* I think that it may be a common issue that if you read the books first, the movies never seem to live up to them, or if you see a movie before reading the book it is based on, it is harder to get into the book. At least it is this way for me. I read the Harry Potter books first, so for me, the movies left a bit to be desired, as I felt there was stuff in the books that should have been in the movies, and some stuff added, that should not have been, as it was not in the books. Conversely, I have seen other movies, that were based on books, and then tried to read the book afterwards, and had a hard time getting into the book, as it was different from the movie.

Molly and Sirius simply had different approaches on what was right for Harry and they clashed. Sirius' position Harry should know more is vindicated by his own death.

Molly is being protective, as is her right- and in a normal war, which was not centered around Harry, her position is the correct one. But Harry is in a unique position in this war and that needed to be taken into account.

***** I wish people would stop saying Molly was a good surrogate mother to Harry the reality is she wasn't a good one she was a pretty shit one.

She claims Harry is as good as her son when in reality he hardly has spent any time with her at all at that , a couple of weeks after first year a couple of days after second year and a few more weeks after third year. Overall he spends around a month with her in 15 years of his life not really a mother figure. Molly also allows harry to be sent back to be abused every year by the Dursleys simply because Albus Dubledore says, even when Fred and George say there are bars on his window and are starving him. Molly Weasley doesn't care about Harry's feelings at all. if she considered real mother figure to Harry through out the series then she is a really Shit one. Especially when it really counts

Because Fred and George are completely trustworthy.

Look, Molly has lots of flaws, but she has very little reason not to believe that Fred and George are vastly exaggerating the severity of Harry's home life. Firstly they're Fred and George, Molly is already predisposed to not trust their word given how often they lie to her. And secondly they drop this when Molly is mid rant about them taking the car, it sounds like something they're saying in a vain attempt to justify themselves and get out of trouble. Fred and George never bring it up again, if they'd come up to Molly the next day or something and said "Mum ,we were serious about the bars" she'd probably have taken that a lot more seriously.

she is kind of like Fudge when you think about it, brushing off Harry's concerns about Voldemort being back, I guess Fudge was right all along Harry is a liar after all, you should never believe a word a child says. after all all children have probably lied about something at least once even Harry. You should not brush of your child or children you love because you think they are lying that is a good way of having them not trust you with anything serious again, is it any wonder Harry doesn't go the the adult in his life more for help, they never actually listen to him and help him anyway.

** This is gone now that I've limited what I read more, but for a long time the marauders. Fanon marauders are some of the most boring characters in the fandom. With the exception of Peter, they're grey characters, and supposed to be read as such. They're interesting because of their flaws, and because their friendship was collapsing internally (and eventually it did). In fanon they're whitewashed to huge extremes, all of them, but especially Remus Lupin, who is made a caricature, a gay uwu soft boy who loves chocolate, and is very timid. I like the marauders because they're a toxic friendgroup of pretty terrible people who enable all of their worst impulses, and who only in their interactions with other people do they grow into becoming good, not the mayonnaise and milk bitches of fanon.

*** I think fanon goes both ways - either there is withwashing or there is making them the greatest bullies of all time. The truth is somewhere in the middle. They were cruel to Snape, there is no question in that.

On the other hand they were unbelievable loyal to their friends. James, Peter and Sirius were all brought up with prejustice against werewolves - but instead of casting him aside they helped him.

Sirius fought against the cruel ideology he was brought up. That's not a small thing either. Standing up against your parents at the age of eleven is very brave.

James and Sirius also decided that they would fight against a wrong ideology and give their lives for it when they could easily live their lives under Voldemort without any problems.

They are complex characters. They are cruel and irresponsible as teenagers, but they are also loyal and brave. I can't think of many (if any) fanfictions that really show that dichotomy.

And Peter always get tossed aside in fanfiction - regardless if it makes the marauders heroes or villains. I think that's wrong. I think they were a very thight knitted group of friends. Sirius trusted him more than Remus. James was willing to risk not only his live but also that of his wife and his son by trusting him. I don't think he would have done that if James and Sirius didn't see him as good friend.

**** But the marauders really weren't as close as friends, at least not as adults. James fatal flaw (not his biggest flaw, but his fatal flaw, there's a difference) is that he believes that the marauders are all a tight knit group of friends who could never betray each other. Meanwhile Remus suspects Sirius of being the spy, and viceversa. Remus is being frozen out, and all along Peter is betraying them (It says a lot that not a single member ever once suspected him). This is not a close group of friends. Maybe in the past, but not right now. Even the good things you mention they did as a group are double edged swords. They turned into Animagus to help Remus, and used that to run around Hogsmeade, where they almost bit people many times. That's the point with the marauders. With the exception of Peter, all their best moments come as individuals, (Remus with Tonks and Teddy, James with Lily and Harry, Sirius with Harry, joining the Order). When they're together, they consistently bring out the worst in themselves. James, Remus and Sirius may have had many fine qualities as individuals, and been good people overall, but the marauders as a group... suck. They're toxic to each other and to other people. Real growth with them only comes when they attach themselves to healthier groups and people. (Peter is as always the exception in that he's a psychopathic monster, but even this is fucked up by fanon, they make him incompetent and/or a coward, when he isn't, he's just evil and completely lacking in empathy, and by feats the most competent and magically talented of the four). And I do think that the bullying Snape suffered is understated. There's a reason for why Snape is more scared of Remus and Sirius than he is of Voldemort. There's a reason for why he barely reacts to Harry trying to /crucio/ him, yet explodes when he tries to use /levicorpus/ on him (like his father before him). He is suffering form the effects of huge, untreated trauma.

**** Izzythehut writes Sirius very well. Ashesahesshackles has written some good one shots and character studies of all the marauders as well. I've also been recommended the author The Divine Comedian by someone I trust, and will read when I have the time. Your Stars are True by Penelope Muir also has good Sirius characterization, and a nice exploration of the bond he had with Regulus. Look them up on ao3. They have a variety of fics. A good barometer for good marauder content is how they treat Snape. If they bash him, then that's a big red flag for fanon marauders. Same with the Snape writers. If they bash the marauders, red flag. If you're willing to read Snape centric fics, we_built_the_shadows_here and Jaxon are Snape writers whose snily fics feature some very good marauder characterization (the formers portrayal of wormtail is perfect). But I understand if a marauder fan doesn't want to read those types of stories, so they're side recommendations. Finally, There is Nothing to Fear by Callmesalticidae is a Gryffindor!Riddle fic that among other things explores what the marauders would have been if they were exposed to negative influences in their house. It gets Dark, but doesn't bash them at any point. The characterization isn't perfect, in that they tone down Wormtail's psychopathy and whitewash Remus a tad, but it's still pretty good. I hope you can enjoy at least one of these!

The fact that they also butchered Ginny doesn't help either.

Book Hermione and book Harry are much less compatible romantically; Harry loves her like a sister, but he doesn't always like her very much. He either ignores, avoids, or snaps at her when she's nagging and she can't let stuff go without Ron stepping in and telling her to cool it. Hermione is intense and overbearing, Harry is almost always constantly in a state of extreme stress, and they both need partners who can calm them down before they self destruct - like Ginny and Ron.

** ‚ÄòHate' is a bit of a strong word, but Malfoy. A fair bit of the series, his rivalry with Harry was just that, rivalry that cropped up throughout. Harry frequently gave as good as he got. I mean, yeah, okay, he wasn't a cherry pie cinnamon roll, but it was only in OOTP that he really started being more actively involved in the series. And let's face it, Harry and co weren't exactly saints early on, either --- setting off a live firework in a cauldron? Knocking out Crabbe and Goyle and impersonating them?

Up until he started trying to poison people and send them cursed artefacts in HBP, I really didn't feel strongly about him.

Now I've read the Drarry/Draco in Leather Pants that just have them getting together... because... reasons... I've just become generally irritated by him even early in canon. I can believe that Draco changed his ways after school, but I cannot believe that he and Harry would ever decide to be romantically involved.

I've read some Slytherin!Harry fics that have them as good /friends/, but romance? Nope. Can't see it. The one Drarry I've ever been convinced by is Sacrifices, and that Harry is so radically AU as to be far removed from canon.

Obviously Harry's upbringing was legitimately abusive, but he at least understands the value of hard work and can relate to Draco on that level.

Arsinoe de Blassenville does this really well.

As you say, I can see a bratty-but-polite first-year Draco being good friends with Harry and perhaps learning to be more empathetic towards other people (particularly Muggleborns), rather than lashing out verbally and magically. And I can see Harry learning coping mechanisms from Draco: learning to make friends, get a rein on his temper and perhaps even seek therapy for his abuse.

I was thinking of a scenario where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and becomes best friends with Draco rather than Ron. In canon, yeah, Narcissa and Lucius rejoining the Death Eaters is not exactly a ringing endorsement of good role modelling, to say the least. If we're talking PS!era, though, Voldie died over a decade ago. The Malfoy parents are ripe for reformation (by Harry and possibly Draco too) in an AU.

You could also mix it up and write Gryff!Harry being good friends with reforming!Draco /and/ Ron and Hermione. That way he'd get to visit the Weasleys and the Malfoys. It doesn't have to be the Malfoys practically adopting him, either, it can be a build-up over a couple of years. I can absolutely see it being a point of contention between (friends) Harry and Draco that Lucius was a Death Eater and that Narcissa is related to Bellatrix.

Okay, but the point of fanfic is that there /could/ be a culture to protect, beyond Magic itself. Even in the absence of a pureblood culture, there are plenty of ways Lucius can still be racist but no longer agree with genocidal murderer. As we see with Dumbledore, people change. It's possible that an AU PS!era Lucius genuinely does regret that he murdered people in the name of blood purity. Yes, he would still hate/fear/be prejudiced against Muggleborns and Muggles. But there's a difference between that and rejoining a genocidal maniac to carry out raids on innocent people.

Even without a culture, no reason Lucius can't be aware of, and terrified of, the rapidly rising Muggle population and advanced tech, for one thing. Surely at least some wizards know about guns and weapons of mass destruction. Even Hagrid comments that Muggles would want magical cures for everything.

Frankly, a lot of magic is also just bizarre, inefficient and outdated (owls? Brooms?), so it's not like we can't go the other way and have Lucius realise that a) Muggles have actually innovated significantly in the absence of magic, and b) what he's defending is largely bullshit.

Then there's Voldie himself. Depending on how sacred unicorns are, I can even see Lucius being caught off guard if he ever finds out pre-COS that Voldemort killed a unicorn and drank its blood. I sure wouldn't trust someone who doomed themselves to ‚Äúa half-life, a cursed life‚Äù to lead the wizarding world to glory. By GOF, were I Lucius, I'd be questioning the wisdom of working for someone who's split their soul seven ways, performed a Dark resurrection ritual and come back looking like something out of a B-grade horror film. Voldie is far from sane or persuasive by that point. He's Visser Three levels of ‚ÄúHow dare you breathe in my presence, minion?!‚Äù /decapitates/

Right, that's Dumbledore's, and a bang-up job he does. By OOTP, the prophecy is moot because /both/ Harry and Voldemort are alive. Per Dumbledore himself, it is /Voldemort/ who has ‚Äúmarked Harry as his equal‚Äù. If Voldemort just stopped pursuing Harry, the issue would be over.

In DH Dumbledore essentially tells Harry to kill himself, instead of finding some way for /someone/ to prevent the death of a seventeen-year-old kid.

So, basically, this is Rowling handwaving all Harry's victories because ‚Äòlove'. Never is Harry given the tools to kill Voldemort outright (pre-DH), or the training to deter him in battle. His power is just his mother's love and sheer dumb luck.

What on earth are you talking about? I'm not just referring to adoption. Dumbledore is the leader of the Order. He's also on the Wizengamot, magically knowledgeable and is Harry's guardian in loco parentis while he's at school. He's the first person, bar perhaps McGonagall, they would turn to to find out if the blood bonds could still be active while Harry stayed at Hogwarts over the summer holidays. At the very least, they should be outraged on Harry's behalf and demand to know why he's being locked in his room like a bird in a cage in COS.

I mean, yes, I agree, but that's only if you're sticking to canon. We're in firmly AU territory here.

And like I said, adoption /doesn't/ have to be the only scenario in which the Malfoys become /closer/ to Harry and less wedded to their ways.

********* First of all, the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù isn't even public knowledge until book 6 and even the Order sans Dumbledore and Snape don't know about it until book 5. Second of all, Harry is still just a kid. He needs to be /protected/ from people who want to use him for political reasons. This is part of why Dumbledore wanted him to be raised in the Muggle world (even if that turned out to be a terrible idea).

You're making a lot of assumptions and ‚Äúwell this COULD happen‚Äù here, and none of them even lead to a Lucius that's a good influence on Harry. At best he becomes a quiet racist that doesn't actively commit hate crimes. Still doesn't make him a good role model or guardian for a child.

So you admit ‚Äútraining to defeat Voldemort‚Äù is irrelevant to the discussion at hand then. What Dumbledore does and doesn't do has nothing to do with whether the Weasleys or Malfoys would be a better influence. Moving on.

Dumbledore is ON the Wizengamot, he is not the entire Wizengamot, and it's extremely unlikely he's personally involved in child custody cases. The Order is not a ministry-sanctioned group and Dumbledore's status is therefore irrelevant to legal matters. His position as the guy who will be this kid's school headmaster in 10 years is just as irrelevant. Dumbledore may have wanted Harry at the Dursleys and personally delivered him there, but considering James and Lily had no other friends or family that could take Harry in, he was probably going to end up there anyway. There is no reason to suspect Dumbledore was involved with Harry's placement at the Dursleys and no evidence the Weasleys even knew about the blood wards. If they wanted to fight about Harry's living situation, they would have to take it to court, not the school headmaster, and Harry would likely have to testify against the Dursleys.

Writing in character is still important in an AU unless there's a REASON the character behaves differently; a life altering experience that didn't happen in canon, a life altering experience that DID happen in canon but not in the AU, raised by different parents, etc.

Andromeda was never a death eater and left her family when she was a very young adult. There was no evidence that she ever bought the pureblood supremacy bullshit, but even if she did she wasn't in nearly as deep. It's a lot easier to admit you were wrong when you're young and in love and NOT part of a terrorist cult. I'm not saying the Malfoys CAN'T eventually change their ways a little bit, but it would be extremely difficult to write well without going wildly out of character, and quite frankly most fanfic writers do not have that ability.

Sure, but better than the Dursleys. You seem to have no issue with /Dumbledore/ being Harry's mentor. Yet you insist that in a scenario where Harry was not close to the Weasleys as in canon (e.g. where Harry ends up in Slytherin and makes friends with Draco), even a fairly reformed Lucius/Narcissa could not possibly have provided any structure, support or kindness at all compared to the Dursleys. From what we see of Harry, he spends a hell of a lot of time at the Weasleys', but he also slacks off with Ron at school, and relies on Hermione for answers. I don't think Lucius would have stood for that.

I'm pretty sure that had a Slyth!Harry in an/alternate universe/ spent an equivalent amount of time at the Malfoys', he might have had more emphasis on other things, such as discipline when studying, and extra magical techniques. Are you suggesting that, for instance, he might never have benefited from using Draco's Potions lab? Or from the extra subject knowledge that Draco had? Or just from... I don't know... learning about how magic is used in other cultures? Or whatever other generalised knowledge it is that Draco has soaked up from his 4 or 5 extra years of magical schooling and growing up in a wizarding home?

I'm not suggesting Harry jump for joy at the prospect of visiting former DEs. I'm not suggesting Lucius bend over backwards to welcome Harry into his home, teach him Occlumency and then proclaim that he's going to host a tea party for the Prime Minister.

I'm just saying that in an AU fic, had Harry eventually spent most of his summer holidays at Malfoy Manor, he would've had a lot more structure during his holidays. He would've had more 1:1 interactions with Draco and a quieter time of it. That's what I mean by structure.

And maybe he could've had some exposure to different aspects of the magical world than we got with the Weasleys. Yes, I am talking about an AU fic in which Harry befriends Draco instead of Ron.

And yes, I do think that there are interesting conversations to be had around why Lucius joined the DEs and why he no longer believes in them --- whether that's between Harry and an /AU/ Draco, Draco and his parents, or Harry and the Malfoys.

By that logic, you could argue that Dumbledore was also ‚Äúa quiet murderer‚Äù because he once allied himself with Grindelwald. Even in DH, his ‚Äògreater good' philosophy is still there and it sucks.

Yes, but in canon, most of the DEs are painted as thugs. I don't understand how it's that much of a stretch to believe Lucius might, as a result of his conversations with Harry, or some other defining experience during the twelve years LV was believed to be dead, realise that Voldemort was legitimately wrong. And then maybe not destroy the Diarycrux - or at least try to get out of it. These are all AU scenarios.

I am actually suggesting that perhaps, before or during PS, Lucius, Narcissa or both could have an inciting incident which changes their view (however slowly) on Voldemort and/or Muggles. I don't understand why that's so hard for you to grasp. People can change as adults, and in a realistic world, they do.

  but considering James and Lily had no other friends or family that could take Harry in, he was probably going to end up there anyway.
#+end_quote

As much as I cavil at Remus as a potential guardian, he /is/ one of James and Lily's friends. And even if James and Lily had no other friends, why not send Harry to some other reliable household, either Muggle or magical, when it was seen how the Dursleys were treating him? Even if we assume Dumbles didn't want to put Harry through the potential trauma of the Muggle adoption system/fostering, I'm sure there were plenty of wizards willing to adopt a child. I can imagine someone like Andromeda, who lived in the Muggle world, raising Harry without pampering him.

The blood wards themselves could easily have been placated by having Harry ‚Äústay‚Äù at the Dursleys' house for two weeks a year. As it is, the Dursleys treated him like shit, so it's not like decent treatment is a condition of the blood wards.

#+begin_quote
  There is no reason to suspect Dumbledore was involved with Harry's placement at the Dursleys and no evidence the Weasleys even knew about the blood wards.
#+end_quote

Except for Harry himself, who could have told them in PS or COS. Again, AU scenario here. And clearly Dumbledore has Mrs Figg monitoring Harry by OOTP. Why is it so implausible to imagine a scenario in which he'd ask her to keep an eye on things /before/ PS? Or have someone else pop by incognito, like Andromeda, to make sure Harry's doing alright?

#+begin_quote
  If they wanted to fight about Harry's living situation, they would have to take it to court, not the school headmaster, and Harry would likely have to testify against the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

Fair, but again, once they'd taken it to Dumbledore, it'd be out of their hands, and in the hands of the Muggle and/or wizarding authorities. Testifying, while traumatic, is made easier by Pensieves and Veritaserum. I hardly think the Dursleys would be able to argue with those. /Or/ that they'd balk at giving up Harry (or only seeing him for two weeks a year, or whatever) if Dumbledore actually asked them to.

*********** Show me where I said no incarnation of the Malfoys could ever ‚Äúbe better than the Dursleys.‚Äù Show me where I mentioned the Dursleys in relation to the Malfoys and Weasleys at all. Stay on topic or concede the debate.

Draco doesn't have a potions lab, extra subject knowledge, or 5 extra years of magical schooling, and I doubt the racist white family knows much if anything about magic in other cultures. Again, you're falling into fanon nonsense that doesn't align with the original lore.

Harry would've hated the ‚Äústructured‚Äù way of life at the Malfoys, assuming that's even correct because again we know nothing about what they do during the summer. Sure, it would be better than the Dursleys, but that bar is so far below the earth's crust it's not worth discussing. He is not the kind of kid who likes to sit around, study, and sip tea all day.

No, they could not, and I'm tired of this being used as a loophole in fanfic. The blood wards only work if Harry's /primary residence/ is with Petunia. Harry only has to spend 2 weeks per summer with the Dursleys because he attends a boarding school and that's all that's needed for the magic to establish that he still technically lives there, not because 2 weeks is ALWAYS enough to make the magic work. Moving him in with Remus or Andromeda or whoever would make them void no matter how often he goes to the Dursleys to visit.

************ I don't understand why we can't dispense with that aspect of the blood wards entirely, though. It's not a ‚Äúloophole‚Äù to avoid, it just plain makes no sense. Harry's primary residence isn't even the Dursleys', it's /Hogwarts/, once he turns eleven. It's his Gryffindor dormitory, or Gryffindor Tower. He actually considers Hogwarts his home, and justifiably so.

So you're basically saying that an AU version of Harry might not enjoy a quieter experience? How do you know Draco doesn't have a Potions lab? I don't understand why you're insisting that we stick to exactly what canon shows us and can't invent details, particularly if we are making /Draco/ legitimate friends with /Harry/. In canon, this scenario would never happen anyway.

#+begin_quote
  racist white
#+end_quote

Um, again, how do you /know/ this for sure? I agree that a majority of the wizarding Britain we see is white, but blood purity-prejudice isn't the same as colourism/racism/xenophobia. It's the wizarding world, it doesn't have to follow our prejudices to a T. Just because Lucius hates Muggleborns doesn't follow that he thinks the /wizarding/ versions of other countries are inferior. Or that he thinks non-white people are inferior. There's no evidence for it in canon, but there's none against it either. It's not like the Dursleys, who are xenophobic in canon.

Once again, he can be prejudiced/former DE/anti-Muggle while also being fine with other cultures.

That was just an example, anyway. I'm sure there might be other valuable aspects of the WW that this Harry, in this ‚Äòverse, /might/ learn from Lucius.

I never said the Weasleys sucked and Harry hated them. I never said they were awful to him.

All I meant was that they were alright, but some structure during his holidays would have been a lot better for Harry in terms of being disciplined at studying, brushing up on his Potions and History of Magic with Draco, etc. Especially if he didn't learn anything from Binns and hated Snape. I'm not talking about cramming, sipping tea, measuring doilies and eating rock cakes 24/7. I'm talking about an alt!verse Harry who might have benefited from Draco as a role model to cultivate discipline, rather than doing everything at the last minute --- and from Lucius making sure that there was a balance of study and play.

I'm talking about an alt-verse Harry who might, at some point, have come round to staying at MM, in the middle of a fic, after 100k+ words of character development.

Okay, I grant that it wasn't the Weasleys' job to train Harry up. But it would also have been nice for Mr and Mrs Weasley to be a bit more proactive in actually following up with Harry about why he was being abused, for example. Or report it to whatever authorities deal with child abuse in the WW (if any). Or, failing that, report it to /someone/ who could have liaised with the Muggle authorities. Again, the primary-residence thing could easily be dispensed with.

No, that is not their job, but it is something you'd do for a child who has to be rescued from a freaking prison in the middle of the night. It's not like Harry was just a little bored, overreacting to his aunt and uncle's reasonable rules, and being a typical moody teenager. He had no friends in the Muggle world, his family was abusive his whole life and his primary school failed to pick up on it. He was obviously traumatised from the Dursleys /and/ from whatever Voldie-encounter happened at his school that year. Not to mention grieving Sirius's death.

What do Molly and Arthur do? Sweet fuck-all till the end of OOTP, just send him care packages. What happens at the beginning of OOTP? He gets put on trial for legitimately defending those same relatives (and himself!) from Dementors at his aunt and uncle's home. So, again, not real safe, is he?

And it would've been nice if, furthermore, at any point, they'd said, ‚ÄúHey, Albus, this kid is fifteen. Why does he have to kill Voldemort, again? Why can't all the adult wizards --- including Moody, the freaking Auror - find a way to defeat Voldie and kill all his cruxes? Or why hasn't Voldemort sent another DE to Privet Drive to take him captive and shot/imprisoned/Obliviated him?‚Äù Snape, Yaxley, Rosier, anyone could've walked in and kidnapped Harry. Are you telling me any of the Dursleys except maybe Dudley after HPB, would've shed a tear?

You can't tell me that it'd be OOC for Voldie to send one of his minions to shoot Harry post-GOF. Or, hell, Imperius someone to do it. Especially not when he grew up during WWII. Even easier for him because he could've done it without it being traced to him.

I'm not going to engage any more because I have no idea why you're insisting that plotholes that don't even make sense in canon should be stubbornly stuck to, that a distinctly AU-verse Harry must be exactly the same as in canon, or that structure can't be better for a kid than mucking around till the last minute.

*** Ditto. Canon!Neville is a fun character because he's genuinely shy, awkward, and more than a bit of a klutz and I wouldn't call him a coward but he's also much more fearful than most of his friends in Gryffindor (which might just be indicative of common sense if I'm being honest). He's likable because he acts and supports his friends despite these shortcomings. In the Battle of Hogwarts he was offered a free pass because of his blood status but he declined the offer, instead choosing to fight against some of the people that frighten him the most. That's admirable.

Now fanon!Neville on the other hand... Oh boy, if he doesn't turn from a stuttering mess of nerves into "*I AM LONGBOTTOM OF LONGBOTTOM!!!1!!*" at the drop of a hat then he's suddenly a magical prodigy after a new wand and a bit of encouragement. And don't forget to turn him into a 6'8" muscular chad that absolutely saturates the air with his big dick energy.

Narcissa is always a saint who doesn't share Lucius' beliefs despite being canonically racist enough to cut off her sister for marrying a Muggle born and never apologize, and may or may not have been forced to marry Lucius in the first place depending on which version of him we get.

***** Yup.

I don't mind bashing in general, if it feels like the author's doing it for fun rather than hate, but the sheer Ron hate makes me wonder how many people read the books instead of just watched the movies. Ron was Rowling's go-to guy for stupid dramatic conflict, but he was never freaking evil. ;P

Ginny... the only truly bad thing I can say about her is she's a non-entity for most of the books.

I will admit Molly got annoying in book five and six, when it felt like her lips were glued to Dumbledore's arse (the whole bit with Sirius in his own house was annoying), but people turning her into a psycho just because annoy the hell out of me.

Of /course/ the closest thing to a mother figure he has is going to come off as overprotective and annoying, he's a teenager and one that isn't used to adults actually trying to take care of him to boot.

I'm not saying Molly was always right or always made good choices. Like idc what Dumbledore says, Harry does deserve to know something about the prophecy that's ABOUT HIM, even if that something is ‚Äúthere's a prophecy about you but we can't tell you the full details until you master Occlumency in case Voldy decides to brain rape you for information,‚Äù and the way she baselessly accused Sirius of trying to replace James during that argument really pissed me off.

Like 'Oh no, in spite of Neville having Snape as a boggart, Snape was a wonderful teacher, Harry is just an arse about him!' and so on.

Molly's behavior - not what he felt, but her behavior - in books five and six were really oddly focused.

Of course, I know why - Rowling needed it that way, it's a flaw of her work that characterization is subsumed by plot. It's the same reason Dumbledore is so easily bashed by some. Doylist, we know what he's supposed to be, but if we look at the books Watsonianly, he looks pretty shady.

** Snape

ok hear me out I know that he was a good character acting as if he was a bad guy in the Books/Movies attached to that was his genuine hate for Harry which made his job easier.

But in Fanfiction, he most often than not gets portrait as this tragic wizard whose heart is breaking every time he has to shun Lily's little boy and it makes me sick to the core.

Snape was written by Rowling as a human being who saw all his failures in Harry. He failed to get the girl he loved (/was obsessed with) portrayed in Harry looks forever a reminder that he lost her to his nemesis because of his own fault. Then he sees his responsibility for getting her killed every time he sees Harry's Scar.

You get the drill. Therefore he lashed out at Harry in his emotionally abusive self dumping all the hate and misery he has accumulated on an 11-year-old boy.

In fanon, he is portrayed as this master spy who is putting everyone else above his own self which is in my opinion not true.

Fannon turned Snape from a human into a Machine and it just sucks everything out of him.

** Hermione is the logical choice for a female MC, along with switching Harry to a woman - I'm not sure why people seem surprised by that so often. She's the most prominent female character in the series, she's a popular character, she's smart, etc. There's a lot of strong points to her character. That also makes her a natural pairing for Harry, especially since the canon pairings are fairly controversial/disliked on the whole.

Basically every other female character is not particularly well developed or present - why would you think that they would be used more often? Do you think that Harry is overly used as the MC or focus of stories? It's natural that he is - he's the MC of the books and the most prominent male character, so he's the default choice. Hermione is just the equivalent for the women of the books. And there are /far/ fewer 'perfect Hermione' fics out there than 'perfect Harry' ones, in my experience.

As for characters that I dislike because of fanfiction, I don't know if there really are any. I guess I've had the opposite for Ginny with a few decently written stories involving her, where I like her a little more? I tend not to consider the negative impressions I get from characters in fanfiction to reflect on the character, but more on the story/author.

** I did at first. But eventually, I came to realize that literally every character you can name, can be written in such a way to either be a bad guy or a good guy. Dumbledore is written as a manipulative cold bastard in a lot of fics and there's a lot of circumstantial evidence to support it, but honestly, that's just fancy thinking because fanfiction authors want to read more into it.

The truth is that the stuff that happens, happens because the jrk wanted it to happen that way. I sincerely doubt that she gave certain things or certain arguments as much as a second thought.

Plotholes happen because the author either didn't think it through, or they did, but the plot in a later book, disagrees with it and so it just gets ignored.

Anyway, if there is one character I still have a strong dislike for, then it's Snape. Talking as someone who was bullied a lot when he was younger, I can tell you that I can hold a grudge. But I would never in a hundred years abuse that position to take revenge against a child for his father's sins.

Not to mention the utter CRIME of wanting to condemn an innocent man. Yes, Sirius was a little shit when he was a teenager. But the man spend more than a DECADE in hell on earth.

If that doesn't mean he hasn't paid for his crimes, then I don't know what is. I think of everything that Snape does in the books, that one thing, condemning an innocent man, stands in the top three of Terrible things he's done.

  ‚ÄúThat's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?‚Äù

Ron's only worried about his parents' thoughts in this, and as his grandmother was most likely a Slytherin, I don't imagine that he's super anti-Slytherin.

Ron was a great friend and would be with Harry to the end but ultimately how his jealously presented is how I came to dislike him. He literally rescued Harry from his relatives in CoS, so he KNEW how badly Harry was treated. Ron gets his family to practically adopt Harry yet in GoF he didn't speak to Harry for a full month because he was jealous of the ‚Äòglory' Harry always has.

Ron was a bit of a prat to Hermione especially like disregarding her S.P.E.W efforts by calling it spew or spug. Ultimately I think she was wrong for spew but how was she supposed to know as a muggleborn who had only just seen Winky being treated horribly?

** Molly and Ron.

In canon, Molly is a lovely and caring mother but does have some very slight issues. Ron as well, he's a supportive friend and someone potentially fun to hang around with but he does have some very frustrating immature tendencies. All in all, both of them are generally great. But most fanfictions like to focus on their faults and bashes them, subconsciously shifting my perception of them.

I think the reason Hermione is so often mentioned in fanfiction is because her contribution to the story in canon was very significant and the strengths of her character was clear for all to see. She's also the smart one out of the three main protagonist which makes it quite easy to write her in to solve any problems that the other characters might face.

In addition, she's also the main female character in the student-age category. The only other two significant enough that I can think of right off the bat are Luna and Ginny, both of which were mentioned and showed a lot less in the books and films. There was a graph posted a while ago on [[/r/dataisbeautiful][r/dataisbeautiful]] showcasing the number of times each character was mentioned in the books and films. In the graph, it showed that Harry was mentioned the most, obviously, then closely followed by Hermione and Ron. Every other character after them were mentioned significantly less. Often in fanfictions, writers like to have a main male and a main female character, since Hermione's character was so significantly more developed than others, she became the number one choice to fill the main female role.

Lastly, the 'golden trio' fame certainly played a significant role as well. I'm a relatively new to the HP universe, only having delved into it in recent years but even long before that, I already knew about the golden trio, Harry, Ron and Hermione. Even without knowing the story, I already knew about these three characters which certainly builds a bond that will last long after knowing every detail of the franchise.

** Hermione was my example, too. I didn't have too much of a problem with her in canon (except for her terrible taste in men), but I've developed a real love/hate relationship with her because of fanon.

This has caused me to take another look at some of her canon activities and realize I SHOULD have had a problem with her. When she attacked Ron with the birds because she was jealous? Way out of line. Cheating to get her crush on the quidditch team? She doesn't even LIKE quidditch. SETTING A TEACHER ON FIRE! Illegally brewing a potion too advanced for her (and making her friends steal the supplies by creating a very dangerous situation in class)---then drugging and kidnapping schoolmates to use said potion.

** I despise Dumbledore at this point. He's just almost never portrayed as a good guy, even when he's not an actual enemy. Molly Weasley is also one of my top hated characters, because of the tropes where she tries to force Harry and Ginny to marry, or she's a gold digger for Harry's money, etc, I won't say the situation where I absolutely started to hate her for trigger warning.

And I love canon Luna, but fanfiction Luna is the worst. She's always way too OP, way to involved, if she isn't a perfect seer that holds Harry's hand through the entire book then she's an OP goddess/reincarnated Rowena Ravenclaw/long lost multiple greats granddaughter of Ravenclaw/always the most intelligent in the room although she can never make sense at all which can lead others to trouble and it also opens the gates for a stupid over hormonal fight with Hermione mostly over Harry even though none of the books I've ever read involved Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna.

I actually like canon Hermione in many ways, she's not perfect and could use a bit more focus on her flaws actually hurting her, but she's a good character.

Fanfiction turns her into this pure uber-genius who can figure out everything and will come show everyone how things are supposed to be and is the truest true love of Harry Potter and how DARE that <insert girl here> try to take Harry from her.

Even when not bashing, you often get the 'Oh god, she and Harry are MEANT FOR EACH OTHER!' swooning from everyone and it gets really odd. She's the closest thing in fanfiction to a canon sue I can think of, at times.

I still like Hermione in the books. But in fanfic? I'm really leery of stories where Hermione's a lead, especially in a romance with Harry.

As for hating a character because of fanfiction... I've become very suspicious of Dumbledore. I try not to bash him, but the decisions he makes in the books are very questionable, and he straight-up admits he sentenced Harry to "ten years of misery" or whatever in the fifth book. I didn't take much notice of it at the time, but some bashing fics make really good points that hey, you shouldn't stick a magical child with magic-hating muggles maybe???

I also went through this weird cycle of hating Ron because of bashing fics and then loving Ron as I grew out of bashing fics. I'm very protective of him now, and like stories where he's at least a nuanced character. Yeah, his view of the world is two-dimensional, but he's still a kid and should be given a chance to mature

But, but, the most important: REMUS ! I already didn't care for him much, reading the books (i mean, contrary to the fanon, he's almost a non entity in the books until he decides that, yes, he should stick to his dead friend's orphan lost in a war because owning to his shit is too tough). But his fanon whitewashing, his becoming this poor little helpless cinnamon bun who never has a bad thought, who is always so nice and so loving towards Harry, who would fight the good fight for everyone, and did we explain how innocent and blameless he is for his very own actions? He's a bloody coward, an ADULT, and he is as arrogant and self-centred as James is supposed to be. He's a right dick at times. And I just can't stand reading about him being this super cool uncle for Harry when he never was interested in him---even when he was his bloody teacher. Fuck that dude.

Note 1: Emma Watson was underage for the majority of the movies.

Note 2: Do you really think that people use Hermione in their fics simply because of how she looks? That's... kinda insulting? Hermione is a character with a /lot/ of potential:

-She starts out as a loner, which means that /anyone/ can befriend her. She's was desperate to be recognised and to find friendship.

-She is a bookworm. She likes to read everything, including random ass trivia. That means that she's a walking, talking plot device. You need the characters to know something random that is needed, but there is no way for them to know? Boom! Hermione read it in a random book.

-She has a strong moral base, and yet the first few years (because of the aforementioned loneliness and desperation for friendship) she will do basically anything for her friends. That can easily grow into an undying loyalty. Also, said pre-existing strong moral base and respect for authority can lead to some very juicy inner conflict as her actions and experiences conflict with her beliefs, eventually leading to interesting character growth.

+ a lot more qualities that make her interesting to write about.

It's a shame that so many authors like to reduce here to a caricature and bash her.

*** I 100% second you on how insulting it is when people say that writers only like characters because they're hot. Fanfiction is just words, and most people that write it are bigger fans of the series than they are the books. The attractiveness doesn't really matter. To write a whole multi-chapter fic because you find Hermione hot would be really boring.

I also agree that Hermione (and Ron) have a great arc and are great characters, as are all of Dumbledore's Army. Harry had his fate thrust upon him, and he rose to it beautifully but at the end of the day, he didn't have another choice and knew that. Hermione and Ron chose to sacrifice just as much as Harry when they didn't really have to, because they loved him and it was the right thing to do. Hermione was targeted as a muggle-born and the Weasleys were blood traitors, but she had the option of fleeing with her parents and Ron had the option of hiding with his family. Neither of them took it. Hermione loved Ron, and she wasn't choosing Harry over him when she was camping; she was choosing to carry out Dumbledore's mission for Harry at great personal sacrifice because she wasn't sure that she could count on anyone else to do it if she didn't. They absolutely could not have achieved that goal without Hermione. I don't love how she was given some of book Harry and Ron's best moments, like to me she knew more about magic and theory than Harry, but Harry operated better under intense pressure, so I was bummed when Harry's idea to free the dragon was given to Hermione because that's where Harry really excels, but even in the books, she's irreplaceable.

I also disagree with the idea that the books gave us a lot of great female characters to choose from. It's very male-dominated. Besides Luna, Ginny, Tonks, and Fleur, I'm struggling to think of another woman around Harry's age who wouldn't be just the writers working with a blank slate character. There are other female characters for sure, but they would require the author developing them very carefully outside of canon.

** Not a character, but a ship (and I wouldn't say I /hate/ it, merely just dislike it). Before getting into fanfics, I was indifferent to most canon ships, besides Romione and Remadora which I had a slight dislike for. Notably, I was mostly indifferent to Jily. Sure, IMO, the aftermath of defense O.W.L. didn't exactly portray him in a good light, but this is just one scene, portrayed from the point of view of someone who loathed him. Then I read one too many "romcom" fics where their relationship was basically portrayed like this:

- James: "Oh this Lily girl seems precious! I want her!" ... "Lily, do you want to go out with me to Hogsmede?"
- Lily: "...why would I go out with a toerag like you?"

This was repeated ad nauseam starting from roughly 3rd year until she ultimately caves in during their 7th year because "if he's chosen as Head Boy, surely he can't be that bad?". Now, the reason I disliked Remadora (even before I started reading fanfics) was because Nymphadora basically coerced Remus into a relationship, which I don't find romantic whatsoever, but just creepy. So let's just say that reading several fics with basically the same dynamic for /years/ between James and Lily didn't exactly make me view it in a good light in the end. Hell, it's likely why I like LE/SS in first place -- "oh look, a fic that portrays Lily with someone who /isn't/ James!" -- despite the major flaws with that ship on its own, since the flaws with that one is entirely different.

She's a devoted follower, but sadly she chose to follow Dumbledore and established authority instead of her friend with a talent for leading others that rarely came to the surface. And yes, Harry was never as wise as Dumbledore or as competent (Something I blame the lack of useful teachers for; if you have a chosen one destined to fight an evil you get them as much damn instruction/practice as they can take, damn it.) but his motives were a lot more pure.

** Honestly? You can pretty easily argue that Hermione is the main character in the story (she certainly has more of an arc than Ron or Harry), so it doesn't surprise me that she shows up in so many fics, just like Harry.

Although it is a bit more jarring because Harry is passive and acts as a Readers Viewpoint, explicitly to act to give the reader a view of the world. So it is *so* much easier to simply imagine him a bit different, thus all of the AU Harry's, the entire independent Harry thing. It still fits within the bounds of the character, and thus you get a lot of different versions.

It doesn't work as well with Hermione/Ron, who have more of a strict characterization, if you deviate it too much it doesn't necessarily feel like you are still writing the characters people want to read about. Not that it can't work, its just harder.

Or, to put it another way, there are more intentionally blank spaces in Harry's character sheet (thus allowing the reader to map themselves onto him), and this allows for more creativity in fanfiction, than with Ron or Hermione. Even though plot-wise they are really as central to the plot as Harry, if not a bit more really.

** - Ron (though I didn't like him much even in the books)
- Ginny
- Dumbledore (though I can take good and bad Dumbles equally)
- Molly (though again around GoF I wanted to punch her in the face mostly already)

I guess the only change there was really Ginny. Book Ginny is reasonably great. FF Ginny tends to really go off the rails. If you don't like smother-y adults you can reasonably be sick of Molly Weasley in the books. Even though she's never a bad person. Especially with that borderline Cathy Bates behavior in OotP. But not Ginny. Never heard of anyone disliking book Ginny. Or Movie Ginny I suppose. That was a solid casting.

PS - fuck Ron.

*** Only time I disliked Ginny in the books is the one time she snapped at Hermione. The sectumsempra chapter was so bad, ‚Äòat least Harry had something good up his sleeve' and snapping at her about not understanding Quidditch was so unnecessary. Harry absolutely deserved Hermione and how she was talking to him he had almost killed someone and would've if Snape wasn't near by. Harry didn't even feel enough remorse to actually hand in the correct potions book which is despicable and Hermione was right. He was using spells he didn't know or understand even McGonagall said he was lucky to not be expelled. He would have been expelled if he was the the BWL.

People can argue that Harry ‚Äòfelt horribly for doing it' but it's simply not true he said the worst punishment was losing quidditch, and after Ginny defended him he ‚Äòfelt lighthearted'.

Which certainly altered my love of Harry but Ginny was so wrong there. Yes Draco would have used Crucio but Harry used a disarming spell on Voldemort why not on Draco?? I truly never understood how both Ron and Ginny were like ‚Äòmeh' after Harry attacked Draco, Hermione seems to be the only one who isn't excusing his actions even if it is because she is arrogantly happy that she was right about the book being dangerous

** I should probably generally speaking get off reddit, but I had this journey for Ron of

1. Reasonable human casually reading canon interpretation. Harry's kinda funny, kinda dopey, fun, brave friend, mean sometimes, mostly cool.

2. Read bashing fics. Now canon Ron, by contrast, is the most loyal, wonderful, friend a person could ask for, best sense of humor in the series.

3. Read reddit opinions. Similar to 2. Now I kinda hate him, again by contrast. Ron's a thoughtless, faithless friend, only interacts with Hermione by bullying her, does nothing useful in books 4-7. Unfortunately canon supports this one to those with this bias already in place so I'm stuck here.

****** Honestly, reasonable counterpoint.

Here's what my horribly biased brain does to that event:

Dumbledore gives Ron a Harry-finder, Ron happens to follow it at the right time to avert a disaster, then Harry has him kill the horcrux to throw him a bone.

I guess it didn't feel like things go any different if Ron isn't there/literally anyone could have done the same thing? Like a muggle walks by, sees a drowning kid, helps him out, then Harry kills the horcrux. Or Harry puts the horcrux down, jumps in, gets sword out, kills Horcrux. Or Harry nearly drowns, Snape goes "shit", levitates him out, Harry kills horcrux.

I feel like if the JKR from PoA, who actually liked Ron, was writing this, she would have made him... follow Snape? Figure out how the thingy worked by pouring hours of his life into it, then maybe use some kind of keepsake that Harry had given him? Something better demonstrating that Ron had a choice.

******* Lol bro.

If you're gonna reject actual canon moments that prove you wrong and change the goalposts, I see no point in this conversation.

And for posterity's sake, here is (nowhere near complete) a list of the times Ron praises/compliments/makes Heemiome feel good although I doubt [[/u/chlorinecrownt][u/chlorinecrownt]] will acknowledge their existence.

‚ÄúI mean, I know you're good, Hermione, but no one's that good. How're you supposed to be in three classes at once?‚Äù Chapter 6, PoA

‚ÄúHermione, I don't know what's got into you lately!‚Äù said Ron, astounded. ‚ÄúFirst you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney --‚Äù Hermione looked flattered. Chapter 16, PoA

‚ÄúHow do you remember stuff like that?‚Äù asked Ron, looking at her in admiration. Chapter 12, OotP ‚ÄúWe just haven't got your brains or your concentration --- you're just cleverer than we are-‚Äú chapter 12, OotP

‚ÄúHermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.‚Äù Chapter 14, OotP

‚ÄúWell, what's so impressive about that?‚Äù whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. ‚ÄúYou are the best in the year -- I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!‚Äù chapter 9, HBP

‚ÄúOh, she was perfect, obviously,‚Äù said Ron, before Hermione could answer. Chapter 22, HBP

Here are some instances that show Ron comforting Hermione or caring about her in some other way.

GoF Ch. 21 ‚ÄúJust as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,‚Äù said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another, it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.

‚ÄúHagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,‚Äù said Ron consolingly. ‚ÄúWorst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry, did I say worst? I meant best.‚Äù

Harry and Hermione laughed, and feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.

PoA Ch. 6: ‚ÄúThey wouldn't fire him, would they?‚Äù said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding.

‚ÄúThey'd better not,' said Ron, who wasn't eating either.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYou don't reckon Malfoy did something to her?‚Äù Ron asked anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. (PA217/295) [PA15]

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYou know what, Hermione?‚Äù said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. ‚ÄúI reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.‚Äù (PA218/295) [PA15].

‚Ä¢ With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.‚ÄúOi!‚Äù Ron called after her, ‚ÄúWe've got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,‚Äù he said, turning back to Harry, ‚Äúshe must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam‚Äù (GF533/614) [GF31].

‚Ä¢ Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night (OP626/710) [OP31].

To explain, Fudge and Percy have this stigma attached to them about being a corrupt politician and pretty much becoming Voldemort's greatest allies to somehow getting redeemed by nothing more than "oh here's what they did when we weren't paying attention."

Ron, in the stories that make me despise him, does nothing wrong except for acting irrationally. I'm not the biggest fan of his character in canon due to personal reasons, but he's a Gryffindor through and through. Even when he should take a step back and look at situations through a different lens

Unless of course if they're written by someone who's clearly new, or they use some tropes that DO NOT AT ALL sit well with me. I'm not so sure you want me to elaborate on that. You might ask for some Brain Bleach afterwards.

If it's a long one, slow burn is the way to play. And the Harmonie isn't even the main focus for all of them. Take ‚ÄòA Marauder's Plan' for example. The Ancient and Noble Houses trope is really well done in this fic.

** I started disliking Dumbledore after certain fanfictions where he was too manipulative but also so realistic, exactly to be expected.

Also Lily, after reading WBHL stories and Marauder era Snape centric stories, where she was self-centered and vain character, also not a loyal friend. I do understand there are certain theories, fans take either Lily's side or Snape's, but some well written stories really show her in a bad light.

Even though l enjoy both good!dumbledore and good Lily stories where she keeps her friendship or maybe relationship, some fanfictions really opened my mind, so l started seeing canon characters in different light.

As a child first reading the books, l never saw through Dumbledore and l have always seen him as a benevolent, grandfatherly mentor.

However, l empathised with Snape and did not like Lily. Unrequited love is a strong feeling that gets through every reader as we have all probably experienced that kind of pain in our lives. Her abandonment is debatable, and fans take sides. A talented writer can make anything happen. I enjoy reading about both.
