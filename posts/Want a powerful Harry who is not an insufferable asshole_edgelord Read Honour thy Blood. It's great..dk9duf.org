*** No not bashing at all. Well Ron is portrayed as exceedingly lazy but it doesn't go beyond that. And no Ice Queen but very much damsel in distress falls in love with her saviour type Daphne.

*** Eh, Dumbledore himself would tell you he was arrogant, especially as a kid/teen, but also as an adult. And he had his jerk moments in the books. My favorite was when he stood their highly amused while Snape blew his top after Sirius escaped.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong.
