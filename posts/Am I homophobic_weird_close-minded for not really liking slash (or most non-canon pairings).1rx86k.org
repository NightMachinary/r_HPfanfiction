I feel guilty and a bit ashamed of myself for cringing at Harry/Draco. And whenever I'm writing my fic preferences out, I feel bad about saying, "no slash."

I don't mind Remus/Sirius, but that's basically the only slash pairing between two main characters that makes sense to me. Dumbledore/Grindelwald would be okay, if it didn't feel like reading about my grandfather. I don't like Ginny/Draco or Luna/Draco, so why do I feel guilty for not liking Harry/Draco?

I'm a girl, so I think part of it is that I don't see the point in reading smutty slash because I don't really find it to be a turn-on. Smutty het at least has a secondary purpose.


** Like what you like. Don't bother with what you've tried and found distasteful. You aren't homophobic unless you see a need to /suppress/ the work because they describe what you're not into.

Most people project themselves onto the main character(s) while reading, and you may not enjoy the mindset being portrayed. Either that or you may see yourself as being in the same room as the characters, and if they're doing something you would feel embarrassed to witness, your discomfort is understandable. So long as you understand that your choice is just as valid for you as someone else's is for them, you're being fair-minded.

At least in my philosophy.

*** Just adding my two cents here from a different perspective, seeing as I completely agree with the previous comment.

I like many (as in *many*), het stories but those with excessive imagery or long\frequent lemons are just unappealing and irritating to me.

For example harry potter and the sword of gryffindor is supposed to be hilarious and I started reading it at least 4 times. I could never get past the frequent and obvious (though tame) references to /ahem/ female anatomy even in the first chapter. So I didn't read it. As long as I don't harp on the author and the people who enjoy it, there is nothing wrong with not enjoying it myself, and the same goes for you the other way around. Although as a girl you probably don't enjoy graphic and longwinded descriptions of sexy females either...

Anyway, being a connoisseur of many varieties of slash (and a good bit of non-slash) as well as a raging homosexual I can tell you I am not I'm the slightest offended that is not your cup of tea. Just don't annoy others for liking what they like and everyone can happily sit in bed with their laptops and read whatever they enjoy ;)

**** Not to threadjack, but how do you feel about adding slash filters to fanfic archive websites, and how do you feel about "Surprise Slash" where they do not give you any indication that this is going to be say...Harry/Draco?

I haven't met many homosexual, harry potter fanfic readers. And it seems that most who write do not write as slash. Slash always seems to be written by tween and teen fangirls who have no idea what they are talking about beyond "omg what if harry and draco did it!"

***** Queer redditor chipping in to say that I read and write slash fic; I'm cool with slash filters as long as there's a het filter as well; and I object to the entire notion of surprise slash unless you agree to surprise het as well. I am cool with pretty much anyone hooking up with anyone as long as the fic lends itself to it. Whether or not your fic is romance-centric, if you throw a main pairing at me (I'll give a pass to background couples) then I expect the characters involved to have built up a relationship that lends itself to them being together.

And I couldn't find a way to say this without being blunt: you need to lose the belief that most slash is written by tweens. It's not. At least, there are no more bad slash fics written by tweens than there are bad het fics written by tweens. The only difference is you've clearly gone looking for the good het fics but never bothered with the good slash fics. That's fine, you can read what you want, but it does mean you shouldn't make generalisations on it.

****** I agree and I'm sorry for generalizing. I stated to another who said basically the same thing that yes; I haven't tried to read many slash fic, and the ones I did read were badly written. I don't have enough interest to keep looking for good ones, and probably not enough interest to read anything recommended.

It at least /seems/ at the moment, that on FFN the relationship of new fics is about 3-to-1 in favor of slash, and none of it good. But total "good" fic is probably a 10:1 or worse ratio anyway so that isn't saying much.

Thank you for your point of view though, as I said, I don't talk to or know many "queer" ff readers or authors. Or at least, any that I do "know" I've only ever read or discussed het from/with them.

** Sexuality is personal, and not liking what turns other people on is both normal and perfectly fine. No reason to be upset about that. I like slash, I like het, but I dislike threesomes/the ubiquitous "Harem Harry". Do I disparage those who do? Of course not. Fanfiction is by its very nature supposed to be a place where people can find enjoyment and acceptance, so read whatever you want and like whatever you like. Don't worry so much. Just don't judge or put down those who like things you don't like.

** As a bisexual male, I find it really hard to read most slash because it's both poorly written and the usual pairings are just super weird (Snape/Harry or Lucius/Harry are two of my biggest headscratchers) BUT it can be done well.

Harry/Draco can be okay if tricky to make seem natural. That's what a lot of writers don't seem to grasp though. Most slash is just an excuse for the writer to imagine Dan Radcliffe and any number of the other male cast members getting freaky. Realistically, Harry would end up falling for a Neville or one of the other Weasleys. (I LOVE Harry/Charlie stories....but that's just me)

On the other side of the coin, I am not a fan of harem stories because I'm very monogamous (yes, I'm a married, monogamous, openly bisexual male) and most just end up being excuses for smut in the same way bad slash can get.

Like what you like, don't read too far into it. Some people don't like lemon in their tea, doesn't mean they'll march against the rights of those who do. In the end fanfic is just that, stories made by fans for other fans to enjoy. So that's just what i recommend ya do!

** The term "homophobic" is greatly overused. Including in ways that don't make any sense.

If you don't like the taste of broccoli, you'll probably avoid eating it. Does that make you broccoli-phobic? Are you somehow prejudicially insulting people who do like broccoli? Should you feel ashamed, or fear that people will think less of you because you don't give broccoli equal access to your taste buds?

The clear answer is no, to all of the above.

** Nope, it's down to personal preference. I won't read any male/male-centric stuff at all, but don't mind female/female, male/female/male relationships...

Quite honestly, it's probably because I've not actually seen any male canon characters in HP and gone 'yep, they would be good together'. Apart from book 4-5 Remus and Sirius, but that's more of a bromance thing than a 'let's play hide-the-wand' relationship.

And Harry/Draco? Urgh. Draco/any other main character makes me want to hurl. I tried writing him as nice a couple of times. The best I could do was gift him with 'magnificent asshole' status and even then he went so far OOC that it boggled the mind.

I don't like Malfoy as a character. His personality is too bloody narrow to do anything with. If he were actually evil, then you could do something with him. But he's just an oblivious kid who has no idea what his shenanigans do to him and those around him.

Him in a relationship before the end of book seven? Good luck making that a credible possibility. Him in a relationship with Harry? Fuck no. Neither of them could handle it.

*** I know it's been a couple of days which in reddit terms is practically ancient history, but I kept thinking about it and decided I couldn't not comment on a few of your things.

#+begin_quote
  all females are a little bi-curious [...] women are soft and loving and emotional
#+end_quote

That's pure patriarchal bullshit. Society has told you only women can be soft and loving and emotional, so you (general) say that if a man is then he must be queer and you (personal) are sexualising the women you see being affectionate with each other. Both of these things are misogynistic. Stop it.

The idea that Harry and Draco can't be homosexual because they married and had kids is also bullshit. It's not actually that uncommon for people to not realise they're attracted to the same sex until well into adulthood, or to deny they're having such feelings or pretend they're straight because of societal/family pressure to conform. If you want to be realisitc, this is actually a thoroughly plausible issue for both Harry and Draco. Given everything we know about the Dursleys, it would be highly likely that they're homophobic and despite Harry's awareness that the Dursleys aren't people to emulate, those kind of attitudes can have lasting effects on childre; it's completely believable that he might have internalised homophobia and doesn't accept his sexuality until well into adulthood. Draco, meanwhile, is a pureblood and given their fondness for advancing wizarding families, it wouldn't be a surprise if purebloods were against homosexuality because it doesn't produce children, so he too could go most of his life pretending he's straight just because his parents spent his whole childhood telling him that if he's a good Malfoy he'll marry a witch and produce more pureblooded babies.

The idea that canon relationships are the only basis for characters sexuality is crap. The books give us seven years of their lives, and not only is that a comparatively short length of time, it's also their teenage years which is a time period at which sexuality can be explored and questioned and never quite understood. Canon is not the be all and end all, especially for those of us who reject the epilogue (and not every one does that because they don't like the pairings).

As for Jack Harkness, he's pansexual. That is, he's attracted to everyone no matter their gender. (And no, that's not the same as bisexual.)

**** I admitted my views on women as "all bicurious" were hypocritical, and I'll admit again that they are purely self delusional. I have nothing but annecdotal evidence to back up the claim. But I like my delusions.

I do not in any way enforce my view on women, I am just as accepting of homosexual relations in either sex, but while I tolerate male/male intimacy (and have in fact participated in it) I appreciate female/female intimacy, because I like women.

I also reject the epilogue, so we agree. And as for Jack Harkness I did call him "Trysexual" as in he'll try anything. Pansexual works as well I suppose. I've never been bothered by any scene with him and someone of the same sex because it is how his character is portrayed. I suppose changing the portrayal of a character does feel like betrayal to me, which would be why I reject seeing gay Harry as he is very straight in my mind.

We all project ourselves onto the characters we love. So my Harry would always be straight and possibly slightly bi-curious, but never Love another male the way he would a female. That is my call to make.

I am not demonizing anyone for their tastes in fiction, only the stories which I have read where Harry ends up being homosexual. In the stories I have read it is always out of nowhere (much like Harry/Ginny in canon sixth year, which I also hate, but at least that was set up in book 1)

Thank you for your concern and taking the time to reply though, you did make great points.

**** True,

I am perfectly willing to admit my hypocrisy over multi pairings(see above), most McDumbledore fic were written long before JKR said anything about him being "a little gay"; and I am also willing to admit that every slash fic I've tried to read was a tweenwriter fic, very badly done, and I'm just not interested enough to look for good ones (and probably not interested enough to read them even if they are recommended).

There are definitely thousands more crapfic that are het or gen, but that is as much due to total percentages as anything. There are lots of crappy writers and even more crappy stories.

I think the problem is the current trend on sites like FFN, if you look for any new fiction in HP, you will find a ratio of about 3-to-1 or worse, of slash to het/gen. It seems like every other post is Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape or Harry/Tom.

Honestly, I think Harry/Tom might be the only one I could enjoy due to the dichotomy. It is possible that most of those fic are actually Friendship fic and not slashfic, but if that is the case someone needs to get the word out to those authors that they need to put that in the description.

*** A point about your objection to slash being that it goes against canon sexuality. I personally find it so much less believable that canon-Harry would /ever/ have a polyamorous relationship than a homosexual one. Harry beyond all else wants a family, in the very traditional sense, and he is highly loyal. He is also not hyper-sexual or overly aware of sexual and romantic possibilities in the people he meets. Compare his reaction to Fleur against Ron's, for example. He is a sexual person, but it's not that important to him -- he values trust, loyalty, and intimacy much more. I think all those translate pretty strongly to him desiring a monogamous relationship.

Your comments about female sexuality were addressed below, so I won't get into that too much. Just try to understand that your generalizations about women are not very accurate in my experience.

I am in no way trying to get your to change your mind about your own personal preferences, or trying to get you to try something you have no interest in. I just hope that you can be a bit more open minded and a bit less derisive in your opinions. The conclusions you have drawn are largely anecdotal and based off of your own personal experience, and that is not necessarily accurate. I have personally read far more high-quality, well-written slash than I have het, and I read both pretty equally. I like Harry/Ginny more than I like Harry/Draco, but I have read more high quality Harry/Draco than I have Harry/Ginny, and this is not necessarily by choice. I'll go looking for a good Harry/Ginny but get frustrated and turn to slash, because it will be easier for me to find something good. I also have read more slash that felt like it was written by adults than het, which is often very juvenile in my mind. These are my own experiences, which I could easily draw generalized conclusions from like you have done with your own experiences, but the fact that both of us have highly contradictory experiences means that neither of our conclusions would be entirely accurate.

To be bluntly honest, I think that you have some innate distaste for reading in-depth or detailed descriptions of male homosexuality, and this personal preference is coloring your opinion of the quality of writing of slash fics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with not enjoying reading about two men having sex, if that is not what you like. I don't like most harem Harry fics because I am deeply monogamous in my orientation, and on some level it bothers me to read otherwise. But I don't let that color my opinion of the ability of authors of fics with polyamorous relationships. Try not to let your personal taste color your judgments either. Doesn't mean you need to read it. Just don't assume all slash is poor quality and juvenile, because I assure you, it is not. And I have read many more slash fics than you have, I can guarantee it.

**** Thank you, I freely admit my hypocrisy.

I am actually somewhat bi-curious, though that really only applies to having a third in the bedroom and not any real enjoyment I would get from having one on one male/male sexual encounter. I am not in any way attracted to men, so you are correct in that I hold zero interest in scenes depicting male on male intimacy. I have no problem with homosexual acts, have participated in a few, and yet I have no taste for reading it...

My views on women are expressly stated as being hypocritical and self delusional, but I like my delusions. I freely admit I understand lesbians, mostly because I like women so I understand why women would prefer another female to a man, especially if they are being promiscuous.

*** You know, fanfiction itself is already looked down upon enough as being the creation of moody preteen and teenage girls (an assumption that I and probably others find offensively dismissive). I don't think it helps at all if we use that insult against other writers/readers/fics. Some slash writers are tween girls toying with sexuality, but others are just people who like toying with an (and unfairly taboo) aspect of what makes a character who they are: their sexuality. Maybe the writers are gay themselves, or maybe they just like reading slash, or maybe they are just in it for the smut. It doesn't particularly matter; it's just another taste in fics, one that you can dislike, but one that you houldn't dismiss as "pointless"--couldn't that word be applied to all fanfiction then? I'm not trying to accuse you directly, and I'm sorry if this came across as rude. I just think that respecting other types of fics (even if you don't like them) is really important and refraining from calling them the work of dumb tween girls is even more important.
