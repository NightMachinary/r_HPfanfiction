My first fic, just a little oneshot.

Any feedback is much appreciated, even if it's brutal!


** Definitely an interesting little read. I can see why Harry would want to leave after something like that. He never liked being in the spotlight, and after defeating Voldemort, he would of been in an incredibly bright one. Ive read a couple fics recently that pick up a few years after the battle, and it usually comes down to him having left the magical world after he did the "impossible". I hope you write a follow up, maybe a couple years later on what ended up happening to Harry Potter... The boy who lived, the Triwizard champion, the man who conquered. Without their hero, I'm not sure what the magical world would do.

*** Thanks! I was thinking that if I continued, I'd have Harry disappear into the muggle world, but then timeskip to Teddy Lupin, recently graduated from Hogwarts, going to find him and try bring him back.

**** Hmm, definitely an interesting premise. But I cant see Harry leaving his Godson for 16 years or so. I could see him disappearing from Britain, and possibly off the radar entirely, but to me Harry Potter is not the type of person to leave Teddy like that. In my mind, Andromeda, Teddy, Hermione, and Ron, know where he is but they know to keep it to themselves. Harry berated Remus when he talked about leaving his son, thats not the type of person to abandon their Godson when they're being raised as an orphan just like he was. Would Sirius Black have left Harry with the Dursleys if he didn't go to Azkaban? I don't think so. That said, it's your story, so write it how you see fit.

***** Mmm that's a good point. I would say that in this story, it became the straw that broke the camel's back for Harry, which I tried my best to show. In what little I wrote, I wanted to make it so that in this universe, if Harry had stayed he would be pressed to take on responsibilities he knew he wasn't ready for. This wizarding world needed a leader of the light, a guide.

Also, in regard to Teddy, I would like to think that Harry understood Dumbledore's actions and maybe saw that he wasn't ready to raise a child either.

Idk, you've definitely given me something to think about

****** I definitely got that vibe, the wizarding world would look at Harry as the next Dumbledore. Having defeated the 'fearsome Dark Lord' when it seemed no one could stop them. He would likely be expected to lead them into the next chapter so to speak.. Which is definitely something Harry would have loathed, especially at his age. I can totally see him disappearing at least for a couple years to travel the world, but I think he would want to be in Teddy's life, knowing that Remus trusted him to look after his son if he wasn't there to do it. Thats what a Godfather does. Harry may not be ready to help raise a child, but would Sirius have been able to at 21? Personally, I'll read whatever you write next, and thanks for seeing it from my perspective.

******* Thanks for the high praise! I do think that Sirius' situation was a little different from Harry's, but I think I will have to edit it to explain him leaving teddy.

** I think it should be "well-being" not "wellbeing".

This was pretty good. I think you described the mood pretty well and took your time to make everything seem quite bleak. I don't like the ending. It's too cliche and Harry running away in such a all or nothing way makes IMHO the least amount of sense at this point in the story.

*** Nice catch, I'll edit that well-being. Thanks for the feedback on the ending, even if you didn't like it. Sadly, it was always going to end that way, it was what gave me the idea in the first place. To me, I don't see it as running away because after all, he has nothing to run away from anymore now that Voldemort is dead. The way I see it, he's walking away, which I think is very different. This isn't supposed to be a straight divergence from canon at that point, it's just where its set. In particular, the Harry is a little different. A little more weary of being worshipped, more tired of constantly working and fighting. I tried to make it come across in how I described the crowds, but maybe it needs more work.

**** I just can't see any Harry who just fought Voldemort and secured victory abandoning his godson. That's the big issue. The next biggest issue is that he can totally distance himself from magical society if he wants to, without completely leaving his friends and adopted family behind. There's no need for it and being a drama queen and making everyone search for you istn't exactly the best way to go for the quiet life.

***** I do admit that I should address the Teddy Lupin issue better, maybe in another chapter, maybe edit what's there already. On distancing himself, I feel that this Harry doesn't want any connection to the wizarding world for fear of being pulled in. Is he being selfish? Yeah, probably. I personally wouldn't say drama queen, but I am the author so might be bias. But he wasn't making anyone search for him, and that was part of the problem. They valued him too much, more than others who gave just as much if not more in the battle. He couldn't live in a world where he'd been so persecuted and now he was so valued and relied on. I've always really enjoyed the "Just Harry" part of the character, so I wanted to explore it a little.
