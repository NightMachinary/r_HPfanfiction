Ok so the fic I'm writing is a harry potter and a elder scrolls crossover where the dark brotherhood has existed within the wizarding world for centuries and now the night mother and sithis choose harry as listener to rebuild the organization and cult like worship of sithis and the night mother. I only have the prologue out wanted some help/thoughts and ideas before I continue with it

First some points about what I plan to do with the story

1harry will be powerful but only on the level of Dumbledore and voldemort

2 he'll actually have to find most of the information on dark magic and enchanting and potions he won't know everything automatically

3 he will however have some blessings gifted to him by the night smother and sithis such as a shadow apperation

4he'll have to find an old dark brotherhood sanctuary (any ideas on where it could be)?

5 he'll be slightly mad

6 the reason is the night mother and sithis promise to give him the one thing he wants a family

7 only people like Dumbledore and grindalwald really old witches and wizards know anything about the dark brotherhood beyond old myths The flamels are the only people that know about the brotherhood in depth

Some things I need help with

1 how do I make the brotherhood a legitimately terrifying organization of assassins to a race of magic users that can teleport put up shields and alert wards etc ? The dark brotherhood will generally be a myth but to the people who have and will learn about them I want them feared on the level of voldemort

2 I really want to dive into the cult aspects of the dark brotherhood and there worship of the night mother and sithis how do you think wizards would view this? Both light wizards dark wizards the minastry and just the general population?

3 how could the wizard world find out about the black sacrament? (the way of contacting the dark brotherhood) or how could I implement other ways of contact?

4 I really want contacting the brotherhood to be almost a last resort these are murder cult worshiping assassins nobody should really want to do this excerpt the desperate ,the dark and truly depraved how could I go about implementing this aspect?

5 I want Harry over the years before Hogwarts and up to third year to become ok with the idea of killing but that seems so difficult ?(I want the night mother to really have an influence on how harry changes he should view the night mother as an actual parent trusting what she says and eventually worshipping her like the rest of the brotherhood would ).

Cults suck people in to their ideology and I want Harry to truly become this cult leader believing in the night mother and sithis as God's and his actual parents

Cults sucking people in applies to other harry potter characters how could other characters in the hp universe end up joining this assassination cult?

6 I could see voldemort trying to gain the dark brotherhood as allies yay or nay?

I would really Appreciate some help/thoughts with this idea

It would be something different than the usual dark harry stories and could be really fun


** Observations:

- Make sure the spelling and grammar is a /lot/ tidier than this post. Spellcheck/Grammarly does wonders, as does a beta.

- 'Slightly mad' is a pretty terrible character flaw. At best, it's irritating to read, at worst, it's boring to read (no character development).

- No reason why Voldemort wouldn't want the DB as allies. But the DB might see it as politically unwise to ally with him.

- Harry on par with Dumbles/Voldy is usually boring to read. There needs to be a good reason as to why he's so precocious and the forces against him need to be significant indeed. (E.g. in ffnbot(Rise of the Wizards), Harry is quite powerful, but is focused on conquering muggles and rebel wizards, so his personal power is relatively insignificant.) I'd suggest that giving him dark brotherhood powers on top of that is overkill.

- Why are the DB coming out of hiding now? Why should the audience care? Are they meant to support or hate the DB?

*** I did this post on mobile and at 3 am

2 I'll take it into consideration

3 how skilled in magic should he be then in your opinion?

4the dark brotherhood is being reborn because sithis and the night mother feel it's time 1940s ww2 was going on 1950s and 60s the Korean and Vietnam war 70s was voldamort now when there is finally a measure of peace now is the time to restore the brotherhood

Not a very good explanation but it's still in the early early stages What would you recommend then

** I've found that the best way to make people understand that your fic is dark and that you're an edgy, artistic and serious writer is to include lots of rape.

The main problem with this approach is having to type one-handed but that's a struggle I'm willing to bear.

** Initial thoughts:

1. "Only" as strong as Dumbledore and Voldemort? You mean only as strong as the wizards who lead the world of wizards in power? That's like saying "I don't want to build a tall tower, I'll settle on somewhere between the Burj Khalifa and Shanghai Tower". My first problem with this is that it reeks of "magical core" bullshittery. Dumbledore and Voldemort are that powerful because they wield knowledge. If Harry wants to be anywhere close to them in magic, he'd have to study decades and decades worth of magical theory *if* you want to stay somewhat true to the canon HP magic.

2. That's good.

3. Shadow Apparition meaning he can just vanish in shadows and emerge from another shadow? Or what exactly do you plan there?

4. The Assassins (Haschaschin) were an Islamic sect that came from the border region of Persia. Maybe one of their fortresses could double for a Temple of Sithis? The Blacks are also prime candidates to host such a organisation in one of their houses. Maybe the sewers of London would be an interesting place?

5. Meh... barely anyone in the Brotherhood was mad (maybe with the exception of Cicero). They were murderous psychopaths, but not mad.

6. fair enough

7. Makes sense if the Brotherhood hasn't been heard of for a few centuries.

Stuff you need help with:

1. Have you read linkffn(A Black Comedy)? In that fic Sirius and Harry break into Death Eater houses and steal from them, creating a myth of effective master-thieves. If instead of stealing the clothes off their bodies, Harry sticks a knife in their throat, you got yourself your modus operandi of killing.

2. Completely up to you. Religion is barely spoken of in HP, only hinted with feasts like Christmas. But in general I'd say that a Cult entirely devoted to a god of murder would be viewed with the same kind of suspicion as Death Eaters. Another way would be to make the religious aspect more towards the view of the Psijik Order which worships Sithis as a Force of Change within the pantheon of primeval forces.

3. Harry could print books in which the sacrament is spoken of. Maybe imperio Lockhart and get him to publish a book describing the ritual. Eventually the Sacrament could find its way into public knowledge when it actually works, through word of mouth.

4. Just as in Skyrim. People who see no other way than to eliminate someone else, the beaten, broken and desperate, will summon the Brotherhood. Maybe a wife of a abusive pureblood Lord hears of this new dark ritual and tries to get rid of her husband that way?

5. As the Listener he would maybe get some suggestion as to how he should solve his problems? Maybe Draco finds his way, miraculously, onto the traintracks and under the Hogwarts Express after insulting Harry and Ron? The Mother could suggest that in order to get a potion-savvy Listener, Harry ought to permanently remove Snape from his position. And since she is his maternal voice and conscience, he may find it to be the most normal way of solving his problems.

6. Meh... The Brotherhood doesn't really ally themselves.

As an general thing, Harry could look for recruits among the cold blooded murderers of the world. Bellatrix, Ms. Zabini would be the first coming to mind. The first way a cult works is to offer a great boon right at the start to get you started and then install a rigorous punishment-reward system. Harry could also use his Boy-Who-Lived mythos to proclaim himself blessed by Sithis and so creating a persona-cult around him as well.

*** I'm actually trying to avoid magic cores hence the studying part some great suggestions and yes shadow apperatiom is as you described

I'll make harry slightly mad because he is not only in communication with the night mother but sithis himself

Hmm good idea on using his fame as the boy who lived as a start point As far as a sanctuary both underneath London and a black property are good ideas I was originally thinking what about underneath Azkaban considering its origins?

As for the first point I don't want him overpowered where he can beat everyone but I still want him pretty powerful Dumbledore and voldamort I said because they are powerful he'll have to study though And of course he is the listener if he has a problem he should solve it via more silent methods if possible

I definitely intend to have the zabini family as part of the brotherhood Sirius as well Those are the only ones I have locked in

But I'm torn on who else I'm thinking maybe Rockwood Barty crouch jr and possibly karkarof Maybe Ginny

Most of the dark characters of harry potter are fanatical death eaters who would never betray voldemort

If you have any more suggestions ideas I'm happy for the help Hail sithis!

**** But don't forget that "studying" would mean *decades* of work, if you want him to be anywhere close to both Dumbledore and Voldemort. So if a young adult Harry is your goal, its simply unrealistic in any way that he could get there. Those two weren't the only two powerful wizards though. Bellatrix, for example, has been said to be a very powerful witch. Sirius was too.

I don't think Azkaban would be a good base. Dementors tend to create a bad working environment.

In terms of recruits, maybe look a bit on the sidelines. Maybe Sally-Anne Perks went down a sinister path? Maybe your big divergence is after the Fall of the Ministry and Dean Thomas comes to killing as a valid survival tactic? Also, you could just add OC's. The Brotherhood would be a global thing, if I understood correctly. Why not recruit in Mahoutokoro, Ilvermorny, Durmstrang, Beauxbatons,...?

Anyway, as a last thing:

#+begin_quote
  voldamort
#+end_quote

Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  Rockwood
#+end_quote

Rookwood

Seriously, misspelling in-universe names, /especially/ names like Voldemort, is an absolute no-go. I immediately close my tab when I come across such a mistake and so do a lot of people.

** Hmm...just a random thought, but perhaps your dark brotherhood for this fic could advertise themselves using mental suggestion?

A variant form of legilimency where they discreetly inject ideas into people's minds?

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
So, like, see Ophidia Malfoy there, she's a member of the Dark Brotherhood. Everyone knows it.

Nobody talks about it, nobody has evidence, and if she's brought up on charges, there'll be no proof of anything. But you still just /know/.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
To take it a step further, maybe these brotherhood members could use this suggestion capability to get targets to kill themselves; just the slightest eye contact or brush of skin, and a few days afterwards, for seemingly no reason at all, the target cuts their own throat or blows their brains out, or just keels over dead. And everyone somehow /knows/ that it was the work of the Dark Brotherhood, through their power of telepathic suggestion.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
They don't just kill people, they inject telepathic seeds into innocents, turning them into sleeper agents. Like a virus, a member of the Brotherhood can sweep through high society parties, leaving discreet telepathic commands in their wake.

And after you're 'infected', if you think about the Brotherhood, if you truly want someone to die, then the Brotherhood will act, and they'll take their price from you. If you admire them, want to join them, then your own footsteps will steer you into their safe houses, your own tongue knowing the passwords. And if you wish them ill, if you're lucky you'll forget they exist, if you're unlucky you'll just die of 'natural causes'.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
Only a rare few, those who are paranoid and skilled in Occlumency, have even a chance of resisting the Brotherhood. For those few special souls, the Brotherhood has elite assassins, to do things the old fashioned way...
