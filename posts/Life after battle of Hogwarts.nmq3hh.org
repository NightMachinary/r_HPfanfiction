I have recently read this Fanfiction [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days]] and want to read more like this.

I want something adventurous and close to the canon story. But the problem is, every other fanfiction I found have some kind of time Turner trick or some non canon romance plot. I just want to see how the characters cope with the after effects of the war and help rebuild the society.

  The war is over, and all Ginny Weasley wants is to be left alone. Instead, she finds herself on a witness stand, forced to come to terms with the (second) worst year of her life in front of the world that let her down. The thing is... every war story is also a ghost story.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  Fairy tales end "And They Lived Happily Ever After," but good stories continue on "one season following another, laden with happiness ... and tears." The first of 4 stories covering the 19 years until Albus goes to Hogwarts. I have a rough draft all the way to the finish!

*** Thanks you for your help. I have read both the stories by Mrs Granger and I feel that the little potterhead in my heart is pleased for now. That is a truly amazing story.
