  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

  Ron thought he was so discreet and surely nobody would notice this habit he had developed, right? One-shot. No pairings. Cross-posted on ffnet.

  Somehow it became a constant mantra, a broken record of not good enough, never good enough, not special, not anything, you are nothing, you are-He's too full, and he can feel it all trying to push it's way back out of him. He's going to explode. So he does, he explodes.

  Ron is struggling, and though he knows he's not alone, sometimes it feels that way. “I'm sorry. I know it's late.” Ron can hear the whine in his voice. He knows how small he sounds, knows that his voice betrays everything his family believes in. He hasn't felt brave in a long while. “I just...” he continues cautiously. “I'm looking for something... to help.”“Help with what?”“Please, George.”

  Ron has always been weird about his food: eating a lot, and eating it fast. He knew he was fairly thin, but he also knew his eating would catch up to him, and he was terrified. Trigger warning for eating disorders (bulimia).

  "Tragedy struck today when Anorexia Nervosa claimed a young boy's life," he spoke loudly. "Very sad. He will be missed by one person, maybe two. Awful. Now to the weather with Carl!"Ginny could not help herself; she burst out laughing. She didn't know what was more absurd. The way Malfoy joked about his own death or the fact that he had watched muggle TV. Muggle news even."You're a bloody lunatic!" she snorted, and Malfoy's smile widened."Darling," he said in a posh accent. "We're all bloody lunatics, that's why we're here in the first place." He started to stand up. "Now that you're here, that goes for you too." He began walking away from her, slowly tilting his head as he spoke over his shoulder."Welcome to the loony bin, Weaslette!"
