I read these a few years ago and I tried looking for them again to no avail. I'll give you all that I remember about them in hopes that one of you will have bookmarked them.

- One was about Ginny being sorted into Slytherin and becoming a death eater in order to spy on them. She dates Theodore Nott. It was pretty lengthy from what I recall (150k+ words at least) and it was rated M.

- +The other was a single Slytherin!Harry fic where each year just had the equivalent amount of chapters. (1 chapter spent on year 1, 2 chapters dedicated to year 2, etc...) All in a single fic. It was at least half way through year 5 when I lost track of it.+

I looked all over, but I can't seem to find them. Please help.

EDIT: Nvm, found that second one. Its hugely popular, I don't know how I missed it. Still looking for that first one though.


** What story was the second one? Is it finished now?

*** The second one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], and it's unfinished, though quite long at ~230,000 words.
