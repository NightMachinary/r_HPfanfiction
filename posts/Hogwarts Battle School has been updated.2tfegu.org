** Yes, so? Fanfiction.net has a "follow" function which causes the site to send you an email when the story updates. Anyone who wants to know when the story updates can follow the story themselves.

My thinking is that only new stories and story completion events should be posted to this sub.

That's not to say that you can't/shouldn't post discussions about new chapters, or even stories in progress. E.g. What do you think Hermione's little ritual / mark does? I didn't notice anything special from in so far in the second task. I did like how Harry defeated Krum, and how Harry stayed to save Krum from drowning. Do you think the portkey malfunction was intentional or an accident?

Thoughts?

*** While there was no need to post an update about HBS (you know, because the author just updated 4 times in as many days), I don't think there's anything wrong with a update thread for a story that comes out with a new chapter every few months.

It gives people a place to discuss the new chapter, it lets new readers find the fic, and they're a nice break from the constant recommend threads that come up.

**** I guess i wasnt clear enough. I'm not against discusion threads, only against threads that only say "x has updated".

I'm also not against threads like "x just updated and its so awesome everyone should read it". So long as this isnt done for every chapter.

***** I don't think you're giving credit to the distinction in the reply. If a story is updated daily and everyday someone posted a thread saying X was updated, that would be bad. But when a story is updated after several months, it does not seem so bad to post a thread about it.\\
(Edited only to disclose I'm a fan of Hogwarts Battle School and wouldn't have heard of this update if not for this subreddit.)

****** I don't mind a post regarding an abandoned story (e.g. no post for more than a year) being picked up again (e.g. The Santi's HP and the Boy Who Lived).

But Hogwarts Battle School was only about 3.5 months later than his projected update time. Not enough time, IMO, to make it a big deal when he posted again. Plenty of authors appear to have several months between story updates.

If you want to know when a story is updated, then use the fanfiction.net "Follow Story" functionality.
