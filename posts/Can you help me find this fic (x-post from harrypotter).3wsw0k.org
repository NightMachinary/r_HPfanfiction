It's an AU fic with an extremely OP Harry, the last part I remember was during the AU triwizard tournament where the champions had to face different versions of themselves and Harry had to face "dark harry". I also remember Flitwick warning Harry about explosions and magic experimentation causing the fall of Atlantis. I've been searching for this for ages so if anyone can help, thank you!


** I think I might have read that? Does Harry end up going to Atlantis at all?

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.
