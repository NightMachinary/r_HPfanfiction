** linkffn(The Griffin and the Dragon) A lighter warfic.

linkffn(Eight and Eighth) My favorite 8th year fic.

And then there's my personal favorite "The Fallout" by everythursday over on Hawthorne and Vine. You need to be registered there in order to read it. It's quite long and a very dark warfic.

** Sorry I am late to the game:

linkffn(The Deadline) by Lena Phoria

One of my all time favorite Dramione fics that wasn't already listed. She also wrote Cruel and Beautiful World that is already listed here.

I really enjoy her characters. Lena is excellent at creating believable, human characters and she doesn't make them into a parody of themselves, which can happen (especially to Ron in Dramione fics, he becomes this horrible villain with no resemblance to cannon Ron).

  It takes the unexpected engagement of their children to get Draco and Hermione in a room together, but only the selfish acts of their estranged spouses and a 300 Galleon bottle of firewhiskey will get them in a bedroom. What starts out as a one time mistake soon becomes a full-blown affair with a deadline; the day their children say 'I do'. But things rarely go according to plan.

linkffn(Isolation) is a bit slow, but is a very well-known fic in the pairing.
