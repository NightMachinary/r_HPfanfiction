:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember one of the chapters being from the perspective of Umbridge. She uses Crucio on Harry, Harry uses Crucio on her, she wakes up in the hospital wing with no evidence of what happened, and resigns out of fear. One chapter had Harry doing something to land Snape in the hospital wing, though no one knew it was him, and then visiting him to scare the guy shitless. Then there was a chapter from Hermione's perspective, where Harry tells her that she is the one he trusts to stop him, take him down if necessary, if he ever went too far.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
