Back in 2017 I stumbled upon this story unfortunately it's been discontinued, what got me hooked was the idea that Harry ended up traveling back in time and becoming Sirius during the Sirius's Fifth year at Hogwarts. I'd love to see what someone could do with a story like this, or at least the premise. Please and thank you.\\
