*** The thing I like most about this fic is that Daphne isn't portrayed as this goddess like how she's made out to be in most other fics.

She's slightly over-weight, prefers to walk around in sneakers and jeans and loves to laze on the couch.

My problem with it, though, was that it stayed so super-angsty. It's a relatively short story, all things considered, but at the halfway point (where I stopped reading) she had zero character progression.

**** Which I find incredibly ironic as the author fell into the same trap in linkffn(12484195) which reads very similar to the above. The same tropey sort of universe, with characters the reader doesn't relate to. An easy trap to fall into that this author seems to repeatedly fall into is not everything needs to progress the plot/arc.

One of my favorite things about [[/u/leadvone][u/leadvone]] in linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone) is he is not obsessed with arcs and plots and realizes sometimes the characters need to just be human. Take Chapter 36 for example, "Daphne Goes Down to the Village", has almost no relevance to the plots but just lets Daphne be Daphne. So often we get caught up in the details the story progression we forget it is just that: a story. We forget our characters have human wants and desires, whether it be shopping or flying on a broomstick. Those scenes make the story that much more believable and real.

***** I haven't read the author's other stories but I am not surprised. They seemed to be trying to get Harry to be some sort of wish fulfilment for them so it would be hard to change that.

Leadvone's Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is brilliant. Even though Harry is strong, the enemies are getting stronger too. Also, you're right about the characters. They're all believable and relatable, even the OC's. However, I struggled with it at the end as Leadvone writes the story from too many perspectives. There was too much time between anything happening and it starts to drag.

*** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord by Colt01)

I've read about 1/3 of this and would tell you its probably not worth a read. No real challenges for the MC and he is too damn OP. Also characters are flat, Daphne has nothing that makes her 'Daphne' and not just another name.
