** She appreciates his cheerful disposition. He treats her (and the people she loves) with kindness and respect. They have similar life goals, or their marriage wouldn't have lasted and resulted in two well-adjusted children. Perhaps they have hobbies in common or a compatible sense of humor. Almost certainly he managed to treat her as a person rather than a sex object/possession. It's not all about looks.

** In addition to what others have said, Mr Delacour is most likely very resistant to her allure/nature, and Veelas must have appreciated strong willed males. He could also be a very powerful Wizard.

*** This always seemed weird to me. Veela presumably evolved their allure/nature to snag mates... and then they purposely snub everyone affected?

**** Positive scarcity is attractive, i guess.

I.e. in times where men were scarce (due to war, natural order of things, that sort of stuff) having the veela allure is quite a treat.

In times when there is quite an even split between male and female population having allure is kind of a burden, so they'd rather choose somoene without it?

Kind of like being on a chubby side was seen as attractive some time ago, or being pale, while nowadays it's tan and fitness that are perceived as more attractive.

** My personal headcanon is that Mr.Delacour is a Muggleborn and was the only one to treat Apolline with sincere kindness during their time at Beauxabatons

** He was actually born with only one leg. As a result his magic compensates one of the other appendages in his lower body.

Basically hes just got a magnum dong.

** Veela are gambling addicts by nature, liking games of chance and odds: it's a flaw like how humans can be arrogant. Whether they're good at it depends on the person, and even the goblins have learned not to gamble with veela (a pissed off, sore loser that can transform and hurl magical fire is not a good thing, even for them to handle).

In WW1, Fleur's grandfather, a French soldier, was saved by her grandmother and her flock, and nursed back to health. He had to play a game of poker for his freedom.

He lost after she got a royal flush over his flush. He soon came to love his new wife though, even though his wife he left behind in Paris believed him dead in the shelling that Fleur's grandmother saved him from (whether the "widowed " Mrs. Delacour and himself had a happy marriage is unknown).

Conversely, Fleur's muggleborn father actually won Apolline in a reversal of her mother's situation. He was captivated by her, and (amusingly) she liked him too because he was interesting/eccentric for the time.

So, yup. Instead of roasting his magical balls off and skewering him with her talons, they married (since his "winning her" actually gained the approval of her flock), fell in love, and had Fleur and Gabrielle.

Now, I'm wondering if history would repeat itself with Fleur or (an older) Gabrielle.

Harry? Bill? Set-up's there.
