**** Literally mustache-twirlingly evil Snidely Whiplash!Dumbledore was pretty funny. As was Luna being related to a bunch of believed-to-be-fictional characters. And Dunbledore being constantly poisoned with Malaclaw venom.

There's a dozen or more things in the fic that I can point at individually and see "that's actually pretty funny" or "that's a cool idea". That's Lionheart's greatest sin, he takes a bunch of cool ideas and ruins them with rape and misogyny and more rape and long tangents directly from the author's own mouth and still more rape and protagonist-centered morality and even more rape and plagiarism. And, and let's not forget all the rape.

***** Yep, it's this. Starts with Sanders, then I think Dumbledore's intelligence network comes up with the other characters
