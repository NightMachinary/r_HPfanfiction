Finished reading linkffn(11752324) and loved the take on a different Voldemort. Am looking for more stories with a more human Voldemort, doesn't have to be female but I would prefer it. And hopefully well done. Over 100k wording and hopefully finished.

Thank you!

Edit; I should have said no slash in my original post. But thank you!


** Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has my favorite Voldemort. He feels very human, a person instead of the evil faceless villain who only likes to torture people for no reason (why would anyone follow him when all he does is inspire fear into people and torture everyone?). The society that he built after he won even tends to work fairly well, most people have perfectly normal happy lives and he makes a decent leader and revolutionary that you can understand people following.

He is still a psychopath with no sense of morality, but also a lot more and it makes perfect sense in the fic for Harry to continue to be his friend/protege/student even though Harry is still entirely good. It's not finished, but there are 6 completed books in this series which do have a lot resolved story arcs even if a few main ones are incomplete.

No slash. There is a very minor OC background gay couple, but they are very rarely mentioned.

*** I recently finished Prince of the Dark Kingdom and absolutely loved the portrayal of Voldemort. The world building is fantastic and I adored Harry as well. I don't think I've ever been quite so sad that a fic was unfinished.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** I second Limpieza de Sangre. Amazing story.

Start with these. Athey's are excellent. Do note that, while she's written a shitload of stories, she's never finished them.
