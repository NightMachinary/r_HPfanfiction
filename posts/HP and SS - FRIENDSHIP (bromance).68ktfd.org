Are there any fics where Harry and Snape become real friends? Preferably posthogwarts (or nevermind). I'd like to see them joking, laughing and spending time together. It can become even slash though I want a big part of friendship.

I remember "Until proven" by Tira Nog. I liked it.


** linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) has a fantastic Harry/Snape friendship. Probably the most steadily developed and realistic one that I've seen. It's also nice that it didn't fall into the usual tropes of Mentor or lovers like most fanfiction. Not slash.

linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl) This has Harry and Snape bonding through ptsd after the war. It's slash. Very good.

linkao3(Stillllife by pir8fancier) also has a friendship and it develops quite uniquely into a romance. Slash.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)

  The war has ended. Snape is supposed to be dead. He's not.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Possibly this one, which is Snape/Harry but takes a while to get around to it, linkao3(1130477).

Harry, Ron, and Hermione invest in a magical antiques business, and they hire Snape to help them identify and restore pieces. Harry is married to Ginny at the beginning, but the marriage ends during the course of the fic, and Harry starts hanging out with Snape. There's a warm friendship vibe among the Trio, and Snape is mellower but not utterly unrecognizable.

** The closest I've read was [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1348][A Place for Warriors]]. In that story, Harry and Snape become friendly in the canon setting, however their friendship is not as warm as what you are looking for.

In addition to the other suggestions in the thread, you also can browse fics at Potions and Snitches within the [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=21][Comrades Snape and Harry]] category to see if anything tickles your fancy there. All the fics listed will be Gen (no slash).
