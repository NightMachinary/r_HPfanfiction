My all time favorite pairing is rumored to be dwindling to nothing...thoughts?


** Well, before the last couple of books, people were hoping that Draco would finally get his whole redemption arc (or that he would reveal the greatness behind the pallid exterior).

Unfortunately it turned out that he /really/ /is/ a snivelling cowardly murder-attempting cockroach. And the epilogue cemented the pairings - for canon zealots anyway.

So most dramione fans have moved to Scorpius.

  Hermione is sick and tired of a loveless marriage. She sick of being boring and dependable. What happens when she decides to take on a younger man? Will she eat him alive or will he show her what it's like to be loved and adored?

** I routinely see concerns in dramione groups that the pairing is dying, and, though it may not have as many people writing in it as it did 10 years ago, it's still a very active and popular pairing. I don't think it's in any danger of lacking new material any time soon. The drama last week as one popular writer decIded to remove her work has exacerbated the perennial wailing on the subject (including leading to accusations she's helping destroy the pairing and a comment that anyone removes her work is a traitor to the fandom. I know. Try not to let your eyes roll of your head at the hyperbole.) I wouldn't pay any of it any heed.

** Sure, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but despite the epilogue, it's still my favourite pairing, and it is still out there... it's not like it's completely fallen off the planet! I never use ff.net, and I rarely use AO3 for HP fanfiction, so I can't comment on the situation there.

But. I do check Dramione.org regularly, and it is still fairly active with new posts. I don't know where you are looking... I also prefer to go to Dramione.org because everybody there LIKES Dramione. You don't need to deal with any pairing bashing or whatnot.

Edit: Grammer.

** I don't think so, at least it doesn't seem to be dropping off any ore than any other high profile pairing.

It does cop a pasting though - the GE survivors page on Facebook recently posted an article about how much bashing there was of the pairing, leading to some Dramione authors to delete works or take them off public forums.

** I suspect it's suffer from many of the same problems that other pairings do - what is there really left to explore with their characters? At their core, neither of them are really that interesting, so you either used them as stand in for other characters, or you start adding attributes to them to make them appealing. And still, there's not really much to write about them that isn't just retreating the same old tropes, and when that's the case, what's really the point?

  Draco fell in love with Hermione, but it was already too late. When a contraption of Dumbledoor sets Draco back in time to hisfirst year of Hogwarts with no memeories of the future but all the feelings and love felt towards Hermione from his future self, how will he do things the second time around. Much better than the summary. A time travel story with a twist, Draco Edition.
