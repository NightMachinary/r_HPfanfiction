Ok, I got a trip soon, and they got spotty WiFi, so I need to start loading up on fics soon. I'm looking for the best crossover fics you've got. Fandoms I'd like it to be is either: Supernatural, Avengers/Marvel, or Sherlock, crossword over with Harry Potter. It doesn't need to be all of those in the same fic, that'd be too much. Or just anyone of those crossed over with any of those really, if you have it, but I mainly would like HP crossed with one of those. Also, Marauder era fics are always good, especially them doing pranks.

A quick note, if you can find a fic where the avengers/TFW go to Hogwarts as they are, not like an AU, but them themselves, that'd be absolutely amazing. Preferably complete or are a WIP; also would be nice if they were a decent bit in, but that doesn't matter as much.


** Linkao3(Say a prayer by mad_fairy)

Harry adopted by Loki, somewhat decent Diary Tom, a clueless Hermione and a school club that turns into a multinational space and planetary colonization program. SHIELD is mad at wizards and Magneto likes what they're doing.

  During the summer between first and second year Harry does something that has unexpected consequences, for himself and for the wizarding world.
