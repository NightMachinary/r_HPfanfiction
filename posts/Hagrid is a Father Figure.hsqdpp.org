I want some fics that flesh out Hagrid being a caring adult figure in Harry's life. Hagrid, who brought Harry cake for his birthday. Hagrid, who made sure Harry had food before worrying about the letter. Hagrid, who bought Harry his owl AND used her to send Harry a letter, inviting him for tea. Hagrid, who invites Harry to come talk about his time at school. Like, that relationship could've been soo much more evolved in the books. I'd love to see some fics with it.
