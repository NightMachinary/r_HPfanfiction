I would honestly like to ask if there are guys who read fanfics. I would love to know their feedback of SenLinYu's Manacled but since it's a Draco/Hermione pairing, I'm not sure they're inclined reading it. In other news, please comment fics that you likeðŸ˜„


** Here is the [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] 2019 survey:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6p4xj/hp_fanfiction_subreddit_survey_2019/]]

TL;DR this sub is 59% male.

So if you see a fanfic recommended/discussed on this sub-reddit, on the balance of probabilities it has been recommended by a guy.

I know lots of people don't consider that representative of the HP fandom at large, but I am not so convinced. Certainly "back in the day" the HP fandom was dominated by women. You had to wade through 20 slash fics to find a single het fic when browsing FF.Net, and those fics will almost entirely have been written and read by women.

It's been a long time since the fandom was like that, however. There was a significant exodus to Twilight in the years after the publication of DH, and most of that migration will have been women. The traditional HP fanfic communities like livejournal where women were dominant have almost entirely died out, and nothing seems to have replaced them (except, to a much lesser extent, tumblr), which suggests to me that the demand is no longer there. These days you browse newly published fics and instead of wading through slash, you're wading through bashing and indy!Harry powerwank fics. The two most active fanfiction communities remaining are this subreddit and DLP, both of them male dominated.

In short: my general impression of the fandom is that a lot of women have departed it for other fandoms, whereas a higher proportion of men have remained interested in HP, resulting in a fandom which is now, if anything, male dominated.

*** I think you havent actually browse through new Harry Potter fanfics in a while. Right now on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] on first page without any filter (except at least 20k words, any rating and written in English) there are at least 16 slash fictions... out of 25. Harry/Draco, Harry/whoever is fine but some of them are Harry/Snape or even Harry/Voldy, that's a bit much for me...

Anyway its my habit to browse new fanfics everyfew days in hope something will catch my eyes(it rarely happens).

And reddit survey is about reddit not fanfiction in general. that's just how many people use from this subreddit and whats their gender. actual fanfiction numbers can be vastly different.

*** The Facebook hp fanfic groups seem to be populated almost entirely by women, judging by names and profile pics. They're almost entirely romance. I never see any Indy!Harry powerwank tropes. They post lots of slash, and shout down the occasional gay man who tries to say that these unrealistic slash stories fetishizing gay men for women's enjoyment are pretty creepy.

** Has dramonie ever been a male thing?I thought it was mostly for school girls.

I think readers for Harry/Tonks,Harry/Fleur are probably mostly male. Though I can't understand why Harry is paired with Fleur instead of her sister.Does it mean the readers like Harry paired with a mature woman better? I am quite confused. I thought male readers preferred it when the male protagonist is paired with a younger woman.

Harry/Ginny may not be as male-dominated as Harry/Tonks,Harry/Fleur.

The fact that slash is female-dominated always baffles me. What are female readers and writers looking for in a slash pairing?I understand why girls like Draco/Hermione but I can't figure out why girls like Draco/Harry.

*** On the Harry/Fleur pairing 3 years isn't that much of a big deal to be with a "supermodel". At the same time Gabrielle is described as a little girl of 8 (one that is very cute and would grow up to be beautiful). So I think that initially drives those fics. Eg using the canon descriptions it is much more likely for the author to pair Harry with an adult versus a little girl 6 years his junior.

Now there are a lot of fics that do pair Harry with Gabrielle (and many that pair both with Harry) but they typically use the story line that as a protective measure Veela don't physically mature until they are mentally able to handle their powers. Therefore, until they hit their mental maturity they look like little girls (eg they may be 13 but they look like they are 8). Once they hit this mental Maturity they rapidly physically mature into beautiful women with the allure.

Which of course causes problems for them in keeping non veela friends as those friends keep "growing up" and the veela stay a little girl. Who then suddenly becomes this beautiful young woman with an allure that makes men "stupid".

In terms of slash, I think that is really just a gender thing. Pretty much ask any straight guy and most would say that they could completely understand two girls getting together sexually but don't understand guys doing the same. Ask any straight girl and they would say the opposite eg they could understand two guys getting together sexually but not two girls (though I would bet that there would be a higher percentage of straight girls understanding two girls together than straight guys understanding two guys getting together).

As far as the Dramione story line not being embraced by guys as much as girls IMO it is a combination of real life as well as "karmic justice". In real life many guys have seen girls take up with guys who are absolutely wrong for them if not abusive without being really able to do anything to help them get away etc. With the concept that it is exceedingly rare for a guy to completely turn himself around (eg once a low life slime, alwaysca lowlife slime). Whereas girls often believe that the can change a guys fundamental behavior.

That's what probably causes guys to not understand Hermione (even with all of her faults) ever hooking up with Draco.

As far as "karmic justice) most guys have a good handle on punishment for wrong doing (especially if someone they don't like is doing the wrong). And many didn't like the Malfoys getting away with their crimes. Most believe that Lucius should have been executed or at a minimum thrown into Azkaban for life. The same for Draco.

Using canon besides being a douche due to his bullying behavior Draco should have been charged with recklass endangerment for conjuring a poisonous snake that attempted to attack a classmate, at least two counts of attempted murder (katie bell cursed necklace, Ron Weasley poisoned wine), conspiracy to commit murder, committing a murder (if you're assisting with a murder even though you don't kill the person yourself you are still held responsible for that death), and treason for attempting to violently overthrow the government. (Lots of other charges could be brought).

So most guys would not want to see Draco rewarded and "getting the girl". Now we all know that every fanfiction is AU (if it wasn't it would just be copying the books and that would get you in trouble). However, the opinions and thoughts that you had concerning the characters and their actions in canon will often drive you to the fics that support those beliefs.

Now that's not to say that you would never read a story that goes against those beliefs. But I would be willing to bet that the majority of stories that you like are ones that support your beliefs that you developed reading canon.

(Sorry for writing a novel as a reply)

*** Generally, straight women like male slash romance for the same reason straight men like lesbian porn.

** There are certainly guys who read fanfics, me being one of them. I'm generally disinclined toward Dramione though.
