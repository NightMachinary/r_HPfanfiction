I've exhausted all my old favourites and I'm hoping to find something new to read. Any recommendations?


** Well, there's a thing that /looks/ like it but might or might not actually be it to be found in “Biting the Hand That Feeds You” (linkffn(10287864)). Also features swiss cheese law, squib loremasters, godfathers with their addictive substance enterprises, and potatoes as money.

Alas, I have nothing more as I'm not someone reading things for pairings (most things planned from the beginning to end with a certain pairing as the only thing that matters taste like plastic to me), but what I could give give I did.

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

  COMPLETE. As the unintended Captain of the most despised Auror squad, can Draco Malfoy lead his band of Slytherins through Death Eater attacks and threats from the Ministry? Definitely not. At least, not without the help of his reluctant Lieutenant: Ginny Weasley. Inconveniently, the last person he'd ever ask.

  Who you are, whom you love, and where your loyalties lie - Ginny Weasley had never thought all of that could change as a result of a single night. Her postponed wedding to Harry following a Death Eater prison break was supposed to be a mere set back to the life she'd always dreamed of. But driven by anger and pride, she makes a fateful decision that will upend her entire life.

Draco and Ginny have been seeing each other on the sly for months when something unexpected happens. Now they have to tell their families. Beat downs, an evil grandmother, muscle cars, Scooby boxer shorts and rednecks figure predominately in this amusing parody/AU fic.

** linkffn(12062984) is a new WIP by Tiny Q. She used to be really active in the D/G side of fandom and just recently came back to writing. So far it's really well written with a pretty interesting plot. I would check out her earlier fics too but just keep in mind they're a bit dated.

  It's been just over ten years since the Battle of Hogwarts. Society has moved on but not in the utopic way everyone assumed it would. For Ginny Weasley, however, everything is going great until a season-ending fall derails her Quidditch career and forces her to reevaluate her life. It also forces her to realize that there's more to Draco Malfoy than she ever thought...

** Let me preface what I'm about to say with the following caveats:

1) people should enjoy whatever they want to in fanfic. If you like super Harry or AU where Sirius lives, that's awesome. 2) I'm a firm Harry/Ginny reader and don't like anything that pairs them with someone else unless they wind up together in the end. 3) I've only read one Draco/Ginny and it was by accident and I stopped once I realized what was going on, even though the story was well-written.

I'm biased and haven't read enough to make definitive statements, but just am going based on personal feelings.

So with that said, I just don't get the appeal of Ginny/Draco or Ginny/any evil Slytherin (I suppose there are good Slytherins in canon that Rowling just never mentioned.

It seems pairing Ginny with Draco goes so against character for both of them, especially Ginny, that I'm not even reading a Ginny or Draco story, but rather a story about a relationship with two original characters that happen to be named Ginny and Draco.

For me, a pairing can only work if it makes sense based on how Rowling characterized the couple. So while I am not a Harry/Hermione fan either, a fic that pairs them wouldn't need to change much about the core of the characters to work. Same with Ginny/Neville or Luna/Harry, etc.

I know a lot of readers like Draco and have no qualms about pairing him with Hermione or another "good" person (that is someone written to be on the right side of things), but in doing so they make Draco someone he isn't. Draco was not a good person in the books; in fact he was fairly evil and cruel, even until the end. I have read some fics that had Hermione/Draco and I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

In my mind, it does more to diminish the goodness of the "good" character than make the "bad" character more likable and "good."

But again, this is just my biased and personal opinion; no one should have to feel they need to justify their enjoyment of the pairing. It's great if you enjoy these fics. I enjoy angsty Harry/Ginny fics that others can't stand so who am I to judge?

I don't disagree that he was fairly evil and cruel. But I doubt he would have married and had a child with Astoria Greengrass, whom JK herself noted to harbor more lenient views on Muggleborns and half-bloods much to his mother's distaste, if he was truly Grindelwald incarnate. So I do believe he has /some/ redeemable qualities.

**** He likely softened a bit, yes, and by Cursed Child seemed like a decent enough guy. So while I still have no desire to read it, a story set way after the events of the books, when everyone is well into their thirties, could conceivably make sense to have them paired off. But still, the stories that take place during the events of the 7 books or immediately after require us to suspend our disbelief and view these characters as significantly different than they were in the books.
