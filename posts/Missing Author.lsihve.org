I read a fan fiction called Paper Birds by TooTiredToFucntion. I checked the next day for any updates but I realized that the last update was 4 years ago. All their stories have not been updated since 2017. The story was on Archive of our own. They didn't leave any notes saying they were going to leave the story behind or anything so does anyone know what happened to them? They might have just moved on with their life, I was just curious.


** I'm trying to find any evidence of this author on ao3 and there's nothing. It's a mystery and I want to solve it!

*** Thank you! I didn't think anyone was going to see this. Another thing was that someone said something about only reading completed fics. The author replied saying that they felt sad when they saw abandoned fics and was going to make sure to finish it.

**** I found their ao3 profile, and the other social media links associated with that account are either abandoned or disabled. I'm really intrigued and have been trying to find anything else that might hint at who they are and where they went. ðŸ¤”
