Here's what I remember about it:

- Harry takes care of the kid of a deceased friend / auror partner. The kid still has a relative and lives with them but Harry takes him out to eat or play.
- Harry's part in the child's life is a secret due to Harry being Harry and bad guys being bad guys.
- Ginny hasn't talked to Harry in years. They meet at some point and they try to rebuild their relationship.
- At some point bad guys kidnap the kid or try to do it. There's a funfair somewhere.
- Novel length
- Old, probably before HBP or even OotP.

Thanks!


** I'm pretty sure that the fic you're looking for is The Test of Time by Alchemilla.

It's a pretty good fic but Harry and Ginny do take turns holding the idiot ball in this story.

*** That's it! Thank you so much, it has been bothering for weeks. I even skipped over it in the Sugar Quill but the summary didn't look like what I was looking for.

**** You're welcome! I got all nostalgic when I was searching for this fic on sugar quill. SQ had a pretty high standard for a FF site and their stories kept me going during the long break between GoF and OoTP.

** Some of the details are different, but could it possibly be Lessons for Life? This was one of my old favorites. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=106&chapno=1]]

*** It's not Lessons for Life but you're right that some of the details are similar and I'm probably confusing them a bit in my mind. I'm pretty sure about the whole "Harry secretly takes care of the son of a deceased auror partner" thing though.
