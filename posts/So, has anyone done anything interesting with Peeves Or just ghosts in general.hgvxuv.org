So, I've been nerding out about different types of beliefs in spirits, shades, ghosts, and ghoulies recently, and I'm now wondering if anyone has done anything interesting with that sort of thing in HP fanfiction. I'm not looking for vamps or zombies, just non-corporeal stuff like the ghosts and shades and such. It can play a large part in the story or a small one or somewhere in between (eg. The Geist in The Lie I've Lived), I don't mind, I'm just looking for anything interesting. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

*** This sounds familiar. Is the Harem particularly porny, and can I skip those scenes if it is? (I'm ace and I find sex scenes as dull as football, and I fell asleep at the last football match I went to).

** So, I'm writing a fic that deals heavily with how Peeves comes to Hogwarts, and is also quite ghost focused.

The downside? I'm four chapters in, and none of that has happened yet! At my posting schedule (a chapter every two weeks), it'll be a few months before I get to that according to my outline. But if you're still interested, check it out here (or set a remind me bot, I guess.)

Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** This doesn't address beliefs in the spirits, but in one of the later chapters of linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) (around 30-32, IIRC), Peeves is a villain. And, I think it was in [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise over Britain]] by Bobmin (sequel to Sunset over Britain, and a site login is probably needed for both of them) that Harry uses Peeves as a saboteur.

*** For the Wand and Shield one, do I need to know anything about Avengers?

And ah, Bobmin. His stuff is classic. And yeah, if it's on Fanficauthors, it needs a log-in. I have one though. :)

**** Actually, I think if it's on fanficauthors /and/ is rated mature, it needs a login. I don't think the stories not rated mature require one.

As for having to know Avengers - it's likely to help, but I think there's probably enough to get by in the story itself. It's been quite some time since I've read Wand and Shield, though, and I started reading Marvel comics in the 1960s (and stopped in the 1970s), so I already had sufficient background information. Then again, if you've seen the movie previews, you'll likely have enough background information.

***** Ah, okay. I've literally just seen the original Avengers movie when it came out and Logan a little while back, so I know basically nothing beyond 'The characters exist and fight things' and the occasional vague snippet of spoiler stuff or memes I've run into online. I never really got into superheroes. I did enjoy Finding Home [link below] and that gave me a basic idea of who everyone was, but yeah, my knowledge is definitely not deep. I probably know more about Harry Potter and I haven't read the books since Deathly Hallows came out. :D
