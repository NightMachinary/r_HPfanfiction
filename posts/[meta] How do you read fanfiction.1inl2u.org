How do you or most people you know who read fanfiction? I don't really talk about it much with other people IRL and wondered how you guys read your fanfictions.

I used to just read them exclusively on the computer, but now I read them on my smartphone just on the web browser on my android. I've also printed one out before when I got tired of looking at my screen, but that was a lot of paper.

** I read them on my computer. If I really like a fanfiction, I will cut and paste the whole thing into a word doc.

I used to print them out when I was younger and didn't have a computer in my room. I would paste the whole story into a word doc and print sixteen pages of text on each page. It was totally readable.

** I used to print them but it's such a waste of paper and there's no control over font size right off the webpage. If I like a piece enough to keep it, I will save it as a PDF or EPUB using [[http://www.flagfic.com][flagfic]], and then read it on my Nook viewer on my smartphone.

** I mostly read them on my computer in the comfort of my room. I tried reading them on my phone but I get annoyed with how often I have to scroll. I also have an e-reader, so I will take my favorite stories and put them on my nook so I can read in public. To anyone else it looks like I'm reading a normal book.

**** I use epub (or if not available pdf). AO3 has a direct link for downloading a piece of work and for fanfiction.net stories I use [[https://www.flagfic.com/]]. If the story of interest comes from somewhere else I'll copy/paste it into word and then save the document as a PDF.

**** Depends on the e-reader, find the format and use a grabber or converter and upload the file. The only one it takes a bit on is the new Kindle Fire, I used to be ble to upload right to it but you need to tweak it and its easier to upload a PDF and read it that way than have to convert it to the kindle fire friendly format, if I'm feeling really lazy. I tend to do a whole batch at a time for e-readers.

** I primarily read on my iPad or iPhone these days, but used to read on my laptop a lot.

It depends on the site but for FFN I use flagfic fanfiction downloaded to grab the whole thing (if it is a longer than a few chapters or 10k words) and read it in the kindle app as a mobi. If I'm reading a story on archiveofourown they have a button on the top of every story to download in any format and it's two clicks to open in the kindle app. I've seen a lot of stories get pulled so I like downloading them.

Most folks like my husband know I read fic. I have friends I trade recs with and although I take a lot of flack from my husband for the fandoms I read he doesn't much care.

** I primarily read on the computer. I occasionally use my phone when I'm out, but only ever for short fics because I'm usually just trying to kill 10 minutes waiting for something. I download and save my favourites, so I can put them on my Sony Reader and re-read them whenever takes my fancy. (Also, saving fics means I have a copy in the event they're ever removed from the net.)

** I usually read fanfiction on my computer, but I've recently started reading fanfic on my tablet. It's better than using the smaller screen of my phone, but it's much more comfortable than using my laptop in my bed. The only issue I have is that some sites don't have good mobile versions. I love it when fanfics are available as PDF or EPUB.

** I read them on my ipod. The computerscreen is just too big for me. I've mentioned in passing to my friends that I read HPfanfiction, but we don't talk about it much. They read other fanfoms anyway. My sister is the one that knows the most, she sometimes asks me to recommend some fics. She also knows I've written and published at least one fic, but she hasn't read them. I'm thinking of recommending one of them next time she asks, but I will never show it myself. I love the anonimity of fanfiction and would love to keep it that way
