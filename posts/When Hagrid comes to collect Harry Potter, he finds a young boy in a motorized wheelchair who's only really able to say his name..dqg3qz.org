Because sometimes surviving a Killing Curse to the head can have some unfortunate consequences.

Basically, this idea started with me thinking about all those "secret genius" Harry Potter fics out there, and I kinda wanted to turn the concept on it's head. Then I decided to take it to an exaggerated extreme, partly because I'm a terrible person, and partly because it amused me. Yes I know I'm going to Hell, I've known for a while now.

Not exactly what you're looking for. No Hagrid, but there is a severely disabled Harry.

There's at least one story where Harry is blind, but it's more smart Harry.

** I know there is a story out there where Harry isn't disabled but he is a squib and still goes to Hogwarts, it was a short fanfic and I don't remember the name but it was a good read.
