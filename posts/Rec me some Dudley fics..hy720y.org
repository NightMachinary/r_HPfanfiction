I'm in the mood for some fics with Dudley Dursley in.

I'll take anything - magical, the year he spent in hiding, his child goes to Hogwarts, the gradual change after the dementors, how he ended up in a gang, what he does after the war or how he explains his cousin to his wife. Maybe someone takes in Dudley and Harry under the (false) belief they get along. Anything at all.

I've read a few fics already, but can't remember their names off the top of my head.


** If I can post a self rec, I'm still pretty happy with linkao3(this calls for a toast so pour the champagne). It's a Dudley centric fic after deathly hallows where some events happen at Harry's wedding that lead to him really reassessing his life and his relationship to his family.

For fics I have less of a vested interest in, I'm a huge fan of linkao3(aunt Marge's even bigger mistake), which is kind of the opposite premise of Harry and Ginny going to /Dudley's/ wedding. Harry and Ginny are the focus but I really love the take on Dudley in the fic, who's trying his best but will probably never really get it.

Also a huge fan of linkao3(cousin harry) and it's sequel, which both deal really well with an adult Harry and Dudley trying to repair their relationship. The first is from Dudley's perspective, the second is from Harry's.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

** I have ePub of rather good story (meanwhile removed from everywhere on the Net) “Dudley Dursley and the New Normal” by alikat522, where Dudley post-war has rather harsh experience with the magical world. Rather good. Actually, the original original is on [[https://dudley-redeemed.dreamwidth.org/729.html]]

** linkffn(4172226) is a really good one. It is Dudley centric and has\\
him grow up and realise things about his parent's treatment of Harry.

linkffn(9342732) with how much fics (and even the books) compared Draco and Dudley you don't see a lot of fics with them in it, so that's one reason why I really like this. This is a post-epilogue story with a mix of redemption, reconciliation, and a mystery case.

linkffn(8369495) Takes place after the Dementor attack and how it affected Dudley and his character

linkffn(4030448) I'mm be honest, don't remember exact details of this one, but I'm usually picky with that I save so it had to be at least reasonable good. More character growth aided by a good adult role model.

*** Thanks for these links. I've saved 'A Hero' properly this time and have now read 'Dudley's Tale' for the first time, I enjoyed Draco and Dudley's friendship. Plus, it was interesting how the rest of the story tied together.

Now to keep working my way down the list.

  The life of Dudley Dursley and his family as he gets pulled back into the wizarding world years after he thought he was done with it. Mostly epilogue compliant. There will be references to alcoholism and implied romance, hence the T rating. The disclaimer: I own nothing but the characters I have created for this story. Everything else belongs to JK Rowling.

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.
