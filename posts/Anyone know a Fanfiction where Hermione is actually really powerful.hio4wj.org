  Hermione Granger returned to England after years abroad. Of course things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione didn't know just how much she was still changing. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it was downright dangerous, but at least she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another person. The question is will she be able to choose her life partner or will it be out of her hands? I posted this story on Granger Enchanted back in 2014. Thank you so much to bunnyhops for all of her lovely beta work back in the day. She rocks!This is a Hermione/Multiple Wizard story, so if that isn't your cup of tea, feel free to skip this story. As a heads up, all the wizards are Slytherin!I like to create photo collages as I write to help create a visual for the scene or chapter. I've created a folder of photos for this story on my Flickr page (MissFantastic) in case you want to see what I envision. Of course, feel free to use your own imaginations as well!
