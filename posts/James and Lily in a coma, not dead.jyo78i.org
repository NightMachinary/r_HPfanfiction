Can anyone help me find a fic I vaugely remember (or anything like it). Basically, James and Lily aren't dead. They're in a magical coma so Harry still ends up at the Dursleys. I think the Wizards have told the Dursleys they're dead, or that there's no hope of recovery, because the Dursleys still treat Harry like they did in canon. Then James and Lily wake up and obviously go to get Harry and there is Serious Retribution.

I don't mind if it's not the exact one I read before, I just want to see Lily giving Petunia what she deserves. Does anyone know of anything like this?


** Not quite a coma, but how about magical stasis?

***** Well, I vaugely remember reading something with that plot years ago, and wouldn't mind finding it again, but will happily read anything that's based around the premise that J&L weren't dead and when they wake up from their coma or whatever they are super pissed off with the Dursleys.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I'm not sure if I know the fic you're talking about exactly, but A Different Beginning has something like it: linkffn(4489910)

Lily ends up in a coma, James hands Harry off to the Dursleys to be able to take care of his wife. When there's nothing more that can be done (2 years later), he comes back for Harry.

Sadly, the Dursleys don't get much more than a telling-off and a punch in the face from what I remember.
