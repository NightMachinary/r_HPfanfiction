So, everything is in title. It's not necessarily has to be a crack story.

  Reborn after my embarrassing fall at Godric's Hollow as the Potter brat was an interesting experience. Getting sorted into Hufflepuff, even more so. But reborn as the Lord of Winterfell in Westeros as my playground? Now that was new, even to a retired Dark Lord.

** Not directly in Harry's body, but as his brother: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853), would have been really good if it were not for that weird and creepy Tonks romance.

*** I'm glad someone agrees with me. I really liked everything Voldemort did, but the scene where 18-year-old Tonks needs to convince her parents that a 12-year-old truly loves her was bizarre.

**** Personally I think it's a portrayal and deconstruction of the Soul-Bond sub-genre. Notably because when they first touched and their 'soul bond was established' in Voldemorts words, he was actually just sapping her with a bit of wandless magic and then played it off as being a soul bond.

And I think it's telling that no-where in the rest of that fic this is verified, or even proven that soul-bonds exist. It's entirely Voldemorts manipulation in an Machiavellian attempt to romantically isolate, and then engange with, Tonks.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.

** Hmm...I remember a serious story where the horcrux in Harry's head keeps trying to take over his body and make him hurt himself; the bits I remember are that muggle drugs are apparently effective at slowing it down, Harry is given Draught of Living Death to keep him asleep while Flamel works on how to remove the horcrux, and the horcrux manifests in Harry's mind as some kind of creepy, half-rotted away baby thing.

And I remember a cracky story where Voldemort sends himself on vacation using a spell that sends him away and lets the nearest horcrux take over his body...unfortunately, that horcrux ends up being Harry, who wreaks merry havoc on the Death Eaters.

But I don't remember what either of these fics are called or where to find them. Sorry. Does anyone else know?

Addendum: Found them! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis][Psychosis is the serious one]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7447454/1/][The Dark Lord's Much Needed Vacation is the silly one]].
