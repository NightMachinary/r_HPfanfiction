:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic I read sometime ago. I cant remember very much of what happens but I do remember is Harry is at the Weasleys with both Ron and Hermoine. When Albus and Mad-eye show up and pretty much drag him to Malfoy Manor where he is handed over in exchange for a sack of gold. His friends tried stopping the adults from taking him and Mad-eye hits Harry because he wasn't complacent about going. I also don't know if this was exclusively on Wattpad or Fanfiction.net but any help would be welcomed.


** That sounds wild.
