My friends find it strange... but i just love stories where the main character is... well, cold. Not trusting others easily, cold blooded, hardened soldier, lack of emotion, heartless assasin, etc.

I don't discriminate between post or pre Hogwarts, Time Travel, dimension travel, crossovers.

Anything you might recommend?


** Harry isn't totally heartless in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] linkao3(5103614), but he's close.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
