Instead of having Harry and co look for them. Dumbledore uses the group of fully grown. And highly trained wizards and Witches to find Voldemort's horcruxs.


** I want to read this story and I feel very put out that none of us have written it (I say us because I totally could have lmao and I just...haven't!, even though I'm always griping about Albus sitting on the knowledge for a decade)

** Cool. Then one person in the Order betrays Dumbledore (willingly or under torture/truth potion), tells Voldy they're after the Horcruxes. Voldy gathers all of the Horcruxes up and guards them personally, forever.

*** That honestly sounds like it would make things easier, just one place to assault and get them all, I bet Dumbledore could whip up some fiendfyre.

*** Yes, of course! How did we ever forget that the trio are immune to torture and the truth potion? That was the entire reason they were chosen after all! Not plot induced stupidity! /s

Honestly, having a two or three (not all) capable and trustworthy Order members responsible for the horcrux hunt would be far more sensible. These were people who were trusted to provide security for Harry too; if they were to betray Harry as supposed here, the canon plot collapses.
