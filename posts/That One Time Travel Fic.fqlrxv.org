:END:
I lowkey can't remember if it was time-travel and It probably wasn't but there was a specific part where Sirius pretends to be Arthur to try and find out Where Harry is. He infiltrates a meeting but is found out by Moody when he properly pronounces "Telephone"


** I feel a sudden bout of pity for the person trying to go up against MOODY,
