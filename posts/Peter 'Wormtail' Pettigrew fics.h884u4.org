Any fics where he is a major character rather than just an occasional threat? He can redeem himself or remain an evil butt, either is fine. POV is preferred, but I'll take anything; my only requirement is that he really did betray his friends as he did in canon.

Have a good day!


** linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) seems like the most obvious

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
