Are there any fics that play the Manipulative Dumbledore sympathetically? Like he's fully aware that what he's doing is not okay and is being consumed with the guilt, but does it nonetheless.

It would probably work best as a one shot, but I'll take what I can get.


** Canon! :)

*** That´s just it, I don´t get the downvote on this one, you cannot deny that Dumbledore was manipulative and that his plan was messed up, but that was the only solution he saw, does this make his actions right? Do the ends justify the means? He is a complicated character and just describing him as an evil monster doesn´t do him justice.

** That one story where he writes the book about using power then dies because the ministry didn't release him from all his oaths.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has a very manipulative Dumbledore who forges ahead despite feeling guilty. [[/spoiler][For example, he manipulated Hermione's resistance group into working with him, while using her group to exert pressure on the Ministry and 'neutral' Wizengamot members; or in Aberforth's words, using child soldiers as his killer squad. Albus didn't like this at all.]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12025821/1/The-Unbroken-Saviour][The Unbroken Saviour]] by ElegantlyDone could be one. I said could because Dumbledore in this story feels guilt about something that did not happen yet. When he finds out and tries to work out why. It's a time travel fic where Harry travels to the Marauder's Era. He's closer to Harry in this one as well as more protective rather than manipulative.

** Remembrall is a very short one-shot but the Dumbledore there fits perfectly in your request, it´s kinda dark and sad. One of my favourite one-shot´s. linkffn(6070977)
