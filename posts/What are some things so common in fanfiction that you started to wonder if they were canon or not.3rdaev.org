We don't know who she hung out with, who she dated, who she looked up to and so on and so forth (at least in the books. I really don't care about Pottermore).

The only thing we know is that she's pureblooded. So, the only thing requiring remarkable justification would be that she knows and maybe enjoys Muggle culture without being introduced to it during the story.

** Notice-me-not charm

Tracking charms

Point-me being able to aim at anything other than North

Albus doping his tray of candies

Obliviate working like a Neuralyzer from Men In Black

Here's one that takes some explaining; I recently wrote about a Quidditch match where the players were causing all sorts of harm to each other, and I got a bunch of reviews describing the play as excessively harsh and over-the-top.

Oh, really?

#+begin_quote
  Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.\\
  ‘Sorry!' said Flint, as the crowd below booed. ‘Sorry, didn't see her!' Next moment, Fred Weasley had chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  ‘Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no! -- Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the pitch -- THAT WAS DELIBERATE!' Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle, had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom but dropped the Quaffle.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  It was turning into the dirtiest match Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle.\\
  Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty--ten to Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded.
#+end_quote

And all that was just in the 3rd year final.

**** Well, they're not really /that/ easy to abuse from what I can tell. They're only useful on the unaware, because if somebody is looking for you specifically, the charm won't hold up under the scrutiny. I think a better name for them would be the 'distraction charm', because that's what they do; they distract you from the fact that the person under the charm is significant in any way. They still register your existence. They might even say "sorry" if they bump into you. However, if the searcher /knows/ you are significant, they won't be distracted. So, if you're the only person on the street, and the person you're following knows there shouldn't be anybody on the street at all, or if they're looking specifically for anybody who might be following them even if they are in a crowd, the charm will fail.

An absurdly powerful NMN might make them pass completely over you, but if you literally don't register a certain portion of the scenery and realize this fact, it's still not unbeatable.

Of course, as notice me not charms aren't canon in the first place, I'm probably just belching hot air.

****** Well... that's a good question, and I'm not sure I have a complete answer. I have seen the movies, so I am basically familiar with the canon material. A family member had been reading the books, and when the first movie came out, we all went to see it. I distinctly remember commenting when we walked out, that it felt like they were jamming way too much material into the time frame. "disjointed" was how i described it. I could definitely see why others liked them, but the movies were just so flawed to me. I also remembering thinking that Harry was useless. He bumbled his way through everything, everyone around him were the real heroes.

I really cannot remember how I first got into reading the fan fiction. For a very long time, the concept of fics in my mind, was about creating situations in which characters have sex with each other. To this day, when some one asks what I've been reading, I get super embarrassed to tell them its fan fiction, it feels like a stigma. Logically, I understand fan fiction is totally normal and awesome, but socially, if people are even aware of it, is to me, very very very very nerdy.

So, somehow, I ended up reading some fics. I think it helped that there is just so god damned many HP fics covering every idea you can think of that got me to overcome my aversion. What got me hooked completely was the controversial HPMOR. After that, I started to branch out and read fics for other series. My current favorite is OSABC, a Mass Effect AU, which is soooooooooo much better than canon.

The funniest I read recently was for "Ride to Hell: Retribution", a maligned video game. There is exactly one in existence on fanfiction.net, and it is very short. It just skewers the game.

As young as they manage to make him look in the meeting-with-Dumbledore flashback(s?), it's still not even close in terms of age. The illustrations in the book make it even more obvious. I've noticed that a lot of Snape-romance-centric fics also tend to say things like "After the stress of the second wizarding war was lifted, he almost looked younger," as an attempt to dispel the older appearance given by Alan Rickman.

I think it's totally okay for magic to solve non-magical problems like insomnia with zero negative consequences. That's the whole point - it's magic. The levitation charm doesn't punish you for breaking gravity, and the dreamless sleep potion shouldn't punish you for for curing your insomnia.

But then, to balance this out, there should be magical illnesses that you can't just fix with an easy potion or spell.

** This one isn't common, but I'm pretty sure it's canon. I'm copypasting the first one from another comment I wrote:

We never hear about people falling off the stairs. We never hear about those dementors accidentally kissing someone despite their obsession with wandering onto the grounds, and most of all /somehow/ the only people affected by a /basilisk/ were those looking at it indirectly.

With all the danger in Hogwarts, you'd expect that there'd be at least a couple of deaths, you'd think there'd be some kind of effect on the student body from the sheer quantity of danger that they get put in, but we don't. The only death we hear about is Myrtle's.

You remember those kids that just up and vanish after their sorting? People like Sally-Ann, Mandy Brocklehurst, Euan Abercrombie, Owen Cauldwell, Graham Pritchard, and Kevin Whitby? No?

/Neither do the students./

I'm not doing the best job at setting it up, but the idea is that the students mentioned above are dead. Their families and friends? Obliviated. Anyone who'd heard about them? Obliviated. Hogwarts is the safest place in Britain after all and we certainly can't have one mucking that up with silly things like a wrongful death suit. As I mentioned earlier, the only death we hear about is poor Moaning Myrtle's and that one left behind evidence that couldn't be obliviated, a ghost.

I've always kinda had this idea in the back of my mind since I read that part of the Seventh Horcrux where Harry kept talking about Sally-Anne falling off the stairs, but the fic that convinced me of it was Chapter 9 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/9/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen.]] (background of the story is fem!Harry disappearing at a young age) I'd suggest you read the rest of it first as the characters are /very/ AU, but the first quarter or so of Chapter 9 is all you really need to get the theory.

So, what do you think? Crackpot or not?

Other one I really like is that Aberforth's actually an unspeakable.

*** I think it's an interesting theory and I've enjoyed the stories that have explored it, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's canon. Just because we don't hear about them doesn't mean they're dead-there're plenty of reasons a student may not return to school. Just off the top of my head:

- Have to relocate because of their parents' jobs
- Family illness causes them to relocate
- Student falls ill
- Parents aren't happy with the curriculum/student population/professors/facilities/whatnot and decide to home school or transfer them
- Muggle parents change their mind about their child learning magic (there was a troll in school? A basilisk?? A professor died??etc)
- They are still attending school but we don't hear about them (there are "about 600" students at Hogwarts so that seems very possible)

Basically prefect Percy took points, 'Ron got it wrong', and prefects /can/ take points, but not from other prefects (apparently the confusion is caused by a mistake, addressed in reprintings).

What being in the squad of utter wrongness changed for Draco was not that he not could take points off, but that he could take them from other prefects.

Hermione was the one who'd said that he can't take points off of them because with normal prefect rules he couldn't. And Ron is the one who'd thought they can't at all because he was too lazy to actually bother with checking the rules.

Charlie was a House Prefect, Captain and Seeker for the Quidditch team, skilled enough at Seeking to go professional but surprised many by pursuing an interest in Dragon-care in Romania. He was well-regarded enough in that job to be included in the team bringing four dragons from Romania all the way to Scotland.

***** I didn't say anything about autism and homesexuality being linked? first_decoy started a thread on Charlie, I commented about a fic I had read that featured him as well.

Autism isn't always extreme introversion, there is a full spectrum and many people can be very successful at their chosen profession, whether it be Quidditch or dragon taming. If you'd like to read the fic that I read (where Charlie is an admittedly very small part of it):

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

      I already posted this as an additional chapter to 'boy with a scar' but people have been having a hard time finding it, so I thought I'd repost for y'all\. omgpadfoot asked: "What if Voldemort didn't offer Frank or Alice Longbottom a chance to sacrifice themselves for their child, his offering to spare Lily was only a whim based on a prior request to do so\. What if he killed Alice and Frank without hesitation, and was able to kill defenseless little Neville\. Then just to be safe, he tracked the Potter's down too\. What if Snape didn't find out in time, and Lily was murdered without thought, and Harry shortly after\."\(Ao3\!omgpadfoot if you aren't the same as tumblr\!omgpadfoot please let me know\)

  Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.

  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

***** It's kind of funny it says "the Dursleys never exactly starved Harry" though cause after vanishing the glass in the boa constrictor's little display case, Vernon made Harry go into his cupboard without food. And then he started to think about how he wished he had a watch so he could sneak food from the kitchen, as if this was a regular occurrence. I had the thought that maybe they didn't excessively starve him (like for days and days), but they did deny meals, at least a couple in a row or reduced to a bread and water, whenever he had episodes like that.

** Harry having a family vault. It's a really easy plot point, because you can set up an independent Harry in one chapter with that: Dumbledore can't be trusted because he kept the vault from Harry, and inside the vault is a letter from Lily and James, quoting the prophecy and some emotional stuff.

Combine that, and bam, Harry is independent and now has infinite money and knowledge of the prophecy. No wonder it's so popular in fanfics.

*** Technically he does have a family vault. It's just that that's the very vault he visited when he was in the bank.

What's fanon is him having a trust vault and that being the vault he'd visited.

** Crabbe and Goyle being complete idiots incapable of independent thought.

They're smart enough to at least pass their classes without (I'm assuming) too much cheating, and they're not magically incompetent either. Crabbe cast Fiendfyre in the seventh book. He might not have been able to control it, but he was able to cast it. That's not something a near-squib can do.

Honestly, they're probably bored out of their skull guarding Draco. They probably look forward to intimidating people because that's the only damn they're allowed to do, because it's hard to look intimidating if you're playing RPS while you're guarding someone.

EDIT: Also, the "Sacred Twenty-Eight". I read that somewhere, something about the founding families of the wizengamot. I know that's not in the books, so is it on Pottermore or something?

*** That second one really twists people- so many stories portray Harry as stunted due to limited food during his childhood, but the boy in the books grows up to be as tall and good-looking as his father, despite having the knobby knees of one of the older ancestors seen in the Mirror of Erised.

Height is one of the main factors confounded by the movies and their influence in fanfiction.

The twins aren't tall. They're stocky like Charlie... and Ginny, eventually (doesn't mean she's fat; just sturdy). The reedy Weasleys are Arthur, Bill, Percy and Ron. Harry is taller than Hermione, and Ron looms over them both. Neville is similar to Harry in height but rounder, with sandy-blond hair much like his mother. Dumbledore and Voldemort are very tall and lean. Slughorn is nearly spherical, as his belly precedes him into rooms. McGonagall is stern, dark-haired... and half Dumbledore's age. Lupin doesn't have a cheesy pedo-mustache. Sirius has no tattoos.

** This one is a bit obscure:

The life debt between Snape and James is because Sirius convinces Snape to go into the Shrieking Shack while Remus is a werewolf in an effort to kill him, and James saves him to protect Sirius.

That's canon, right?
