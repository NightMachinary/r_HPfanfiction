Has there ever been a fanfic that, for some reason, you found didn't feel like fanfic, /because/ it felt like a genuine novel? I'm curious, since we all know that fanfics can be godawful to "so bad that it's good" to amazing. Fanfics can range from anything like "too original" to "static". What do you think?


** I'm pretty sure there is no "too good". I do, however, think that there is a sizeable audience in fanfiction that has no patience for things that would normally constitute a "good novel". Things like complex romance, plotting, character design,... is often lost on a part of this community.

** In a sense, for a sufficiently narrow definition of "well written." Most MFA writing programs workshop/woodshed writers into adopting (almost exclusively) cumulative syntax, which paints a veneer of abstruse literary-fiction-ness over everything and makes stuff read like it's penned by Gertrude Stein or William Gass wannabes.

This doesn't generate page-clicks in fanfiction. Fanfiction readers tend to be drawn to simply told stories with solid story telling, literary comfort food.

** I have had a few situations where the fanfic was better than the show, and if the show was still going on, it dimmed my enjoyability of the show a little bit. I try not to read fics of ongoing shows for that reason.

** The only problem I have with well-written stories is that they've ruined the rest of fanfiction for me. When I first discovered the stuff I'd read just about anything but having experienced the quality of stories written by authors like TheEndless7, Starfox5, White Squirrel, and Rakeesh I can't stomach most ff even as a guilty pleasure.

*** Same. When I first started reading fan fiction 15 years ago I would read anything I could get my hands on. Now I feel like a crotchety old man who has no patience for anything that reads like a school-age person wrote it!

** Not for me. I read fanfiction with only a slightly lower standard than the average indie novel, and my expectations remain fairly high.

** Too original to the point where it's no longer Harry Potter? Sure.

I'm struggling to think of how it could be too well-written though. At first I thought of something that is too hard for a non-native reader like me to follow. But then my understanding of well-written is that the prose doesn't get in the way of the story. It should be /easy/ to follow, not hard.
