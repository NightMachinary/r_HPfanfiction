I've been looking for a fanfiction like that for a while now. Of course, we already know quite a bit about Tom Riddle's past, but I would love to read about in the style of the Harry Potter books. Him growing up, getting his Hogwarts letter, his years at Hogwarts, the people he meets, how he became Voldemort. From his perspective, kind of like the stories about Harry where he turns dark. Is there something out there like that?

#+begin_quote
  Tom is three years old when Mary, his twin sister, is taken from him. After eight solitary years at Wool's Orphanage, he learns that he shall see her again at Hogwarts, a school of magic. Will their reunion be a peaceful one, or will they travail through seven years of waxes and wanes, through which their world becomes increasingly torn by war and desire?
