So I was reading a fic where Harry ends up as an Auror. It had a decent start, but then it went on describe Ron as this jealous and lazy person who was too lazy to become an Auror and was too jealous of Harry and I just couldn't deal with it.

I get that people have their own preferences but almost every fic I read these days bashes Ron, worships Hermione and... Harry I guess just stands there trying to be independent and what not.

So are there any good fics (even the short ones will do) that positively portray the relationship between Harry and Ron (as friends). It would be cool if it some post-war fic where both of them are Aurors.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) becomes this in the later chapters.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** I think I have seen this fic being recommended a few times around. I've had this in my list for a while now, but everytime I look at the word count, I back out.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.
