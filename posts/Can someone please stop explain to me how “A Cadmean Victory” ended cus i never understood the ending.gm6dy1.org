** Ok, this is my interpretation, since the author left it open-ended. It has been some time since I read it all, but I often go back and read the first 30 chapters or so(I really like Painting!Salazar).

First, remember when Harry killed Pettigrew at the beginning? And used it to extract Tom`s Horcrux from himself by fracturing his own soul? He unknowingly made a Horcrux for himself, his wand(it got red hot and almost melted his hand). Ok, remember that.

In the end, when he and Voldemort duke it out and kill each other, Harry survives because of his Horcrux and absorbs a little of Tom`s power.

When Fleur is mourning him in his tomb in France, under their willow, Hedwig(taken by Harry`s soul) arrives with the Elder Wand and the Stone(that Harry had), so through a convoluted combination of having possession of the Three Hallows and having a Horcrux, Harry fully comes back to life.

A Cadmean Victory because he defeated Death like Cadmus Peverell tried to do.

A Taste of Ismenian Water is the epilogue, It shows an alive Harry, who questions if he`s fully Harry or a Voldemort thinking he`s Harry or Harry with some Riddle, so he casually infiltrates the Department of Mysteries and looks into the Mirror of Erised, confirms he`s truly Harry Potter, and then steals the mirror, because why not?

He then returns home, tells his wife Fleur he`s really Harry Potter and not "Harry Riddle"(she already knew that), and then is finally relived being reunited with his wife and daughter.

  The original epilogue to A Cadmean Victory before I decided to make the last chapter the epilogue and leave things hanging. Obviously it's just a single chapter and scene, but I thought I might as well share it as a separate story for those who wanted to see my version of the ending.

** I have two prevalent theories. Choose the one which makes most sense to you.

Harry's wand was the Horcrux. Hedwig was also a Horcrux. Fleur kept saying that she felt a sliver of Harry's magic. That means the Horcrux was there but just wasn't perfect (probably made by accident). I think Harry made Hedwig a horcrux by accident as well. The ending however was Harry and Voldemort. Voldemort killed Harry but Harry, being a spirit, took over Voldemort. Voldemort lashed out and we saw how similar they truly were. We also see that Harry even as a spirit is as strong as Voldemort. Harry never truly died, so Voldemort did. Voldemort, with no other Horcruxes, could not survive being possessed by another. So Harry ended up Killing Voldemort the same way Voldemort survived in the first place.

*OR*

Harry made a horcrux and anchored it in the elder wand when he knew he couldn't win against Voldemort, he then possessed his owl (the same way Voldemort possessed Quirrell) to return the Horcrux and the other half of his soul (the one possessing Hedwidge) to his physical body.

This would explain why the owl's body was deteriorating.

It would also explain why Voldemort was fed images from Harry's life when he picked up the elder wand. The same way the locket corrupted Hermione by showing her what she feared, Harry's Horcrux showed love to Voldemort, which is what was supposed to be the "power he knows not" since the beginning. This in turn reminded Tom of a time long ago when he had loved (the ambiguous Myrtle parts of chapter 102).

Which stays within the idea of "no light or dark, only intent", as even what is considered the darkest of magics, a Horcrux, was used with the intent of redeeming instead of corrupting.
