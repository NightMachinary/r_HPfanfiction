Are there other fics that are somewhat similar to basilisk born. As in Harry is sent back in time, is the head of an important family and then is returned to his time and still is the head of house and uses it for something. Or any other time travel stories from the last year, either a do over or time travel to marauder era. No Ginny pairing please.


** Commenting in case someone found one. I've tried searching for a similar one, but could never find one as good

** Ones where Harry uses time travel to political/Voldemort fighting advantage in the present: linkffn(son of Salazar); linkao3(Of a Linear Circle --- part I). Probably also linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712904/1/Gelosa%C3%BE-in-%C3%89cnesse][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712904/1/Gelosaþ-in-Écnesse]]), but he doesn't become the head of a powerful family in that one. I'll add more if I think of them, but there's definitely more out there!

Edit: maybe also linkffn(A Long Journey Home), but though it's certainly headed that way, I don't think the manipulation of the present bit is super developed yet

  Another "Harry goes back in time" fic. What happens when a five-year-old randomly apparates into the newly constructed Hogwarts, horribly beaten and dying? He is found and raised by a surprisingly gentle Salazar, until he one day returns to his proper time...only he's seventeen years older than he was when he left. Either Snarry or Harrymort...you decide. BOTH SEQUELS UP!

  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
