** Not canon Snape. Canon Snape is supposedly an anti-hero trapped between his conflicting roles as a spy and as a teacher. He actually is an abusive fuckwit who exists to make the wrong choice every time. He's a goddamn animate Goofus and Gallant comic.

A good fanfic portrayal of Snape would involve changing his actions. A person seeking redemption wouldn't actively support and encourage the exact environment that drove him into working for a terrorist organization.

****** Adding on, he's a fucking awful spy. The mark of the spy is that they're trusted or they're unknown. Snape is neither for either perspective. For Voldemort, he's such a bloody obvious Death Eater that nobody (should) tell him things. He's being propped up by Dumbledore alone. To the Order, Snape is abusing children and supporting the radicalization efforts in Hogwarts, to the point that shouting blood slurs in a crowded corridor don't even get you punished.

Snape's entire existence is literally "be the antagonist of whatever scene there is". Need someone to deliberately damn an innocent man and release a terrorist with a body count? Snape's your guy. Need to bully a child in the exact way you were bullied? Call Snape. Need someone to mindrape a child, view his worst memories, then not do a damn thing about the abuse? I know a guy.

******** Let's review his actions:

1) Goes to give Lupin his medication.

2) Sees the map, so he knows that Pettigrew is alive and where Lupin is.

3) Leaves the potion behind while going to Lupin.

4) Despite knowing Pettigrew is alive, Snape gets the minister to execute Sirius anyways.

Even ignoring the Sirius situation, Snape set up Lupin to either die by Dementor or to have a transformed werewolf on school grounds that he can valiantly slay.

I don't want to pin anything involving restraining Pettigrew on him simply because I can't remember if he was conscious then, but if he was that also goes on his head. (Although Lupin, at least, should have realized ropes don't do shit to a man who can turn into a rat.)

** No, but like whistlingbanshee said, he had potential to be. And, while it would have been great for storytelling purposes, it /is/ more realistic, imo, that he wasn't.

Snape was at the beginning of redemption, I think. We saw him being intolerant of the slur. He protected Luna, Ginny, and be Neville. We saw him admit he saved would be victims of Death Eaters.

The "always" moment, though, imo shows he had a ways to go and, given the amount of people who think Snape cared for Harry deep down, I don't think too many paid attention to what he actually said. I know I didn't at first.

#+begin_quote
  "I thought...all these years...that we were protecting him for her. For Lily."
#+end_quote

The whole convo is him admitting Harry's life is of no importance to him outside him being Lily's and that he wouldn't be there if not for the promise.

Maybe it's fan fiction getting to me, but he and Lucius seemed to be good friends, too, by the end and good, redeemed people aren't friends with magical Klansmen.

*** I don't at all read that quote that way. I think when Dumbledore told Snape, "if you truly loved her, the way forward is clear," he wasn't talking about protecting Harry. I mean that doesn't even really make sense in context. He was talking about Snape making the choice he failed to make in 5th year, living his life the way Lily wanted him to. The way forward is to turn away from his dark impulses and help people instead of hurting them. Which he does...mostly.

When he says "I thought we were protecting him for her," he's saying "I thought we were both moving forward the way that Lily wanted...to protect, to love, to save." Using Harry, raising him like a pig for slaughter, is the antithesis of what Lily stood for and Snape seems to understand that very well by the end of the story.

People will say "oh, but he went to Dumbledore to try and switch sides!!!" but that ignores the fact that until he found out Voldemort was going after the woman he was obsessed with, Snape didn't give two shits about the nameless infant that his boss was going to kill.

Hell, if Harry had been born at the end of June, and the prophecy clearly pointed to Neville, would Snape have bothered to switch sides? Would he have felt ANY guilt at all? No. Therefore, he is someone who willingly engaged in a conspiracy to murder an infant.

Nothing can redeem that. What a shame his death was so quick.

As for Dumbledore, I don't feel that strongly. I think he was noble in spirit, but rather stupid in execution - after all, canon Harry is pretty much an idiot, so to leave his instructions in the form of a silly riddle for the Trio to solve was pretty dumb. As far as Dumbledore/Grindelwald, I mean, it's the difference between someone saying racist things, and someone else taking part in a lynching. Just because he flirted with the idea of world domination doesn't make him anywhere near as evil as Snape.

Stuff like McGonagall, at times, treating Neville just as badly as Snape was but Harry being more inclined to sugarcoat it because he actually liked her.

I'd also disagree about him not being a good man. He didn't present himself as one, true, but even from Harry's perspective in canon we see moments when Snape is legitimetely concerned about other people wellbeing that aren't 'Lily's son'. There's even a quote during the pensive memories in DH that was like "The only people whom i've seen die recentely are the ones i couldn't save."

Yes, so? Why do you think I prefer story which utilise background adults such as the Tonks or the background teachers over stories with Dumbledore, Snape or McGonagall as the mentor/good teacher? Or why I consider Sirius the only decent important adult?

And basically all other important adults (Dumbledore, Snape, the Weasleys, Lupin) have proven that they will do nothing consequential when shit hits the fan. Hell, the Grangers have more potential because they have not shown to be awful at being authority figures.

** No. He abused his position to pick on and belittle Harry and a good 17 year's worth of Gryffindor students just because James Potter bullied Snape and worse for seven years and because he pushed his own best friend away from him because he willingly joined a terrorist group.

** I think that people in this fandom tend to have really, really different things in mind when talking about WHAT exactly was/wasn't redeemed.

Personally, I think of him joining Death Eater, supporting Voldemort. So my answer is -- yes. He was redeemed. After all, he spend at least 7 years (more of you count all the years that he worked for Dumbledore aka pre-Harry years) putting his head on the line and risking his life to make up for his mistake. I don't believe it is the case where his motivation (love/obsession for Lily, which is another topic in itself) matters. But that's also a whole another discussion -- whether motivations and intentions matter the same/more/less then actions.

As for him being a foul unpleasant individual and his treatment of people in general and Harry in particular. I don't think it's somethings that could be ‚Äòredeemed'. /Personality/ - is not something that can be redeemed. At least, not when it comes to Snape. Being, simply put, a jerk is huge part of who he is. Even if you write a Snape who somehow got some sense talked in him and started treating people better, it still wouldn't be ‚Äòredemption' imho. Personal growth, character development maybe. But not redemption.

** In the eyes of the larger wizarding world. No.

In the eyes of Dumbledore and Harry. Yes.

** I think that killing him off was probably the kindest thing that Rowling did for the character. How Harry presented him as after the war was a help to his reputation, but I think that his personality wouldn't have fundamentally changed. He would still have had to answer for Dumbledore's death (whether or not Dumbledore planned it is irrelevant, he still would have had to face a trial), he would have a whole generation of children who were at Hogwarts whilst he was headmaster hating him, he'd have those that would look to him as a potential love interest (some girls love a bad boy or think they can 'fix' him). Life after the war would be excruciating for him.
