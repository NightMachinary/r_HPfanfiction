** Linkffn(The Merging) is the best I've read in a damn long while. As a warning, though, it's one chapter (plus two more "epilogue" chapters) away from being complete, currently ends on a cliffhanger, and hasn't updated in over a year. That said, there's been multiple year-long gaps between updates before, so I don't think it can reasonably be called abandoned just yet.

There's also linkffn(Forging the Sword), which /is/ abandoned, but still very good, and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), which is complete with a sequel which is on hiatus.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
