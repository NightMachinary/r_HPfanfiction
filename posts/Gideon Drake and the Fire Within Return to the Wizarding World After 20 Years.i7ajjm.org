As a reader, I wasn't able to find the type of story I was looking for, so I decided to write it! I'm very happy to be seven chapters and 20,000 words into my story now. The feedback I've been getting has been really gratifying but I would love to hear from other HP readers and writers (the experts)! I hope you'll give it a chance and let me know your thoughts.

*Summary:* A new story set in J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World. Gideon is a wizard! Or is he? As his first day at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry finally draws near, Gideon's life begins to unravel, and so, too, do the secrets surrounding his past...
