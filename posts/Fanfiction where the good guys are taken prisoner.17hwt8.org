I read this fanfiction called 30 days: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548835/1/]] and even if not very well written, I enjoyed it a lot. Can you link me to other stories where one character or more are prisoners? Whatever the rating and whatever the characters (except Ron, I can't stand him).


** There was one about Luna's time at Malfoy Manor, told from Draco's POV, but I can't find it anywhere. The title might have been something like "Christmas at Malfoy Manor", but it doesn't come up when I search.

*** That could be a nice read, I guess it's completely canon and fits in the original series as a complement? Do you remember what site you read it on?
