I don't remember much from the fic apart from that the girl love interest was way older than James and was possessed by Voldie or something like that. The first book had a swamp in a forest Afair.

**** I'm fairly certain you mean the G Norman Lippert stuff: James Potter Series. The first one is called "The Hall of Elders' Crossing", but I don't think it's on Fanfiction Net. It's been awhile since I read it, but I remember it was very good.
