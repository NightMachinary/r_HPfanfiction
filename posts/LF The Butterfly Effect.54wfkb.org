** If you somehow don't know it then linkffn(Forging the Sword) also meets your requirements. But the last update was long ago, and what was written focused mormore on worldbuilding and characters than plot.

** *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), definitely meets your needs. Harry really has a power 'he knows not' and that power is actually related to love. After saving Hermione from the troll, Year 1 diverged. Year 2 approximately went the same until Harry got down to the CoS, then the story became completely AU. This fic also came with severe Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing, something I'm sure you would enjoy.
