A fix like this will ideally show how this affects the wizarding society (e.g Gringotts online banking, Weasley Wizard Wheezes running ridiculous advertisements, and the Malfoy's becoming the kings of online investing).


** This reminded me of the time when I was still active on Tumblr and encountered 'The Setup Wizard,' an /IT guy at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry./

** I always sort of imagined that the wizard internet would be an actual different dimension to which you could summon yourself with your wand. Here would be some sort of Oracle that could respond to any of your questions but it would also learn information from wizards all over the world visiting it. Some would contribute freely, others for fun, others would teach the oracle information but ask the Oracle to also advertise their business and others would simply ask the Oracle to charge others looking for the information they have provided. It would also deliver your messages to other people across the globe. When you leave a message for someone, their wand notifies them.

Edit: Alternatively, for any question, you'd have to pay it back with a new information be it in the form of speech, written or a memory like those that go into the Pensieve.

*** This was one of the first fic I ever read, it might have been the very first. I guess it's time to see if it's as good as I remember.

** Safeguard on AO3 is a delightful unfinished MCU crossover in which Harry is a technomage who investigates the effects of the tessaract event on the magical internet.
