One of my favorite stories is On a Train, Switching Tracks by Mede, and I love the platonic relationship between Ron and Draco. Are there any other stories that feature this?


** That's the only one I know of. It's a shame it wasn't completed. It was fairly droll.

*** I know! It is really a shame that it was abandoned. :(

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

** linkffn(Living with Danger)

It's a fic where Lupin + OC + Sirius Black + OC rescue Harry from the Dursleys and raise him with Hermione and [[/spoiler][Sirius and OC's daugther]]. Draco comes into the picture after [[/spoiler][the Pack (the main family thing) get captured by Lucius and escape with Draco.]] Eventually they meet Ron and they're good friends. Warnings: Overly fluffy, incredibly long, lots of flags for Sue-ish behavior/characters. Still enjoyed the series (moreso the beginning and ending than the middle) because of very solid writing.

** There is a fanfic where Ron and Draco, unknowingly, become penpals. It also features an indy-Harry, can't remember the name though.
