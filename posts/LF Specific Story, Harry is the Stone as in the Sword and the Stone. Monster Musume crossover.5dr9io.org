It was a really interesting story where Harry while saving Gabrielle from the Lake runs a foul of the Merpeople, who try to kill the two with a giant Golem (which is like a Wizarding version of a Nuke) Harry tries his damnedest to protect the child with him even casting a Super Shield. Harry comes to speaking to the Lady of the Lake who tells him he is the Stone who must protect the Sword that decides the next King (that wasn't really explored yet) Harry on a time limit uses Excalibur to destroy the Golem. A Year or so later after he is out of Hogwarts and is chosen as a Host to Monster girls due to his status of living on the border himself due to his magical status

Can someone help me remember and find this story
