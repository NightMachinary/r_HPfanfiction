I was reading one recently where Ginny and Harry are having a conversation after dropping James off at the platform for the first time. It was pretty good but then the author's idea of humor kicked off : Harry and Ginny spend more than a dozen paragraphs viciously insulting Cho Chang . Ginny even calls her a whore ( despite the fact they dated the same number of boys in Hogwarts ) Left a really bad taste in my mouth .


** When the first chapter (or even the first few paragraphs) begins by drumming up outrage on the part of our poor, abused, cinnamon roll, Hadrian Potter-Black. That tone of internal outrage is evident when the MC's mental dialogue starts referring to characters by smarmy nicknames, like "Manipulative Old Coot" or "Dumblefuck", then listing out reasons of how our sweet, darling Harry has been wronged, with fanonical buzzwords like "The Light" or "Line Theft". Lol, where the fuck do people get these.

.

+Worst+ Best fic ever made it clear what it was right out of the starting gate. It's so good, it doesn't pull /any/ punches.

  He couldn't believe this. He couldn't believe he'd been lied to his whole life, by the man he thought he could trust. How dare he? How dare he lie to his parents too, and effectively get them murdered? All for his own selfish need for power. How could he? Harry was fuming as he stomped down the hallways of Hogwarts, unaware he was muttering aloud.

  He had suspected the lying since his 2nd year, though always dismissing it as paranoia, but now he had be told by them man himself, Dumble-fuck had confirmed his worries and still asked him “Can you still trust me?” in his most grandfatherly, and sickeningly "kind" voice.

  Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were in on the whole thing, he was sure, as he overheard Fred and George discussing the fact that none of their friends had gotten the trademark Weasley sweater for Christmas and how their dad was happy that Dumbledore and managed to get to Harry's vault and finally pay them back for the' hard work'. Ron was more interested in the fame associated with him then he himself, which hadn't been true (or noticed) until the Triwizard Tournament had occurred and he showed his true colours of jealousy and greed. Ginny has tried, and nearly succeeded once, to drug him into love and force him to give her his family's name, with the help of none other than Hermione.

None of it is relevant to the story, but the purpose of the story's existence is to be the author's wish fulfillment. An experienced writer wouldn't explicitly list the exact number of galleons in the MC's vault, because that limits what they can do with the story in the future.

Also, why specify "Distrust Draco Malfoy" after distrusting Slytherins? Unless Dumbledore thought there was a chance a Malfoy wouldn't be sorted there? Same thing with Snape, who is the Slytherin House Head. Just redundant.

Also, how come every single vault Harry gets access to has tons of money? Why can't there be a story where Harry gets tons of vaults, but they're all broke? Or the goblins charge a bunch of fees, taking away all the money.

Or Mrs. Weasley had.

I once read a Romione fic where they got married(this was before all the books and movies had come out so maybe...2005). But....Harry raped Hermione on her wedding day.

I didn't read this fic, but..there was one on Pottersues in which Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and the rest of the Weasleys were vilified. They all wanted Harry's money, so they were gold diggers. They were also made homophobic. Like, Snape and Harry were together on the Hogwarts Express(despite Snape being a teacher). And Ron and Hermione make a comment about how wrong it is. Not because Snape is Harry's teacher and Harry is a sixteen year old little boy. Not because Snape has been a complete dickhead to Harry or made Neville's school life miserable. NOPE. Because Snape is a guy.

I was once reading a fic out of curiousity where Hermione discovers that she's not a muggleborn but instead a halfblood or pureblood. She turns completely against her loving muggle parents and begins to hate muggleborns. And the glamour on her disappears and she suddenly looks like a Victoria's Secret model.

  "If I'd known that you'd turn into such a Romanophile, I wouldn't have suggested that book," Hermione glared at him, "We were supposed to meet at the Cauldon two hours ago, you prat!"

** Usually, I give a fic at least one chapter. Not in the following cases.

I can't even remember the name of the fic, but Voldemort sends an assassin to kill Harry. The assassin is either a muggle or is just a wizard who prefers to use guns for some reason.

Harry gets the jump on him and shoots him with Vernon's revolver (how did he ever learn how to use it? Apparently, he watched Vernon show Dudley how it worked and that was enough). After Harry shoots the dude, he threatens to cut out his eyes with a knife. It was at that point that I clicked out. Everything seemed OOC and contrived to me.

I stopped reading Macgicks of the Arcane when it was revealed that Harry wanted to make basilisk skin armor.

**** Polygamous/Polyamorous relationships are called "Polyfics" by their readers, where the poly ship is the centre focus of the story.

Harem fics usually have the poly relationship be incidental to the main story (which is some sort of Indie!Harry OP schlock in most cases), and the relationship dynamics are developed only superficially. The participants are often characterized like boyband or idol group members, with each of them having a distinct "personality" archetype, like the Girl Next Door (Tonks), the Hot One (Fleur), the Ice Princess (Daphne), and the Quirky Pixie Dream Girl (Luna).

General pattern: None of the harem are also dating someone else (who isn't dating the main character). None of the harem want more of the main character's time and attention than the five minutes it takes to get together. None of the harem have any sort of relationship development with each other except for perfect insight into each other's psyche as plot relevant.

Almost always have a teenage male main character and female harem members. Often first (two) harem members are only repeating harem member characters. May be one kink per harem member or one (non-canon) stereotypical personality per harem member.

***** Fair warning to anybody thinking about touching Firebird: the world building is fantastic, but this is excessively GRIMDARK even compared to a normal Darth Marrs setting.

Voldemort actually becomes somewhat sympathetic, because he's opposing people who are (somehow) more cruel and malicious - and he's not out of character, the world is just /that/ bad. One character is almost raped to death (via blood loss), and it's not even the most traumatic moment said character has to go through.

That said, the world building is almost worth the read on its own, and if you can handle the GRIMDARK then it's a good choice. Just...caveat emptor.

******* Ugh, yes, one of the worst parts of its popularity is how it will top the search results whenever someone looks like the archive tags on Ao3. Fem!HP/LV is a relatively small niche, and deserves better fics to be representatives of the sub-fandom.

View "Full Work" on Ao3 and skip to any paragraph, and you'll find the hammy, overdramatic writing chock full of typos and missing punctuation. Some people might think the writing is imaginative, but to me as a reader, it's purple prose-y af, awkward and distracting at certain points, and makes the story read like a cheesy dimestore romance full of heaving breasts and turgid loins. It's hard for me to call it good writing, by any stretch.

  Lifting his mask again to taste the air for a third and final time he smelled the unmistakable sweet iron of old blood, her precious magical blood which could trace it's lineage back to the founding of Rome, mingled with the saltiness of an ocean's worth of tears, and seemingly endless years of misery and hopelessness...

  [...He cast the] Dark Mark into the sky to make sure there was no mistaking what had happened here tonight. The blazing red flames licked up past the roof into the night sky like they were reaching for the gods themselves for salvation, and instead only found the acid green, rictus grin of his symbol laughing down at them mercilessly.

"Quite fitting isn't it?" "Behave yourself Voldemort." She said primly, though she was finally lowering her wand. "Or the only fitting we'll be doing will be my boot fitting up your arse." Voldemort felt a wicked grin take over his face, meeting her fierce green eyes with a purring sense of satisfaction. It occurred to him that even with the whole convoluted matter of Lordships and wills and horcruxes aside, he couldn't have chosen his future wife better if he'd tried. Harry Black-Potter was going to make a truly formidable queen.

Dark Daddy Dom Tom, at it again. He's a murderer with no morals, but he makes it romantic.

You could switch out the names for Rey and Kylo from the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy and it would be an instantly popular Reylo fanfic. I'm honestly struggling at trying to see the good in the characterisation. I suppose some people might like these particular character archetypes or dynamics, but it seems pretty generic to me. And that's disappointing, because it's ruining Tom Riddle/Voldemort's original character, and in a way where he himself would consider it ridiculous.

*********** The characterization was the nail in the coffin to keeping up with the updates. I could stomach everything else, in the name of the AU premise of the story, but Voldemort's characterization became more and more off the longer he appeared on screen. I think my realization came when Voldemort began to justify his genocidal ways by using The Greater Good (borrowing Grindelwald's schtick), and it wasn't him trying to win Harry over with manipulative lies, but was supported by the story's worldbuilding itself, as magic can "fade" out of the world. That was too AU for me.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

**** The worst thing is there is a LOT of ways that you can write a completely great fic that also deals with Christian themes. The problem is that requires dealing with things through metaphor and allusion, and being well versed enough theologically to paint in these allegories and hope your reader notices them, but even if they don't, they still get a good story out of it. Just hang all the Jesus metaphors off of Harry and you're good, while not actually calling Harry Jesus

Look at CS Lewis' The Chronicles of The Lion is Totes Jesus Guys.

But that's really more of an issue with the sort of churches that create people who step out of the fic to prostletyze is that those churches that spawn such people don't really like the members actually learning the theology.

The most common one is that pure-bloods are Pagan and the filthy Muggle-borns are suppressing their culture and forcing traditions to vanish. It is even worse when Paganism is essentially a sub-branch of Christianity.

If I recall correctly, it was a label that Christians named others, people who did not actually fight.

Then I got to the 38th chapter of the story.

Nicolas Flamel whisks Harry away somewhere where Voldemort will never find Harry in order to train him. He whisks him away to a planet several thousand light years away from Earth. Ok, that's actually a rather genius idea. Neither Voldemort, nor his Death Eaters would ever think to look for Harry /off-world/... Then Flamel reveals he and his wife are aliens.

I have never closed the tab so fast.

You know, if this had been a crossover fic, I would have given the idea a chance. Say... if the author had made it a crossover with Doctor Who, where Flamel was secretly the First Doctor, I would have kept reading (it doesn't have to be that exactly, I'm merely giving an example).

But this was a vanilla Harry Potter fic. There are no aliens in canon, nor is there even a hint of aliens in canon as far as I'm aware of.

Then there was a fic that I didn't actually mind reading. It was hardly the best I've read, but it wasn't terrible -- mediocre, but good enough to have me keep reading, and I was somewhat engrossed in the world. Oh, the fic features soulbonds? I was displeased but continued because it didn't take up too much of the fic, and eventually got engrossed in the fic anyway. Then, someone was apparently Obliviated by Dumbledore, having his true memories replaced by false ones, and screwed over by having feelings for someone who had a soulbond with someone else. So here we have Manipulative Dumbledore /and/ the bad side of Soulmate tropes (a trope I already strongly dislike as-is, even when fics portray it as purely beneficial), conveniently grouped together. It killed off my motivation for continuing completely, even if I had read over half of the fic already, so I stopped.

** I hate stories where Harry is unbearably condescending and smug, in a way that the author clearly thinks is clever. As soon as harry starts going on about how immature and irresponsible Hogwarts students are because they dont do 300 sit ups at 4 am and benchpress the giant squid.

Alternatively, i just read the first chapter of a fic in which Harry was dating Fleur, Gabrielle, and a sexy oc vampire character. Every sentence was straight out of [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. Pert breast jongiling sexily as they took turns throwing themselves at him. It almost seemed like a parody. Harry also had twin phoenix companions, in addition to his own buisness that he started himself at age 14.

** I usually do my best to prevail as long as possible, however...

A while ago I started reading a story that is supposed to be very good. I couldn't handle it after just a few chapters because Sirius was CONSTANTLY smoking and it just put me off (apologies to smokers).

Another one had Luna's POV in 1st person: So I walked, and waved at the nargles that just randomly appeared right now because the author has to portray me as crazy and the wrackspurts started eating them.

** every time a fic turns into a harem one. okay, sure, I don't mind polyromantic relationships, but this is phenomenally annoying- both harem and reverse harem fics are overdone, the straight harem ones more so.

Also, I was once reading a wrong-boy-who-lived fic(a bit new to them at the time). Harry had two siblings, a younger sister and a twin brother who was whiny and the "boy who lived". His parents were very condescending to Harry and neglectful, as were Sirius and Remus. Harry then started to learn how to be a necromancer after his sister had died- I think his brother killed her by accident, I don't remember.

at first I was okay with it. Sure, Harry seemed a bit self-righteous and Remus was sort of ooc, but I guess with how Sirius compared Harry to his father in the original books he would be more attatched to his twin. Okay, sure. His parents were surprisingly hateful and horrible, even though they were supposed to be good people???

he gets to Hogwarts, is all dark and moody and goes to Slytherin. Starts studying. Okay, cool, seems like he's focused on his goal. He goes through an unnecessarily complicated strategy of turning himself older and going to shop for books on the dark arts. Okay cool, seems weird but necromancy is a bit dark I guess.

he goes into a book shop, and has uncomfortably high sexual tension with the female cashier. I guess she was given a personality, but keep in mind that she is overage and Harry is ELEVEN. Albeit in the body of a young man, but that's still not good??? It's bad. uncomfortably bad. Harry gets distracted from his goal, and I barely see any mention of his dead sister as he goes to have sex with the cashier girl every time he goes out to shop for books and learn more. By that time, I gave up on the book because I'm not a fan of an eleven year old boy getting into a very sexual relationship with an overage person, hot girl or not. I don't care that she has issues, or a personality, or a backstory. I draw the line at this.
