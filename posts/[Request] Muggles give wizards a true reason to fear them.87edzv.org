** Global thermonuclear war.

Wizards should fare better than Muggles, but would also suffer debilitating losses. Too many wizards were living side by side with Muggles; too many wizards were dependent on the same agricultural production as Muggles; and it was questionable whether magical healing would work against radioactive fallout, something that had never existed when all those magical books were written.

For example, [[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/uk-government-top-secret-list-probable-nuclear-targets-1970s][London itself was targeted]] by 2-4 Soviet nuclear warheads during the Cold War, each one with a yield of 5 megatons, or 333 times more powerful than the Hiroshima Bomb. The Ministry, Diagon Alley, and most wizards living there would not survive.

Maybe wizards did pay attention to this threat, as they were instrumental in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

*** I'm sort of on board with this, but more so due to limits in manpower than in the capabilities of magic itself.

I think that a Shield Charm could protect against nuclear warheads and the resulting fallout in theory. Like, if you're a wizard who knows it well, and enough to cast it over your property.

But I'm inclined to believe that there's a limit to the area which one or even a group of wizards could cover in such an event. There's also the issue of the Shield Charm's purported difficulty for most wizards.

As for magical healing, I propose that it's much the same thing. Ionizing radiation is still mundane in nature, so while a Healer might not necessarily understand the concept of radioactive fallout, they know how to rid the body of poison. For all we know, it could be as simple as swallowing a bezoar - for immediate treatment, at least.

However, it's likewise a question of manpower and expertise. Most wizards aren't Healers, so when confronted with an illness that they haven't seen before, they would be more likely to fold.

*** If you saw a Youtube video of a wizard in a pointy hat waving a magic wand to do some magic and then teleporting away, which of these would you consider more likely?

1. Magic is real, and there is a hitherto hidden society of wizards in pointy hats with magic wands.
2. A studio really good at special effects and CGI has been hired to orchestrate a viral media campaign, though it's not clear exactly what they're selling.

Special effects tools get cheaper every year. It's an Internet meme now, so everyone's doing it.

To be precise, it's a video that the random person on the Internet who posted it claims is security footage.

Indeed, a person who had the highly improbable fortune to know two people who happened to catch wizards on video might get some indication that something weird is going on. However, assuming my Google-fu is adequate, about 5-10% of the UK population believe in magic IRL. Assuming that we don't have a Masquerade of our own going on, that means that people with legitimate reasons to be suspicious will be vastly outnumbered by people who believe for no good reason.

Ultimately, wizards can adapt as well. First few times, it will be dismissed as visual effects. After that, the Ministry can get the memo out that citizens need to be more careful, and maybe get the Unspeakables to produce a spell that affects video cameras and teach it alongside Memory Charms. Statute of Secrecy is the Ministry's Prime Directive.

****** The problem is that the wizarding world is not shown to adapt to Muggle tech. The last thing the adapted well was radio. Moving pictures? Their take on movies. The moving stairs in Hogwarts? Escalators. It comes down to whose in charge of this stuff at the ministry. Post books we get Shacklebolt, Arthur Weasley, or Hermione. So they could get they job done, mostly Hermione.

But if any pureblood idiot that thinks muggles are inferior and not a threat would just obliviate and move on, causing a slow snowball effect. Once the memory gaps reach epidemic portions. Eventually the government would have to step in.

Unless you fall into the muggles are weak, stupid and inferior camp. Then wizards have magic and magic solves everything. Except more magic, of course.

The examples you gave weren't wizards adapting to Muggle technology. They were wizards seeing Muggles do something, and coming up with magical ways to do it. (Some of them, like stairs, probably predated the Muggles' developments.)

Wizards have had to deal with film and video for decades already, so it's not so much a matter of quality as it as a matter of quantity. They can handle large-scale events, however, to the point where the British PM thought that an invasion of giants was a hurricane. Those purebloods would adapt as well, if the alternative was hefty fines and even prison.

And yes, Muggles aren't stupid or inferior, but they are, in fact, weak.

******** I swear I read a thing where a former Hogwarts headmaster installed them because he heard muggles using the term moving stairs and got the wrong idea, but I can't seem to find it. Poo.

Honestly it depends on the writer. But for muggles to be a threat they have to know about wizards, so full public reveal or small group like in Fantastic Beasts, either way people need to be in the know first.

*** This actually makes me wonder about what Magicals would do if evidence of magic went viral. They wouldn't be able to obliviate everyone, so if that happened, would they just give up and reveal themselves, or hope that people thought it was fake?

My point exactly. There had to be others, muggle-borns for example, or other orphans.
