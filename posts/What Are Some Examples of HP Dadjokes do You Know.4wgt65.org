Considering that Cursed child deals with their sons and daughters, I'm expecting a dad joke or two.

So come on hpff! Dadjoke me!

Also, I would love to hear about dad jokes that you came across in fics.


** Harry Potter can't tell the difference between his potions supplies and his best friend.

To be fair, they're both cauldron.

And---

Why does Tom Riddle prefer to use Twitter over Facebook?

He doesn't have friends, only followers.

** I think /the/ dad-joke of the fandom is:

  Sirius Black: "Yes, in fact I am Sirius."

Those are horrible and I feel horrible.

edit 2: My brain never stops.

#+begin_quote
  Someone else: What do you think about what Hermione did?

  Well, Granger things have happened.
#+end_quote

I am in hell right now. At this point I want to inform all of you that I am not able to write anything productive because all my brain does is trying to think of puns.

#+begin_quote
  What do bad students do in order to get into NEWT classes?

  Albus' eyes were twinkling as he added, "If it makes you feel any better, I've never been more than two-thirds bus. Further proof there really is no truth in advertising."
#+end_quote

Dad joke by the OG Dad. His "muggle" humor was great in that fic.

#+begin_quote
  "I am going to break that little man," Sirius declared as Albus came up behind him.

  "You know the muggles have a pill for that now," Albus commented as he brushed past.

** Idk about Dad jokes, but when I was 8 I was having a HP birthday party and my mum was doing a trivia quiz for us all and my dad popped in and tried to show off by asking us all how many legs a Gryffindor has got.

**** That's what we asked him. But he didn't know. He thought a Gryffindor was an animal. Then we explained to him. And he said two, because a Gryffindor was a person. Then Harvey told me my dad was weird, and Louise agreed. Later on, I quite firmly told my dad that he was not invited to any of my future birthday parties. I'm therefore of the opinion that Dads and Harry Potter don't mix.

** OK, serious question here.

What are dadjokes

But, if you really want it, I guess I have no choice to give it.

How many legs does a Gryffindor have?

Five, if you count a door (dor) as a leg.

Oh, gods, I'm cringing so hard right now.

Dadjokes are stupid jokes, the kind that dad's are seem prone to. "I'm hungry--Hi, hungry, I'm dad" is the quintessential dadjoke. I also just found out that [[/r/dadjokes]] exists.

Edit: [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] is this your dad's joke? Also what is a dor? Haven't heard of it being compared to a leg.
