** go through slexenskee's fics, they've got a great few. linkao3(195137) (not sure if the bot will work with a series... if not it's affelaye)

edit: yeah that pulled up something completely different, but it's slexenskee's affelaye series :)

edit again: few more. here's some soulmark series & fics, the first one updates pretty consistently: linkao3(16595471), linkao3(12714501), linkao3 (3348758). linkao3(8553358) -this is probably abandoned but from what i remember really good. nocturnememory's ichor series (now taken down) got me into this pairing BAD.

  The only time that Harri Potter had called Aunt Petunia ‘mum' she was promptly smacked across the face.It wasn't the first time her Aunt had hit her, but it was certainly the hardest. “I'm not your mother,” Aunt Petunia had snarled....It was only later, in the privacy of the room she had rented at the Leaky Cauldron, that Harri was finally alone. She removed the ribbon Mr. Ollivander had wrapped around her wrist to see the words that should have appeared once her wand bonded.The words 'Avada Kedavra' glared at her in emerald green. Harri's heart dropped.

  What have we here, a voice crows from somewhere inside her mind, hmmm, difficult, very difficult... brave, but you would have to be wouldn't you? Not a bad mind, and talent - oh my goodness, yes, such talent. And you want to prove yourself, don't you? Have a hunger for it... to prove you're more than a soulmate... but where to put you... Not Slytherin, Harry thinks as clearly as she can, not Slytherin, not Slytherin...Oh my dear girl, the hat mutters, are you sure? You could be great, you know, and Slytherin could help you on the way to greatness, it's all here in your head...I want nothing to do with him, she concentrates so hard that she thinks she might give herself a headache, I don't want his words, I don't want his mark, I don't want to be in his house-Understood, the hat grumbles, well, if you're so against Slytherin, then it had better be-“-GRYFFINDOR!” A soulmate AU where Harriet Potter thinks she has enough problems in her first year at Hogwarts without her soulmate being the man who killed her parents, thank you very much, but she doesn't get a vote.

  “I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.” - Pablo Neruda It was enough of a shock to realize that the life she thought she had wasn't reality at all - but that was only the beginning for Halia Potter. Will she ever truly adjust to this new, twisted world of hers that operates on half-truths? And perhaps more importantly, who is the real hero in all of this? Progressively dark AU; femHPxTMR.

** Thus far my only favorites of that pairing are by The Carnivorous Muffin. She's a very prolific writer, and I love the way she writes Riddle's personality. Each version of Riddle and fem!Harry in these fics is quite different.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]

"When Harry Met Tom" is probably easier to start out with, since it begins on a typical time travel set-up but takes it in a unique direction.

"Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" is more off the wall, but I highly recommend it. It mainly focuses on the (platonic) relationship between fem!Harry and the Horcrux in her mind, but the plot diverges out from there once they reach Hogwarts. I suggest reading at least the first two chapters before deciding whether it's something you'd like, since the intro chapter can be off-putting by itself.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
