In the fic I'm thinking of, there was something of a roguish handsome prince of the underworld in Knocturn Alley - plus a whole crew of other characters that could come right from Pierce's books - who was becoming very good friends with the main character, a young female 'harry in name only' (I think). Hogwarts happened, I believe, and these characters were interacting a lot during the summer.

Anything else that is close to a crossover between Piece and Rowling would be awesome to read, too!


** The first in the series is The Pureblood Pretence. The second is The Serpentine Subterfuge. The third (a WIP) is The Ambiguous Artifice.

***** No idea - I tried just linking the first one and got a decent response. Maybe it was the semicolons? I'm no expert on the bot. :/
