I've seen so many people swear by this fic, it's like the Holy Grail of fics in certain circles, and I'm curious why that's the case. I tried to read it once and it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in so I gave up, and in any other case I'd forget about it but I keep seeing it get recommended.

I guess my question is, what's the reason it's so popular, and should I try once again to read it? Would it be worth it?


** I hate this fic with a passion: this Hermione went back to Marauder Era. But instead of saving hundreds of innocent lives, she let everything happen again and only seem to be interested in double penetrations.

*** Just on the "not saving hundreds of innocent lives" thing, that's a pretty common thing with time travel - that either you can change things or you can't change anything because it's already happened (in which case you're following canon). And the author does deal with this and Hermione's issue with not being able to change things in the fic. So, of all the reasons to hate it with a passion, that's a weird one to choose.

****** What is this comment chain? "I will ignore the point you are trying to make in favor of pointing out something obvious"? As he said, her being with Sirius and Remus will have huge effects on the future. Making the whole huge plotpoint of her not being able to change the past more than idiotic. Because she is changing it a lot.

******* The whole point is that her being with them has already happened and therefore doesn't change anything. Also it's not a triad. There is one threesome scene, but her relationships with each are separate and handled in a way that makes a ton of sense given the world-building.

It's not for everyone.

But to argue that her being with Remus and/or Sirius changes the past completely misses the entire point, which is that time is a loop in this universe. Ex: in POA, Harry, Sirius, and Hermione are saved from the dementors bc back-in-time Harry casts his Patronus. It's already happened or, more precisely, it's always happening at all times.

There are some fics out there where Hermione goes back and the only way to change anything is to create an alternate timeline (essentially not saving anyone anyways bc they die in a different timeline) but that's not this one.

***** As someone that has read past the first 14 chapters, yea, I can see that. It does get better later on. That said, I still stopped after a while since I couldn't bring myself to look over the huge plothole of "I can't change things, woe is me, they still need to die" while she is actually changing tons of other things. Like for example, she is with both Sirius and Remus, obviously changing the future a lot.

****** Technically what she does doesn't change the future that's been established in the story. Canon is changed, certainly, but I wanted to explore various types of time travel and this story embraces just one (things happen because they've already happened---time is a loop). I've also done two time travel stories where the future can be changed, and also one where changing the future actually creates an alternate universe.

**** I do plan on finishing all of my works in progress (even if they've not been touched for a while). I had some undisclosed mental health issues pop up in the last few years that really sent me through a loop and was only just getting better before Covid hit. Being in quarantine hasn't helped the situation much, but I'm slowly getting better. Co-writing another fic (Outlet) has helped because I have someone always there as support and taking half the workload too). I really hope to get back to my WIPs this year.

** Honestly, there's just too many 'Muggles suck'/'Muggles don't understand wizards'/'Muggles aren't normal' moments for me to get into it. There's plenty of people Harry could go with but they'd rather abuse the Dursleys for fun and because they're Muggles. It left a bad taste in my mouth.

*** Not sure I'd say the Dursley hate is unwarranted. My dad (in his 60s) didn't read the series until covid hit and one of the first things he said was how utterly disgusted he was by the Dursley's abusive treatment of Harry. It's not something we pick up on as much as kids but I'd say the Dursley hate is totally fair.

As for generalized anti-muggle sentiment ... I've read DoT more times than I can count and I haven't picked up on that, but the characters aren't perfect so maybe I missed something subtle.

** One of my favorite things about Fan Fiction is that there is something for everyone! This fic might not be your thing, but that doesn't mean there is something wrong with it.

And if you can't find a story you really like, make one up! That's the beauty of it.

*** Sorry, also on the "is it worth it" question, I think it never hurts to come back for another try on a story. I had heard great things about DoT and I tried reading it once but couldn't get into it. A few months later I took another stab at it - now I have read it s couple times and I consider it a favorite. But if it's not your thing, that's okay. I hope you find a great story to get lost in soon ♥️

** Can we all just agree that song quotes to stop quoting songs at the beginning of every chapter? For 99% of stories I've seen this in, they add nothing to the story. If you're going to quote something (song, poem, whatever), choose one chapter and make it one that helps us understand the story arc/characters better.
