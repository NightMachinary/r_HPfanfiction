It's one that takes a darker look at Hermione. she does end up with Harry but they both create horcruxes and it explores the Dark magic is addictive school of thought.\\
It's a oneshot I think. Or it's a pretty short fic. Does anyone remember which fic it is? It covers the 5th 6th and 7th years and follows canon.\\
Thanks!
