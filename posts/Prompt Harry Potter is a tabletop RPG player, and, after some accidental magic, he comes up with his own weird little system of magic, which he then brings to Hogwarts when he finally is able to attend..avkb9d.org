Say, around the age of 7-9, Harry Potter is exposed to tabletop RPGs, and since he's still having incidents involving accidental magic, he figures, hey, maybe he's magic too. Perusing all kinds of tabletop RPG books, he comes up with his own magical system that's a mishmash of the Vancian magic system in /Dungeons & Dragons/, the force/drain, adept magic and spirit summoning systems of /Shadowrun/, the spell construction system of /Ars Magica/, etc. And while he does learn the magic system taught at Hogwarts, he ultimately still prefers his own mishmash magic system.


** Harry Potter, self-styled Sorcerer, stared at the letter in his hands.

"I'm a /Wizard?/" he asked the giant who had delivered it incredulously. "I study magic, but my magic is inherited?"

"S'pose so," the man rumbled. "Nobody's sure how magic is passed on, o'course. Otherwise we'd have more to do for the poor, sorry Squibs, and I reckon that Mugglebo-"

"Do you realize what this /means?/" Harry gasped, interrupting Hagrid. "I'm not a Wizard or a Sorcerer. I'm an ARCANIST!"

He grinned from ear to ear. "Which means that this is Pathfinder! Which means..."

He locked eyes with the giant.

"M-my point allocation..." he moaned, suddenly despondent. "But how could I have known? What kind of maniac would realize they had inborn magic abilities and bump INT instead of CHA?"

Miles away, a bushy-haired, buck-toothed nerd with an abrasive personality sat straight up in bed. "I don't know why," said Hermione Granger, slowly, "but I feel a strange urge to... roll initiative."

*** Bravo! Brilliant! Encore!

Edit: Side note, the reason I only mentioned D&D, Shadowrun and Ars Magica is because they existed in the time frame of Potter's childhood in the original timeline, whereas a lot of other systems with interesting magic systems, like PF, didn't.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20 may be of interest to you. It's about an OC dnd wizard who ends up in the Harry Potter universe but still plays by dnd rules. It's really good, too.

*** Already read it. Unfortunately, don't particularly like it after the first 10 chapters, because it goes kind of all squishy for me, rules-wise.

** I have thought about doing one where Harry is forced by Dudley to DM for his friends and when Harry goes to Hogwarts he realizes he would rather have the AD&D spells and invents them instead of the Hogwarts ones.

The spell slot system is what I meant by "Vancian magic system".

**** I know what Vancian magic is. I was saying what I would do if I wrote it. The spell slot system (without the more powerful AD&D spells) would be quite inferior to wizarding world magic.

***** I don't know, man. If he combines the spell slot system with the force and drain system from /Shadowrun/ and the spell creation system of /Ars Magica/, Harry could create practically any spell he could dream of, and power it with his own life force, making each casting as weak or powerful as he needs them to be.

But D&D spells would work too, if he didn't want to design and build his own spells.

** I wrote a shitty fanfic a while ago about mixing Dnd And HP

It's found here

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10661645/1/Harry-Potter-is-a-Wizard]]

â€‹

Year 1 I think is decent if a bit too self-important sometimes. Year 2 is unfinished and a mess, and if I ever return to it I would re-write it.
