I've been rereading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Masters Ball) recently. It's a pokemon/HarryPotter crossover fic where Hogwarts is a trainer school. Great idea, really good initial worldbuilding and merging of the worlds and things like Animagi, Gyms, starter pokemon, the classes, the Whomping Willow, Sirius, the Dursleys and Harry staying with them...then it just gets so dumb.

Luna is a 4th wall breaking half veela that continuously mentions pop culture mid-conversation with absolutely no relevance in the most "holds up spork" way imaginable, it's actively mentioned multiple times how Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione is a ridiculous concept (which like, grand, but not in the middle of your fic...), No one seems to have any actually powerful pokemon if they aren't actively at school, Harry up and leaves school around book 5 I think...

Then you get Jack and his war. The war is between two regions (pokemon countries because why bother with the unique setting you originally set up, lets sack off the real world) Jack is an OC who leads this worlds version of the IRA with no understanding of their motives or tactics and presented in a completely glorious light with no attempt at the author rebuking him being an out and out terrorist (not biased because i'm Northern Irish, there's just absolutely no nuance there, also just to be clear i'm not the one bringing up the IRA, that's the author who gives them all terrible Irish accents). It's at this point it becomes very clear (if you stupidly like me ignored the several page long A/N's that explain the history of the pokeRA every chapter) that that this is actually the main character and the story the author wants to be writing.

Now you might have noticed I haven't mentioned like any HP characters or plot points in a while. This is a feeling you will get frequently by Book 3/4. The author actually says at one point they aren't going to bother because we've already read loads about them in canon (which they didn't read, but got a good idea from wikipedia).

This has turned into a rant but I LOVED the premise and oh dear goodness it gets bad fast. What about you? Anything similar?


** Almost all of robst's fics. He has some really neat premises ("What if Harry got expelled and obliviated after his trial?", "What if Fudge threw him in Azkaban for murdering Diggory after the Triwizard?", "What if Harry were raised by Goblins?"), but the rest of it is almost always super bland and samey.

I really like the idea of magical space travel, and I would love to see it done well, but the setup where wizards get completely wiped out by the muggles didn't work for me.

Of course, the extreme casualties they suffered on their voyage was kind of expected too. Interstellar travel was supposed to be risky, with magic or not.

** ^{/Disclaimer: this will not be everyone's cup of tea/}

There was one I got most of the way through when I first discovered the realm of fanfiction (and BDSM) that was SS/HG, with Snape being a seasoned dominant who'd trained many submissives, and Hermione wanted to become a/his sub. It was good at the beginning, she was a bit of a brat and there was some hot-and-cold style angst as there tends to be in smut, but the further I got into it, the more times he would do something impulsive or stupid and apologize and plead "I've made so many mistakes with you," all while practicing horrible BDSM etiquette that took me right out of the story. Eventually though, the turning away point for me was when they decided to take it from in the bedroom to adopting it as their lifestyle, which led to him telling her what she could and couldn't do to help Harry and Ron find horcruxes, dictating whether or not she could even talk to them... By the time I gave up, she'd entirely lost any semblance of /being/ Hermione because she wasn't /allowed/ to be. I'm sure it was supposed to ultimately become a "Hermione rises up: We can be equals even if we're dom/sub, so let me do what I want sometimes" sort of exchange but I was tired of waiting for that part of the story.

I'm irritated all over again just writing that out. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I think I removed it from my bookmarks out of spite when I finally got fed up, which is a shame because I would have liked to link it.

They're both mostly romance-focussed, although OO also includes some aspects of sex magic in her stories. Usually I prefer stories with some more action-based storylines but I can look past it in these cases. Desert Sea also has a few in that genre and she always has really interesting twists. I've linked some examples but all of them have written loads of stories.

****** I don't remember it being there when I first read the fic, though it's possible I just skipped over it. More than that, Harry allegedly embodies the traits of all the houses, but he never shows any cunning whatsoever and this fic had him thinking on his feet and taking initiative and I appreciated that.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I saw a story once where the author tried to portray most of dumbledore's actions simply as a man who's just not in touch anymore with what children 2 generations younger than him act and think like.

I remember thinking that the story could've been better if 1) it was just some drabbles in chronological order, but with no real plot in between or 2) if there was an actual plot driving the story forward, besides just a canon rehash with some funny dumbledore situations.
