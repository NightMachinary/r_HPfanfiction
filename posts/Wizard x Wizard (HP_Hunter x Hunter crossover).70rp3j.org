** Huh. You know. The Nen system feels like it could work in the world built by JKR. But that's more because Togashi knows how to build power escalation (his two major works display this with Hunter being much tighter).

Still. I don't how I feel about this.

*** There's actually going to be some interesting stuff regarding magic and Nen, probably. So far Hisoka thinks Harry's magic is Nen and Harry thinks Hisoka's Nen is magic. XD And yeah, Togashi's power escalation is fantastic. But ya know, you're never going to know how you feel unless you try it out~! I think you will like it, though. Phase One of the Exam is done now, though, if that helps any.
