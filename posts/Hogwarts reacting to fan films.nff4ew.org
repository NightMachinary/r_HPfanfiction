So I always see fics about Hogwarts reading the books or videos, but what about them reacting to fan films. 4 films that i think would make a great reaction is Severus Snape and The Marauders, Sisters of the House of Black, Neville Longbottom and the Black Witch, and Voldemort: Origins of the Heir. I think it would be interesting to see their reactions.
