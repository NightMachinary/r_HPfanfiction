What if Lily and Petunia had a (semi-)estranged half-brother, who lived in the US? Or an aunt that lived in New Zealand? Better yet, in crossover scenarios, what if their relative was super-powered but not magically? e.g. Charles Xavier is their uncle.

Would Dumbledore have still placed him with the Dursleys? Why/Why not?


** The Dursleys would still be Harry's closet living relatives and Petunia has known about Magic for a long time

** Thing is, Petunia would still be Harry's closest relative, meaning the blood ward would be more powerful if he was staying with her. The blood wards makes it so that no wizards with the intent to harm the Dursleys or Harry could come close to the house.

If Harry wasn't with Petunia, maybe the blood ward would be weaker ? Like, it's growing exponentially the closer your blood relationship is, so it's mother, then sibling, then aunt/uncle, and after that no matter how much you're loved it justs harm the dark wizard, and not outright stops him.

Also, Petunia was aware of magic, meaning she could deal with Harry. She didn't do it well, so imagine if a muggle from the 1980's USA had to deal with a magical child ?

As for crossovers scenarios, it's even worse. What's to tell Dumbledore that the super powerfull [insert super powerfull character] has Harry's best intention in mind ? This person has probably a job, many people gunning to take him out, and probably doesn't have the time or the money to deal with a magical child that will also brings his fair share of trouble. And what if that super powerfull character turned out to be evil the whole time ? It's not only the life of a young child, but the life of the, as depicted by a prophecy, only hope to defeat Voldemort.

I know I wouldn't give Harry to an unknown like that.

I just want to point that Petunia's love (or rather lack off) didn't have any impact on the Blood Protection. Said protection was powered by /Lily/'s love, while Petunia was only there as a refill. She only needed to accept Harry into her home to maintain the protections, and loving Harry would not have made any difference when it comes to his protections (it would not be any stronger).

Concerning the extended family, I have no idea. Petunia was conveniant because she was the closest to Lily, and already knew about magic (so you could explain everything in a letter). But I'm not sure anyone else would have accepted into his home a baby he found in front of his door, especially if the only explanation is a letter saying "/The kid is your extended nephew, he is a wizard (yeah magic exist) just like his parents, a dark wizard killed them and now for some reasons I need you to raise him until his majority, thanks/".

** Yes, he would still put them with the Dursleys.

Dumbledore believes in the prophecy. (Between them, he and Voldemort made it self-fulfilling.) He also believes that Voldemort is not gone for good.

Therefore, he knows that Harry will be needed *in the UK* to fight Voldemort again. He is not going to risk giving Harry to a guardian that might even possibly keep Harry on another continent instead of sending him to Hogwarts. He needs Harry to want to protect the UK and Hogwarts in particular.
