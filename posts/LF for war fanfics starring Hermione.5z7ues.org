Hi, i'm looking for any fanfics in relation to Hermione trying to survive/fighting the war. As long as the story itself is taking place during the war. one example of fanfic that i really like is To Begin Again by RZZMG. :) any recommendations is appreciated.


** There are too many fics meeting that criteria, so I will pick a few of my favorites in which she was both a brilliant mastermind and a terrifying warrior:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822&rewrite=true][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]], linkffn(2746577)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925)

As someone else already pointed out, all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]]'s HP fics wrote her this way.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

**** Canon pairings.

Weasleys were quite different in this story. Ron was nicer, his parents were still good, but the same could not be said for his other relatives. [[/spoiler][by the way, his grandpa was the Duke of Wellington, and his mother Mariam was the Princess of Prussia]]

The summary of the fic isn't that great, but the actual story is fairly good

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
