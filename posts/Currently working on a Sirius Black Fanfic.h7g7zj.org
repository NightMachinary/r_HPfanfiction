Hello!

I've been working on a Sirius Black Fanfic that takes place during the Golden Trio Era. I've noticed there's a lack of fanfics that are set in this era (most are marauders fics), so I decided to write one. The first few chapter are uploaded on Wattpad, but I'm not sure if I should upload it on other sites as well ([[https://ff.net][ff.net]], AO3 etc). Let me know what you guys think?

Title: Embers

Summary: “After all this time, you still believe he's innocent?” He asked, watching her intently.

She took a drag off her cigarette, looking out at the night sky. The view from the Astronomy tower always seemed to amaze her, and yet she found herself wanting to run the other way, “I have to... I'll always choose him, in a heartbeat, without a pause, without a doubt. Always. He's my everything, and it sucks.”

Amara Raywood lost everything that fateful night of Hallows Eve. The dangers that followed forced her to leave the things she held most dear behind, including her godson. Now, she has been asked to come back to Hogwarts as a Professor, though, she finds her past still haunts her.
