We know of a few things that are seen as very hard or even impossible:

-Immortality (very hard)

-Bringing someone back from the dead (only possible with resurrection stone, unclear if it actually works or just creates imitations that lure the user to suicide)

-Making true gold (only with Philosopher's Stone) (possibly also applies to other precious metals)

-Making food out of nothing (duplicating food is ok)

-Getting useful and accurate information about the future (very hard)

What other things do you think could extreme challenges for wizards?

One of my ideas would be fighting climate change, because they'd have to create simple effect but at an incredible scale, and the available population is tiny.

*** Appendage/organ restoration in general. Taking Moody as an example, we see his eye (might be an advantage ofer his natural, and thus a choice rather than need) and his leg (actually impairs mobility, no reason not to fix if possible).

When it comes to vision, it's more complicated, because looking at Hogwarts, the number of people in glasses is really small. It almost comes down to Harry, Old People, and Powerful People, each of those groups has a good reason for it. Most people however, a crushing majority, do not have eye problems, even after up to 7 years in Snape's classroom getting fumes and acid in the eyes.

I'm not sure if it's canon, but from what I remember, only damage from Dark spells cannot be healed (e.g. George's ear). Given than Moody spent his entire career fighting Dark wizards, it's unsurprising that he has so many permanent injuries.

There's actually a pretty extensive [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Glasses#Known_wearers][list]] of characters who wore glasses, though I'm not sure if all of it is canon. At the very least, Percy, Arthur, James and Myrtle wore glasses, and they don't really fit into any of the three categories.

*** Eh, depends. A bit of legilimency can go a long way towards finding the winning sequence of actions that would result in the recipient of their affection falling in love with the enterprising witch or wizard.

I'd agree that love can't be directly compelled, but it can certainly be nudged to come your way.

**** I would argue that although the recipient would "fall in love" it still wouldn't be "true love". For someone to use this method, instead of trying to court the recipient, then they would be doing a disservice to the person that they claim to "love, put it simply, one wouldn't need such a method if it were actually "true love" and not either (or a combination of) lust or an unhealthy obsession.

** Forensics and investigation.

There are just /so many/ ways to magically cover your tracks, muddy the waters, or perform undetectable magic. It's little wonder so many trials are political shams when the objective truth is next-to-impossible to find with any degree of certainty.

** My theory is that magic operates on a different description of matter to Muggle chemistry. This idea is based on:

- The fact that alchemy exists and is real. Historical alchemy described matter very differently to the way chemistry now describes it.

- The fact that Hogwarts does not teach mathematics, which would be necessary if chemistry formed a part of transfiguration theory.

- The little transfiguration theory we know, which not only contains no chemistry, but also contains concepts which are very "unscientific" like "food".

- The fact that gold is magically special when chemically there's nothing unusual about it.

Now, in many ways magic operating on a different description of matter is an advantage. It means you don't need to know/understand Muggle science to cast magic, and indeed thinking of matter in Muggle terms might /hinder/ you. It also means you're not limited by the constraints of chemistry.

However, the flip side is that probably you cannot transfigure things based on concepts which exist in Muggle chemistry but which do not exist in the magical description of matter. Does "uranium" exist in the magical system of matter? Possibly not. In which case it would be impossible to transfigure a nuclear bomb, because "uranium" is part of a different language to the language of transfiguration.

*** Gold is interesting, actually, in that its inner electrons move at a significant fraction of the speed of light so its properties are a bit different than you might expect; it's much softer, denser, and less reactive than you'd expect based off of normal periodic table trends. (Mercury is also a liquid at room temperature due to similar effects)

I agree with all of your points, but if one wanted a more physicsy magic for their fic this would be a reasonable explanation for why gold is harder to transfigure, with the added consequence that you can't transfigure any elements over ~190 g/mol. Might also explain why wizards don't accidentally kill themselves with radiation more often.

** Generally, I'd say difficult magic covers two main fields - combating other magic, and combating particularly complex reality.

eg. For the first, if someone casts the AK at someone, that's a powerful spell making someone dead. If you want to stop them being dead, then you have to make a 'resurrection spell' more powerful than that.

eg. For the second, reality involves a lot of systems with interrelated parts. It's the old 'one problem with twelve causes where each cause is also making the other causes worse' problem. To fix the problem, you'd essentially have to fix each of the causes at the same time. It's not impossible, but it would be more difficult than one magical wafting a stick once.

** The flippant answer: Whatever is required to be difficult by the plot is difficult / impossible for HP magic.

Most traditional divination's, despite the existence of the subject, seem to be something HP magic cannot produce.

Dismantling existing magic is also a weak point. Sure you can (maybe) counter a single magical effect with a very specific and probably costly counter but anything more potent than that appears to be impossible.

More generally, there don't seem to many options to go beyond one wizard waving one wand to create localised human scale effects. Going beyond that scale either in power or in volume while not impossible seems to be very difficult.

If it's more or less nonstop, and they are unstoppable without magic, and their fear prevents people from fleeing if they get too close, they could do an incredible amount of population damage, especially of let loose in a densely populated area like New York or Shanghai.

** It would be pretty easy to summon the trash in a certain area, even ocean trash, and then vanish it. I don't know if you can summon gases in the air, but since they are just very small particles, it must be doable. That would help with what you call climate change, and what most people call pollution.
