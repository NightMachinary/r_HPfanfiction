Are there any fics where Harry just doesn't care about social morality and if someone offends him, bullies him or tries to control him... he just attacks in the most violent way possible?

Like first example... Draco pulls his wand and tries to curse Harry. Harry dodges and pulls out a knife then slits Draco's throat, letting him fall to the ground to bleed out.

Or Dumbledore orders Harry back to the Dursley's and Harry says no. Dumbledore gets aggressive and orders him to go and Harry just steps toward his desk then stabs a knife through Dumbledore's wand hand then shoves a second through his eye into his brain while he's screaming and distracted by the pain.

Stories where Harry has no voice of reason and can be ultra violent and not care. Do any exist?


** This sounds Horrible!

*** Me too, so often Harry just takes the abuse or whines and complains. He never fights back because he's scared of being punished.

Truth is... the Wizarding world needs him more than he needs it. He is the chosen one, the only one able to kill Voldemort.

Basically he could slaughter anyone who annoys him and get off scot free because if they do anything, he can refuse to kill Voldemort. If they snap his wand and send him to the muggle world... again, no one to kill Voldemort. If they lock him up.. same result.

He can do anything he wants and yet he's always scared to do anything so everyone walks all over him.

** Not exact, but Harry doesnt really have normal emotions, and is willing to take everything so literally that he almost kills a person at least once.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

** If such a story does exist, it wouldn't be very long. At the first provocation, Harry would react violently...and immediately be arrested by the Ministry, convicted, and sent to Azkaban on murder charges.

*** True but knowing that only he can kill Voldemort, he wouldn't be there long. Dumbledore would let it slip to the news or Ministry and force them to release him.

Might try to make Neville the new BWL, but once Voldemort returned and killed Neville... they'd have to get Harry out.
