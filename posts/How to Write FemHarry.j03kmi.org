I've gotten a mad desire to write FemHarry after years of kinda brushing it off.

I was wondering if there was any advice anyone had for writing her? Tropes or contrivances they'd seen that I should avoid? Tips etc. I've read quite a few in the genre and I've written female characters before but any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT:

Sorry for making a blanket comment but these have all been really helpful.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!


** Dudley would not be able to get away with harassing a girl as much, and FemHarry would end up in a different social circle at Hogwarts, but other than that, not much changes. Of course, different friends means no one to save Ginny for example, and the PoA plot might go differently (FemHarry might never hear of Ron's or Hermione's pet for example). And if she sits with someone else on the train, she might end up in a different house. But her personality should be similar to regular Harry.

** linkffn(*Hermione Granger's Guide To Gender Flip Fanfiction*) gives some good advice about how to write a Gender Fic story, and even if you don't find anything to help you it's still an entertaining read.

Now if I had to say one thing, just like with an OC, don't make your Fem! Harry perfect. Just because she had a vagina doesn't mean that she has to be better than everyone in class, still a Quidditch star, and be so beautiful that every boy (plus some girls) in the school are ine love with her. Give her some believable strenght and weakness (whenever they are the same in canon or not).

Also, if Harry's gender is the only change from canon, try to think about how it would change his uprising. Would the Dursley still give her Dudley's cast off (it may seem "strange" for neighbourhoods)? Would Dudley still bully her (with Harry you can cay "boys will be boys, but she is a girl there)? Would she still be sorted in Gryffindor? Would she still hit off with Ron or would she prefer to hand out with some girls like the Patil twins? And so on . . .

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** Depends on if you want an always fem!Harry or gender-bent fem!Harry. If it's the first: go nuts. I've written the most clich√© ever evil fem!Harry in which Vernon is a child molester and I paired her with Riddle of all the possible pairings...first ever fanfic, lmao. Then I have another in which she never went to Hogwarts and is eighteen, smokes cigarettes and weed and has tattoos and just wants nothing to do with the magic world. In my newest fem!Harry fic the Irish Goddess Morrigan picks her out as her successor and she has to learn to handle becoming a deity in a magic world where the old gods are forgotten. I mean, you can go completely crazy there. Treat her as if you write a male Harry, just remember that this one has breasts and a vagina.

You can, of course, write a standard retelling of the original story and weave in the theme of classic female roles in the magic world and whatnot, different expectations and everything. I'd read that for as long as it wouldn't be a word-for-word retelling of the books.

It's your playground and you can do with it what you want.

Now, genderbender fics are a bit different. I also am writing one of those. There you have to find the balance between too little and too much angst. Obviously, having your gender changed from one moment to another is a life-altering experience and you have to remember that. *But* reading about a Harry breaking down in every chapter because he suddenly has breasts would get old real quick. On the other hand, a Harry who just shrugs his new equipment off and accepts liking boys like it's nothing new would also be questionable at best. I tried to be positive about the changes over the course of first to third year, with the second year almost wrapped up. Obviously, the sexuality there is up to you, the other, angsty themes regarding the gender change are not. It has to be balanced. Too much angst is just as bad as too little.

** So I enjoy a gender switched Harry, but I typically prefer ones where Harry was always a girl and where that's only one of many changes (like Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). Best gender bend Harry I've ever read is probably [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]].

One thing that has bugged me in some fics is the obsession with menstruation. One fic I read (Harry was originally a boy) had Harry continually thinking about how her body was now able to make babies and was "becoming a woman." And it was just weird and awkward. That certainly wasn't what I was thinking when I had my first period. I also never looked in a mirror to consider my womanly shape (bigger hips etc). Admittedly I'm not the most self aware person in the world, but Harry isn't known for that either.

Using muggle hygiene products for periods also seems a little odd to me. Like magic doesn't need to fix everything, but I can't help but feel they should at least have magical equivalents. I'm okay with the issue being ignored entirely, but if you choose to mention it please don't make it weird.

** I would avoid a name like Harriet, it can easily give the impression that James and Lily were being lazy when picking a name for their kid. Generally most Fem!Harry fics use one of three naming conventions for Fem!Harry 1. British Royality names 2. Just any relatively common girl's name for the time period in Britain. 3. Flower/Plant names. All of those conventions are fine with the flower names you've just got to make sure it sounds like a name for a human.

Also, as with any AU one change is going to naturally lead to several other changes here and there and those changes should be explored in the fic.

Finally, in regards to pairings, IMO you should ask yourself if the pairing still works if Harry were still male (and was of the appropriate sexualality), and if it wouldn't then that's probably not a good pairing for Fem!Harry either.

** For me drastic name changes really put me off from reading it. Because then it feels like I'm just reading an oc. Keeping the brave, headstrong, humble, and adventurous Harry in fem form is the most important thing in my opinion. A lot of authors who suddenly write fem Harry either make her this ultra feminine sex bomb fem fatale or a very meek shadow of themselves. So keeping the core characteristics of what makes Harry who he is, is important when writing fem Harry in my opinion. A Harry who is not Mary Sue but just as outspoken and athletic as his counterpart. These are some of my favorite fem Harry's

** There are many ways to do it. Personally my approach is that the gender flip has to result in significant changes to Harry's character and circumstances, else there doesn't seem much point in doing it.

Like, sure, I guess there are people out there who are interested in reading canon with a few pronouns changed. But that doesn't interest me at all.

  There is a psychopath wanting to kill her, a girl in this situation tends to be scared, isolated, sulky and wanting to protect herself, looking for a way out, the last thing she will do is think about sex, dating or sports, for God's sake.
#+end_quote

As opposed to boys who only care about sportsball and getting laid in the midst of mortal danger. That's some yikes-y gender essentialism ya got there. The thing is.. for much of the original timeline Voldemort is a nebulous and/or distant threat. Regardless of gender, they shouldn't be focused on Quidditch or fretting over crushes while dodging curses, but there is plenty of down time for the character to become preoccupied with normal teenage concerns. There's also the possibility of a character using those things as a distraction from the reality of their situation.

**** Love it and I understand where you are coming from but as I said I think that this territory of the concerned protagonist who wants to find a way out is little explored because of the fear of moving away from the canon. we must also take into account the girl's personality, if she is not a Harry in a female body then she will act differently. now something that really makes me sleepless is about the experience of the girl Harry in the graveyard. It is this moment that will make her act or run. The other teenagers are still acting normal because they didn't see Vold, but she saw him, she was alone in a cemetery with two men, a giant snake and the body of a dead friend, I see little care for the authors of Fem!Harry when that crucial moment comes. it's not the same experience as the boy and it's not the same reaction. I am a girl and honestly i would have had an outbreak I would go irreparably crazy

****** Because boys and girls react differently is simple. You know, Harry comes from the Muggle world which is surrounded by sexual, moral and physical dangers and threats against girls all the time. even if the fic follows the canon, Peter rips her shirt off and cuts her, Voldemort stands alarmingly close and puts his hand on her face. that alone is enough for a temporary mental crisis. Depending on what experiences she had before Hogwarts or how Petunia raised her, she may react better or worse. there is no way in the earth the girl will have the same personality as canon Harry honestly... imo

** I think someone mention it all ready but I need to stress the importance of not making her perfect.

Most FemHarry fics biggest mistake is that they are all self-inserts of the author, self fulfilling fantasies and while that is part of the reason people write fanfic is important to keep a level of realism. A good character doesn't need to always have the answer or solve the problem or be the smartest and strongest. I recommend you look for the characteristics of a Mary Sue and try to avoid them as you write.

Do not go heavy on the compliments to her appearance, is okay to make her beautiful but is just boring if every single male character falls for her or compliment her looks.

About the name I personally love Harriet as a name and find it easier to think of the character as Harry if she can keep the name but that's personal taste. One of the best femaHarry I ever read is Jasmine from A Long Journey Home of Rakeesh and the name never bothered me.

Apart from that one I think the Harry from The Never-ending Road from Laventadorn is the one I like the most speaking exclusively about characterization. She has a consistent personality and there is so much character development and her friendship with Hermione is just too sweet, but most of all she has flaws.

Good Luck and have fun
