** As much as I like Ron, fourth year really isn't his best showing. Harry's point of view is understandable, he's been forced into a life threatening tournament that he has no desire to be apart of.

Ron's point of view is jealousy over his friend being forced into a life threatening tournament that he has no desire to be a part of and refusing to believe that he didn't enter himself.

You could argue that Ron's jealousy stems from deep seeded insecurity from being the youngest boy of a family of incredibly skilled brothers. I would counter that saying Harry and Ron had Been through three years of trials and in every instance Harry has proven that Ron can not only count on him, he can trust him.

In fourth year Ron ignores that history and that trust, and lets his jealousy win. I feel, and i would argue most would agree, that Ron is objectively in the wrong in this instance and his point of view is only worth knowing so that it can be acknowledged as wrong.
