Okay, so maybe way back in around 2005 or so I was still reading Harry/Draco fanfiction. While I've certainly grown out of the pairing itself, I found myself delving back into the old stories of great writers that I used to read. I've already re-read a lot of Maeglin Yedi's stuff and possibly about to start re-reading Telanu's Tea Series.

However before I do any of this there is one story that I cannot seem to find. It doesn't help that I don't know the name of the fic either.

All I can remember is laughing really hard and having my breath taken away at how stunningly dark and funny the fic is. I do believe it was Draco/Harry, and involved Draco going to the light side, but Hogwarts was literally completely surrounded by the Death Eaters. At one point Draco leans out one of the windows and shouts hello to his father before Harry jerks him back inside.

I also remember something along this line: "Why were you mouthing 'tomatoes' at me during dinner?"

Also something about Harry asking Hermione if semen really contained protein and she said yes, but he shouldn't tire himself out trying to survive off of himself.

It's killing me and I really just want to re-read this for the hilarity of Draco's antics. Any help is appreciated and thanks so much!
