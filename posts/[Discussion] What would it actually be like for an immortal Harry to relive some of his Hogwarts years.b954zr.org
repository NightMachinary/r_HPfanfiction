So, I am at the beginning stages of working on a story where we see the consequences of time travel. In canon, Hermione warns that "terrible things" happen to wizards who meddle with time, but I rarely ever see true consequences in fanfic. So I wanted to take the stereotypical master of death, immortal Harry trope and experiment with consequences. Without giving too much away, Harry accidentally runs into his younger self (at the beginning of OoTP) and they somehow... combine. Basically just taking off of the whole idea given in PoA that you shouldn't see yourself while time traveling.

So, now Harry is waking up and has to deal with no longer being an adult, no longer being independent. And it's gotten me to thinking, what exactly would an immortal Harry be like? I think it's within his character to imagine that he idealizes his childhood friends and idealizes the adventures they went on. I imagine it to be much how older people look back on their youth as "ideal" and the current world as flawed. Only more so since he's ~800 years old. So there will be disappoint when things aren't as great as he remembers. And also people are going to probably feel disposable to him, maybe more like pets - even though he'd never dare admit it. But it's a side effect of outliving everyone. Also, he won't be able to remember every detail of how things unfold, maybe the big details and gets confused on the order of some smaller events. Not to mention events/outcomes will change.

But where I am getting stuck, is what would happen once he gets to Hogwarts - as far as realistic consequences to immortal Harry being there. I could see him trying to dumb himself down, but doesn't quite get it right because he hasn't been around school children in a while. So he still attracts attention on that front. Dumbledore may legitimately fear that Voldemort is possessing him somehow. His friends aren't going to like how he's treating them and he's going to be distraught by them not being these idealized people he remembers. But then what? Realistically how would Dumbledore react? Would he wait and see? Would he try to pry? We see in book 5 Dumbledore basically ignoring Harry because of his connection with Voldemort. So what would Dumbledore do here? Would Harry even bother staying at Hogwarts for his whole 5th year? The plot I have so far could definitely work with him not being at Hogwarts. I guess I just want to create a really realistic immortal Harry, realistic consequences for Harry, and realistic consequences for time travel. Any help/suggestions would really be appreciated!


** Read linkffn(basilisk-born) as it has something similar to this. I feel dumbledores reaction would depend on when he noticed. For instance Harry saw someone die right in front of him and was tortured and nearly killed by a fully reborn full power Voldemort. That would be enough to change pretty much anyone. A good bit of knowledge can be attributed to simply reading and we see a pretty independent Harry already in fifth year canon so it wouldn't be too big a stretch. I feel like Harry would be distant and different because the friends he has haven't been through the same things his older friends has so they're not the same person. I feel like dumbledores reaction would depend on how he found out and what kind of dumbledore you're going for. Evil dumbledore, human dumbledore, Harry must die dumbledore, etc.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

*** I will definitely start reading that fic. I've seen it recommended a lot but have never gotten around to reading it.

As far as Dumbledore goes, I want to keep him as close to canon Dumbledore as possible. I am thinking that he would act cautiously from a distance and then might subtly challenge him to see what he's capable of. I just don't know if once it's known that something is different how Dumbledore would respond.

**** You need to decide what interpretation of canon dumbledore you want to use though. Manipulative, greater good, human, stuff like that. If manipulative he'd probably freak out more whereas human or greater good wouldn't be as bad I'd think.

***** Okay, I see what you mean now. I think I am leaning towards more human with some greater good aspects in there. Of course he'll be seeing Dumbledore through a different perspective being older, so I think he might appear more human to Harry because of it? This gives me something to think on a little more too.

****** I used to see dumbledore in a worse light but if it's first person I'd suggest looking at things from an adult perspective. For instance when I was younger my thoughts were more dumbledore should be getting Harry ready to fight and giving him information and all. But now I can only imagine myself doing exactly that and trying to find any option that doesn't place a child on the front lines of a war. Also definitely decide how old you want to make the Harry in control when this happened as it will effect maturity and reasonable knowledge. Another is how close things should follow cannon. I'd suggest using the whole butterfly effect thing with changes becoming more and more pronounced as time goes on. Also is this world going to be the same as the one he came from or is it going to be more alternate reality based then time travel.

******* Yeah I definitely need to nail down the exact age of Harry. I am working on flushing out the butterfly effect as well. Like Harry missed the dementors, so there will be a whole plot point there later on of how this effected the Dursley's. And the world that Harry finds himself in is the canon world. Though it won't stay cannon for very long. There will be somethings that stay the same of course, but I really want to get away from stations of canon. I really appreciate your help, this is my first fic so I appreciate any and all help!

******** What kind does Harry come from? Is it the same or different? That would allow you to keep future knowledge from being too useful which is a major reason people follow stations of canon. Just DONT under any circumstances do a bullshit reason to follow canon that gets people to stop reading real fast. I don't remember the name but there was one story where Harry had the prophecy, he knew Voldemort had a plan to lure him there to get it, knew Sirius and everyone was safe and somehow still ended up in the DoM fight. That is something that makes me and others drop a fic fast.

** Certainly things like lack of empathy, complete boredom and frustration at everyday life, inability to connect to anyone in school, or even teachers in their 30s/40s... Realistically, the person who he's going to relate most to is Dumbledore. In fact, you could have manipulative!Dumbledore in full swing and immortal!Harry would think it's all very reasonable.

Now you said he "combined" with his younger self, so it's not just him there. Does he have access to all his memories? All his power and skills? Maybe he's lost access to magic that he'd taken for granted for centuries. Which personality is in control? Are they fighting? Maybe he thinks that the other personality inside him is Voldemort, when it's actually his younger self. Maybe the ultimate tragedy is that immortal!Harry is simply incapable of winning against Voldemort, so he needs to give up his consciousness (i.e. die) and let 15yo!Harry resume his life.

*** I am wanting to have canon Dumbledore as much as I can. But I like your point that he would have a hard time relating to just about everyone. And I also like your point that Harry would understand Dumbledore's motives more so being older. I think that I will incorporate that into the story.

As far as "combined" goes, basically older Harry was consumed by younger Harry because older Harry isn't a natural element to the time period. So older Harry has taken over the body. However, muscle memory for spells and fighting, physical strength and anything else that would have been stored in the body is set at where young Harry would be. So his center of balance will be off and he'll have to relearn how to cast spells because the wand movements are no longer natural.

As far as his memories, he remembers his childhood like a lot of older people do - it's kind of a blur and more like a dream than reality. There are of course major points that he remembers, but the details of it are fuzzy.

I really like your idea of the two Harry's and him having to truly die for Voldemort to die. I also wanted to incorporate in the scar horcrux and have problems with it because of it have to get used to older Harry's soul in the body.

Do you think with all the boredom and frustration that Harry would stay at school? I could see him leaving but I don't know what would be the final straw or what would be enough to trigger it...

**** Hard to say. It depends on what sort of story you want to tell, and how you've characterised him up to that point. If it were my story, I could definitely see him getting frustrated within the first couple of months of just normal school, leaving to go and try and kill Voldemort/fix everything, but failing and probably making things worse in some way. But then he'd return to school and be really depressed for a while (especially since Umbridge would gloat). I don't know where I'd take it from there, though.

** I wanna see it played comical where he keeps getting Draco mixed up with his half-Weasley grandson, and keeps forgetting which Dark Lord it is alive right now.

"Wait, Longbottom? He's not in Azkaban yet?"

"What? Why?"

"I uh...thought I read an article about a Longbottom that was in Azkaban for a few dozen grisly vigilante murders, must be misremembering."

** I'm assuming the horcrux is still in his head. I can't see him willingly walking to his death again so that could cause problems. He also idealized dumbledore so I could see Harry coming clean to him rather quickly if only for the sake of having someone to talk to who isn't a kid.

*** I was hoping to have more tension in whether or not he would tell Dumbledore. I think that there would be questions about if he's truly immortal if getting hit by a killing curse is enough to knock out horcrux. I am thinking that they will have to destroy the horcrux another way.
