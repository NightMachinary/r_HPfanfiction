Been reading fics like A Long Journey Home and Hope's Calling, they're making me hungry for more high quality immortal fics. Preferably not abandoned ones.


** Look for Crossovers that are "stronger" that HP Canon

Marvel

DC

Star Wars

Mass Effect

Twilight (Yes This has lots of Immortal!Harry Stories, most are Slash or Fem!Harry Though)

Things like that

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) This fic has not been abandoned, it is still in progress. Harry is being returned to his own birth over and over again until something happens, but he's not sure what. After several lives of trying hard to eradicate Voldemort in various ways, then trying to eradicate himself in various ways, Harry tries a completely different approach. Possibly not immortal, but after several hundred years, who's counting? A very mature and intriguing story.
