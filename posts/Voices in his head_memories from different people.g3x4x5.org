  Crush the world beneath your heel. Destroy everyone who has ever slighted you. Tear down creation just to see if you can. Kill anything beautiful. Take what you want. Desecrate everything.

**** Things just barely starting to happen by the end of chapter two and then it's been abandoned for five years on an interlude for chapter three. If you value your time, I wouldn't waste it on this story.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!

** linkffn(12468148) - not sure if it fits but Dumbledore wakes up after his death and finds that he's 5-6 years old Harry. It's abandoned but 65k words are still good.

  On that dreadful night, Albus Dumbledore is struck down by his friend and fellow staff member, Severus Snape, whilst the Death Eaters watch on in glee and Harry in horror. Seconds after the Curse strikes him, Albus finds himself waking up in the seven year-old body of Harry Potter. Reincarnated as the Boy-Who-Lived he now has to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for !HP

** One of my favourite examples of this trope - This Death and That Death and That One Over There. It's... an interesting premise. MoD Harry is master of Death. Of EVERY Death. And Humanity has been real creative with the concept over the years. So he gets every Death God waking up and talking in his head.
