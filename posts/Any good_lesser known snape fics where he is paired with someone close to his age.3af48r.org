Well-written is a must (developed character/good dialogue preferred).

Slash or het both okay.

Just don't want a teacher/student pairing where the student is less than half his age.

Also magic is not required! I've read a couple of excellent fics based in the muggle world and would love to see more of that.

If this is too specific I'll honestly take whatever comes my way.

Thanks!!


** Hmm: I'm reading Prince of the Dark Kingdom and it has Snape dating an entymologyist. This is definitely a side plot, so its not what you're looking for. On the other hand, it has a believable emotionally whole Snape.

I also like of Muggles and Magic: It's ultimately Snape/Hermione, but its set in the Regency era. Hermione only goes to Hogwarts for a couple of years and then works as a governess for Snape as an adult, so marginally less squicky.

There's also one in which adult Hermione decides to have marriage of convenience with Snape once he's in Azkaban, which kind of subverts the Marriage Law Trope, if you might be interested.

Oh, I finally remembered one: The Birthday Present by excessivelyperky Snape is single for 700k words, but has a crush on Molly Weasley because Molly is kind to him. I think its really good. :) It has one of my favorite devices: Brewer's Bog, the idea that long-term potions-fume poisoning has been affecting Snape's health (mentally and physically).

*** I love Snape's character and his wife in Prince of the Dark Kingdom. That entire apart of the plot just works so well, but yes not quite what I'm thinking of (and I'm caught up with it). The birthday present sounds like it's exactly what I'm looking for, thank you! I will put that on my list :)

** My idea of well-written and yours, probably don't match up, but I enjoyed both of these stories. The first is unfinished but still interesting, linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) The second one is HG/SS, though they are the same age. It is a WIP but worth a look, linkffn(Happily Ever After the Fact by Tychesong)

  In 1998, Severus Snape was given a second chance. In 1976, he has to figure out how to take it.

  Hermione receives a letter from the Ministry informing her of a bit of new legislation, and attempts to deal with it in a unique way. My nod to the genre of Marriage Law Challenge fics (among others), originally written for Dragoon811 for the SSHG GiftFest 2014.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] by GreenGecko. Highly recommend. The actual Snape/OC pairing doesn't start until in the sequels, but it is very well written story overall. Plus Harry's powers are very unique in this one.

** There is linkao3(My Name is Cameron Sage by thesewarmstars). It's a fic where Harry goes back in time and is Harry/Snape, but it's not a teacher-student relationship because the two are at the same age and are equals in their friendship/relationship in terms of power. In fact, Harry grows and learns and gains quite a bit more power than Snape. Anyway, I liked it a lot and I'm typically not into slash fics. Give it a try!
