Just playing on the whole "British People love standing in lines" stereotype.


** Harry was staring up at the sky and just thinking, he did not notice ron coming up behind him and asking 'Mate what ya waiting for' he did not notice when ron started to lean against the wall and he didnt notice when hermione stood behind ron and start scolding him for leaning. he did not notice when when nevile come up and stood behind hermione and when colin stood behind nevile

he did not notice when snape started stalking the every growing line telling students to stand straighter and prouder.

he did not notice when the house elf's under orders from Dumbledore brought snacks and refreshments for those queuing.

** Harry turned around to see a line of people, eager yet patient with a hint of curiousity. Just as he was about to ask what was going on a hand grasped him on the shoulder.

"Harry... Harry I'm very disappointed...Your first signing event, and you're giving out autographs in some out of the way dingy hallway. You should have come to me boy, I could have helped you set up a publicity function with some flare. Not to worry, I've got a quick charm that will spruce the place up a bit."

Harry's denials fell on deaf ears as Gilderoy conjured a large banner overhead reading "Autographs from Gilderoy Lockhart and his protege Harry Potter". When Harry turned to run the banner collapsed and entangled his feet, tripping him as Colin's Camera flashed.

** Most of those people joined because Fred and George asked them to to prank Harry.

Colin took a picture of his reaction.

** Harry stared into the Defense room just before supper thinking over the term so far. Hermione had asked him to lead a defense course and he had tentatively agreed.

He thought of all four defense instructors they had previously and how much the room had changed over the years.

Never even really paying attention to Hermione prattling on about how meeting in the defense room could go badly he just kept thinking.

If he were to have his own defense room it would be much more active. Maybe even seven rooms, one for each year. Yeah the castle had plenty of room. He could easily have a different room for each room. Make them have to work, some challenges. If he could save the stone as a firstie something lighter should be an easy weekly course for the firsties.

Second year have them solve clues to find the damn room. Yeah move the room every week! Graduation time would involve them fending off some conjured snakes!

Third year he would have them form teams of hunters and hiders. Yeah, the hunters would have to capture the hiders. Make for some good team tactics that would. Graduation would be him hunting each class.

Fourth year a series of more difficult trials. Any who fail have to start over again from the start and catch up!

Hmmmm... fifth year.... oh that's brilliant. Owl year would be hunters again only worse. Yes, each class would have to disrupt the others classwork. That would be great!

Talking to himself he out loud finally he pondered sixth year.

"Maybe drop them off in groups into the Acromantula zone and make them survive for a day? After that see about getting a few dementors to chase them. Seems a bit harsh but I did both before end of third year."

Hermione noticed he had spoken finally and took the chance.

"Harry are you ready to start your practical defense class finally? I think everyone who's coming is in line already."

Startled Harry looked back and saw that dozens of students had from a line down the hall waiting to go in the class.

"What the bleeding hell?"

"Harry, language!"
