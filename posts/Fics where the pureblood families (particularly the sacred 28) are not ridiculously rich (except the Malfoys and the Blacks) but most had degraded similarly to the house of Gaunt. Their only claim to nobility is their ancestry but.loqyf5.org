#+TITLE: Fics where the pureblood families (particularly the sacred 28) are not ridiculously rich (except the Malfoys and the Blacks) but most had degraded similarly to the house of Gaunt. Their only claim to nobility is their ancestry but otherwise they are all broke and living in poverty.

That's why so many rally behind Voldemort when he actually promises to restore their houses to their former glory.


** I seriously think that the size of the magical Britain would limit the amount of wealth available, and so the most of wizards and witches were actually middle-class and families living in the ostentatious wealth (e.g., Malfoys) are financing their manors on debt.

*** So part of the reason Malfoy wants Voldemort to conquer everything is so his debts (and/or creditors) get wiped away?

As an alternative, maybe the hugeness and opulenceof Malfoy Manor is just due to Lucius and Narcissa constantly maintaining conjured/expanded sections and furnishings - if their spells wear out, it'll go back to being a three-bedroom farmhouse.

*** I mean the whole idea of wealth/money in a post scarcity society like magical Britain is rather puzzling. What sorts of things would you even need money for?

**** I don't think it is a post-scarcity society: merchants in the Diagon Alley wouldn't like to hear you don't want to spend money with them. And it would be hard for Weasleys to be as relatively poor as they are.

***** Isn't it canon that while they can't create food, they can expand existing food to last almost infinitely? They can conjure water.

****** Yeah, and all fanfiction writers know try to explain this away, because it seriously breaks the logic of such universe. Perhaps the multiplied food is not very good, perhaps the conjuration is not permanent (and what happens when the food which already dissolved into proteins and fats in your veins ceases to exist?), but we haven't seen anybody to do it in the canon, although it certainly is possible.

**** There's no post-scarcity. It's just that wizards don't need the same things as muggles.
