I'm not a fan of what the general idea seems to be with Harry Potter crossover fics. I decided to delve into the realm of crossovers after feeling a bit sick of the same settings, adversaries, and conclusions. Avengers is the largest medium that had crossovers that I thought I would enjoy. I was never a fan of Twilight, never seen or read Percy Jackson, and while I enjoyed Naruto I never thought those two would mesh well for me.

After combing through these fics over the last few weeks, I was really not a fan. The general idea for most of these stories is to drop just Harry into the Marvel universe. There was rarely if any sign of Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hogwarts, etc. In my mind, I'm questioning if this even fits the definition of a crossover. It's pretty jarring when all of the connections that Harry makes in the seven books is suddenly washed away with no hopes of returning. It's even worse when Harry never even sees the Wizarding World. Is he even Harry at that point?

Again, my crossover experience is only in Harry Potter + Avenger stories. However, I am curious to know if this a common occurrence in other crossovers.

Also if you have read any crossovers that use more Harry Potter characters than just Harry, please link them. Bonus points if Harry/Hermione/Ron are still central characters and good friends.


** There are all kinds of different crossovers. There are two that I am most aware of, not sure if there are more. They are those where characters get dropped into a new universe and maintain their core characteristics, or full on merging of universes.

I think when you have two completely separate universes, it tends to just be easier to have character drop crossovers rather than merger type crossovers. It seems like you're reading more of the character drop crossovers.

A merger type crossover would be like Child of the Storm linkffn(8897431) . It is an absolutely massive Marvel/HP/DC/etc merger crossover.

**** I would say that is more of a characteristic of either type rather than it's own separate type because to get the crossover you really only have a few options.

1) two worlds, same universe - merger universe

2) two worlds, different universe - either character drop or merge universe to end up with a crossover

** The nature of most crossovers are that they are fix it fics in disguise. How do you fix the engrained hatreds alliances and wars that set up a game of thrones. You drop in an outsider. It's why the powerful universe is dropped into the weaker. Captain America in Harry Potter is just a guy with a shield.

Harry is a great drop in character because he's incredibly reactive. He doesn't really have a goal in life or anything he's working on but he will at the drop of a hat emerge to fight evil when he discovers it. He is also incredibly emotionally isolated, he has two friends/family and that friends family he truly relies on with many tertiary friends at a slight distance that he maybe close too but his primary feeling is responsible for them.

Combining settings is shit. The author will spend pages telling you why all the setting bits that counter act eachother somehow actually fit but it's all filler nonsense.

Harry Potter is a setting that only works in a certain time period. It's also a story about how the magical world is chock full of old prejudice boring history and established precedents. The setting already requires massive handwaves in the destruction of electrical technology for it not instantly falling apart and be discovered.

The marvel universe could be seemlessly merged only if you were willing to match the time period.

Before the internet really kicked off.

It's the nature of most horror movies. It's the nature of a lot action movies. Certain tools available make a significant amount of plot or character struggle useless.

Hermione is the internet of books. She's smart she's determined but much of her plot relevance relies on how difficult information is to find in her universe and era. Ron has many hangups but ultimately also has the problem that made him leave. He actually has a family to get back to. He and his family are Harry's emotional rock having it would keep Harry from truly investing in a new world.

Practical physical heroics is never not relevant. Harry has always been about practicality. Hermione would Excell in bringing herself and others up to speed on a new setting but would also remove half the story by no longer requireing actually interaction with in universe characters.

Do you want a story about the trio walking in solving everything in five minutes? Or they do it by never speaking to anyone on the new universe except to pump for information? The third option is to contrive ways where they can't accomplish anything themselves, lose all their wands, become idiots or massively buff the new universe.

It's the simplest and arguably the best way to intersect universes.

** This is my preferred form of crossover - as limited as possible. Ideally just one character into another world, never to return.

I'm not a huge fan of merging worlds - it tends to do unacceptable violence to the HP magic system. A complete fusion whereby two worlds are synthesised into something new is OK, more like an entirely original world than a crossover of two recognisable worlds. But what I absolutely hate is stuff like having HP wizards in Britain and Dresden wizards in the US.

I'm also not a big fan of large casts interacting, which always feels very artificial and fanservicey.

** The single-character (or couple or small group) style of crossover is simpler and easier to write, in part because it provides a cleaner and more focused narrative: Drop a single stone in the pond, and watch the ripples spread. It also tends to require a lot less work to justify - you just need one single weird event, be it a bizarre accident, a special ritual, a negative space wedgie, etc...

At the other end of the spectrum is a merged-setting fic. These are, as other commenters have pointed out, very hard to get right, especially if the two settings have contradictory or incompatible elements. They also tend to require a lot of time spent on explaining the merger - how has the Wizarding World existed all this time and not previously interacted with other stuff? In your chosen crossover, did Grindelwald and the Red Skull know each other? Beyond that, there's the combined advantage and disadvantage of having both settings' antagonists to deal with - maybe some of the Death Eaters and/or their supporters are actually with Hydra, for example.

All this is not to say that a merger can't be done. Aside from "Browncoat, Green Eyes" that's been mentioned already, I'd point to three others as real standouts:

- linkffn(Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg) - Harry Potter / Stargate SG-1 (the author has some other very good crossovers as well)
- linkffn(The Man With No Name by Frostfyre7) - Firefly / Doctor Who, managing to capture the characters and feel of both settings at once
- linkffn(In Flight by gabriel blessing) - Sekirei / Fate/Stay Night, a phenomenally seamless merger of the two settings

** I usually prefer crossovers of the 'Wizard Educated Harry in Another Universe' variety.

Mostly, this is out of a sense of self-preservation. Full on 'fusions' are very difficult, and if you want a crossover between, say, A Song of Ice and Fire and Harry Potter, the fusion route really doesn't work at all. Sure, you /could/ fuse those two settings, I suppose, but to do so properly you pretty much have to completely change one or both of the sources. At that point it's really more like an original story that's reusing some names and character archetypes.

Even fusions between worlds that /are/ compatible are in great danger of collapsing under their own weight. When you take the characters and history of two settings, you have so many little bits and pieces that don't quite fit properly that have to be reconciled in some way. Not to mention the fact that you have two casts of characters to try and do justice to in some way.

Fusions work best when the worlds being fused don't make too many pronouncements about the world beyond their story, or general historical events. If they do, then the writer needs to get very creative, or they can side-step the issue. If you're more concerned with telling a story, than the technical process of worldbuilding, then the 'Drop in' crossover seems a reasonable solution.

This is the reason why my most recent story, a crossover with DC, I've gone with 'it's the HP world with a few additions, but DC heroes are starting to emerge in it'. Because a true fusion of those two worlds doesn't really leave us with a world in which the events of Harry's youth make any kind of sense.

** I generally prefer to keep my genres together, I.E. fantasy to fantasy. So HP-Game of Thrones or HP-Lord of the Rings, etc, /especially/ if it's just Harry who ends up in the other universe. That said, my personal favorite crossover involves Harry Potter and the Matrix linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4135485/chapters/9325320]]). This mixes aspects of both worlds so you have Harry and other HP characters playing some critical roles.

** The problem with entire world merging is that you usually have too very different set of rules and you end up dropping one or the other. I like the single character dropped in another world crossovers best because it focuses on only them and how they adapt to the new world. Harry is a very adaptable character who just seems to acceot all the crazy shit that happens to him making him oerfect for crossovers like this. That being said the MCU crossovers are annoying because often Harry shows up and just destroys all enemies with his magic and master of death powers.

** I think the big issue with just dropping Harry into another world is that, well, he's not really all that interesting on his own. What defines him in canon is his relationships, his friends/enemies, really - but as a character, he's not all that special.

So if the crossover is just 'drop Harry into another universe', it runs into that issue right off the bat. It also runs into the issue of Harry Potter magic being very vague in its limits, and usually interpreted to be way more powerful than whatever other universe it's in. And a Harry that's 10x more powerful than anyone else is even more boring to read about.

The crossovers that I think work best do involve the Wizarding World. I think bringing another character into the WW works better than the reverse - or, at least, better than Harry going over there. The usually more powerful interpretation of WW magic is usually counteracted by having a singular person using a different magical system, for instance, and abusing that fact (eg, Harry Potter and the Natural 20). I could see that working well with Sanderson fics, too.

Fusion fics can work pretty well, though apparently a lot of people here dislike them. That's where the HP WW is not just apart from the muggle world, but also some other aspects of the crossover setting. Personally, I think this is a lot more interesting as a crossover than just plucking a character and tossing them over, as long as the settings can be made to overlap appropriately... which is not easy to do. However, I found that the Denarian Renegade and its sequels did a good job of integrating the Dresden universe (which I haven't actually read >< ) and the HP one into a shared one, for instance. I imagine someone could do the same with the Avengers, though that might be difficult to make interesting when written out.

Or taking the character and making them as non-canon and op as possible in a new world... If you're doing that, might as well just have an OC.

** I'm a big fan of that style of crossover actually, and that's what most crossovers of ALL fandoms are like. One character or element from 1 story dropped into another, Harry Potter Crossovers have HP thrown into another world 90% of the time, that's just the meta for that crossover, it's not an ideal crossover 'setting', like marvel or DC are. Those two normally have the 'other' fiction dropped into their world, same with LOTR crossovers which is a setting crossover, in fact one of my favourite HP fics is a crossover, Shadow of Angmar. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the latest chapter, it felt like a bit of a let down after the long wait. I was looking forward to jumping right into the Hobbit and seeing some HP/Canon lots interactions, but it seems like that's not happening, likewise there are other in universe changes which I'm not a fan of. When I read the first Arc I really loved it and couldn't wait to see this Harry get stuck in with the events of the main LOTR story, but all the emergant AU elements are making that seem quite unlikely so I'm quite apprehensive now.

And worm crossovers are one of the more balanced ones, either a power or person getting dropped in worm, or Taylor getting dropped in another world.

When you mentioned all the other characters in Harry Potter being absent in Avevgers fanfic... I think that's a good thing. A full setting merger like that; I just cannot see it as ending up as anything other than a huge mess.

** Most of the crossovers I'm aware of are character drops, as noted by others. Some that I like that aren't merely character drops are:

linkffn(Plantagenet by HiBob) is a well-done crossover with Randall Garrett's "Lord Darcy" stories that involves more characters than just Harry, although he is the main one.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage) is a Marvel crossover that involves more than just Harry, although other students are more prominent in the story than Ron.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alternate Tournament by twistyguru) is a Mary Poppins cross that inserts a number of Disney characters and movies in the HP universe, mostly as cameos, except for Mary Poppins herself. Slight references to slash, but nothing too overt, if that bothers you.

linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter) and its sequel are multi crosses between Harry Potter, Ranma 1/2, and Sailor Moon, with minor cameos and references to other series. Ron's not a major supporting character, but Hermione is there through the end of the sequel.

Like Harry Potter and Narnia, lord of the rings, GoT, or even twilight if you wanna push it but frankly the one thing I cant stand particularly in the twilight ones is how overwhelmingly gay 90 percent of them are. I respect people's right to love who they love but as a straight Male I hate it when a good fanfiction is suddenly just a cheesy forced romance between harry and x twilight character.

** That's what I wrote about [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][on my blog]] (originally from discussion [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fk43ov/overused_tropes/][here]]): whole nature of 90 % of all crossovers just means they have to fail. Nature of two universes is so different, that you have to brutally violate one or another so much, it doesn't make sense. Just don't call the character Harry Potter, make it OC in other universe, and we all be much happier.

The fundamental problem of HP/fantasy crossovers is that HP is actually not a fantasy, or at least not in the conventional meaning of 90 % of all fantasy stories.

There are very few exceptions (e.g., I liked linkao3(Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][Muggle Interface Team by Northumbrian]], which has just a whiff of the crossover with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Human_(British_TV_series][Being Human]])), but they can easily fit in those mentioned 10 %.

IE School year at Hogwarts then when school is finished, summer camp at Camp Half blood. Can't remember the story name, I have it listed somewhere, but it's on my list to read.
