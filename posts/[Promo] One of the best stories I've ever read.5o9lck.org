** This promo has 2 problems. A) this fic gets recommended a LOT, and B) you could atleast explain why it is so awsome if you consider doing a thread for it, cause as of now this thread dosent tell me more than a search on ff.net.

** I like the story quite a bit, but the beginning is weak. It would benefit from a re-editing, with a new, more cataclysmic series of events leading to Harry's decision to fuck everyone's shit up.

** Enjoyed it, for the most part. The ending wasn't my cup of tea. It just sort of /ends/.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
