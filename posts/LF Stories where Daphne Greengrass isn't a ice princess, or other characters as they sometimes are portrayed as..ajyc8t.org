So often in stories, we see Daphne Greengrass as the typical ice princess, maybe to counter for Draco's normal portrayal of "ice prince" I don't really know why it is that way, but yeah; that's not how I view Daphne at all. I view her as more bold, but also quiet when need be.

Similarly; we often see Millicent Bulstrode as really stupid.

And then other Hufflepuffs; we don't get enough portrayal from them and such other things.

Any stories that portray the minor characters differently, than what is normally portrayed as in canon.

Blaize Zabini, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, et cetra. Just different than what they're normally portrayed as.

Little to no bashing please; as I tend to dislike the bashing.


** In "What's her name in hufflepuff" Daphne is a weirdo who loves turtles. : linkffn(13041698)

In Switchverse, Hannah Abbot is a gryffindor seeker who likes to boss around her friends Goyle and Crabbe. linkao3(10621071)

In Sacrifices Arc, Millicent is very smart, Pansy is very pleasant and Zachariah Smith is Hermione's academic rival(also loves annoying people with why questions). linkffn(2580283)

** Daphne is one of the main characters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]]. She and Pansy are both from the wealthy pure-blood elite so I have needed to take special care to distinguish the two of them:

- In terms of values, Daphne is a part of the rural elite whereas Pansy belongs to the urban elite (though in fact both possess country estates).

- Pansy is prim and proper, always taking great care over her outfits, hair and makeup, carefully coordinating everything. Daphne is also stylish, but she has a more bohemian approach to fashion and has perfected the art of "bed-head" hair.

- Daphne is comfortable with the outdoors and enjoys adventurous pursuits. She's happy to muck out the hippogriffs. Pansy is a more delicate flower who dislikes the mess and dirt of the outdoors. While Pansy enjoys riding, she would never do the mucking out herself.

- Pansy is more studious than Daphne, having a lot of pressure from her parents to achieve good academic results. Daphne's parents do not value education as highly, seeing academics as of no greater value than artistic, social, or sporting pursuits.

- Pansy's family is richer than Daphne's, but Daphne's has a longer history.

Victoria also features Susan Bones, who is Victoria's best friend. I've taken care to emphasise that she does not live with Amelia; it is a common fanon error that Susan's parents are dead. I've also depicted her parents as separated, as this is something that personally I have never seen in fanfic. I suspect it's because many fanfic writers depict the wizarding world as having a very old fashioned approach to romance (even though in canon they take a modern approach to dating) and so it doesn't occur to them to depict divorced people.

  Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent: linkffn(13133746)

  By: Petrificus Somewhatus

  /This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year./
#+end_quote

A pretty new H/D romance that doesn't have an ice princess Daphne or an edgy Harry or bashing. It's one of the few romance fics where both partners feel like actual partners working in tandem as equals. Also, Hufflepuff!Astoria.

** Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1585368/James018][James018]], he has two that fit the bill.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12673854/1/Butterbeer-Bollocks-and-a-Ball][Butterbeer, Bollocks and a Ball]] (Hilarious and perfect one shot. Features a very amusing Daphne.)

"She Transfigured Seamus' testicles into a pair of tweezers!" Through a series of unfortunate events and unwise decisions, Harry Potter ends up going to the Yule Ball with Daphne Greengrass. Perhaps things won't turn out so bad after all: when you've hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up, right? ...Right? Not your usual Daphne fic. Warnings for language and underage drinking.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367688/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] (Really good, but discontinued after 7 chapters unfortunately. But they are 7 really good chapters! Especially chapter 7, which was my personal favorite.)

The effect a twist of fate can have... Instead of Malfoy, Harry meets someone else at Madam Malkin's, someone who causes him to question the wizarding world more. What happens when Gryffindor boldness meets Slytherin shrewdness? A tale for the ages, of course.

** If you want a different Daphne, with background and reasoning for most of her personality (not Ice Queen) and quirks, check linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw) Its in my opinion, THE best Harry/Daph there is, mostly because it doesn't feel forced, she has flaws, is a normal teenager with issues, some mental due to magic, is in a bad situation and did her best to escape it. Not to mention it takes over 350k words for her and Harry to even have a cordial friendship. No bashing whatsoever. If only the author could give us like 5 more chapters to end the thing...
