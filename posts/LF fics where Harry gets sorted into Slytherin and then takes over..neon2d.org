Hi everyone, im looking for a fic where Harry uses his charm/witt and parsletongue abilities to essentially take over Slytherin, and by that i mean he solidifies himself as THE Slytherin not to mess with. Ive read to many stories where Harry is constantly getting walked over by everyone else even though he can clearly wipe the floor with any of them. Please no Slash.


** Prince of Slytherin fits the bill perfectly.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
