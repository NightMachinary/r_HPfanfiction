** I think making fun of tropes is pretty much a trope now with the amount of those fics I've seen... hopefully yours will be better. No suggestions though, sorry :/

** The word muggle being analogous to dropping the N bomb and only Harry and Hermione decide to stop using it to show how noble and better than everyone else they are, and start using mundane instead.

Also that technology isn't broke by magic it's just a commie plot to stop muggles and magicals mingling.

There is a load of money to be made by dealing in both muggle and magical worlds because nobody has ever thought about it before. The goblins don't even know that they could trade their golden galleons in for massive amounts of muggle currency.
