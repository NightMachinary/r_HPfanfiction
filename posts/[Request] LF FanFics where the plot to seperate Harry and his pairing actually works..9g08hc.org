Hey There!

Basically I am looking for a story (No slash please) where there is a plot to seperate Harry and his pairing and that it actually works.

I have seen quite a few where there is a plot to seperate them but it always follows the same road and is either being discovered early and prevented or just fail spactaculary. However, I have yet to come across a story where the plot actually works.

*** It isn't exactly NTR as no one cheats on anybody. The only thing that happen is that the third source (aka the culprit) force the couple to break up. Sure, it can lead to NTR or not but I never asked for that specifically so...

*** Sure! For example I have seen a Harry x Daphne story where their relationship with each other gets revealed to everyone and Draco (who wanted Daphne for himself) attempted to brew a potion that would cause her to hate Harry. That is the basic example but the theme here is the same. Someone is not happy with Harry's and X relationship and try to break them off via any method possible but only in those stories it works instead of Harry or the girl finding out and preventing it or something.
