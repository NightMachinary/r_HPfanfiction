Do they craft masterful stories, leaving you hanging onto every word, make you crack up with laughter, or cry along with every character's pain? What makes then unique?


** That is always hard to say. As I have been around in the fandom forever I tend to hold the old "greats" from the mid to late 2000's in high regard. Authors like nonjon, Jeconais, Bobmin, Ruskbyte, Rorschach's Blot, whydoyouneedtoknow or Shezza. While I still love all their work and have personally no problem enjoying them today, other, newer readers might think they are a bit trope and clich√© heavy. Which is simply the case because these authors pretty much created those tropes back then. Making their fics very creative and fresh.

As I have only been back in the fandom for a few months, working through what I missed in the last 4 years where I did not read any fanfiction, I won't be able to mention any of the newer authors. But I am sure others will have a clearer view and comment with them. At least if they stop shitposting :D

This is why people think Tolkein, Lovecraft, and C. S. Lewis are hackneyed. It ain't easy, being the writer who lays the foundation stones.

I really love a lot of this guy's work, but you have to really get past how little he seems to be able to spell. Make a Wish is one of my favorite stories in FF, but it's so full of mistakes, that it takes me out of the enjoyment whenever I reread it. Cliches are the least* of his worries.

Edit: * commented on someone's spelling, and then misspelled my self. Sad day.

**** I don't really remember that, but it has probably been a decade since I read his early works. So I will take your word for it. To be honest, back then I wasn't really hung up on spelling or grammar. A good plot and engaging writing was all I looked for in a fic. Also, English is my third language, maybe that's why I did not notice his errors so much as I was still learning at the time.

Jeconais is still unbeaten when it comes to happy romance. Bobmin is simply a legend for creating tons of tropes, because he thought of them first and they had such an impact that they are still used today.

What most surprises me is what about nonjon hasn't aged well for you? I feel like his fics could have been written last week and noone would find it suspicious. And they would still be recieved very well.

****** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The plotting is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of history and political philosophy most of the story will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Harry's political outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation -- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Machiavelli's Il Principe, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the plot, to realise that it's not just a story -- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots -- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the history behind Malfoy's catchphrase ‚ÄúAs soon as I'm old enough, I'm going to rape her‚Äù, which itself is a cryptic reference to mid 18th century French feudal politics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, I DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the witches' eyes only -- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin' personnel kid.
