I'm such a newbie in fanfic world..If anybody could guide a bit!

My OFC , who avenges voldemort , She's his step sister, and she knows about horcruxes before dumbledore did , bc of Regulus , and now I think I am unable to fit her and dumbledore together in HBP... Though she dies at the end of HBP , after dumbledore's death , saving Harry's life .

And another point , I doubt she'll clash with Snape becoming a hero at the end of war ! I don't want them to steal each other's thunder...

Is it okay to paste some original chapters of jkr as such ,{in my case almost part of deathly hallows, except the end}

And and , Is it fair to skip like whole of Order of phoenix part? it's not going with my plot. , But I fear a nightmare of proceeding loopholes !
