Him: So, what have you been doing this summer?

Me: Reading, I love to read

Him: How many books do you read a week?

Me: about 4 or 5, easily. I guess it depends on the length

Him: So how often do you have to go to the library?

Me: uh, I actually read them online

Him:Oh so do you rent them or something?

Me: No, the website I read them on is free

Him: Oh what website?

Me : Uh... i can't remember at the moment (I didn't want to tell this poor middle aged man that it is [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and ao3 )

Him: Oh so what kind of books you like

Me: ...I guess I read harry potter alot

Him: Oh my daughters love that series!

the coverstion then turned to a big ass butterfly that hit the windshield.

"I love what a loving father Lucius is. One of the greatest characters."

"I can't believe that the books /for children/ have a slut like Ginny get together with Harry. First she sleeps around, then uses love-potions. Can you believe it?"

** Yeah, it's so hard to answer the "how many books do you read?" question because then I'm trying to do the mental math of how long the fanfics I'm reading would be if they were in printed book format lol. Plus, the whole "what do you read?" if you give them an answer to how many and its like 'eeeeehhh...."

I find it to be a bit of a tricky question even for people my own age. Lots of people don't read, and if they do read, it's usually books, not fanfiction. Fanfiction is a very specific subset of fandom culture, most people are "casual" fans and never get into fanfiction for any show. Even if they do read fanfiction, they may think your pairings are just plain weird and nonsensical. You could have completely different fanfic tastes.

*** Also, with a decently long follow list, weekly reading tends to be a collection of separate chapters of whatever updated, rather than start-to-finish books. Hard to measure that in familiar terms.

*** Also the first few Harry Potter books could be read in a day but a book like Les Miz or War and Peace would take months to finish

** I've had this type of conversation many times. I usually say I read free online fantasy stories and their eyes quickly glaze over.
