Once in a while I come across a (mostly Independent!Harry) fic where he easily gives up Quidditch in favour of training or other things. Or even to not give Dumbledore/whoever the power to take that away from him.

Often it is rationalized that Harry was never asked if he would /like/ to become a seeker. And that he only loves *flying*, but not the game.\\
Would these plot points solely be there to relieve the author of writing Quidditch scenes? Or did this fenomenon come about another way?

/Thoughts/?


** 1) A lot of people probably don't like Quidditch and think the rules make no sense, so they have Harry not like Quidditch either.

2)A lot of people probably think that it's boring to read about Quidditch matches, so they don't write Quidditch scenes at all.

3)A lot of people probably just hate sports in general and want to write Harry as more of a nerdy character than the athletic person he really is.

*** I think the main issue is that seeker is a boring position in canon and therefore the matches which focus on Harry are not that interesting. If you focused more on the overall happenings and add more commentary on the other positions, it would be more interesting. Have the seekers interact more with the chasers, either as a fourth one for the own team or as a disruptive element for the opposing one.

And keep things simple. No one knows what a Fabianski Dive is supposed to be, but a cross, through-ball or pass are simple enough.

** I'm sure a few authors did do so for not writing quidditch scenes, but for the most part (atleast In good fanfics) it's too help the story...... Whether that's independent character building or not wanting to bog down the story with unnecessary quidditch scenes in their opinion.

Typo, but yeah, it could easily come to pass through another way. You can write the no-first years rule for a reason - Quidditch isn't a game for weaklings, and first years are tiny when compared to the older years and are far more likely to get seriously hurt.

Have Harry suffer some bludgers in either training or a real game, where the opposing team beaters aren't going to make it easy for him, and you'd have Harry with a genuine reason to stop playing.

** I think its often used in stories that also have Harry "turn his life around" - which apparently means for a lot of authors that every minute spent on something fun is wasted. In a lot of these fics where he gives up Quidditch, he is also never shown to go for a recreational flight.

The reasons for it are probably as diverse as the set of authors that write them. One reason could be, of course, that the author just doesn't want sports scenes in his fic. Another rather juvenile trope I often saw is this notion that if Harry becomes a scholar / trains himself to defeat Voldemort, he obviously can't enjoy sports. There is also the situation where Harry truly sacrifices his enjoyment to get more time to train himself with a goal in mind, but rarely do I see the actual consequences of this sacrifice in a fic.

For experienced writers, yes. But on a volume basis, given the demographics of who writes fanfic, it's just as likely that the plot point is there because the author is a teenager who doesn't like sports and doesn't want to write about characters that do.

I don't think so. Most fics where Harry plays Quidditch don't have any Quidditch related scenes in them in the first place. Rather I think that him giving up the game frees up his schedule. With indy!Harry he has to exercise rigorously every day after all, as well as studying far harder than canon, practising all his spells, going to Wizengamot things and tending to all his House affairs. There's no room for Quidditch in that schedule.

** I mean...if Quidditch was removed from the canon books...would anything actually change at all? Harry barely even plays as the books go on.
