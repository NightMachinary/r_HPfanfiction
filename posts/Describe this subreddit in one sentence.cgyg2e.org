  During the trio's stay at Grimmauld Place in DH, Hermione spends some quality alone time with a good book. PURE SMUT. You'll find no plot to water down the smut in this fic.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Maybe She's a year younger than Harry and is fairly neutral.

How did she end up with Draco The Prick, That I do not know.

********* That's the exact point! Daphne's a blank slate and years of writing Daphne fanfics by other authors gave us the basic framework of an Ice Queen of Slytherin Persona. Its how we manipulate the story in order to make her open up to Harry and Harry to her is how the story's subplot revolves.

The basic idea of her character is that :--

A. She's A blue eyed blonde girl with a hot figure. ( Not exactly Susan Bones but not flat chested either )

B. Her Personality is cold towards everyone except her parents, sister and her best friends Tracy and Blaise. (Some fanfics do make her character about hating her parents and sister but thats up to you to write it)

C. Her family, The Greengrass, is a neutral family. ( Again, some make them dark,light or neutral but thats up to you )

D. She does not follow Draco's gang of ruffians.

( More Terese than Virginia but, Your choice. )

But still, Its fun for me to read an HP/DG story where the Ice Queen fall for Harry and stands by his side through thick and thin. Normally in fanfics i read till now, they are either introduced through Marriage Contract or in Triwizard when nobody believed Harry but Daphne does. You can do the same or make them meet at the train or put both Harry and Daphne in Slytherin house. Its up to you on how to set them up.

Excuse me if I did got carried away but it's was fun to write about Daphne.

I hope you got your answer my friend. PEACE!!¡!!

********** Hmm, how did they build such a complex character out of nothing from canon? I am very curious to see the fic that started this all. (Mainly because they didn't do this to any other character)

I personally feel Susan Bones has a huge scope for character development. My fav Fanon Pairing is Luna/Harry though.

I don't mean to be rude asking all these questions, It's difficult to get my thoughts across comments, and people think I'm passive agressive, which surprised me because I have questions which is why I joined this subreddit in first place :) Thanks for answering!

*********** Nah man, it's alright to ask about it. The point is both Daphne and Susan are blank slates and are completely up to us to mould their persona. Daphne is only shown in one scene and Susan doesn't get too much screen time. Hell the one time I remembered Susan was when Amelia Bones was murdered. We do got a basic framework for Luna through the books and movies for being dreamy.

Years and Years of fanfics helped in Character Development of Daphne. It could be that a guy just thought of pairing Harry with an OC (considering thousands and thousands of Ginny and Hermione Pairing) and checked JKR's website and found Daphne Greengrass, connecting her to Astoria and thought that , 'Hey lets make Draco and Harry Brother-In-Laws by pairing Harry with Daphne. That could be the origin of HP/DG pairing, at least what I think. But, JUST A OPINION OF MINE. Some made her personality Cold, Distant and Aloof, building a Ice Queen Persona for her. Its up to you how to make her personality. You can make her cheerful and bubbly or use the basic Ice Queen Persona. It's your choice.

Harry/Luna is also a good pairing, I have read some of those but authors tend to make oneshots only for them. I never got a full novel length fanfic for them. If you got some, do tell me about it.

Normally these pairing are made to be hated by other students of Hogwarts except a select few. Like students may hate Daphne for being a Slytherin, Susan for being a Hufflepuff, making a mindset of a weak person or Luna for being insane according to them

Authors tend to write their fics so that Ron and Hermione hate Daphne for being a Slytherin and Smarter than Hermione (Hermione has somewhat of a competitive nature as shown in Half Blood Prince), Susan for being supposedly weak and not right for Harry and Luna for being plain Insane. Hermione might not be like that in some fics and Ron may accept them or not but thats how authors tend to write fics.

Personally I believe that these pairings have a lot of potential and do tell me why a woman is screaming in a muggle station about where is Platform 9¾. Didn't Molly, Authur, Charlie, Bill, Percy, Gred and Forge attended Hogwarts before? Surely they must have conveniently forgot about it in order to help Harry find the Platform, sound fishy to me.

I like to read Dumbledore Ron and occasionally Hermione bashing fics cause they feel like my type. But your opinion matters, not mine.

Anyways, excuse me for my ranting and hope you got your answer my friend !!¡!!

#+end_quote

I don't think "I can't sympathise with the MC in a slash fanfiction" is an accurate description of the situation.

For the type of reader who projects onto the protagonist rather than merely sympathises with them, not reading slash is just an example of a more general reading perspective. That perspective is the lack of interest in fics where the protagonist is attracted to individuals the reader does not find attractive.

Because it's not just Harry/male that this type of reader dislikes. It's also Harry/Umbridge, Harry/Millicent, etc. Basically Harry paired with anyone, regardless of gender, who the reader would not want to have a relationship with themselves. Seen through this lens, the lack of interest in slash is nothing more or less than the fact that the reader is straight.

This cuts both ways - it is why so many straight female readers like slash (and only read slash) - because they are attracted to men, they want to read a story where the MC is attracted to the characters they find attractive.

So it's not the fact that the MC is gay per se which breaks the reader's identification with the MC. It's the fact that the MC is seeking out relationships that the reader would not want for themselves, gay or otherwise. It's the same reaction as when the MC does something stupid - the reader is annoyed, because they feel that they would never have done that thing.

For this type of reader, the reading experience is like a video game: Harry is the reader's avatar in the world - an extension of the reader themselves, not an independent character. That works so long as the avatar does things the reader likes. But the moment Harry starts doing things the reader wouldn't want to do (or does not aspire to do), it's like playing a video game with broken controls. Frustrating.

As for female protagonists - I suspect that for many (straight male) readers, the reading perspective is different from the outset when reading a female character. Whereas with Harry you are living vicariously through him, such that his sexual experiences are your own, I suspect that with female characters the reader's point of view is more that of imagining themselves with the MC. Which is why (straight male) readers of female protagonists will generally only be interested in female protagonists who they find attractive. The test is the same "Would I want to be with this person?", it's just the target is different.

I was curious, so I looked it up on AO3. As of right now, there are [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works][2,499,461 works categorized as M/M on AO3]], of which [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=BDSM&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=M*s*M][118,304 are also tagged BDSM]]. 118304 ÷ 2499461=0.04733180473, so slightly less than 5% of slash works on AO3 are BDSM. Granted, this search won't catch all of them due to people undertagging their fics, but it's certainly not enough of a problem to turn 4.7% into 90%.

If we narrow it down to the Harry Potter fandom specifically, there are currently [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=M*s*M][103,734 Harry Potter works categorized as M/M]], of which [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=BDSM&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=M*s*M][5,027 are also tagged BDSM]]. 5027 ÷ 103734 = 0.04846048547, so the Harry Potter fandom has about 0.1% more slash BDSM fics than the archive as a whole.

But I like age-gap or cross-gen pairings in certain combinations (Snape/Dumbledore is another favorite) if there's tension or unresolved issues or power imbalances or thematic parallels or what-have-you. I also like unconventionally attractive or even ugly characters together (for example, Snape/Filch, mostly because of one stellar writer).

I'm sure I have more brilliant fannish revelations I could unload on you, but fortunately you'll be spared because I just realized it's already 2:30 am on a workday. But thanks for sticking with the conversation.

  I'm also baffled by the general rage toward badfic. Either I'm supernaturally skilled at identifying and skipping things I don't enjoy, which means they never get a chance to leave an impression, or most people on this sub torture themselves by wading into poorly written shite.
#+end_quote

I sometimes feel the same, but I do get the impression that a lot of people here read mainly on FFN, so maybe that has something to do with the rage towards badfic? AO3 certainly has plenty of badfic, but the waitlist for an invite seems to scare off a lot of the writers who just barf out words on a page and post them immediately with no edits to start getting comments, so in my experience the writing quality on AO3 is higher on average than FFN. AO3 also has a higher average age for the userbase, which also tends to lead to more skilled authors, and a much better tagging system that makes it easier to filter fics you're not interested in from your search results without ever seeing them, let alone having to scroll past them every time you run a search.

*************** You're probably right. I started out on LiveJournal, where it could be harder to find fics if you weren't part of the community, but there were a lot more rec lists and reccing comms (oh, how I miss crack_broom and crack_van) and dedicated archives to help guide readers. After the LJ exodus, I started using AO3, partly because Snape/Harry was one of the ships targeted by the religious organization that threatened LJ with lawsuits and created the whole Strikethrough situation. I came late to ff.net and even now only read there if I trust the reccer's taste.

AO3 may not have the sheer quantity of badfic ff.net does, but give it time. It's getting there. I don't use the tag system much myself; my tastes are pretty specific, and authorial style and characterization are the true enticements for me. Kinks and tropes, not so much. I can usually tell within a few sentences whether to hit the back-button or keep reading.

I also suspect a lot of this sub's members avoid AO3 because of the visibility of slash, which they automatically categorize as badfic. So in their eyes, ff.net is superior because it has far more het and gen. Of course, it also means they've got to navigate the search system without a map. And a lot of people just plain forget that fanfiction is amateur by definition, and as fandom becomes more mainstream, the upswing in baby's first fics increases sharply. Students on their lunch breaks posting silly in-joke fics and fantasies for each other is just part of online life now.

**************** My fannish history sounds pretty similar to yours, except Remus/Sirius instead of Snape/Harry. We weren't hit as hard by Strikethrough as your camp, but I think most of us went "fuck this shit" in solidarity and fled to other platforms in the exodus. I miss crack_broom and crack_van so much, though. And all the newsletters!

I was hoping after Tumblrpocalypse that we might get more people moving back to Dreamwidth, but it seems like most people headed to Twitter, which I like even less than I liked Tumblr, so fml, lol. Meanwhile I guess I'll be hanging out on reddit being stubbornly pro-slash and hoping The Next Big Thing comes along sooner rather than later.

**** The general expansion of rules. Specifically, that all of the new rules are targeted at limiting discussion.

Most concerning is the sneaky expansion of rule 8. Rule 8 itself was implemented as a consequence of Reddit-wide policy. But recently, the mods appear to have added an additional section of text to it:

#+begin_quote
  Gratuitous or positive depictions of non-consensual sexual content are also subject to removal.
#+end_quote

You will notice that when Rule 8 was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7x1cdx/compliance_with_reddit_rule_change_regarding/][implemented]], no mention was made of this.

This is disturbing for two reasons:

1. In the past, all additions to the rules have been discussed among the community, not added unilaterally by the mods, without notice to the community of the change.

2. In the past, the subreddit has maintained a strict policy of "no kink shaming". Non-consent/rape fantasies are extremely common, [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605][especially]] [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20620397?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents][among]] [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/all-about-sex/201001/womens-rape-fantasies-how-common-what-do-they-mean][women]].

The second one is particularly troubling because the moderation team have a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5v5f2v/new_rule_proposals/][history]] of wanting to impose their own personal morality on the subreddit in terms of wanting to ban certain kinds of fics. In the past, the community has consistently pushed back against this, and the mod team has respected that push-back. But now it seems that new rules intended to limit the types of discussion which can occur are being implemented covertly, without notice and without consultation.
