** First person PoV combined with switching PoVs is extremely jarring.

*** His idea, if I'm not wrong (and given the quote at the end of the chapter, I'm probably not), is taken from a book by Alain Damasio, /The WindWalkers/. Frequently switching the PoV, and using symbolism to point to the identity of the PoV, are two elements directly taken from this book.\\
Now, one of Damasio novels systematic axis is the exploration of the meaning of identity (as part of a group, of a society; and the impacts the conventions used for naming and designating a person in a society/group have over said person). It can be quite hard to do (and the first chapters of Damasio's novels are frequently hard to read), but if well done, and in /The WindWalkers/, it is fantastic.... if not well done, it will probably plunges this fic in the depths of unreadibility.

** Does anybody else read "Badass!" as "Annoying!"? I suppose I should be grateful the authors gave a clear warning to stay away.
