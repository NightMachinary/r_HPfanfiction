  Harry in control of memories and actually benefitting for himself, killing/manipulation others and for once using the god damn power for himself instead being so afraid of consequences.
#+end_quote

So what you're saying is that you want Voldemort in control of Harry, but that he should call himself Harry?

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** It starts off pretty as a pretty tolerable crackfic Has a evil Dumbledore whos sort of competent in a completely insane way. At somepoint pretty early on you can see that author no longer has any idea how to continue it and so he starts throwing in random fairy stuff that in no way advances the plot. Then he starts ticking of the trope lisst until he realises how little point there is in the entire fic and abandons it.

**** It certainly does fit your story

- Harry gaining Voldemorts memories / merging
- Harry exploiting it and manipulating himself, not being scared of the consequences
- Harry being in control.

These were your three main points, and they all fit to PKH. And as I said, I do not recommend PKH, but it does fit.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
