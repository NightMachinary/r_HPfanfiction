(I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY ORIGINAL)

A Harry who became Voldemort's equal (literally) due to his own different approach to magic and power.

Tom delved into the arcane and esoteric, scrounging up dark spells and rituals (like Horcruxes) in his quest for power and domination. His go to spells are the Unforgiveable's and he wields the magics he's learned with deadly efficiency and incredible power. Scoffing at the limitations of the "Light" with their spells and practices.

Harry isn't quite the same.

Tom works within the rules of the system. He learned everything he could about magic (forever deepening his knowledge as he grows older) and though he pushes the boundaries, that is more on the side of morals and ethics rather than the very foundations of magic themselves.

Harry Potter is a famous example of a magical impossibility, and every spell he turns on the Dark Lord and his followers is a reflection of this.

- An Expelliarmus that is casted as a pulse, knocking back and disarming anyone in a perimeter around him.

- An Incendio that's size, range and power he can alter at will.

- A Summoning charm capable of working on the living.

- A Corporeal Patronus that is solid to the touch and alive when summoned.

Through a mix of ignorance, arrogance and sheer genius, Harry's spells do not act the way they should.

Though Voldemort and his cronies are quick to laugh and jeer at his use of "schoolyard hexes", they may know the incantation and what it is supposed to do, with Harry's tendency to bend and break the rules of magic there is no knowing what exactly they are going to be hit with (or how).

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Allows the author to keep Harry's signature spells from canon (e.g: Expelliarmus and Stupefy) but gives him a degree of versatility whilst also making him look badass and intelligent.


** Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt) does something similar near the end.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

** Wind shear does something like this where he uses elemental transfigurations but taken to an extreme that neither Tom or dumbledore did
