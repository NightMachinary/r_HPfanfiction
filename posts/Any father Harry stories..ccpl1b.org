Probably to Teddy, since I see them as the most popular ones, but any will do. Whether he raises himself due to time-travel shenanigans, or raises his own. Whether he raises Merlin, or a muggle child(using extremes here). As long as Harry is a loving, caring father.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19) is sadly incomplete, but is frequently recommended and is truly a great story.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

***** I'm sure this reply will be deleted, because god forbid people discuss things, but that first update this year was after like a two year wait. I wouldn't really hold my breath. There's been no real contact from the author since then, either.

And they already abandoned their other story.

****** Her tumblr has regular contact. Last I saw she estimated the next chapter is about 30% done. At current rates it is about one chapter a year.

** linkao3(Snape's Memories by paganaidd)

Edit: Why are so many responses being downvoted? This fic is all about Harry being a father, which is what was requested.

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.
