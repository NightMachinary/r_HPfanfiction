I've been wondering this for a while, I have been reading HP Fanfiction for many years and only twice have I come fics that give a somewhat accurate description of the animagi transformation process. Does anyone who why that is? Is it because the process takes too long for authors who want to quench their readers need for immediate satisfaction?

Also does anyone know any fics that have the correct process included?


** Because JKR only told us how it's done within the last 5 yrs. As recently 3, I think.

***** Yeah, the process is stated in PoA to be very dangerous, carrying mandrake leaves in your mouth for a month isn't dangerous, it's just annoying.

Unless they're poisonous and you can die from it, but that's still stupid because it's a boring way to make it dangerous.

******* Maybe. It's still dumb. The getting in touch with animal and slowly becoming it meditations common to fanfics may not be original but they ar least make sense.

I've also seen ones where there's an animagus spell for every animal and they fire each one at you wand choosing style until you find one that doesn't hurt. Again, makes much more sense than the canon way.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Accurate is a misconception, we never see just how Sirius and the other non-werewolf Marauders nor Professor Kitty-Cat learned to transform- it's not in canon at all.

I've seen many methods used and I think people's creativity in explaining what J.K Rowling didn't bother with is astounding- from runes to rituals, mandrake leaves held in mouths for a lunar month to collecting tokens representing the animal to vision quests.

** honestly the fandom at large seems to have collectively decided that anything JK Rowling posts as 'canon' outside the main books is absolute trash and tend to ignore it. Given that our information for canon animagius transformations are posted to the same site where she canonized wizard's shitting themselves while they walked, I'm honestly not suprised people ignore it.

Another factor to consider is that the process she outlines fits poorly with descriptors we get in the main books, and is just overall doesn't feel like a very fun or even intuitive process to work into a story in many cases. writing a rolicking adventures story where harry is mastering magics and learning things doesn't handle a slow ritual involving rotten mouth leaves being mentioned every so often. It would drag certain stories or be a complete non-sequeter in others. romance fics would probably suffer from including it for example since who wants to snog someone with a soggy rotten bunch of leaves in their mouth?

** Just read the description of the process on Pottermore and it is fairly stupid. The process is not difficult at all, only mildly annoying for a month and requires you to say an incantation morning and night until a lightning storm. The fact that it in no way involves transfiguration makes it even worse. It requires no skill at all which goes against Sirius saying that Peter struggled with it and James was the first because he was a tranasfiguration protegy.

I think my prefered method is using meditation to find the animal within and slowly focusing to change your body bit by bit until you can do it perfectly.

** IIRC, there are several different ways to become an Animagus since it is known that the African Magical school trains almost all of its students to be Animagi, implying that they have a method that is far less risky/time critical than the one used by the Western Magical World.

My personal headcanon is that the various European/American ministries promote the riskier/harder Animagi techniques in order to dissuade people from attaining that skill since Animagi can bypass most detection techniques in their animal form, making them a potential threat to the Ministry in question. The reasons that they don't outright ban the skill are\\
1) The potential for a burst of Accidental Magic granting the child in question the skills of an Animagi.\\
2) If they ban the skill in Europe/America, magicals might well simply go to Africa to learn the skill there, giving them an advantage that the Ministries won't be able to plan for since they don't know about it.

There was a canon(?) thing about the students of the African school giving a demonstration of synchronized Animagi transformations, causing at least one western wizard to panic and try to move for them to be punished, a move which got nowhere as it would have caused a /lot/ of political difficulties.

The Marauders probably discovered/researched the African method for Animagi transformations as keeping the leaf in their mouth for a full month would have been almost impossible for a teenager.

  They only wanted to help Remus. But carrying Mandrake leaves around in his mouth for a month, James discovers, is only the beginning of the battle. Based on JKR's description of the process in Pottermore's "Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies".
