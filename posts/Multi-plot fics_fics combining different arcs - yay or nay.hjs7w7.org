It seems like most fics I come across recently center on one big plot line - if there are subplots, they are usually much smaller and less significant. IDK if it's just what I read or if it's a common thing in fic writing, and I've got a couple of plot ideas in my head, so I'm wondering: if I were to combine them in one fic would it still work and appeal to readers or should I just split them between different (in all likelihood shorter) fics? I don't want to describe everything in detail just yet, bc I'm not even sure how the plots would develop (I had a random burst of creativity last night and just jotted down a couple of key points in my note app - btw anyone else has the best ideas while almost asleep and you just /have to/ wake back up again and write it down?), but what came to me so far is: a) Harry having wand problems after the horcrux in him is destroyed and feeling inadequate, b) Ron and Hermione having relationship problems bc after the war they feel like they're doing nothing, c) a roughly musical theme centering on Draco feeling cast out by everyone (kind of - Draco acts like a grow -up emo teen and tortures himself with sad songs because they fit his life). Oh yeah, and it would most likely end up being a slow burn drarry endgame (bc I'm on a major drarry kick right now) with a healthy dose of romione angst. If I were to combine all of those into one would it work or should I sick to having them split? Do you like milti-plot fics like that or is it too much of a commitment to read?


** This is incredibly complicated question. There are two sides of the story. First of all, more I read many poorly written fanfiction stories (because, let's be honest, most fanfiction stories are poorly written) more I believe in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][Artistotelian Unities]] (that's the blogpost I wrote about this). Nothing kills the story like uneven focus.

Take for example linkao3(To Reach Without by inwardtransience). It is one of the best gender-bender fem!Harry stories I know about: there is plenty of angst, identity anxiety and everything not only common “I have BOOBS now! How to get laid asap!” of most such stories (yes, it is femslash which I don't care much about, but I can understand that it is probably reasonable result of the gender-bender story). It is pretty good Black-family centric story (magical politics and all this stuff), which I don't like much, but the author made reasonably decent take on this. And there is deep!Magic super!Harry story out there, which I completely not like, but to each his own. If it was just the last one, I would throw it away without regrets, as I do for all super!Harry stories, but it is not the biggest problem. I really don't know what is the plot and story this thing wants to carry on. And I am sorry for all the perfectly written rest of the story.

On the other hand, if you write story of length of “War and Peace” (and many fanfiction stories are [[https://blog.fostergrant.co.uk/2017/08/03/word-counts-popular-books-world/][comparably long to the worlds classics]], mostly to their detriment), then you cannot expect to have simple plot capable carrying fifty pages three-chapters story. Of course, you need more complex characters development, multiple sub-stories and such.

However, all stories have to have that unifying touch: there must be some overarching main story, one overarching main /Spirit/ (in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][other comment]] I have suggested reading Dorothy L. Sayers “The Mind of the Maker”, but I accept that it is probably too weird for most fanfiction readers/writers out there), and it'd better be same throughout whole story, which is what I objected against linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) in that blog post above: not that it is complex, it must be, given its length, but that it starts as the chamber music one-family story, and ends like the symphonic whole-world giant in the style of “War and Peace” or “Deluge” by Sienkiewicz.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

**** Thanks for your thoughts! This is exactly why I asked in the first place - so many long fics are unnecessarily overblown (for lack of a better word) by subplots that go nowhere that they're hard to read. And then, on the other hand, some just seem to take a turn somewhere in the middle and all of a sudden start focusing on something that seemed minor before - and it's not like it's a gradual shift of focus, it's just that from one point you feel like you're reading an entirely different piece. And I wasn't sure if it was just me or if this bothers other people too.\\
Also - you've got my MAJOR respect for Sienkiewicz right now - not because I like his writing - in all fairness, I couldn't stand it when they forced me to read it in school - but this subreddit is the last place I would expect someone to invoke Deluge (tbh, I had to google it to know which one was it, bc I only thow the original name).

** I personally like multi-plot but only if it finally turns out that whatever has been happening that didn't seem related actually relates to the grand scheme of things.I don't know whether what I said made any sense. I'm not an author. I just read.

*** I think I understand what you mean :) I always hate it when the plots don't intertwine at any point in the story - to me it seems like the author couldn't develop what they came up with enough for it to warrant a story of its own, so they just threw a bunch of kind-of-drabbles together.
