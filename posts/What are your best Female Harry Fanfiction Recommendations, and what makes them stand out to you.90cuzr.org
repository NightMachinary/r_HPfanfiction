A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh

For me, this stands out for the characterisation of Jasmine (and the supporting cast) as well as the generally high quality of writing, which balances drama, humour and action well.

What I like about the characterisation is that Jasmine is so feminine. So many fem!Harry fics leave me wondering "what's the point?" because they have fem!Harry acting just like Harry (and his various fanfic incarnations like "Lord Potter-Black"). Yes, Jasmine is powerful, knowledgeable, and rich, but she's also elegant, restrained, sophisticated, and at times playful - all characteristics that take advantage of the fact that this is fem!Harry, not Harry.

Ultimately, this is the reason why I am interested in fem!Harry. Not because I want to read about Harry with , but because I want to read about a Harry who displays characteristics which are generally considered more feminine. While you could of course just write a feminine male Harry, that comes with very different connotations to a female Harry. And - perhaps I'm biased on this point - physicality matters. I feel like the flowing female form is simply more suited for elegance than the blocky male one.

A lot of people will talk about the worldbuilding of this fic, especially in the chapters which take place in the past. To me that's not a particularly strong point - it's perfectly fine, but those chapters just don't grab me nearly as much as the ones which take place in or near the present. The highlight chapter for me is the one set in the 1960s when Dumbledore unknowingly interacts with Jasmine.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I love Girl at War. I think the dialogue and the banter in it is amazing. It does so well at making a female Harry have actual feminine qualities and changing the way people treat Harry accordingly. For example, how Petunia would have seen Harry, the relationship between Harry and the other girls in her year, her dynamic with Sirius, ~feud with Draco, and the misogyny she would have faced from the Ministry and Daily Prophet. It's nice to see a fic that does more to change the storyline with Harry being a girl rather than just changing the name.

** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) is a very well written fem!Harry. Like other stories recommended on this post, there is an emphasis on what Harry being a girl would entail. It isn't a simple canon rehash, and minimal lines are quoted from the series. The dialogue is amazing and I love how this fic depicts female friendships.

Moratorium by DarkPetal16

I love this one, it's true to it's intention and actually makes a Grey/Neutral Harry. It's interesting, unique and well written. There are changes from canon, but some things-like her initial friendship with Ron and Hermione- remain the same. Yet, the author plays around with the different dynamics this Harry would have with each character and does it masterfully. Dumbledore is often one of the hardest characters to do well but this author manages to capture his flaws and keep him as the well meaning and powerful wizard we know and love.

This story is not a canon rehash, there are a lot of changes and it goes in a much different direction, but the core character of Harry is still somewhat the same- she still wants a better world, still forgives and recognizes people make mistakes.

All of the storylines run smoothly together, everything seems well thought out. The pairings do end up as Draco/Hermione, and Tom Riddle/Harry Potter. This fic is probably one of the only fics that does the latter pairing in a believable way, Tom's storylines and character arc make it so that he is still as we know him to be, just a little bit more on the Grey side than an outright dark lord.

Truly this may be my favourite Fem!Harry out there. Each chapter reads like a singular book, there are no blatant inconsistencies, bashing, grammatical errors (that stand out). Tt is a beautiful build up into the resolution. Each character has an arc and they do not finish it unchanged whether it be Tom, Harry, Snape (who is also portrayed realistically for once), Ron, etc. Philsopher's stone arc is a bit weak, but to me the characterizations and character dynamics are my favourite part of the story.

I just really love this fic, and I've reread it a few times and will always recommend it.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** Sorry, I accidentally deleted my other comment and it was a long one, too. :-( Basically this author wrote a very intriguing femHarry in her story "Grandloves." It involves femHarry and Voldemort (the ugly one that came out of the cauldron) getting into this twisted, romantic relationship. It honestly feels like watching a train that you know is going to get derailed and end up in a wreck. You know you shouldn't be viewing it but you also want to know how it all ends.

Her other femHarry story is called "Crawlersout." It involves a femHarry who can go back in time to raise Tom Riddle. Along the way, she catches the attention of Grindelwald.

** I've always enjoyed [[https://fanfiction.net/s/6343543/][Harry and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl Who Lived]].

It starts off a bit rough, but quickly settles in. Give it a couple of chapters. It avoids a lot of the irritating and vaguely (or not so vaguely) offensive stereotype stuff because Harry is still canon Harry, a boy raised as a boy for his first 11 years. The only difference is that everyone in the wizarding world thinks he's a girl, and treats him as a girl, and that makes a pretty big difference.

The moment I knew I was going to stick with it was Harry trying to navigate a compliment-exchange at the start of year feast.
