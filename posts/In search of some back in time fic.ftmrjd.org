Hello everyone!

I'm a huge fan of time travel fic, and I was wondering if you had any good (and hopefully completed) time travel fic. But specifically one with either Hermione or Draco going back in time in their younger bodies.

Hope you're all well during the quarantine, and thanks in advance! (sorry about my english, I'm not a native english speaker)


** Hermione goes back in time in someone else's 11yo body in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]]. She lives through Hogwarts twice, once as Hermione and once as one of Hermione's classmates.

Draco goes back to his own 11yo body in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10021610][Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone]]. He tries to solve the plots based on his old memories of things he only partially understood in the first place.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
