Hi all,

Recent current events have inspired me to write a short crack fic in the style of Indy!Harry as Harry discovers the unknowable forces that have been manipulating his financial status for his entire life, and decides to do something about it.

(Note. This fic is not meant as financial advice in any way, shape, or form. I wrote it because the memery surrounding these current events felt oddly familiar.)


** u/AevnNoram:

  Harry was angry. The mean and greedy goblins of Gringotts had been loaning out his gold to poor people trying to start their own businesses. This was an outrage.
#+end_quote

Okay. Done.

** I had a similar idea. Hermione figures out that magical pureblood families of Great Britain were controlling hedge funds that were trading on the London Stock Exchange and we're using the profits to find death Eater activities. Y'all can guess what happened after.

** I don't exactly get why Harry is angry about the bank loaning to poor people. Like, that's completely unconnected to current events and makes it seem more like a hitpiece on the WSB people.

*** +I cannot imagine how a 450 word Harry Potter fanfiction could meaningfully change the opinions people have of WSB posters.+

You got me. I was paid off by Citadel to write a Harry Potter fanfic to make WSB people look like they don't understand basic market mechanics.*

Regardless, I'm glad you liked the rest.

(This is a joke. I did not receive money to write this Harry Potter fanfic.)

If it is, I admire the OP's tenacity if nothing else.

Trying find a way to offend and/or defame people who self-identify as 'autists' and 'retards'? I wish I had that much free time!
