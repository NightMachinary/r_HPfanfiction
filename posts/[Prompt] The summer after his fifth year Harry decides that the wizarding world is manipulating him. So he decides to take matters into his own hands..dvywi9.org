Harry has come to the realization that everything he knows is a lie. Dumbledore is stealing from him and training him up to be a sacrifice, his friends are being paid to spy on him, the ministry is just one big conspiracy, and he needs to tear it all down if he ever wants to be free.

The only problem? He's not actually being persecuted, he's suffering from a delusional breakdown after seeing Sirius die. His friends love him, Dumbledore is actually trying to shield harry from danger, the ministry is just an incompetent bureaucracy.

Will Harry get the help he needs or will he rise to be the dark lord he could be? /For the greater good of course/

*** Yes, that's what made me think about this prompt. Take your standard indy!grey!edgy!lord!harry and make the bashable stuff all in his head.

He thinks Dumbledore is setting him up to die, stealing all his money, and trying to rule the world. Dumbledore is actually just an old man doing his best to protect people.

He thinks the Weasley family are trying to steal his wealth and power through Ginny. They're just compassionate people with a daughter that has a crush.

Etc. Etc. A deconstruction of the indy!harry trope, basically.

** I have a snippet I wrote a while ago along these lines. No plans to continue at this point, but someone else might...

​

“Even if Molly tried to use a Love Potion on you, what were you /thinking/, using Dark Magic on Ron?! Do you realise how hard it must have been for Dumbledore to keep you out of Azkaban?”

“That old coot? When did he ever lift a finger to help me? No, I merely claimed my title as Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Black and invoked the ancient law of sippenhaft to administer a proper chastising to the offender's family. Pray that I do not administer one to you!”

Hermione couldn't help but take a step back. In the past week, the world had gone mad. Harry had discovered hitherto unheard-of tools, powers, and inheritances---and she was glad. Then, Molly Weasley had tried to potion him into love with Ginny---and she was surprised and disgusted. Then, Molly fled, and Harry had cursed Ron in her place and told off Dumbledore---and she was terrified. She took a deep breath.

“What's gotten into you, Harry? You've discovered some ancestors, some money and artefacts, and you're suddenly acting like you're better than everyone, insulting Dumbledore, cursing Ron, and threatening me.”

“Dumbledore hid my birthright from me! He suppressed my potential!”

“That's ridiculous!” Hermione /did not/ say, instead forcing herself to take another breath. /Someone/ had to be the adult in the situation. She phrased her reply carefully. “He did? How did you discover it? Dumbledore has forgotten more about magic and scheming that either of us have ever known.”

Harry nodded. “I'll show you.”

He took her hand and led her through the hallways of 12 Grimmauld place, past the mounted house-elf heads, down the stairs, and into the small dungeon that made up its basement. Hermione cringed as the already grim ambiance of the old Black house was amplified tenfold, but Harry seemed unaffected.

They stopped in front of a door, which Harry opened with a wave of his hand, before pulling Hermione inside. (Casual wandless magic, Hermione noted.)

In the centre of the room floated a sphere about two meters in diameter, in Hermione's estimation. It was perfectly black, yet it pulsated with a colour that Hermione could see but could not name. Web-like tendrils of the same colour spread from the orb to the floor and to the ceiling, running up and down the walls.

“She came to me the night I came back to the Dursleys', and she explained everything. Everything.”

Harry was grasping her arm both both hands, his green eyes wide open in excitement. She barely kept from recoiling as she saw that, in his eyes, the same tendrils could be seen pulsating in time with the orb. “And then, she offered to help. And she did.

“I can't believe I used to be so excited about things like Quiddich and the pitiful war between Dumbledore and Voldemort. I am the Chosen One, the heir of every important wizard line, the apex and the nexus of human magic. Dumbledore, Voldemort, the Malfoys, they all pretend to be fighting each other, but really, they are all working together to use me and to suppress my potential...”

Hermione tuned out the rest of his speech, because the orb---it was talking to her---had more important things to say.

/Purebloods get their family's secret knowledge and tutors, even Harry gets a magical cloak, his mother's protection, Patronus lessons, and Occlumency lessons from a master---which he throws away over a petty personality conflict, while/ */you/*, /everything/ */you/* /know, you have had to work for. And, in the end, you work harder than anyone else, but all you get is a pat on the head from the teachers, and a solid reputation as the reliable sidekick of the Boy Who Lived./

/You've spent so much time helping others get better at defensive magic, you've gotten an EE on the Defense OWL. An EE! Even now, you are putting yourself into unknown danger, just to help Harry out of his latest mess./

/But, you wouldn't mind helping, as long as people would/ */let themselves be helped/*, /but it never sticks, does it? Merlin forbid they actually exercise some patience and caution, and maybe even crack open a book that they weren't forced to on pain of death. Merlin forbid they do something because it's the right thing to do, like free their slaves, even if it makes their lives just a tiny bit less convenient. And those people are supposedly/ */on your side!/*

/Why can't people be more sensible?! If they were more sensible, they would appreciate all that you have done for them, and they would agree with your ideas and advice./ */Someone/* /needs to make people more sensible, but nobody but you seems to be interested in the project. Together, though,/ */we/* /could do it./

**** The way I envision it, it twists reality to feed and validate the victim's insecurities, seemingly giving them what they want and need, while actually leading them to destruction.

In this particular case, Harry craves a family and feels powerless, like he has no control over his life. The orb amplifies his grievances and seemingly gives him tools to address them. It gives him "titles" while manipulating Molly to make him push away the closest thing he has to a family---the Weasleys. It gives him wandless gimmicks, while taking away the very Power Voldemort Knows Not by feeding his arrogance. It pushes him to turn away from things that brought him joy and friendship---like Quiddich---in favour of pursuit of pointless power. It manipulates him into pushing away mentors and people who care about him, including Dumbledore.

When it senses Hermione, it tailors its appeal to her insecurities and disappointments.

Slowly shifting into desperate paranoia and fear as he "realizes" that he "can't trust anyone"
