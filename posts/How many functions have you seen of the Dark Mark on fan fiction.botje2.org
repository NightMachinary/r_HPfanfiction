Seen them as brands in the soul depicting slavery, commonly leading to Harry being the head of house for all the death eaters

Seen them as Magic leaches Voldemort can use to take magic from his followers to himself

In one notable occasion has seen them act as Apparition beacons and those who wear it are also easy targets for Voldemort to use possesion on

Pretty sure I have read that death eaters could bring the Dark Lord's soul from the after life even after all the Horcruxes are destroyed, along with his main piece.

Sometimes I'm just waiting for someone to continue the Orochimaru simularity and having the Dark Marks be possessed by demons or something that Voldemort enslaved to provide his followers a power boosting transformation.

Others I think fan fiction authors try to fit as many abilities as they can think of into the mark to make Death Eaters in general a bigger threat. So have you seen any cool, weird or just plain idiotic functions of the Dark Mark in fan fiction?

Edit: oh and also seen them act as a Magic focus,


** IMO the most original feature that I liked is a fic where saying Voldemort triggers nearby Marks, which was used in a similar way as the Taboo in the Second War. This is what created the fear of saying his name, the legitimate belief that saying it could summon Voldemort nearby.

** Every mark has a part of Voldemort's soul embedded into them, effectively making them all Horcrux'

Can use the mark to punish followers.

Either complete your mission or the mark will judge you and you die.

Killing Voldemort kills all the marked death eaters.

The snake tattoo can animate under parsletongue for more intricate commands.

Dark mark bearers can draw upon a small amount of Voldemorts power to power boost in difficult situations.

Can send messages through the mark like Hermione's protean charm on the Galleons to send messages to the DA

Can sense his followers intentions through them, thus know when they are lying to punish.

Can only receive the mark if deliberately choosing to follow the Dark Lord, kills spies. (Snape only turns spy after receiving the mark )

When pressed can summon the Dark Lord, or if Dark lord presses can summon targeted followers or all followers.

Can turn invisible if someone tries to randomly check people for the dark mark.

*** That last one is smart though. Like wouldn't the super secret group of dark wizards want to be able to lie in spy situations if they were to lets say infiltrate the ministry.

**** yeah that ones from the Methods of Rationality.

So Death eaters can make it invisible, unless whoever is checking their arm already knows they are a death eater. That way it acts like a good way to identify death eaters, but only those that already have their cover blown.

** Not necessarily a function, but my favourite interpretation of it is that the dark mark is branded into their skin like a scar. In the books it's described as red (opposed to the black tattoo in the movies) and burns when touched. I'd like to believe Voldy branded his Death Eaters like cattle and acts as a shepherd to his sheep.

** I just finished a fic where it had a port key function although it never specifically said they were used as such. Just pointed out.

**** That's a good question, considering it was said in the books (by Snape to Fudge, I think?) that Voldemort expected his followers to instantly apparate to his side when he summoned them with the mark. So there must be /something/ involved in the whole process that gives direction to them.

** The two canon items that show up are:

1. Responds somewhat to Riddle's status (faded out while he's out of action, becomes more prominant as he gains strength in GoF)
2. Can be used to beacon in other DEs (also GoF, graveyard), though someone using the mark on someone else is apparently not pleasant in at least the movieverse

â€‹

That said, them not being on mind controlled troops makes sense, why mark someone you're literally using to throw away? On the other hand that might be dependant on how important any particular controlled person is and how much they need to be monitored or pulled arond for more instructions.

** One I liked was a very AU version of him where he & his fellow dark lady make it so the mark instantly kills if it senses you've betrayed them.

** Having all DEs with the mark and tying their lives to his does make for a great cleaning operation but what I always wanted to see was someone using a horcrux to leech not only Voldemort's magic but also the magic of all those marked, the perfect tool for a Mary Sue.

** In Puzzle, Voldemort could draw on the power of his Death Eaters through their marks, which had the effect of making them all squibs when he was finally defeated, since he'd sucked out all their magic in a futile attempt to save himself.

** One of my personal favourites is that it acts as a magic leech to boost Voldemort's power at the expense of the branded. I rather like this theory because it fits well with my headcanon of horcruxes weakening the user's magic as they're destroyed.

** From HPMOR, as a red herring. Being invisible and only appearing if the opposition knows that they are a death eater. Also planting some on innocent people to cause more distrust.

** There's at least one where the dark mark gives the Death Eaters a basic sort of Occlumency to protect Voldemort's secrets and make them less susceptible to Boggarts, Dementors, Confundus spells -- not immune, but resistant. The exception, of course, is anything cast by Voldemort himself. Since he Marked them, he can ignore the defence that he granted them. That leaves only legitimate practitioners of Occlumency able to resist him at all.
