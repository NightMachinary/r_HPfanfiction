Is it just me, or is anyone else having problems with this too? I can't find any settings that would make the text color more readable...

--------------

To clarify exactly what problem I'm experiencing, this subreddit's background is dark grey.

On the main [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] page, any thread that I haven't clicked a link to yet, is in black; black on top of dark grey can be difficult to read.

When I click to open a thread on the same page, a hover-thingy comes up that shows the thread; however, this hover-thingy is in white; since the text is also in white, this makes it impossible to read the thread's posts on the hover-thing.

Opening a thread on a different page poses no problems to me; a clicked-on title goes light grey, which is easier to read on dark grey, and white text on a dark grey background is also very readable.


** Install RES, untick use subreddit style on the right hand side of the page. I dont know what's actually causing your problem, but that will probably make it at least readable.

** Yea just piggybacking on the OP post... I am not having any issues, but to be honest I have been hating this new style compared to the old one.

** I'm currently using chrome with an extension called Stylish that lets me overwrite some of the CSS code. So I've inverted the background and text colors.

** I don't know if the css was changed since you posted this but the text is white for me so I'm not sure what you're experiencing. Sorry.

**** I don't know how or why you're getting that, because it's certainly not a feature of our stylesheet - or Reddit itself. Reddit posts shouldn't be floating like that.

It's probably some third party app interfering.

Your options are to a) remove whatever third-party plugin is causing that, or b) install [[https://redditenhancementsuite.com/][RES]] and uncheck "subreddit style" on the sidebar

***** Well, it's not a third-party app...I don't have any extensions installed except for AdBlock and Reddit's whitelisted...unless Google Docs is doing something.

And I don't have beta testing selected in my Reddit options either...I do have the 'allow subreddits to show me custom themes' option on, but I kind of want to keep that, I wouldn't be able to tell the subreddits apart otherwise.

****** Really strange. Try opening up Reddit in Edge or something?

It would be stupid if Reddit is AB testing style changes on subreddits with /significantly different CSS/.

**** That's really weird. Looks like it's opening self posts in some kind of frame. Maybe some new feature reddit might be A/B testing? Try right clicking on links and opening in new tab.

***** I do that most of the time anyway, this hover-up thing only happens when I left-click a post.

When I middle-click to open in a new tab, the theme doesn't pose any issues.
