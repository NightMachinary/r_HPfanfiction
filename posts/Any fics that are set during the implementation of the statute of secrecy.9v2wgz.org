Considering how the secrecy of magic is such a core value in the wizarding word, I find it odd that there are so few fics(if any) that look into things like the witch hunts and the strict isolation of an entire portion of the population. It'd be a fic where the author would have to come up with a lot of information themselves but I reallly like the idea.


** theres probably not that many cause any one who trys to reserch what the trials were like for a fic are going to run into the problem of the witch hunts basically not being a thing (At least not to the degree j.k.rowling thinks it was a thing)

*** Yes they were. The North Berwick trials ended in 70 people implicated over 2 years.(Which is huge for the population of the time.)In mainland Europe its estimated that 30,000 to 60,000 were executed through out the period. The thing is that in cannon the witches simply cast charms to protect themselves.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick_witch_trials]] Edit: The number executed in Berwick is unknown.
