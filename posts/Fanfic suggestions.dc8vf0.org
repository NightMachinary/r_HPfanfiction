Are there any SB/OC fanfics out there where the main character is quite Mary-Suey but still flawed. And where the overall fic is well written?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): She's not a complete OC, but this Petunia has made some very different choices than in canon. She's quite BAMF, but still nurses a huge inferiority complex.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Ooh I've been waiting for the opportunity to recommend this fic!! Linkffn(The Good Morrow; Witchcraft by A Picture)

Witchcraft by a Picture is the prequel to the SB/OC fic and it's not itself SB/OC but after you devour Good Morrow you HAVE to read it!

The premise of the Good Morrow written by the author in the summary is not even comparable to the amazing writing and content inside, so don't be put off by the summary that sounds cliche

  If you think that Hogwarts was squeaky clean in the 1940's, think again. Sex, drugs, violence, love, jealousy, and a bit of murder... Welcome to Hogwarts! Tom Riddle/OC, Alphard Black/OC, OC/OC. Rated M

** I remember reading a fic called in the name of being honest. I can't say as to how Mary Sueish the OC was, but she did have some of those traits. Maybe you'll like it. It covers the first wizarding war but it's told through flashbacks. The ending is sad, though. I feel I had to warn you about that.
