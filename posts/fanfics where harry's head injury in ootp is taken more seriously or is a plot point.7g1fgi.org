in this one fanfic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1073564/chapters/2155127]]

the author gives a good reason and explanation for harry's behaviour, the idea being he has a head injury, anyone ever seen a fanfic where this is addressed?


** In HBP Harry was hit in the head by an iron cannonball travelling at over 100mph, something that would have smashed a Muggle head and killed them instantly. Pretty sure wizards are more resistant to (head) injury.

If they are charmed, presumably there is no reason they couldn't be charmed to strike a head with less force than an arm.

#+end_quote

The point of boxing is to hit the other guy as hard as you can, but boxers still wear padded gloves and other protective gear to minimize the risk that someone dies.

We have presented two possible explanations for Harry not dying from that bludger.

1. Wizards possess some form of supernatural durability or damage resistance - at least for their head - that goes unmentioned throughout the rest of the series or
2. Hogwarts bludgers are charmed to never strike with enough force to kill, just as they are charmed to chase targets

It seems to me that #2 is more likely given the numerous magical objects we have seen, although I certainly have no issues with #1 (especially in fanfiction) since it doesn't directly contradict canon. And if one counts the movies, Newt giving a muggle a helmet while not wearing one himself might support it, although maybe Newt was just going to rely on the Shield Charm and other spells.

******* Or it could be as simple as Hagrid would never have expected them to travel anywhere by Muggle methods, and even if they did they could have used a Shield Charm to protect themselves from harm in crashes.

That heavily implies that a car crash is incapable of killing them. A better argument would be that they have spells and the like possibly superior reflexes that help them but it evidence does suggest they are more durable.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

While on magic broomsticks that travel at over twice that speed. And anyway, I find it more impressive that humans are able to routinely hit small objects traveling over 100 mph with a stick (baseball).

#+begin_quote
  Able to see and pinpoint a ball the size of a walnut while they fly at speeds hovering around 150mph
#+end_quote

That's perception, not reflexes.

150 mph was a firebolt's max speed, it didn't hover at 150mph, seekers wouldn't always be going that fast. And we're told in canon it usually takes hours and sometimes takes days to find the snitch, so not sure how impressive that is. Presumably the snitch doesn't leave the quidditch field, so that's a small area, and it travels more slowly than brooms.

#+begin_quote
  dueling while dodging jets of light that have to move at substantial enough speeds or they are useless.
#+end_quote

Without knowing the actual speed of spells, this doesn't say much. Humans have demonstrated the ability to pluck arrows out of the air, that seems pretty impressive too.

Also, I don't recall many (or any?) spells actually being dodged in canon. I remember Harry diving behind a gravestone in Goblet of Fire, but Harry didn't actually dodge the spell, it just struck the physical object he had taken cover behind, and he started moving before the spell had been completed.

****** I feel the opposite in terms of likeliness, given:

1. Wizards live much longer than Muggles.

2. Wizards can shrug off Muggle poisons.

3. Quidditch is noted to be a violent and dangerous sport.

4. A bludger being dangerous was a plot point in one of the books.

These, in combination with my argument above, seems to me to heavily suggest the first of your two explanations: that the possession of magic gives wizards superior resistance to physical injury (this being a separate issue to the also very useful ability of healing magic to repair injuries that are sustained), and not the latter (that Quidditch is played with Holodeck Safety Protocols engaged).

******* 1. Longevity has nothing to do with toughness, not in biology for certain, and I don't recall any evidence for that in magical species

2. I don't recall this, what is the source? In real life biology, resistance to toxins and poisons, even diseases, does not bestow resistance to physical damage, but with the magical world, who knows? Seems like it could go either way.

3. I don't see this as relevant, many would describe boxing as a violent and dangerous sport even though they use safety methods to minimize the chance of death. Wizards can survive direct contact with bludgers because they're supernaturally tough or the bludgers are charmed, but that doesn't mean Quidditch still isn't dangerous and bloody.

4. I don't think this supports either option. Harry thought the bludger was trying to kill him, but Dobby didn't want to kill Harry, so perhaps Dobby knew the bludger couldn't kill him because of a charm. Or, as you proposed, he knows wizards are tough enough to likely survive it. Or Dobby doesn't know anything about Quidditch and bludgers.

*** This is a minor quibble with a largely correct statement - I don't think bludgers move at 100 mph. I mean, have you actually seen something move at 100 mph? You have zero time to react. Combine that with the length of their bat, and that they're swinging with one hand, and I don't find > 100 mph plausible. Closer to 50-60.

But then again, the counter-argument here could be, because /magic/

***** Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and assume there's a magical element in the bludgers on the bats. Or JKR just didn't do her physics right.

Because generating enough torque with one hand and a small bat to force a dense iron ball into speeds over 100 mph to hit other objects moving at speeds over 100 mph all while balancing hundred feet in the sky on a broom? That's peak athleticism combined with beyond human hand-eye coordination and timing. Sort of like beaming onto the Enterprise while she's moving at warp speed.
