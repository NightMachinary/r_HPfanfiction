:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Not sure how long it was but it was fem Harry and Stargate, she flirtet with Samantha Carter.... Not sure what else there was in that fic to be honest


** One of the chapters in my Harry Potter Story Fluffle sounds like a good fit. There are two Stargate crossover chapters there, 4 an 12, but #4 sounds right.

They are all sample intro chapters for possible stories, which would explain why you can't remember anything more. I mean, there was more than just flirting! But not much, since it was just setting up basics for plot, setting, and characters.

  Fluffle: A pack of bunnies; or, in this case, a collection of 1st chapters of stories which may or may not get written. Most are x-overs. Some are FemHarry. Most are femslash. All are interesting, but many have problems preventing me from creating strong plots. None are up for adoption, but if you have ideas to help so a full story can be written, I'd love to hear from you.
