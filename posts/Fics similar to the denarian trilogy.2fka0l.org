I'm looking for a fic similar to the denarian trilogy. Basically harry molded from a young age by an evil voice in his head. Preferably not voldemort. No slash please.


** It's not quite a perfect match, but for evil influences in youth one might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] (and sequel) by Ruskbyte, a HP/Hellraiser crossover? (40k words, complete).

#+begin_quote
  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/17/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Whispers]] has the Elder Wand speak to him in his head. Supposedly there's a sequel in the works. (Hey [[/u/__Pers]], any word on that?)

*** Thanks for the rec. It is basically the same premise, I love the whole harry being an asshole thing.

** Context wise, as in evil voice thing: no. But you might want to suffer a chapter or two of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9101451/1/Kaleidoscope-of-Magic][Kaleidoscope of Magic.]] This Harry gives off almost exactly the same emotional state as the Denarian Harry. Some things seem cliche at the start, but they evolve in a very logical and flowing manner.

*** Thanks, it is a pretty good read so far. Other than harry being an idiot and telling dumble he will kill and torture him every chance he gets it is very good.
