I've seen several pretty rude reviews recently, not just on my own fic but on other people's, and I just wanted to point something out.

Fanfic writers have literally no obligation to write fanfic. Fanfic writers don't have to be here.

They write fanfic for fun, or as a tool to improve their writing, or whatever, but they definitely do not do it because they are bound to any individual's fic preferences.

If a fic updates after a long while, and your only response to the author is "don't take so long to update next time", that author is not hearing "I like this fic and would like to hear more of it more often". They are hearing "I am an entitled child and hate that you do not bend your entire life around my personal reading practices."

The general rule of thumb is "don't be a fucking asshole".


** It reminds me a bit of the separation between a Game master (for dnd or similar) and their players.

The players only really interact with the game on the night, unlike the GM who spends not only the night running the game but the time between planning and thinking about the next night. A GM never really stops playing.

As Sepp Herberger was famous for saying, "After the game is before the game."

I feel it's the same for writers.

But anyone who's never written before can't really appreciate this. The "don't be a fucking asshole" rule still applies either way.

Do you mind linking your fanfic?

Who the fuck are you to tell authors to take down works they have spent hours and hours working on, and had to stop for personal reasons you have no clue about.

**** I don't see any particular reason why you need to take the story down, unless you want to for some reason. You're the author and you get to decide whatever you want, whether that's updating, abandoning an old work, or choosing to take something down. The readers pay you nothing (hopefully), and you are under no obligation to do what the readers want. They could ask for updates respectfully, but if they start demanding you to do something, then they're the ones being disrespectful of the time, effort, and emotion you've put into your stories.

TL;DR: You can do whatever you want. Pls update "The Aurors" tho ;)

If the update requests are becoming bothersome, you could always add in a note to the fic or your profile that you won't be continuing it. That's something I always appreciate!

So: fanfiction writers are not your bitch.

I believe in hope. I would rather wait forever for a fantastic update than a shitty one made early to cater to readers. And if a fanfic author decides to stop writing, well, what can you do? Harassing them doesn't get the job done any faster.

  If a writer takes such an undertaking on, they also have some responsibility to the reader.
#+end_quote

No they don't. Authors take time and effort to write, they work hard to deliver something and most they get is scorn if the time between the updates increases. "A few trolls" is not the issue. If you can't write, you can't write.

#+begin_quote
  You need to finish what you start, and attempt to do it in a timely fashion.
#+end_quote

No. You cannot go to someone and hold a gun to their head and tell them to update something, expecting that they will suddenly write faster. They won't. If they are burned out, their idea just doesn't sound as good anymore or they're dissatisfied, there's nothing they can do, and trying to guilt trip them into something because the readers are entitled to an end just shows a horrible arrogance.

You claim to be a writer, then offer us an insight on your multi-chapter tens of thousands of word long finished fiction, please. Written in a 'timely manner', good and compelling to read, before sprouting off nonsense.

Nobody has any responsibility, nobody has any obligations, nobody is entitled. If the readers are going to be toddlers, maybe point at them and say 'write your own and see how it goes' before trying to pin the blame on the authors.

#+begin_quote
  No they don't.
#+end_quote

But they kinda do, though. IMO once you started, you *have* some sort of obligation\responsibility\whatever to finish it, cuz you got people invested in your story, so it's kinda "asshole-y" move, in my book, to just drop it mid stride. i don't saying "keep writing despite anything", just don't leave thing hanging. as i understand it writers usually have some general idea to where thing are headed. so why not, if you "burned out" or "idea just doesn't sound as good anymore" - post your thoughts and plans about what eventually would have happed as last chapter\AN? it would make people like me immensely happy.

as for time between updates - i don't really care, the sooner the better ofc, but as long as author is updating its all good. i would have liked though if, from time to time, authors, who update like once a year, left messages that they alive and kicking.

***** TLDR: No they don't. Obligation arising from where? Legality? Morality? Obviously not. Some kind of social contract? There isn't one. Full stop. That is it.

If they took time out of their lives to read what I or someone else wrote, that was their choice. If they enjoyed it, then they're better off for it, but that enjoyment does not somehow magically create an obligation on a writer's part to finish what they wrote. A reader got some entertainment for free, generally leaving little useful feedback (and God bless the outliers). Seriously. Try applying this standard you're imposing writers to any other scenario and you'll laugh at how silly is sounds.

As for posting thoughts and plans or an announcement in general of discontinuity, there's an act of finality to that. They never know when they might want to pick something back up again in the future and if they make that announcement, they're far less likely to do so. There's nothing stopping them to, logically, had they made that announcement or not but...it's hard to explain this feeling to something who's never written and wrestled with the idea of dropping a story. I'd say it's like a mother deciding to abort though obviously far less serious an issue.

#+end_quote

lets say i decided to baked bunch of cookies 2 times a month and proceed to give them up to people for free. i did it for a year straight and then stopped, because i wasn't feeling like making this particular dish anymore. People who enjoyed this specific pastry started to demanding more of it. Now legally i do not have to continue. Cuz if they took time out of their lives to eat what I or someone else cooked, that was their choice. If they enjoyed it, then they're better off for it, but that enjoyment does not somehow magically create an obligation on a cook part to finish that quota. It is expected(in this strange little world, if you decided to give your cooking for free, you expected to give out certain amount(representation of people expectation to finish your work)), but not legally binding. A eater got some food for free, generally leaving little useful feedback("oh my good that's delicious, please cook more!" or "Jesus Christ! This cookies are shit!"). So while legally i can tell them all to fuck off, from a moral standpoint, IMO, least i can do is to give out recipe.

p.s. i feel that i may have trouble getting my point across because of my poor command over English language.

  All artists have responsibilities to their patrons.
#+end_quote

They don't. If you are getting paid for a job, you have a responsibility to do that job. If all you get are words and reviews, there is nothing you are responsible for.

The fact that you immediately jump onto attacking me instead of actually arguing against my points, calling me hateful, angry and negative, despite my opinion being just as viable as yours is shows just how weak your arguments are. When I called for you to show any of your writing, finished, multi-chapter and long enough to actually count, you diverted the attention. Instead of claiming you're a published author who knows so much, I will have to ask for proof. The burden of proof lies on the one who makes the claim, after all.

#+begin_quote
  The way you describe it, all readers just provide scorn, and all you get is trolls.
#+end_quote

Unnecessary exaggeration. I specifically said "a few trolls" is not the problem. The problem are people like you, who believe that every reader has entitlement to the end of a story.

#+begin_quote
  Did I ever say anything about holding a gun to their head, or guilt tripping? No. Again, you seem to be taking this quite personal. I have a feeling you have had some bad experiences before and sorry for that.
#+end_quote

Again, ad hominem. You are trying to undermine my argument by talking about me instead of the argument. The gun is the heckling people like you and other readers offer the author for abandoning a story.

#+begin_quote
  Again, you seem quite angry about this. Why? I would never want to read content from you if this is how you treat people. You dont even comprehend what I wrote.
#+end_quote

Ad hominem. Try again.

#+begin_quote
  I never pinned ANY blame on the authors.
#+end_quote

It's not about blame. You still put the readers above the author.

#+begin_quote
  All artists have responsibilities you then have a responsibility to them but you do have a responsibility
#+end_quote

You cannot put "You have control over the situation" and "You have responsibility" together. You claim the responsibility should stand above the control. If the choice of the author is "I will drop this story because I do not wish to finish it", then that's it, that's the control.

#+begin_quote
  The more I read through your comment, the more I feel like you are a writer who has been heavily trolled for some reason. Your anger flows out of the comment quite heavily. You are basically screaming at me through your words, despite the fact that what I said was quite reasonable.
#+end_quote

Ad hominem. Attacking my argument through me just makes your arguments weaker. Welcome to a discussion, you're doing it wrong.

#+begin_quote
  If as a writer you cant understand that, then I am afraid you probably will continue to have issues. If you as a writer can't spell 'can't' correctly, you will probably continue to have issues. <- See, ad hominem, fun stuff.
