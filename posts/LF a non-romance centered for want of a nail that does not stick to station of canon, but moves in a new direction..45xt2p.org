Yes, I know that kind of thing is rare. No, Im not a big fan of any kind of bashing, particularly Dumbledore bashing.

Romance must not be the core plot of the story.

Thank you.

And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), deserves a special recommendation: the story setting is very AU, especially in the Muggle world where nuclear weapons were never developed and European countries were at each other's throat.

In the wizarding world, James and Lily didn't trust Dumbledore at all, and they laid a nasty trap for Voldemort in their home. Predictably, the ever overconfident LV stepped on the trap and got his body blown up. James and Lily then fled England to avoid Dumbledore's control, and had to move every few years. Incensed by all this hiding and running, a young Harry vowed to gain power and followers so he could one day force the wizarding world to leave them alone. Well, things turned out quite differently....

The author has shown excellent knowledge in politics, strategy, and the art of war. The writing is also very good, and characterizations are great. Voldemort is still the key opponent in the story, and he is even more competent and intelligent than in the canon, but Harry is more than a match for him.

*** This is a story that I see recommended time and time again. I tried reading the first chapter and what I found was a not particularly well written introduction with sloppy exposition (bullet points in the A/N? A truly talented author would have worked all those differences in the story in a cohesive way instead).

I reached the end of the chapter and saw no valid reason to read the next. It might just not be for me, but I'm willing to give it another shot. About when would you say the story picks up? When does the reader get hooked?

**** On the first try of reading this story I dropped it around chapter 5 because both the setting and writing style seemed very boring. On the second time, I noped out because Harry was an OoC sociopathic asshole. When I ran out of good and long stories the third time, it finally managed to get my interest.

If the first chapters seem boring to you, try skipping 10 chapters at a time till the events start developing, maybe that'll help. Also expect almost all of the characters to have extremely different personalities from canon.

#+end_quote

No, they hadn't and no, it wasn't. 'Defy' is a very broad criterion.

#+begin_quote
  MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

  JKR: Of James and Lily?

  MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

  JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, *anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for.* And both couples qualified because they were both fighting.
#+end_quote

Also:

#+begin_quote
  I failed to see why their win was so outrageous.
#+end_quote

Because Voldemort isn't someone you just /beat/. The only one who can conceivably face him in anything resembling a duel of skill is Dumbledore, and even he can't beat him outright.

Aside from that, the whole thing is terribly written. The Point of View shifts from Voldemort to James back to Voldemort (and then does it again within a few paragraphs). The duel lacks proper descriptions that are needed for visualization and is far, far too ramble-y. The action is mostly Voldemort doing a spell and James dodging or deflecting, and so on -- it reads like a summary of a duel rather than an actual duel. The /only/ line of description is terrible and would have been better left out anyway.

#+begin_quote
  True to his predictions, the moment Lily entered the fray---wand ablaze as she raced down the staircase---Voldemort resorted to using his more destructive spells, causing holes to appear all over the house as explosions blasted them into creation.
#+end_quote

'holes all over the house'... really? Instead of describing, I don't know, glass breaking or part of the roof falling in or something. Something that would a solid visual of what's going on. The author fails at that completely.
