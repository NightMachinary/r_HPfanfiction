As always, this is for sharing your opinions. I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts. If it's because another pairing is better, that's a perfectly valid reason.

Edit: I realize this has probably been done before, but don't really care.


** Harry/Snape, Sirius/Snape

I love Snape as a character, but he really shouldn't be romanticized and there's no way Harry could ever fall in love with him. Also I think if Sirius ever read a Sirius/Snape fanfiction he would spontaneously combust.

** For me its Drarry and Hinny

Drarry is 8 out of 10 times the same boring troupes and rushed romances, and I dont feel great about bullies to lovers ya know?

Hinny is just awful, its creepy and forced and reduces a really cool charater (Ginny) into a boring role. Plus I hate that shes so similer to lily potter it's real gross.

I do enjoy both Ginny and draco as charaters but I simply pass all these fics by

** Apart from the absurd ones, I think I dislike Wolfstar the most. Unfortunately, since I read mostly Marauders Era fics, I have to put up with it. I just don't see Sirius and Remus together at all, and I have yet seen a fic that would make me believe in their relationship. Most of the time, the pairing requires Remus and Sirius to act completely OOC, and it changes the dynamic of the Marauders from what we know from the canon.

*** It's not my least favorite, but I still always filter it out on ao3. There are so many where they're just teenage boys in the 70s that portray Remus as a quite nerd and Sirius as a flamboyant gay. Yeah, Sirius might have been over the top, but he was also pretty cruel and Remus had to be a more of a troublemaker if he was one of them.

I wouldn't mind it half as much if they were actually in character.

*** Yeah, the "star crossed lovers" idea falls apart in canon when you realise Sirius didn't trust Remus with the info about secret keepers (someone said James thought it would be the highest dishonour to not trust his friends, so Sirius must have talked him into that one) and Remus very quickly and easily decided Sirius was guilty.

** Ron/Hermione. I don't think there's a canon pairing I dislike more, not just in HP but in fiction in general. I tried to like it, I read some highly recommended Romione fics... I still could never warp my head around it. Imo they're opposites that are mutely destructive rather than the ones that attract.

Harry/Hermione. Though I see why people would ship the main character with his best girl friend, this pairing never once crossed my mind when I read books. It feels more incestuous then actual incest (I mean, Jaime/Cersei feels more natural to me). The way this pairing is often written also... Hermione's whole world gets unhealthy centered around Harry, she basically lacks any live outside of him. And Harry gets smothered and weighted down by her.

Any pairing with Snape. First, I can't see him as charming cool and smooth-talking the way some people do. Even if he was never DE and a bully, he still would be a foul, deeply unpleasant individual. Second, I'm someone who has no problems with large age gaps, teacher/student, etc. but something about Snape's love life being in a limelight makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't mind it being mentioned, or playing out in the background but reading any details makes me feel like I'm... reading about my parents or something.

They can both do a lot better.

That being said, /all/ of the canon pairings, except maybe Bill/Fleur are pretty terrible. Harry going for his roommate's girlfriend like the day after Dean rolls off of her? Luna ending up with the 90 year old MC of Fantastic Beasts? Draco /not/ sucking face with a dementor?

From the way Fleur was acting, I don't know if I could last half a year of being nice to her. And even after she started hating Fleur, she still tried to act nice to her and only snapped at her once or twice.

Even Hermione and Ginny were both relatively innocent, since Hermione only said one comment about Fleur in the whole book and Ginny only made fun of Fleur a few times. I don't think either of them got to the level of horribleness that Fleur did.

Let her be Harry's friend, let her be one of the main-sidecharacters, sure. But don't force her down my throat.

**** ... I'm honestly not completely sure 😅 That was years ago, so I can't say for certain what I thought back then and what I just think /now/ that I thight back then

What I remember quite clearly is that I actually enjoyed the brass way she introduced herself on the train and the obvious talent she had in regards to magic. I think I expected her to play a more prominent role from then on, only to disappointed in that regard. /Then/ she was saved from the Troll by Harry and Ron which I hated with a passion because this "cool" character I had built up in my head just needed to be rescued!

Unfortunately, nothing she did for the rest of the series could shake me off from this disappointment I felt since then.

Then, years later, I started to read fanfiction (though not for Harry Potter at first) and suddenly realized that there /must/ be some stories with a cool Hermione. After all, I can't be the only one disappointed with her, right?

/Right?/

Unfortunately, I was disappointed /again/. There were a lot of "cool" and "badass" Hermione stories, but all of them took it too far. She wasn't just /strong/, but unquestionably /the strongest/; she wasn't just /smart/, but /the smartest/ etc. Then there were also all these Hermione/Snape and Hermione/Voldemort stories that /just wouldn't stop plopping up everywhere/, making my frustration only grow.

Basically, I simply reach my boiling point at some time. I know that there are surely good stories with her, but just reading her name annoys me. No matter how well-written she is, I simply /can't/ care an I'm honestly tired of trying.

** Disregarding the absurd (anything with Death Eaters), it's a close tie between Ron/Hermione and Lupin/Tonks, and for pretty much the same reason. Based on canon actions, those relationships are poisoned. After Lupin ran away, Tonks will always have that nagging voice in the back of her head that it might happen again, that he already left her once and so on. Similarly, I don't see Ron/Hermione lasting due to past actions. They have far too many memories of bad fights, on top of Ron leaving. And while on a rational level it is understandable that it was the Horcrux, Hermione has a long memory in canon, and despite also being influenced by the Horcrux she never left. And his jealousy is not a good look either. Like with Tonks, those will be the treacherous voices in the back of her head which will poison the relationship.

** Canon pairings because they're boring...been there done that.

Harmony because I'm too used to the idea of them being just friends, and because I feel like they're both serious people so they'd be a rather boring couple. I won't abandon a story if it's a component, but it doesn't make me excited about it.

Luna with any of the Slytherins we know or Ron because I'm pretty sure they would have killed her within 10 minutes or less for being so ridiculous (sorry Luna fans!)

** Harry, Hermione or Luna paired with any of:

-Draco

-Snape

-Voldemort

-Any other Death Eater (excluding fics where Harry or Hermione /is/ a DE themselves)

-Any Marauder

-Anyone 15+ years older or younger (except when at least one party is an immortal over a century old, because that kinda narrows one's relationship prospects)

Also, Ron/Luna makes me angry. I love Luna and hate Ron.

*** Ron/Luna is so awfully written 99% of the time (and not just bland like most Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny). He let's her ramble on about stuff, and that's the base of their relationship. Like, that's not healthy or how relationships are supposed to work.

** Anyone with Snape. He was awful. He abused little children with no remorse. He is a bigot. He wallowed in self pity. He was a whiny incel. He was a bigot terrorist. He was horrible to the supposed love of his life's only child. He held onto petty grudges forever. Just no.

Ron/Hermione. They were not compatible to me and felt forced with no chemistry. Characterizations of them together make him seem dumb and insensitive and her like a bossy nag like a bad sitcom couple.

Ron/Luna. No compatibility. She's too out there and he just isn't and I can't see him being endeared by that.

Harry/Hermione. I just don't see it. They are like siblings. Just because ppl are friends doesn't mean they need to date.

Hermione/Lucius. Please ppl whyyy. Like ok if this is some dark being held captive Stockholm syndrome fic then maybe but like this is not happily ever after.

** Most male slash pairings, for the simple reason I don't much like reading the stories. I'm ok with slash as a side pairing, but I'm not thrilled with it being the main pairing. Nothing against gay men, I just don't like reading it.

My least favourite would have to be Harry/Draco, because I cannot stand the blonde ponce.

Harry/Snape. I hate Snape. He's a vile, bitter person.

Harry/Voldemort - Harry/Tom Riddle. That bastard murdered his parents. No way Harry would forgive that.

And finally my absolutely, utterly loathed pairing: Ron/Hermione. Granted, I am an avid Harmony shipper, but Ron and Hermione? Despite the way he treats her? Really? I'd like to think Hermione has more self respect than to go for Ronald Bilius.

Edit: ok, so now I've been downvoted six times, and I'm honestly wondering why. Are people offended by the fact that I do not like reading stories where the main pairing is male slash?

If that's the reason, I must say it's a rather... weak reason to downvote my comment. The OP asked about our least fovourite pairings, and our reasoning, and I gave mine.

I honestly don't see the problem. A big reason why I read fanfiction is because it gives me the ability to choose what I read. I don't enjoy male slash, so I usually don't read them. It's honestly no different from avoiding stories with Harry/Ginny or Harry/Daphne. It's just a personal preference.

**** Perhaps you're right. I dislike the Ron/Hermione pairing so much, I didn't even consider that as the reason for the downvotes. I just reckoned most people would feel that way.

I immediately thought people figured I was a homophobe, because don't like male slash. Oh well...

****** I just dislike Ron because he's so damn flaky, and lazy. He mistreats Hermione almost throughout, as well. Oh, and JK used Ron to make Harry less interested/ambitious about his schoolwork.

I realize JK did it to make Hermione smarter and more relevant, but it was always going to reflect badly upon Ron, for a lot of readers.
