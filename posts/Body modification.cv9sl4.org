Are there any bod modification fics where the MC modifies his/her own body? I have read New Dawn at webnovel and The Art of Self-Fashioning. There is also snippets of dogbertcarroll where dumbledore transfigures his own body into that of a young woman.


** 'In the mind of a scientist' by ZenoNoKyuubi features a very much functionally insane Harry that's somewhat addicted to modifying his own body.

Inspired by Soul Eater's Dr. Franken Stein he is a vain, rude, obsessive and mentally unstable person craving for new and exciting ways to mock mother nature by doing things such as opening his own body to improve himself, create weird and unusual drugs, give Flamel, Dumbledore, the ministry and Voldemort the metaphorical middle finger and being intrigued to the point of obsession with Tonks' metamorposis abilities.

It's a funny story that made me laugh out loud several times and it has two sequels: 'Madness at the gates' and 'Madness effect' where he casually mocks all laws of nature in one way or another.

I highly recommend it.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.
