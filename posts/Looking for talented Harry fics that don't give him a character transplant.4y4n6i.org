I enjoy fics that feature a strong/talented/pro-active Harry. However, I also prefer fics which are canonical in characterisation and tone. Unfortunately there aren't too many fics out there than reconcile these two preferences.

Far too many strong Harry fics give him a sudden Dumbledorean level of academic intelligence, or have him suddenly extremely studious, or else simply give him a "power boost" which goes against the canonical mechanics of magic. I would prefer to avoid these kinds of fics.

I think it's perfectly possible to have a strong Harry without giving him a character transplant. You just have to put Harry into situations which bring out those canonical character traits which enabled him to learn the Patronus Charm in Third Year.

Harry learns best by doing, by being thrown in the deep end, through practical use of magic and experimentation. I think that's as viable a method of learning magic as understanding magical theory, in that they are each different paths to the same destination: they increase your understanding of (and thus connection with) magic, increasing your magical intuition. You can have a canonical strong Harry by having the fic focus on Harry learning by experimenting and exploring rather than spending all his time in the library.

Similarly, canon Harry may not enjoy studying for its own sake but he does not lack for motivation when the context is right. He is best motivated by two things: necessity (such as with the Dementors) and competitiveness (especially with Malfoy). A fic that exploits these traits to have Harry apply himself to magic more would be completely canonical in terms of characterisation.

Furthermore, Harry in canon is an extremely curious person, often going to great lengths to investigate things that have caught his attention. A fic could definitely use this trait by having some kind of magical mystery engage Harry's curiosity. And once his curiosity is engaged, Harry rarely relents.

Does anyone know of any fics like this? The best example I can think of is Ectomancer by RustyRed.

To be clear, when I say "talented Harry" I'm generally thinking of a Harry who exhibits talent at the same kind of level as his parents/Snape, not Dumbledore-level Harry, which I think is beyond the scope of canon-compatibility.

To clarify this (in case it gets thrown back in my face during a later magical theory discussion), I am not saying that practice is a /replacement/ for understanding magical theory. Rather I am saying that experimentation and exploration of magic is an alternative route to understanding magical theory on an intuitive level, essentially learning it first hand rather than second hand via books.

** I have to contest that canon Harry is a curious person. Iirc, in the first book, it wasn't Harry that was curious as to who Flamel was; it was Hermione. I'm not sure in book 2, but in book 3, he wasn't curious as to how Hermione attended her classes.

He's the quintesential 'greatness thrust upon him' protagonist. He does things out of necessity, as you mentioned.

For a believable canon Potter to be pro-active in magic, he needs an endgame (GoF and DA.) So give him something useful in the field, fanon runes-enchanting/rune casting, and he'll try to find out more. A typical wizard is a Ravenclaw, knowledge for knowledge's sake.

Look at the Dresden files series. Dresden is sort of like Potter. He has Bob the skull for a Hermione, and Dresden is Potter in application.

Also, I agree with the practical way for understanding magical theory. It maybe slower than working on/reading magic that was already established, but it'll be more personal. Thus, more powerful again citing Dresden files because of personal runes. Once someone knows the meaning of those runes, the magic gets weaker.

Personal experimentation in magic might be slow and dangerous, with occational explosions, but it'll be adjusted/instinctual for the user.

Also, sorry I haven't encountered the kinds of fics you've requested.

** Ironically enough this fic was recommended in another thread. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10349675/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Scar]]) I like to think he has that sort of feel were Harry learns by doing. I definitely recommend reading the notes at the end because they help to show where the author was trying to go. They were trying to get that kind of Harry. I think they succeeded and dropped the ball at times, but it was overall a good story.

It you haven't read blue steel yet I recommend that. It goes over the top and has some unique characterizations in it, but it's not bad. Read it with a grain of salt and you just might find what you're looking for. [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/]]

I agree that I like where Harry is challenged by doing and learning. It's why I love linkffn(make a wish) yes it's over the top and in reality a crack fic with a plot it's still good. I like how Harry grows and finds himself over a slow build. I also like how he ends up.
