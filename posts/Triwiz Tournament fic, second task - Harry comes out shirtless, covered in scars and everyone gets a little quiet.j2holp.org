:END:
Like the title says, I'm looking for a Triwizard Tournament fic. All I remember is the starter scene for the second task, where they're all lining up at the lakeside to jump in. Everyone else is there, then Harry walks up with his shirt off, revealing the marks of all the various injuries he's had over the years. Everyone sees, gapes, and goes quiet in that awkward "What the hell do we say to that?" sort of way.

There are so many purported series' that when you finish part one you either see that the second part isn't even completed or not even written.

Like take Kassiens never ending summer And lorddwars summer of change And also the Jamie Evans series which has beginnings of the second book, but naught else All of these are honks fics with purported sequels but that isn't the case. Then there are multiple stories which are abandoned and author never says anything about it. It's bloody annoying it is. Now the tonks/Harry pairing is my favourite. But most of them are incomplete or abandoned series' Like i said annoying. /sigh/

However none disappoint me as much as the incomplete third fic in the 'second chance at life' series. Honestly I dont even think of it as a hp fanfics, i think of it as a companion AUs to HP books...

I love the two fics in the series that have been completed. The third one is incomplete. I ve reread the whole series so many times. Sometimes in the wistful part of my heart i wish and hope that there are these 'last 2-3' chapters that i haven't been able to read yet, but if i reread it enough times, i will be able to read them (something like a secret level)...

It was pretty great and had a unique take on the horcruxes. So 197k words in the story in the 49th and last chapter after finally defeating Voldemort Harry is thrown back in time three years apropos of... nothing. And the story ends. It was a pity because I remember the rest of the story being really good.

** Okay. What scars. Let us go through the injuries that could have scarred by fourth year. Lightning bolt on forehead, can give you that but no one is really gonna be shocked by it. First year... no injuries that could have scarred. In fact no true injuries other than minor cuts caused by the flying keys, wouldn't scar.

Second year, broken arm followed by vanished bone. Painful but wouldn't leave a scar. Basilisk bite? Healed via Phoenix tears without a mark. No other injuries of note.

Third year: only incident of note that could have caused injury was the dementor at the quidditch match; Dumbledore caught him before he hit the ground, no injury mentioned. Whomping Willow through Werewolf Lupin failed to leave a mark on him, and Buckbeak respected Harry to not injure him. Final verdict no Scars.

Fourth year up to second task: Incident at Quidditch World Cup? No injury inflicted. First task, no injury inflicted, and even it had it would be common knowledge so a scar wouldn't be shocking.

Overall verdict: Harry Potter has no scars other that his initial lightning bolt that could shock people, nothing from all of Hogwarts up to that point and especially nothing from the Dursleys as that would have raised alarm bells during quidditch practice a long time before this, and thus would be semi-common knowledge amongst hogwarts students prior. All in all, if you want to do this Scars would have to be common knowledge long before the second task, and would have lead to drastic changes to Harry's home life way prior to this.

*** Not really it is stated in the books I think that the basilisk left a big round scar where it bit him Phoenix tears saved his life yes but didn't vanish the scar. When you think about it it makes sense because basilisk venom almost melts you from inside and phoenix tears are only known cure. And even jk Rowling mentioned that Dursleys did not stop at only emotional abuse. Everything else was just too bad to put in the books

**** Rowling is full of shit and shouldn't be talking about things she didn't have the guts to write, Harry never acts like someone physically abused and no one else in the series reacts to him like he's being abused in such a manner, if she wanted him to be an abused child rather than one who is just made to feel like shit (that is still abuse by the way just not physical) she should have written him that way. Talking about it after the fact reeks of attention seeking

As for the Basilisk bite, if I'm wrong I'm wrong nothing world ending about that.

**** Not attacking you even if you had. Just commenting on how if one writes an AU based on one incident one needs to take into whether or not said incident would have come prior and how that would have effected the story going forward towards initially planned point of departure.

***** Fair enough. Your comment did come off as somewhat aggressive and I'm still not entirely certain what in my post it was directed at or why it was made on a whats that fic post, so I was trying for a less... confrontational response while I tried to work out those things. :D

Like, an AU based on one incident? What incident did you read my post as referring to, might I ask?

And that was hardly me being aggressive, if I as trying to be aggressive I would have been insulting you're taste in fics/ideas all I was doing was critiquing the concept of which scars you were talking about.

** God, that sounds awful trope.

Never in canon was he depicted to have been /physically/ assaulted.

*** Said, no.

Implied, to a degree. Petunia swings at his head with a frying pan and they let a dog chase him trying to bite him. They also encourage Dudley to hit him (Hit him with your Smelting Stick, Dudley!) Not to mention all the times Vernon went purple with rage in the books from the tiniest things, which implies a really bad temper.

Issue is, Rowling basically wanted to eat her cake and have it too. She wanted him abused, but didn't want to make it 'too bad', so she implied abuse but didn't come out and say it.

So fanfic can go either way, depending on the author, really.

*** I mean, sure, I guess? Like I said to the other person, this is a whats that fic post, I'm not making a prompt, nor did I write the story I'm looking for.

You may dislike the idea of the trope, but I do believe the writer of the fic built on it to make an interesting scene. Didn't do shit with it afterward, so the execution of the trope could definitely have used more work in story terms, but it was an interesting scene.

And sure again, but it was a childrens book series so that would've been weird if he had been depicted being assaulted - and this is fanfic, not canon. Plenty of people change many bits of canon for a multitude of reasons. For Want Of A Nail is a trope for a reason, y'know. :)

Be that as it may there was enough of it anyways. We are already told that his bone was broken but he wasn't taken to the hospital. And so he sat in the cupboard alone and starved (until it healed of its own accord and most likely not properly) for - a week? Is that not enough mention of abuse.

***** Not what I said. Showing the after effects, the implications, the idea that he'd been abused both physically and mentally, that stuff all happened, yes. But actively telling us that he'd been physically assaulted and writing that into the narrative would've been frowned upon in a work written for children. Petunia went after him with a frying pan in the narrative, but we weren't treated to a word-by-word account of her hitting him. That's all I meant. My apologies for any miscommunication.

Don't misunderstand though, I'm not saying he wasn't abused. Even if the Dursleys hadn't ever physically hit him, like the other commenter said, what they did do was undeniably abuse and very serious abuse at that. Anything more than that is in the realm of canon fact-fighting and I don't know enough canon facts to get involved in those.
