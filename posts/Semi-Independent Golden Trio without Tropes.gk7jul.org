After First Year, Harry decides to be more serious. He thinks the only people he can rely on are Ron and Hermione, not because of any evil plots or terrible tropes, but because of canon experiences. Ron and Hermione stood with him and helped him stop Voldemort. McGonagall, supposed to be their head of house and helpful? She didn't even slightly entertain the thought that they might be right. Dumbledore? They don't see any maliciousness behind him, they just assume he's old and unreliable due to him being too late (They find out he freaking flew to the Ministry instead of apparating)

Gryffindor House? Even Fred and George treated him like shit because of the point loss from the Dragons. Ironic and massively hypocritical.

#+begin_quote
  But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker."
#+end_quote

They just decide "Fuck it we almost died and no one had our backs. let's take Magic more seriously" Hermione is the Theory girl, Harry is the practical Ace, and Ron knowing about the Wizarding World, and able to get information. No bashing or Tropes, no Lord everything, just "Fuck it we need to be more serious and independent" and they train hard as a Trio, and are WAY better prepared for all of the Canon events (Basilisk, Dementors, Tournament, etc) with Ron sticking by Harry as they're a Trio.


** linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) is the best example I know.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a non-magic AU (replacing magic with superspy skills and superscience a la James Bond films) which has this kind of a trio dynamic.

*** True, what lots of writers are more focus on is how to be unique from everyone else. That can end up being the downfall and a writers block for them. I find it that it's the way stories with tropes are executed that breaks or makes the story.

Say for example Harry is Lord of everything trope. Most of these fics are just using this as either a way to make the chapter seem longer or a way to say Harry is great and was woefully betrayed from having this information hidden from him. Then proceed to forget about him being a Lord. I find this trope works better in a political fanfic incorporate this trope in a way that flows naturally in this story. What are the pros to being a Lord of basically every house? Do they get more say in the ministry. What are the cons? Do you have to pay more taxes, you may have more votes but it's still a fraction of the entire Ministry. How does Harry gain allies and avoid having enemies. Etc.

***** That's me, but with pairings. I like to take any random pairing and then read how various authors try to make them happen.

Which is why it's such a shame when a Harry/Daphne pairing throws them together with a marriage contract and has them cooperating from chapter 2. I wanted to read about how they overcame the interhouse hostilities and got together. Now that you've thrown them together, you'll need some other points of conflict for the future and few authors are good at making them natural. Too many use the "Voldemort is after me so if I break up with her, she'll be safe" trope. Or "I killed a person in self-defense and/or defense of another and oh I'm evil now and she will hate me so I'll shut everyone out by yelling at them for one full chapter".

Another fun one is Harry/Hermione but they are in different houses.

** Here's the thing tho: reading about endless training instead of plot/tension is extremely boring. When stories go this route they often over show training scenes that become extremely repetitive (cough Fate ) and neglect actual plot/conflict for magic wank. I feel like the old truism "show don't tell" is often misunderstood by fanfic writers. Show things that are relevant to the plot. Every scene should move the plot forward even if stealthily Avoid repetitive scenes unless new information is added. Things that are not relevant to the plot should be told and implied.

*** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope][This page]] does a decent job of explaining it, I think. The key phrase that stood out to me was "a pattern in storytelling."

For an example in the context of Harry Potter fanfic, "friendly goblins" is a trope that immediately carries a number of connotations, most of them negative -- Harry is friendly to one or more goblins at the bank, this is unusual for wizards, and he immediately gains their friendship/favor/plot significance as a result for no real effort on his part beyond recognizing Griphook or saying "thank you." There are of course ways to write friendly goblins that don't involve that sort of tripe, but such cases are the exception, not the norm, and so "friendly goblins" became a trope associated with all the above.

** You've said semi-independent but described full independence. It's less trope removal and more removing all conflict from a story. The trio are already semi-independant: they were the ones to do find the philosopher's stone, enter the chamber and rescue Ginny. Those things were done without help from any of the characters you described.

I'm not trying to bash your idea, I'm just not sure where your conflicts will arise from. The fic will become very one-note if they're suddenly able to 'take magic seriously' and defeat every obstacle in their path.

*** Studying more spells and learning better and basically being a 3 person DA from end of First year wouldn't eliminate conflict. Harry still would have troubles. Him being more serious at learning spells, and maybe doing what he did before the 3rd Task in 4th Year wouldn't make the Basilisk any easier, given that they're basically immune to magic. Wouldn't make the Dementors not mob him constantly. Even if he just gets to 7th year level by the time he fights Voldemort in the Graveyard, he won't win without the Plothax. He'd just stand a better chance against the Generic Fodder Death Eaters that only know 3 Spells.

There might even be more conflict, given that they'd have no faith in anyone but each other, which would escalate in each year. Second year - Heir of Slytherin thing, no teacher stood up and said "Harry isn't the Heir of Slytherin". Basilisk thing - Dumbledore should have been the one to work it out, once again they just see idiot adults and lose faith even harder. Hagrid getting arrested "The ministry has to be seen doing something" - lose faith in the Ministry. 3rd Year - Lose faith in the Ministry even harder because they put basically Demons around children. It'd eventually result in some very jaded children thinking they had to do things themselves 100% and would lead to a few issues in its own right.

**** I think it does remove /some/ of the conflict, though. For example, Conjuration is a 6th year skill; if Harry is at 7th year level by the events in the Little Hangleton churchyard, he can conceivably save Cedric by conjuring a brick to block the Wormtail's AK. Also, knowing more combat spells means he lasts longer in the DoM at the end of OoTP, and the titular organization walks into an active firefight instead of a hostage rescue situation in the Death Chamber.

***** Was she tho?

McGonagall could be blamed for not paying attention to minute details, especially in the first few books, but gross negligence - not really.

First book - there isn't any solid proof for the Trio's claims, not to mention, the book is riddled with plot holes and conveniences.

Second book, Fourth book - She's usually blamed for not stopping others bullying Harry, but have you seen high schools? No one bullies kids around teachers. One would think there are enough places in a mediaeval castle to mess about without teachers knowing what you're doing.

Not to mention, being a Asst. Head/Vice Principal inhibits what she could do. She's supposed to be in a neutral position, she can't be seen favouring her students, especially if she's the head of the House.

She's accused of not stopping Snape's bullying, but Dumbledore himself protected Snape.

Third book - This one had her biggest fuck up, leaving Neville outside the common room, with a mass murderer on the loose is not something anyone should do.

But even this isn't much compared to the level of incompetence she shows in fanfics. Some of these make her out to be a Dumbledore worshipper who happily goes along with him as he endangers students on purpose, knowingly (being a mindless stooge) or unknowingly (being a complete moron who can't think for herself).

For fucks sake, we're talking about a woman who was nearly sorted in Ravenclaw, stood up against 4 Aurors to defend Hagrid, dueled Voldemort himself (with help) and did her best to protect students while being under whom she thought to be Voldemort's biggest supporter and Dumbledore's murderer, along with two other Inner Circle Death Eaters.

She is not without faults (short temper, dismissive and not really unbiased, she fucks Gryffs more than others, kinda like a reverse bias), but the comically unbelievable levels of idiocy shown in fics is just... Aagh!

A good happy medium that seems to redeem McGonagall's character is in Fairy Tail by Araceil

Linkffn(9596404)

Chapters 4-6 especially. While it's a crossover with the anime and manga Fairy Tail little to no knowledge about it is required to read.

While in the beginning McGonagall is opposed to Harry's “new magic” she starts to give Dumbledore a verbal dressing down before the scene changes.

** So the 12-year-olds turn into fully-formed, mature, independent masters of magic - rivalling older, wiser, more experienced adults - overnight? Through "training"? That's a trope in of itself.

*** Overnight? More like Constant years of hard practice. Most Wizards are lazy, that's canon, you don't see many Wizards decide they want to learn everything they can, you see them coast by, but I'm not talking about Sharingan levels of "See a Spell learn it and then dodge like a god" I'm talking about "Right, we'll get ahead. We know things are going to go wrong, and we can't trust the adults to help us. Voldemort is out there. Let's learn every spell we can, let's try and get ahead of the curriculum" and "Right, this is all the spells we'll be taught at Hogwarts. if we learn these, then we can learn to Silent Cast earlier"

Plus I'm thinking more by the End of Fourth Year with over 3 years of doing constant hardcore training and learning every spell they can, they can do better against the Fodder than "EXPELLIARMUS" cried Harry, of Canon. Fodder being the likes of Stan Shunpike and the Snatchers, and Draco Malfoy/Crabbe/Goyle pre 7th year level of Wizards, not Lucius/Bellatrix who only lose to idiot plot. I also said better against, not rivalling. Overnight would be "Harry awakens the Rinnegan just before the Graveyard. Chibaku Tensei GG" not "Harry Hermione and Ron have daily DA style sessions with just the 3 of them learning everything they can and preparing"

**** But what would they learn that would really give them that kind of advantage? You have to remember they are supposed to kids, and kids, even if they're armed with all the knowledge and training, are just kids. It's hardly likely that they'll be able to commit to rigorous regular training as well as schoolwork and having a social life without hitting burn-out very quickly. And besides that, I doubt Dumbledore would let them train each other in case they seriously injure themselves from practising apparition several years too early. There's a reason that a lot of spells are locked off until they're older.

And what if they learn the wrong lessons? Or will they instinctively know that, "The Patronus will be very important in third year and the summoning spell will be very useful in fourth year I should think, tee hee."

"Oops, better learn this spell that will instantly empty a cursed basin. I'm sure that will come in handy."

"What's that? I should learn a spell that creates a fake arm with fake blood just in case someone takes mine for a ritual? Good idea!"

"Occulmency at age 13? Yes please!"

"Oops, we almost had some meaningful conflict there! Quick, use the dozens of spells we learned earlier to quickly solve the problem!"

Besides, it's not like the trio doesn't do amazing things already. Harry kills a Basilisk with a goddamn sword in canon, as well as out-flies a dragon and fends off dozens of dementors with a single Patronus charm. They manage to hold their own for a while against a bunch of Death Eaters in the Ministry until they inevitably need saving by the Order. At some point, it goes from impressive to predictable and boring.

Harry Potter isn't Dragon Ball. It's not designed to be Dragon Ball. Harry isn't saved because he knows the best spells or has the best power levels. He wins because of his mercy and his kindness.

I'm not saying this can't be a good story. What I'm saying is that it could very easily become the trope-ridden story you wanted to avoid.

***** I'm thinking less "Oh, specific lessons" and more "Let's find Old OWL and NEWT tests and find every spell they test for at Hogwarts. Let's learn these. Let's learn Silent Casting earlier" and then when 3rd Year does come about "Fuck there are Dementors at Hogwarts. We read about the Patronus Charm, let's try and learn it" does make sense.

There's no reason Harry shouldn't have been trying to learn every single spell he could in Canon, ESPECIALLY after First year. He got into the Monotony of the Wizarding World WAY too quickly.

Harry should have been the Light side equivalent to 7th Year Tom Riddle by the end of DH in terms of skill. Not a match for Adult Voldemort, but someone that if he was facing 17-year-old Tom, would be dead even. That's what I'm going for, but without the bashing and Harry has infinite money and titles that those fics usually contain, but making it a Trio Fic rather than just Harry.

****** Maybe a challenge between them to learn a new spell once a week each and then share what they learned? That keeps the variety up and would keep it interesting for the kids

** I'd like to see Harry try to quit the Quidditch team second year but Draco cuts him off and he can't quit the team. Basically it'll be a nuisance if he quit then having to hear his teammates and Malfoy. So Harry decided to quit after the Slytherin game. How would the Gryffindor team react to Harry suddenly say I'm done after the game. Did Harry even want to be on the team in the first place? I'm sure it's applied he wanted to join. It would be interesting to see the teams and McGonagalls reaction. Normally the Quidditch team is seen as one of the few people who back Harry in stories.
