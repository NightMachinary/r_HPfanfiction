** Can you explain what "reading the books" fics are? I have heard them referenced two ways -

1) In the HP universe, the characters get copies of JK's books somehow (either before or after the events) and read them.

2) The fic author writes extra chapters/perspectives/"behind the scenes" stuff into the original books and as the reader you literally have to "read the books" along with the fic.

Or is it something else entirely?
