So I'm looking for this fanfic where Dumbledore goes to the Flamels when he realizes that the scar is actually a horcrux. Perenelle asks him to simply kill the child and Albus refuses to do so.

Later on in the story when Harry's life is in danger Albus suspects that Perenelle has something to do with it so he stands outside their mansion and sets it on fire, irking the immortal duo. Albus then warns them that if they are involved in repeatedly putting the boy in danger in hopes of killing him then they should stop.

Any ideas??


** Is this the one?

  It is said that convictions are more dangerous foes of truths than lies. What if the tale of the wizarding world wasn't the truth, but merely an interpretation of it? What if a single spark, instigated a man to do what was right, than what was easy? Starts at the end of fifth year. AU. [Elements from Fate/ Stay night] [Rated for Dark, mature themes]

** This one does involve the Flamels but not at all in the way you describe...

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
