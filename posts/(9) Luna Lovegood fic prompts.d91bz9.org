Some of these ideas are fairly fleshed-out. They're examples I thought of but know I will never write. Feel free to take a stab at any of these and twist and flesh to your heart's desire if any of these base concepts intrigue you. If you do, though, please share?)

1. A VINDICTIVE LUNA LOVEGOOD: who is so off-putting to her housemates that they believe her to be a dark witch. Whether she is actually a dark witch or merely putting on an act to successfully get people to back the heck off... hm. Surprise me!

2. A MORE INNOCENTLY (/cough/) VINDICTIVE LUNA LOVEGOOD: who gets back at her tormentors in Ravenclaw by making sure her actions properly manipulate 'the creatures only she can see' to make those people fail both academically and socially. Whether she is actually controling invisible creatures or simply furthering her ploy in psyching people out with an innate understanding of psychology... surprise me!

3. STUDENT MAGICAL PHARMACOLOGIST (closet drug dealer) LUNA LOVEGOOD: The teachers are baffled by miss Lovegood's imaginary creatures' sudden rise in popularity. Apparently Luna isn't the only one who sees them anymore, or the only one who has an opinion on how interactions with them affect both the physical and magical worlds. Or is she? Could they actually be real? If so, what forces are at work to reveal them to humankind and why? (Lonely, persecuted Luna either discovers or creates a mind-altering hallucinogen while apprenticing under Madam Pomfrey and spreads the substance around the school. She gains a following and the faculty overthinks the matter.) Luna might be just lonely and bullied enough to have been driven to drugging and indoctrinating people so that they will speak to and listen to and believe in her, and be friends with her, and protect her. Controlling people to be nice to her - without resorting to using an illegal Unforgiveable - is an alluring prospect, and drugs in the magical world do not have nearly the same level of government control as drugs in the muggle world do. She is dangerously close to making her debut as a potentially budding head-of-a-cult dark witch with aspirations to branch out and enthrall entire communities. For the good of both muggles and magicals, of course. World Peace and all that. Or: Luna is just that desperate to renew an arcane religion to which Luna and her mother adhered; because if the old ways are not soon renewed and if these creatures do not soon gain new believers to worship them and more evenly disperse their populations and mitigate their affects and grant them offerings to appease them... bad things will happen to the universe. Things that might adversely affect fate and destiny itself. (Looking at you, Boy-Who-Lived!) Or she just really wants the religion to not be lost and to not be alone anymore in celebrating the same festivities she once shared with her mother.

4. HOGWARTS SCHOOL COUNCILOR LUNA LOVEGOOD; AU in which Luna is an adult throughout canon events: Grown-up Luna has earned a Doctorate in both muggle psychiatry and magical mind healing and has finally convinced the school board to hire her on as the first mental-health professional to Hogwarts' staff. Miss 'Loony Lovegood' is amused to note just how many school residents (including teachers) are bats-in-the-bellfry-insane. Luna saves Harry from the Dursleys. Dumbledore is displeased and wants to get her dismissed. If only because of the latter, Lucius Malfoy absolutely adores her. Adults are 'dreamily' called out on their BS and student crushes abound. (Draco with a crush on Luna sounds absolutely adorable; just sayin'.)

5. SLYTHERIN LUNA LOVEGOOD: Neutral or dark, I would love to see a Pureblood whom even Voldemort is forever on the fence over whether or not to draw in on his schemes. Cold but absent-minded, crazy or genious, cryptic and vague, her stance on any given topic is never clear. This includes homework, lol. No-one will study with her. Even the Dark Lord himself doesn't really know what to think of her let alone what to make of her. Wherein Luna has average intelligence but likes being underestimated and overestimated by turns and her innermost motives are ever shrouded in mystery.

6. HALF-VEELA LUNA LOVEGOOD: Could be interesting. How many impressionable boys can Luna lure into a broom closet and 'convince' that wrackspurts are real? How different would her Ravenclaw experience be if she could just sneak into the boys dorms to be guarded from her own roommates? If she could seduce dormitory passwords out of any boy and find refuge in just about every hidden nook at Hogwarts? If she could sweet-talk Filch? If she found and chose to 'borrow' The Marauders Map and make her own mischief?

7. 'SOMETHING UNKNOWN' LUNA LOVEGOOD: The wrackspurts are real. The nargles are real. They're all real. Luna knows, because Luna is a changeling... and 'those' are her people.

8. REINCARNATED AS A MERMAID LUNA LOVEGOOD: Luna is very strange in the eyes of her fellow merfolk. She sings to people whom she has never met. She makes compliments of folk who are too far away to be seen let alone heard. She sleeps in the whipping currents and dances in still water. She plays strange fin-tentacle slapping games with a giant squid. And now, as something called "The Ministry" comes to impose their own plans for all of merkind: she swims to the surface, slides herself onto a comfortable rock, and serenely cites their own laws back to them. Old laws. Unchangeable laws. Laws that she could not possibly know of unless she herself had worked with this Ministry. ...And throughout it all, why is that so-called 'Unspeakable' looking so danged twitchy?

9. LUNA x FILIUS: Despite the manner by which her housemates treat her, Luna is perfect for Ravenclaw. Behind glazed eyes lay a keen mind. Beneath fantastical ramblings whips a sharp tongue. Luna is intriguing. Her mind and ideas are intriguing. Filius gains an exceptional interest in one of the most underappreciated members of his house. As a teacher, there is nothing unprofessional about inviting this seventh year NEWTS student to some extra one-on-one tutoring sessions. However, as one born half-goblin, there is nothing more untoward than secretly appraising a potential mate. To purposefully probe the depths and boundaries of another being's intelligence and awareness. There is nothing more salacious than hosting a prolonged and private exchanging of ideas with one who is unaware of what level she stands on as a potential partner for courtship. To sound her out and measure her value. To appraise with a cold but calculating eye. Filius knows he can get away with it because humans know little to nothing about Goblin culture. Except Luna intuits his intentions, somehow. And then she learns how to flirt.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
