Is there any current fics where Harry utilizes the Magia Erebea spell from Negima?


** I haven't got the link on hand but in Third Path to the Future he uses something called that a lot. But I don't think it works as it does in Negima, he uses it to shunt a portion of his magical power into enhancing his body and while it's happening his total pool is reduced by a percentage. It's a crossover with marvel (mainly xmen) and it's over a million words atm. For stuff that might matter to you reading it though, it's got magical cores,harry/multi and a pretty OP!Harry too. I personally find it quite a fun read, but I can imagine some of that turning people off.

*** Seconding this recommendation. A caveat, though: at times lately it's felt to me like the author is imposing his or her own libertarian politics on the characters, which has been odd. There's bound to be some author politics on display in a fic with as much world-building as ATP has, though.

**** Oh yeah totally, as much as I've been enjoying the more recent chapters, it's definitely taken a turn in that direction. I don't mind so much cause it feels like it fits this Harry's personality quite well, but it's pretty blatant.

***** Definitely makes sense for the ATP version of Harry. It was a bit jarring to me to hear Storm complaining about the same things, though.
