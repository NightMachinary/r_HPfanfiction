It's purely logical in that it often causes the author to continue and ruin both James AND Lily, but only bash James each time.

The most common line in these stories is that James Cheated, So Lily Cheats and gets pregnant, OK But someone then ask the question "Well then why did she stay With James and lie about Harry"

This leads to "James trapped Lily with a Marriage Contract" which then begs the question, "Is Lily a fucking idiot that she can't read a marriage contract? Why would she sign that?"

Which leads to "James Dosed her with Love Potion! That's why she signed it!" which then makes some readers scream "THEN HOW DID SHE CHEAT ON JAMES?"

Again and again to many people don't logically set up the plot, it's Based in two points and nothing else "I hate James Potter" and "I can't explain how this super powerful Wizard would ever join a Superhero Team or Move to a new Town/Have new Friends/go to a New School"

Like Harry doesn't need to be Loki's son like he is in 50 other stories or Superman's Brother or Kenpachi's Son or Vegeta' s Kid for him to WANT to help save the world, nor does he need to be related to have the ability to help.

Honestly use fans of either series or both series for ideas, because if 70% of your story idea is "Oh my God Imma cuck James Potter with this story so bad" don't want to even read it


** Plenty of them just handle it with "James/Lily was actually [insert character here]", most often Loki.

I know, the name 'Hadrian' is usually scorned by the kind of story it used to be, and generally I would agree, but this has nothing to do with it, give it a try. It's the best Harry-Percy xover I've ever read. There's a sequence in progress, I don't know if it was abandoned or not.

*** There was one I liked where Harry was actually Tony Stark's son and James was sterile.

It was set up where they saw Tony at a conference, and he looked a lot like James. It was timeline shifted, so it fit more with the Avengers movies, so artificial insemination was a thing. So she talked to him, and Tony agreed after some discussion.

There's a funny quote where Tony says something, "I kind of wanted to do it the natural way, but she said no, so into the cup it went."

I like these more than the cheating ones. I find most of the cheating ones tend to be done by people who really really like Snape.

** Unfortunately James suffers from a few things. One is that, as Harry's father, he needs to be fallible. Not only is it just boring if Harry's dad really was this noble, perfect guy, but part of growing up is realising the flaws and weaknesses of your parents/people you look up to. Harry as a character places James as a pedestal, and has to go through that process of realising his dad had flaws and was a real human being and not just the war hero who sacrificed himself for his family. He needs to realise this to grow himself - but readers might not grasp this, and immediately jump to - 'Well, James was a bit of a dick wasn't he?' - rather than understand that Harry is coming to see and know his father (or at least, his perception of him) as an adult does rather than a child. It's hard enough to go through this process when your parents are alive, never mind when they're dead (although Harry goes through this again with Dumbledore in Book 7 with far more angst).

He also suffers because some people love and identify with Snape, for whatever reason. Either way, it means you get people trying to write these convoluted stories where they try to make someone else Harry's father. It's possible to get it right if you properly explore how it impacts Harry, but you have to do so knowing that you are actually making James more sympathetic and Lily far less so - and the sort of writer who wants to write a 'James wasn't Harry's dad' story isn't typically interested in doing that, so the whole thing will fall apart.

** While a bit different since in your case it's about crossovers, you basically describe my main issue with Severitus fics where he's Harry's father by blood. Personally, I actually like Severitus fics more than I think most people do, especially ones taking place earlier on before they build a rapport of hating each other. However, I was never able to get into the kind where he was Harry's parent by blood, specifically because it causes the backstory to be either disturbing, or just plain nonsensical, for basically the very reasons you state.

I've seen /one/ fic of this kind that actually calls Lily out on her actions -- basically, James did something pretty dumb, but in the grand scheme of things, unimportant and fixable (IIRC he neglected his wife to some extent to be with his friends, perhaps a bit too much), and Lily goes way overboard and basically uses Snape for revenge sex. In the end, James is devastated for his wife cheating on him rather than talking to him about her issues with their relationship, and later on, Snape is devastated for not ever knowing that he had a son. The fic basically portrayed Lily as a manipulative bitch who was playing James and Snape's loathing for each other to her own advantage. It was a novel take, that's for sure. I've not been able to find the fic since.

Then he learns that all along, because Sirius or Remus forgot to give a letter Snape that explained that Snape was the father as James had found out that he wasn't and went on an Auror mission but died.

*** There was one I saw recently where Lily was sterile instead of James, and James' family had a ritual to bypass that.

Said ritual turned out to be oooold Greek stuff, and it summoned Aphrodite. Cue (not written thankfully) threesome, and Aphrodite transferred the baby she got from James into Lily and made it Lily's, so Harry had three parents, kind of like blood adoption.

It was a PJO crossover, yeah.

** Literally I love this trope and how ppl make it work. Sometimes there are no answers because there's none to be given. Unanswered why's are angsty unwanted plots that can be left to the imagination of the reader.

It's the Wizarding world where magic can have some serious consequences. You can play around and toy with it to suit a narrative.

I have read a handful where James was sterile for some reason and Sirius stepped in or someone serious (lol).

Blood magic can also help with adoptions - that's a nice one.

I like to read the one's where Lily is Dark and she knows Harry isn't James but does some stuff that make him James and can convince the goblins or skew the family tree... it's interesting to read how ppl think outside the box.

** In linkao3(Blood Magic by GatewayGirl), it's part of some religious magical thing where men who are expected to die will inseminate a... Godwife? Sorta person so they can still have kids. So James and Lily both consented to this and due to cultural considerations it was seen as fine by everyone involved. Then they put Jamesing magic on him to hide Snape still being friends with Lily.

Note: if you're reading this for the HHr tag skip this one. It's super uncomfortable, and Harry rejects her not too far in after stringing her along for a bit.

** I can see why people use it in crossovers, because it's a convenient way of providing a reason for two different worlds/fandoms to merge. If one of the main character's parents was from another fandom then characters from that fandom would have a reason to interact with them and be involved in their conflicts.

One that I really wish the author continued is linkffn(Try and Try Again) They do an amazing job setting up the circumstances for Harry's conception in a way that Lily is pregnant by someone else without making her or James seem terrible, and nothing non con about it. Honestly all three parties involved come across as really upstanding good people, and that wasn't an easy accomplishment.

** Most of the ones where Loki is Harry's parent, it's because Loki actually was either James or Lily. But wasn't aware they were also Loki until well after it would have mattered.

Also in some of the Kryptonian Harry stories James blood adopts Harry to cover up the fact that their son was stillborn and doesn't tell Lily.

Then there's the popular option of them not being together at the time, but him getting back together with her after she's pregnant. And being fully aware of it.
