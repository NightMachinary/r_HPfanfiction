Yeah I am looking for fics where he doesnt go to hogwarts but returns during or after fourth year. Preferably during. NO slash, genderbending or Harry/Hermione I have already read all of Brennus' stories and HP and the Sun Source, Wand Knife and Silence, and Deprived.


** "Blindness" and "Emperor", linkffn(5904185;10937871), are my two favorite 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' fics.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] is another one, but not as good as the above two fics.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I've written a story where Harry was raised in France, where Dumbledore and the Order went into exile after Lucius Malfoy took over Britain in 1981. The story starts after Hogwarts, though.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Hah, I just recced this in another thread about 8 seconds ago. Ah well, it fits for you too! In linkffn(muggle-raised champion) Harry does not attend Hogwarts due to the Dursleys trying extra hard to make him normal. But the Triwizard tournament changes things!

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
