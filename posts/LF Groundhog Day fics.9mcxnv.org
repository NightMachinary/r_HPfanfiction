Looking for any and all time looking fics. Whether it's a day or a year, no matter the main characters, if time loops more than just once, I wanna see it.

I remember enjoying it a lot. One of the best groundhog day stories I came across when I was searching a couple years ago.

  This story was written as a gift for Olivie Blake, in the grand tradition of giving her murder for her birthday, and since I know that she enjoys the particular flavour of Harmony. It was partly inspired by Groundhog Day, but with the darker twist of Edge of Tomorrow. EWE.

**** The author has talked on his patreon about originally wanting to have the story done by around the end of the year, and needing to pick up the pace if he wants to meet that deadline. There's been more chapter delays since he originally said that so it probably won't be done by then, but a lot of story points are wrapping up or meeting their climax, the end is defiantly in sight. Normal schedule is a new chapter every three weeks, but it can get pushed to once a month if there's a delay that chapter.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.
