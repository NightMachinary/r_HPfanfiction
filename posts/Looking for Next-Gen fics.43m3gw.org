As the title says, i'm looking for next gen fics. Prefered are any Ao3 fics, or links thereof, (Easier for me to load the entire fic and read all at once on a bus ride, while FF requires internet or tons of tabs) but i know that some majority of HP fics are on Fanfiction, so either is fine!

I have no character preferences, or anything else.


** Hogwarts Houses Divided is indeed the best of the lot. There are a bunch of other good ones:

linkffn(Clash by Shezwriter) is a dark next gen fic with some unconventional characterizations. Lots of plot twists.

linkffn(Etc Etc and Life Goes On) is a great read if you like satires. My most unexpectedly favorite fic.

linkffn(Whispers of the Dead Lords) was supposed to be a seven year fic similar to the main books. It was updated almost daily before the author disappeared into thin air one fine day.

linkffn(Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot) is hilarious crack.

linkffn(The Goblet's revenge) is a fic where Albus has to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament in his first year.

linkffn(Questions and Answers) follows mostly Albus through his school years, but has story arcs for all the main characters.

linkffn(A Strictly Legal Matter) is a Draco/Rose oneshot with a twist.

linkffn(James and Me by Northumbrian) is pretty cool, though you have to read the author's Strangers at Drakeshaugh first for context.

*** Hey! /etc/ is my fic! Never thought I'd see it mentioned here by anyone except, well, me. 'Most unexpectedly favorite fic' makes me so glad because that's also how I feel in writing it. :D

+1 to /Clash/, too.

**** Yeah. I generally dislike school dramas, so a satire of the genre caught my eye immediately. It has an unexpected charm, and Clemence was awesome throughout. Just couldn't put it down until I had read the whole thing.

Still waiting for that epilogue though. Hope you haven't forgotten about it.

***** One more chapter and epilogue, actually. I've been veeery slow with the last two updates (and very active in my apologizing for that--by the way, sorry for the slow update), but I'm perpetually working on it. I try not to curse it by putting estimates, but I hashed out the most difficult remaining part, so I'm optimistic for posting something soon :) It's been five years since I started it and it's become a different beast as I matured and the story narrowed in on the characters, and I really can't wait to post the remaining stuff. Thank you for the kind words!

  Draco Malfoy is employing Rose Weasley to do some legal legwork for him. Their meetings are strictly business, but Draco wants more. Does Rose? For the "I never" challnge at the Sober Universe Forum, and very unlike my usual work. Rated M for a reason.

** linkffn(4380964) Albus Potter centric fic (first in a series). The characters are among the best I've ever read in next gen FF. They all seem believable as a combination of their parents' characters but still wholly their own people (and not so amazingly perfect that you want to barf).

** Honestly, look up George Norman Lippert. He has written a legitimate sequel series (4 novel length books) that revolve around Jame's adventures. I think they're the best quality books.

Also, look up linkffn(little0bird), she's probably the leader of next gen, Canon compatible fics.
