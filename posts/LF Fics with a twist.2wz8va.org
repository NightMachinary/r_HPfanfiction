Pretty much what the title says. Mind you, I'm not looking for stories that surprise you with a wtf ending that comes out of nowhere. I'm looking for those well crafted ones that leave crumbs for you and when the big reveal happens, you go back and read it and slap yourself on the forehead, thinking how you could have missed it.

Obviously, don't spoil the twist though.


** Nonjon is pretty good about that in Browncoat Green Eyes, A Black Comedy, and the Where in the World series

*** Not sure I'd call any of those twist endings. In most cases, the reader knows everything, and it's just the characters who are surprised. Either that, or I'm just good at picking up clues. I've never read a fic where the ending really surprised me, and I had to go back and reread it to see all of the clues. Come to think of it, I've only ever read 1 or 2 novels that surprised me that way.

*** I've read Browncoat Green Eyes. I think it's a great fic. Whilst I'm not sure it has a twist in it, thank you for the suggestion nonetheless!

**** I thought the [[/spoiler][miranda]] bit was pretty twisty.

** I've never heard/read the abbreviation LF in the fanfic community in my life, and I've been reading fanfic since 2004 or so. Is it just me? Maybe you'd have better luck getting recs if you clarified that term? :-)

*** It's short for 'Looking for'. It took a few times seeing it used here before it clicked for me as well.

**** Oh, right! I was so confused. Luna/Fred? Looping Fic? Haha. Thanks for the clarification!

** It's been a while since I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]], but I think there's a decent chance that it's the sort of thing you're looking for. I don't remember how obvious-in-retrospect the twist seemed, but it definitely wasn't out of nowhere; it fits the "leaves crumbs leading up to the reveal" pattern perfectly.

** I'm not sure how foreseeable a "twist" the endings are, but these two early (short) one-shots of Perspicacity may qualify:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/1/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Adventures in Child Care]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4042440/1/Ministerial-Kneepads][Ministerial Knee Pads]]

These look like they may have been his first fanfiction stories, so warts and stuff.
