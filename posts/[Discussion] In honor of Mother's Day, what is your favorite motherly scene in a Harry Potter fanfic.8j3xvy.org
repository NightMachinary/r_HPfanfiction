*** That's such a great gesture, because it reads both Ron and Harry perfectly.

You would assume that /Ron/, as the last Weasley boy to need a watch on his seventeenth birthday, would be the one to get his uncle Fabian's watch. But he's not. Ron very rarely gets new things that have only ever belonged to him, so giving him something new is the loving gesture.

Harry, on the other hand...what Harry lacks is family. So when he's given the family heirloom, that's really meaningful.

***** It's not a fic. It's canon. Molly gives Harry her brother's watch in DH.

** there are a couple fics where Narcissa plots the demise/marries off girls whom she deems aren't good enough for Draco.

There are so many things wrong with that but I feel this vicarious, vindictive satisfaction when that happens so I'll be toasting one to the Lady Malfoy...

*** I've never read anything like that but the idea of Narcissa finding something wrong with every single girl that Draco brings home to the point where Draco is the only wizard in all of Britain that isn't married makes me giggle.

*** That's perfectly understandable.

However, whether you do or do not celebrate the day has approximately *nothing* to do with the topic at hand.

I think they just wanted your favourite moments of mothers day that you read about in fanfiction, not your own view on it, but it's all good. just wanted to explain since people just downvoted you and didn't say why
