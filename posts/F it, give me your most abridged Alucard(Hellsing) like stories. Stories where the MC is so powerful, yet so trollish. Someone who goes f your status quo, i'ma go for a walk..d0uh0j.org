  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child.

And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Best Served Cold by sakurademonalchemist

Harry is an auditor. Also features Alucard and is kind of cracky. The author has a number of good fics as well.
