This is... horrifying. Truly terrible. And not in the sense that it's bad.

It's well written but extremely fucked up.

** linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) linkao3(Antithesis by OceanBreeze7)

Both of these were fantastic and I adored them. I wouldn't say 'mentally disturbing' but they certainly container heavy af themes that were difficult to get through.

After both I had to read a hell of a lot of fluffy Wolfstar romance to try feel less sad again...
