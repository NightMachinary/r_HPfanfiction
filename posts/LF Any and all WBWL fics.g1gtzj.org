I have but a few requirements: No fem!Harry and no dark!Harry /glares at people recommending antithesis left and right because that shit looks depressing/

Of course it'd be nice to see slytherin!smart!abused!harry but anything goes. I also like long fics (:

Slash and bashing is fine and I don't really care who the WBWL is. It doesn't even need to be Harry's sibling/twin; it could be Neville!

Also no PoS bc I've already read it lmao

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** *Blood Stained* - linkffn(11483808)\\
Marvel/HP crossover. He wasn't abused. But "forgotten" (the quotes denotes plot). He's "slytherin". He's more of a mercenary/hitman in this fic.

*Hadrian Black*: *The Other Twin* - linkffn(12352179)\\
Eh, it's a harem. Anywho, James/Lily dumps Harry on Grandma, the head of the Black family. "Harry" wasn't pureblood enough, thus the Hadrian. IIRC the twins aren't antagonistic of each other. Harry is more against the birth family/marauders. And he's Slytherin.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

  Nearly born at the same time, twins but still different. Daniel is declared the boy who lived. So what's a good brother to do? Create his own legend... and protect his brother. Careful World, here comes the Black. Contains Harem, some Femslash and Powerful/OP Harry.

** Saving Connor is a huge one in this circle. I'll admit I never made it through the first book a while ago but haven't returned to finish the others in the series. But what I did read I liked! In this one, Harry is trained to protect his brother at all costs & you really see him struggling with devotion to his brother & his search for himself. Plus this one has what I thought was really good characterization of a lot of adults & also kids. The writer really knows how to work with a full ensemble of characters, which is rare.

** There's a short story that I liked called The Boy Who Wasn't by Bobmin. The story has both Neville and Harry in the crib together that Halloween night and both Lily and Alice die. Dumbledore decides that surely Voldemort would've chosen the Pureblood versus the Halfblood and makes Neville the BWL.
