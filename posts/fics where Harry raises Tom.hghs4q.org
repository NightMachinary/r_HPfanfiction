As the title says, I'm looking for fics where, through time-travel and for whatever reason, Harry ends up raising Tom Riddle. Preferably in the sense of ‘giving him a loving home might make him not-evil.' I've never read any before, and found myself wondering about them. No Dark!Harry, please, and preferably nothing with significant romance. Thank you!

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  Harry, after being saved by a mysterious stranger, is flung fifty years into the past, where he resolves to save the future by killing a 10-year-old Tom Riddle. He ends up raising him, instead. But when young Tom develops an unhealthy fixation on his new guardian, things quickly spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself entangled in a deadly game. Will history repeat itself?

** linkffn(professor tufts; altered destinies)

The first one is faster paced though still very interesting where he goes back to his past self and raises Tom. The second one he goes back in time with the intent to kill him as the war went much worse than in canon, but ends up raising him instead.

  Harry goes back in time due to a quirk of being the owner of the invisibility cloak (reincarnation deal). Time-travel, professor Harry with new (OC) identity, child Tom Riddle. No bashing involved. HP and canon belong to JK Rowling. Complete. This is less of a show and more of a tell story i.e. Dialogue gets really scarce at about ch. 13 and lots of time jumps.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** Well this is my favorite of the genre, and even if you're averse to fem!harry this fic would trump that. The worldbuilding is amazing and the interactions between Harry and Tom can only be described as sweet, albeit sometimes bittersweet.

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
