Possibly related to the partly-fanon idea of purebloods (and particularly purebloodists) being this refined aristocracy who wear velvet and silk and such.

Plus, I don't recall the books giving us a detailed account of the full moons during seventh year, so for all we know the full moon could have been that same night. Again, unlikely, but not impossible.

  A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you're related to blood traitors even if you're not a Mudblood. *And lastly, your pretty little friend . . .” The relish in his voice made Harry's flesh crawl.* “Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others. “Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if she's a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?” “Penelope Clearwater,” said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.

** Death Eaters raping is not now, nor has it ever been canon. Not saying it can't ever have happened, but there is no official HP material that ever depicts Death Eaters raping anyone. This might be because HP is when all is said and done a kids' series... but it does mean that rapist Death Eaters are complete fanon.

If I'm to speculate... Voldemort to me always seemed asexual. Cursed Child aside (and my headcanon there is still that Delphi was delusional and not actually related to him at all) I can't see him being interested in sex, much less forcing it on other people. He'd probably turn a blind eye to his followers doing a bit of rape as long as they did it where he didn't have to watch or know about it, but I don't think that Death Eater raids were the huge rape-fests that some fans like to depict them as.

Now, I DO get some very rapey vibes from Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback, Greyback especially, so my initial take on it: Probably rape happened on occasion, but not "officially." It was more an "oh, if you must" kind of deal.

There IS one confirmed instance of rape in HP canon, but it's never actually called rape and it wasn't the "evil man grabs a helpless woman and force-fuck her" kind of rape. Still, looking at it from a legal and moral perspective, Merope Gaunt raped Tom Riddle Senior.

We know that she used magic to force him to be with her. Dumbledore theorizes she used a love potion, but says it was possible she used a spell of some sort. Doesn't really matter what she used, though; she did use magic to have her way with him. That's rape, for the same reason it's rape to get someone drunk or drug them in order to fuck them. Merope probably didn't think of it as rape; she thought it was romantic. Merope was a pretty messed-up person.

Still, the fact is clear: Voldemort is ultimately a product of rape.

(And I think I've used the word "rape" a more times in this post than I have elsewhere for several months.)

***** Savage.

Rape is part of war, real war with open conflict at least. Always happens. Considering wizards and witches are still human it should still happen.

The 'good' side (Or the winners, whatever your interpretation) of war rape also. For example, Russians raping German women, Americans raping German women, and so on. (That's all I can remember from the top of my head but probably every country involved in the war had it happen. Just making it clear I'm not deriding Russians or Americans, and so on. I think they tried giving Sex dolls at one point to the soldiers to stop the amount of rape that happened in WW2)
