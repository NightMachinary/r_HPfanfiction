** Some things are exaggerated in fanfiction.

For me it's the fact the narrative never holds her at fault.

Or that she's quite often a hypocrite.

Or if fanfiction authors try to convince you that she's perfect and the next Dumbledore.

**** My second and third point hold true though.

She attacked Ron and confunded McLaggen and we're supposed to be sympathetic because she ended with a sob and McLaggen was a jerk.

***** Hermione is always right. She can blackmail Rita and hex Ron and McLaggen. But Rita and McLaggen are nasty and Ron upset her so you know...it's all fine. Rowling did say it was easier to write women. And this is why- the main one is always right, no consequences for her.

** She answers in Potions class to annoy Snape. Annoying Snape is worth losing some points for Gryffindor.

*** Sounds like Hermione deliberately annoying the authority figure to me.

Oh, wait.

  "Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf---"

  "That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger," said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all."

  Hermione went very red, put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears.

  "But if---if there was a mistake---"

  "KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. "DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointing at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.

  Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, "Very well---Miss Granger?"

  "Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform," said Hermione, "which gives you a split-second advantage."

  "An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 6," said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered).

  Harry's Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked round and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes," said Harry stiffly.

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.
