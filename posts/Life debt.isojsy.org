Why does everyone make Harry always so benevolent so perfect with life debts? The girl always falls in love after he does some heroic act and doesn't cash in on the life debt. Make him do something useful with it. Teach him some form of magic he doesn't know, gain political power. Canon Harry is nice, sure, but he wouldn't cancel a life debt. Why is that all the authors do that?

I'm not sure about that, but it depends on who is indebted to him and what a life debt means.

In canon, life debts aren't explained very well. It seems to basically be "I saved your life, so you have to save mine sometime." In that case, Harry would have no reason to ever cancel one, but it also wouldn't be likely to have much of an effect either. Of course, in fanfics, life debts usually have to be repaid some other way, usually involving some great service or betrothal or money.

If it's an enemy who owes Harry a life debt, like Wormtail in canon, he'd definitely milk it for all it's worth. If it was a friend, he'd probably just ignore it or cash it in with something that they wouldn't be opposed to anyway. Like cashing in a debt from Ginny to get the Weasleys to invite him over for the summer or something. If it was someone he was neutral towards, he'd probably either handle it the same way he would a friend, or in the later books, maybe make them swear to fight against Voldemort or something.

In any case, canon Harry is not the type to use a life debt for personal gain. He'd use one to fight Voldemort or right an injustice or help someone else, but I can't see him using one to have sex with someone, as many of these stories go, even as a horny teenager. And he never showed any interest in or care for political power, so that's out. And using it to learn more magic is more of a Hermione thing.

*** I could see Harry using the life debt with Ginny to force the Weasley's to accept some money.

** A canon "Life Debt" is just the aknowledgment that someone saved your life, and a matter of personal pride, while fanon "Life Debt" is a form of enslavement by "Magic itself".

So, it's fine for canon Harry to not cancel any Life Debt because it's not like there is some kind of contract he can tear up, and it's not like the life debt gives him any power over the person he saved, but in fanon, it's pretty hard to present a "benevolent" MC when he keeps slaves.

That being said, I remember reading some fic that used the Life Debts (usually the same type of fic that use "I swear on my Magic" and "So mote it") to do something, so it's up to any author to use it or not.

** Because he doesn't seem to ever do anything with the one he got. Pettigrew's life debt 'cashed in' itself and he, despite knowing about it, never yelled out a demand for anything during any of the events with Pettigrew around.

That would be my guess, anyway.

*** But he can still be a good guy and cash in. Hell, in dark and evil stories of Harry, he doesn't cash in on a life debt and the girls swap side and join his side and love him. Like it makes no sense and not how humans behave.

** What makes it more funny, even in Fanon the Life Debt can only be created by a non-negligible, selfless act. Commonly brought up conditions are:\\
#1: You must save someone's life.\\
#2: You must put yourself at risk to do so.\\
#3: You can't be expecting a reward of any kind while doing so.

Condition #3 usually precludes any Dark or Selfish Harry's from participating, and the good versions are usually either unaware of the debt, unwilling to call it in, or lacking one desire that the debtor could grant to discharge it. Thus, I agree that asking for repayment is not a bad thing, it can be very good, in fact.

That said, since creating the thing requires a rich diet of moral fiber, it follows that outside a 'crime of passion', calling it in would not be anything too strenous or morally objectionable. That said, people overestimate the effect from one Dumbledore quote, following the Pettigrew's escape, about increasingly potent, though subtle effect making the debtor assist their saviour in an attempt to discharge the debt, even if it's never acknowledged. It's basically a low-level brainwashing, starting with being more forgiving of character flaws and minor favours that the person can easily justify to themselves.
