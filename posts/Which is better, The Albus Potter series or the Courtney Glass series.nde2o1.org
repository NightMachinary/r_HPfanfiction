** I've never heard of either of them. Would you mind linking them? Thanks. I want to read both.

**** That series is pretty good. It's not as crazy as NoahPhantom's but it's a solid canon continuation with the same feeling and depth as the canon series. I really liked the characters and thought it was quite well paced.

I haven't read the Courtney Glass series but it doesn't seem to be a fair comparison, that series seems quite short and to the point whereas Vekin87's series is a million words long and pretty in depth. If you're trying to decide which to read why not try both?
