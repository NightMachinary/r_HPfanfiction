** It's a classic, old and abandoned fic, but Knowledge is Power by Fettucini (and reposted by Defenestratable) fills the bill linkffn(5142565)

  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

**** I haven't read this fic in a while, but I don't think Harry is a nobody in it. I think he's an international superstar by his second year at hogwarts. The fic got abandoned a few chapters after Fleur is introduced as well.

***** There are two or three very similar stories (Lupin as adoptive father, Harry more serious, Fleur romance) and none are finished.
