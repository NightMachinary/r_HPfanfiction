So, a few months ago I got back into playing Eve Online and this inevitably led me to reading a load of lore. Five minutes later, and I am searching for Eve Online fanfiction. I found a couple that had some very decent potential but which have been abandoned for years and one crossover with the HP universe which I didn't even bother looking at after reading the description.

This of course got me thinking, could you make a decent Eve online/ Harry potter crossover? I wish I could say that I was going to go out and write one but I just don't have the time or the skill. I already have two stories which I keep meaning to work on and which haven't been touched for months. Therefore, I ask anyone who likes Eve Online or just spaceship type fics: how could this idea work?

I think that this has potential even if you don't play EVE online, just because of the interesting lore, etc.

I think that there is potential here. Below are a few of my possible ideas: 1) Capsules are immortal so long as they have access to a clone, right? Well, what if the older families on 'Earth' were really settlers from New Eden who went through a wormhole, got stuck, and colonised a new Earth? Time goes by, something happens, technology lost, bla bla bla. The Potters are descended from one of these families, Voldemort could be too, perhaps other important characters or even minor ones as well.

2) These descendants may or may not know about their family histories.

3) Lily and James could still be alive. They might have been capsuleers either from among the first colonists or having become immortal later on. They might be somewhere on earth with harry. They could be trapped in clones in New Eden trying to find a way back to their son (or as immortal capsuleers, they might not care about Harry and he might be a little annoyed about this - queue galactic conquest and genocide). Or perhaps they are trapped in orbit or something, for some reason unable to return to earth, possibly trapped and asleep in their clone pods.

4) Would Voldemort be a capsuleer and hence immortal? Would the struggle revolve around trying to eliminate all of his clone bays? Maybe he stole the technology or payed a passing pilot to turn him into one. Or something else entirely.

5) Would Harry be a capsuleer from the start? Would he become one? Does he have magical powers or just things from New Eden? Are there problems caused by the mixing of capsuleer technology and magic? Would his friends/the wizarding world/ even the entire earth stand with him? Or turn against him? Or know nothing about him?

6) Would Harry have access to Eve technology? Some of it, part of it, all of it, damaged/incomplete tech?

7) Could the entire thing simply happen in the future, in a wizarding world spread out across the entire galaxy?

8) Etc.

I am interested in what people think and what ideas you might have. I would love it if someone decided to actually write a story like this and would love to help with it. I might end up sticking a short starting chapter up of FFN just to act as a prompt if I have time and the inclination.


** Im not sure how this would turn out, but I would definitely read it. Unfortunately I have no writing skills to speak of so I'm not going to butcher it. Hopefully someone sees this post that has the talents to write this properly.

** I've mulling making a Startrek/HP crossover where the events of the books happen but the muggle world is the startrek world, or something like that. i wonder if something like that could be interesting.

I like the idea of James and Lily being capsulers maybe something went wrong with a stargate and they got stranded on this planet 'earth' and decided to live 'pacefull lives'. or maybe they where enemies but got stranded on 'earth' and eventually fell in love but because james was from GoonSwarm and lily from PL they decided to stay stranded. after they die they try to get back to earth to get Harry.

*** No capsuleer would just 'give up' and live a peaceful life. Every piece of lore supports capsuleers as basically being asshole gods (even more so if they're from either goons or PL), they're not gonna sit tight, or, heaven forbid, go dirtside willingly. They'd probably both be trying to kill each other (possibly repeatedly) while trying to take over the planet (populated by mortal men and women that they view as so far beneath them they didn't even realise their ships had crews) in a second industrial revolution while leaving nasty in-jokes in the classified sections of newspapers only the other would understand (the equivalent of taunting each other on reddit after losing twenty rorqs).

**** While I agree that they would never live truly peaceful lives, when you are immortal, why not take a few decades out to start a family? I agree that they would probably bendoing lots of nefarious things behind the scenes though.

So... Is now a bad time to mention that I am a Goon...?

**** there are about more than 40000 capsulers I'm sure there are all kinds of people in that group. I mean when the majority of them are content with living in hisec mining, or runing L4 Missions you can't say that some capsulers yearn for a paceful secure life without the fear of being ganked by marmite or something.

***** Those capsuleers content with running hisec missions all days are slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people without it bothering them in the slightest. NPC ships have big crews, even player ships still have reduced crews. Most capsuleers are so detached from reality that they don't even know their own ship has crew on it.

** The capsuleer immortality relies on lots and lots of infrastructure that any single dirtside world won't have if it's been buried for tens of thousands of years. Don't forget, tritanium, the main mineral used to build anything in New Eden, deteriorates in atmosphere so any crashing spaceships would rust and degrade very quickly.

Secondly, for capsuleers to be immortal outside of their pods, they require implants in the base of their skull to take a snapshot of their brain at the exact moment of their death. This technology is finicky and not as effective or reliable as the pod-based version, which is why it was only really used on cheap shock troops in Dust 514. No capsuleer would be caught dead outside of their pods (quite literally, also Walking In Stations is bullcrap lore-wise). Also, this implant would have to be re-embedded in each new clone, so where would these new implants or clones come from? Their tech, even if it could survive an atmosphere, wouldn't still work after ten thousand years. Nothing in the lore supports capsuleer tech (or any tech) lasting that long as capsuleers are a relatively new invention in New Eden. Even old ships have to be contrinually retrofitted to stay viable: one of the older ships, the Amarr Iapetan Titan used as a flagship by the Emperor(-ess, think the last one was murdered by drifters a few years ago) is continually upgraded with the newest advancements, but it is a flagship and symbol of Amarrian might so it has to stay top-of-the-line.

As for Harry using New Eden tech, if he uses known, canon stuff he has a Maelstrom class battleship sitting in orbit which oneshots Voldemort (along with the rest of whatever city he's in). Any tech smaller than a corvette (and the weapons fit to it, the smallest of which need a boat to cart around - at least) you'd have to make up, so you might as well make up your own scifi universe if that's all you're getting out of the crossover. There's also no canon support that warp drives, shields, weapons systems work on anything smaller than a drone or fighter, or that they'd even work in atmosphere, so you're back to handwaving everything into existence from scratch.

The only way I could see an Eve Online/HP crossover working is if Harry or some other char were transported to the Eve Online universe, given a healthy dose of culture shock and then sent back, perhaps, with a bunch of +5s or High Grade pirate implants in his head to boost his mental faculties (like the WH40K crossover Inquisitor Carrow). The 'asshole god' mentality of capsuleers would rankle really strongly with all non-capsuleers and would be the most interesting point of the crossover. However, the sheer amount of force and the scopes of each fictional universe are too far apart for any direct conflict. Eve players start in spaceships the size of bungalows and can fly things as long as 18 kilometres. No /Protego/ will save Voldemort (or any antagonist) if a passing titan Doomsday's a hole in the Earth's crust from orbit. Bonus points if it's a Ragnarok using the Gjallarhorn Doomsday, as that many missiles will simply go a good way to causing a complete extinction event on whatever side of the planet it's facing. Meanwhile, the most you could probably /Bombarda/ a hole in would be a shitty EWAR light drone as those are made of spit and duct tape and die to light sneezes, and you would probably have to be standing next to it as wizards have generally not been shown to have Earth-to-orbit firing capabilities.

*** Some interesting points here. 1) Perhaps, but wo is to say that they wouldn't have some sort of infrastructure on earth if they which had been maintained? Also, some artistic license can be used here I think, as with all crossovers. As for tritanium, perhaps. However, might it not be turned into a non-degrading alloy during thr production process?

2) Again, I think that some slight bending of lore is required here on the immortality front. Though, they depending on the backstory that was set up, they moght have no choice but to risk their lives a bit in order to win and become truly immortal again. Also, they might not have been there for 10,000 years. I did leave the options open and each writer must use their own imagination. Also, what about unoccupied wormhole infrastructure? How is their immortality safe when flying in a wormhole with nothing to transfer them to a new clone if they die? As to refitting, I know nothing about that bit.

3) obviously if this was set in the basic Harry Potter universe, it could not just be: Harry warps to 0 n Earth in his Avatar, plays the Goonswarm national anthem, and then proceeds to doomsday the shit out of everything. If however voldemort was a capsuleer and the plot worked around that somehow, perhaps taking place in the future in New Eden and Harry was trying to eliminate voldemort's clones to completely killl him... then maybe you could have that sort of stuff in there.

On the asshole god front. Is that something that all capsuleers are, or is it something that will come with deaths and age? I refer to think that it is the latter and so Harry could, perhaps, become more and more aloof, arrogant, etc, etc, as the story progressed.
