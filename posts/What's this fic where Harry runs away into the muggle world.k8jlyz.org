:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic a long while ago where Harry (fairly sure he was an adult) ran away from the wizarding world and hid in the muggle world (I'm not sure of this but I think it's because something he did in the war broke him and he needed some time alone). I remember he was living with a bunch of muggle University students and that he had to reveal his magic when his roommate got in a scuffle and got stabbed or something. Anyone have any idea which fic this is?
