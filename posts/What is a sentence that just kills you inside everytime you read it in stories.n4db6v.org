That said, there is a literal truth-potion mentioned /in the same book/. If you really /have/ to add the "Harry very publically and irrefutably denies involvement in the Tournament plot"( which I almost guarantee you /don't/), have Harry very publically take said truth-potion, then have him say that he didn't want to be involved in the Tournament, didn't put his name in, and didn't know how his name /did/ get in there.

Ron's envy would prevent him from /saying/ he believes Harry. Hence, it wouldn't matter how he proves his innocence.

From a writing perspective, the scene has been /done to death/ in every form. You Don't Need It. It serves no purpose other than grandstanding, regardless of whether people believe him. If you want to tone down the student body's response, just do so quietly. Remove a few of the instances in which the resentment shows itself.

Snape was all too eager to slip it to him in the chapter where the potion was first mentioned. Just have that scene brought forward, then have Harry respond with "Do it. I have nothing to hide."

**** Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

***** What a random comment.

Protego would probably shield against bullets. Muggles can't disarm wizards, so they are at disadvantage. Wands are way more acessible for wizards than guns are for muggles. Wands are not illegal too. The wizards can just say "Accio gun" and the muggle is done with it.

That's because only Britain has Lord Voldemort. Blood purism is worldwide. I think. Also, the story is from Harry's point of view, and he doesn't give a fuck about other countries.

*** For all the meme'ing we do about "Ginny gives Harry a love potion" here, I haven't actually seen any stories where Ginny is the actual /culprit/ of those - usually in these (almost universally bad) stories it's Dumbledore slipping him the potions on the Weasleys' behalf and Ginny pretty much having the personality/presence of a particularly jealous door-knob.

Still a shitty trope that I never want to read again.

*** I remember a fic where doing that kinda shit was actually making the goblins raise their prices up a lot. Things that were supposed to be free were not, too. The only way to make them "happy" was to insult them and then negociate for several minutes until you managed to lower the prices.

That was a nice twist.
