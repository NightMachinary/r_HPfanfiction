  When Sirius Black escaped Azkaban, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge sent for the Dementors to search for him. Dumbledore and Amelia Bones send for Mr H Delacour, former French Auror and consulting detective. Meeting Harry Potter by chance on the Knight Bus, Delacour, his wife, and his daughters are soon entangled with the story of the Boy Who Lived, and the truth about Sirius...

  Last year, a chance encounter brought together Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour, while her father exonerated Sirius Black. Now, events at Hogwarts will test friendships old and new, as Voldemort conspires to make Harry the Fourth Champion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's a race against time as Harry's allies work to hunt down Voldemort's darkest secrets...but will it be enough?

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.

** My favorite trope is Harry being smart and diligent. Thus, I like fics that start before Harry attends Hogwarts.

Students can change their habits, but most fanfiction seem to rush it. Nobody can convince me that 2-3 years is enough time to become on par with Dumbledore.

That being said, I also like wholesome fics that start on 3rd year. Thirteen is a very interesting age.

** I like 4th/5th year fics a lot, mostly because that's the point at which the world and characters are most interesting- they're beginning to mature and display critical thought, as well as beginning to feel pressure due to Voldemort's return. This pressure makes the story- and alternate versions or directions of the story- really interesting to me. As much as I love a good-ol' "and everyone lived happily ever after" fluff, intense stress provides so much opportunity for characterization - how people and relationships deal with stress or even life-threatening situations tells you a lot about them.

However, I'll also speak out on behalf of "eighth-year" pieces because, frankly, they're fun! They have a sort of college dynamic, often the situation sort of forces previously dived house members together, everyone's a bit more mature (which avoids the often-cringey second-hand embarrassment of the early teens). But, most of all, it provides us with all sorts of interesting interpretations on how Hogwarts functions after the war, what reparations are being made and how? What's going on with new students? What's going on with "eighth year" students? How are the events of past canon being talked about? In my opinion, it's fun to read.

Third because thirteen is old enough to have the ability to think critically and investigate and figure things out, while still being young enough to act with childlike innocence and earnestness.

Sixth is great because it's when most people start to really think about life after school and develop friendships and contacts that will exist into adulthood. It's also a good age for children to have their worlds rocked with new information and new mistakes and have them be old enough to begin to figure out how to deal with that.

If its a Peggy Sue I like 1st, 3rd, 5th or 7th. They each give interesting possibilities and constraints on the Peggy Sue.

If its something that retroactively changes a bunch of canon for an AU I prefer 1st or post 7th. Either going into it all fresh, or covering the changes on their own terms without going into overload covering the massive AU while trying to manage new plot as well.

If its Time Travel I like 5th or 7th if the character will be attending school or 4-12 years post Hogwarts if they'll be in a different role.

If its post canon I prefer either first or second summer after the Battle of Hogwarts if I'm interested in how the characters grow into a world where they no longer need to be child soldiers, or 9-12 years after the battle to explore epilogue alternatives.

** I think each year has something to bring to the table, narrative wise.

I would just be happy to see more stories starting from any of the other years, to really explore all those possibilities. It feel to me like Year 1 variants are tapped out.

** 5th year.

Voldemort has risen, Cedric is dead, Harry's life is forever changed.

There are a ton of directions you can take during OOTP. Dementors get Dudley, Umbridge isn't a professor, Arthur dies, DA is never found out, Prophecy is revealed. It's the prime spot for divergence.
