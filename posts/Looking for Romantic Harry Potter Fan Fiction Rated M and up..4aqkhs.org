** Check out Back to the Garden by Antosha (maybe Anatosha). It's H/G/L nc-17. Its not on FFN. I'd link it but the airplane I'm in is going to take off in about 30 seconds.

** I'm only halfway through this one so far but it seems up your alley plus really good story regardless (the M stuff doesnt happen til around where I'm at)

linkffn(Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak)

Also enjoyed: linkffn(Unlike A Sister by MADharmony)---no outright smut yet but earns its M-rating and is one of the best H/Hr stories out there although unfinished

Other suggestions I would have are mostly Portkey-related:

Forever Knight: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/5185]]

My Confusing (And Hard to Believe) Love Life: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8562]]

In Too Deep: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8366]]

Probably can rattle off a bunch more but let me know if some of these are up your alley

**** Can't say I blame you about portkey lol...but def highly recommend Time is the Fire (just finished it and it was perfect, only a couple smutty scenes but just a great story).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] fits and it's actually really good. That's the only one I can think of, though.

What would you recommend that fits your specifications?

Searching for the Power by GinnyMyLove [aka [[/u/JustRuss][u/JustRuss]]]

** Linkffn(Isolation)

Hermione/Draco pairing. AU Deathly hallows where harry and Ron leave Hermione to search for horocruxs. Hermione is at hogwarts and is forced to look after malfoy. Reading it now and it's pretty mature

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

** I enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents). It's a pretty... unique fanfic despite its generic name. Humor, a bit of crack, some obligatory bashing (author dislikes the Weasleys and Dumbledore I think), and iirc some actually fluffy/heartwarming Harry/Hermione moments. But hey, you said you were open for anything!
