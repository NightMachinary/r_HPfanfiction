Not the Gilderoy fics. The SI becomes the divination teacher and actually researches and teaches working divination spells. Not sure where I read it.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another!
