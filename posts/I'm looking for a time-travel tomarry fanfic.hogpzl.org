:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking for a tomarry fanfic for a long time now that I used to like a lot. In the final battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort and Harry's spells crashed and they were send back to the past, when Tom was a student. Tom says Harry is his brother so nobody suspects them. In the present time at Hogwarts, after the battle, their bodies are like in a magic coma and the professors move them to the infermary. People who was alive in Tom's time start gaining memories of Harry in that time. I don't remember much else but I remember Abraxas Malfoy being one of the protagonist and in the end meeting again Harry in the present time. I could swear it was also an mpreg, but I'm not really sure. I hope somebody can help me find it.

[EDITED] 26/07: Hi! I've found the fanfic! But there's a problem: it's in Spanish. My first language is Spanish, but I'm used to read fanfiction in English and instantly thought this story would be in English, so I'm sorry to all the people interested in this fanfiction who won't be able to read it.

Here's the link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7643947/1/Changing-to-be-happy]]

And thanks for the help!
