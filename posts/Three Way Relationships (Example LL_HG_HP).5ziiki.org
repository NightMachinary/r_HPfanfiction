  In another world, Hermione Granger never attended Hogwarts. Orphaned at age three, she grew up supporting her low-income adoptive family who hadn't the means to pay for her education. Desperation and a chance encounter lead her into the employ of the three Black sisters. She finds herself caught in their deadly web, helplessly waiting to see who will reach her first.

He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

  Ten years have passed since Hermione's priceless private lessons with Professor Snape. Post-Hogwarts life hadn't been kind to her and when social obligations bring her back to the school, Hermione hopes for her erotic adventures with Snape to continue. This time, however, he won't be the only former Death Eater to broaden her horizon...^^ Follow Hermione on her bumpy path of sexual self-discovery and psychological enlightment, revealing Snape's and Lucius' colourful past in the process. WARNING! This is a VERY DARK FIC which includes some quite disturbing scenes (which are necessary for the story development and are not written for pleasure or glorification), so if you're easily disturbed DON'T READ ANY FURTHER!!! You've been warned, proceed at your own peril. ;) Trolling will not be tolerated.
