I am looking for a one shot, maybe part of a larger collection of one shots.

Ron returns to the tent and they are 1 sleeping bag short.

Hermione holds her bag open for Harry to get in and Ron gets very angry. Ron glares at harry but is too scared to say anything due to the look on his face

I know its not a lot to go on, but someone may stumble on it during their reading.
