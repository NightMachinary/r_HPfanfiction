Hello all. I'm currently looking for a beta for my next gen, oc centered fic, The Serpent Master. Just a bit of background on it. I first started writing it about two days after DH was released. I wrote the first book in the series (The Serpent Master) and was half-way through the second story (The Golden Wand), when I sort of gave up on it. Earlier this year I started planning the story out a bit more and started writing it again. I'm currently seven chapters in. But... I'm not getting much response from this, mostly because I don't have a Beta reader at all. I mean I look over each chapter before I post it... but I probably don't catch anything a fresh eye would.

Anyway if you're interested in helping a guy out drop me a message. You can read the first seven chapters [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11811142/1/The-Serpent-Master][here]].

And just as a point, I do have all seven stories planned out.

Cheers!


** This is completely OC, I assume?

Because if it is, I can tell you why the response isn't that much.

*** Partially oc. Lots of ocs but a heavy canon presence as well.

**** I'm guessing the main problem is the first chapters. They are completely OC and that is a huge problem if - and I have to stress this, *IF* your main goal is to attract readers.

If you write for your own amusement, don't mind me, but if you write in order to gather audience, making chapter 1 completely OC is the first step to failure.

Overall first chapter is where you loose ~50% of your readers, no matter what. The next chapters you loose another ~20%.

OC fics loose way more than that since they lack the advantage of having character we are already invested in and only a small amount of readers come to FFN to start with new characters.

***** Nice idea. I'm trying to think of a Canon I can add into the first chapter that makes sense. Either way I still need a Beta.
