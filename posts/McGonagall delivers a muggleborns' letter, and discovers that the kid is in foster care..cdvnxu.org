Bio parents. Foster parents. Case managers. Guardian Ad Litums. Judges. Appointments with pediatricians and therapists booked into next year. This kid isn't going anywhere without a whole plethora of muggles knowing about it ... or is he?


** . . . So what do you prefer :

- Liberal use of the Confundus Charm so everyone think the kid is in some boarding school and everything is fine (basically what Dumbledore did with Riddle, except with more people to bother with because the system changed)
- A quick memory charm so everybody think the kid is dead, or just forget he existed all together. At the same time, put the kid into a magical foster system if it exist.

*** In theory, memory charms would be easier in the short term but would cause much bigger issues if you kept having the same group of people triggered by random events and people.

Could be a funny sort of crack fic where it starts with a memory charm because that's what they've always done in situations like this. Then when it doesn't work they keep having to confundus people. Perhaps then it keeps escalating to the point they have to start imperio-ing people or creating illusions, clones, etc.

*** A quick memory charm wouldn't be all that quick. Whoever is doing the casting should also remember to locate and destroy any and all written record of the kid. In this day and age, computer files will have to be deleted without a trace.

** This is the sort of thing that happens in linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader). Seems to be pretty much abandoned now though.

And yes I know this is a prompt rather than a request, but people are likely to be interested anyway.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

** Wizards dealing with the foster system sounds like Perils of Innocence. linkffn(8429437)

If wizards did have a system with foster kids, it seems like they'd follow the Tom Riddle route. Meet whoever's in charge, then Confund them into accepting their explanation of a transfer to a "special facility". People just weren't that conscious of children's safety back in the 1980's and 1990's, especially with children in group homes or institutional care.

**** The thing about stories set in the muggle world is that they require a lot of OC's to work, and OC's in fanfic are hit or miss.

The ones that fail disappear into the abyss for good, while the rare ones that actually deliver are the ones that fall into the recommendation feedback loop.

****** I think OCs and crazy AUs make it difficult to continue building the story, finish character arcs, and come up with continuously new ideas. Much easier to stick to sandbox with ready made characters that can be tweaked and understood more easily.

** Mentioned in linkffn(3912184), where however the foster mother was a squib, so she knew how to live around the Statue of Secrecy. And of course the similar situation happens in linkffn(8429437), where the muggleborn is an mental institution (a half-way house) and to the biggest surprise of McGonagall, she lives there with two other magical children, one of whom is the Harry Potter.

** I feel like there's a story in little0bird's Questions and Answers universe where this complication is avoided by having someone from the magical world liaise with the muggle foster care/child protection system. They keep an eye out for magical children, and then place them with squib families or families of muggleborns.
