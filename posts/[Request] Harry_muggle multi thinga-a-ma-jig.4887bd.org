I've read 2 fics (can't remember what they're called sorry) where Harry somehow ends up friends with a bunch of the girls around lil surrey (before hogwarts) and ends up fucking a bunch of them before/during his time at hogwarts.

Don't ask why I like this I really really don't know

Edit: looking for new fics thanks to [[/u/yarglethatblargle]] for making sure I put it in here

** Do you want more fics like that, or those two fics you read?

If it's the former, I cannot help. If it's the latter, I probably can't help, but more info will be needed for *anyone* to help.
