#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Had the idea for an extreme au fic where instead of the statute of secrecy some form of 'statute of cooperation' was signed where the wizarding society, at least of the U.K. Agreed to cooperate openly with the muggle world. However whenever I went to write it I struggled with exactly what the world would look like in terms of technology. With wizarding spells and the muggle advancements of the last 200 years I imagine we'd almost certainly already be populating the other planets in our solar system. Definitely an idea with a huge amount of potential

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
