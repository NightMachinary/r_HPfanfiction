All my personal favourites tend to have too many adult themes in them for me to feel comfortable sharing them with someone so young.

PS: she is adorable.

** Linkffn(Harry Is a dragon, and that's okay) Is an amusing and friendly fanfic. A bit on the long side. (In progress) Linkffn(Harry mewter) is a weird one, but I really enjoyed it. ( complete)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.
