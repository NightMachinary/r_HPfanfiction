Bellatrix and Hermionie is easily my favourite pairing.

I'm after some fairly early on established relationship, longer the better and smut is fine.

I've read Murder Most Horrid, The Dark Corners of the Earth, Those Guilded Chains We Wear and Fractures.

Canon, time travel or AU is all fine with me, I prefer not dark Hermione but I'm open to suggestion.

Thanks guys!


** I've read only a handful of Bellamione stories, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) is easily my favorite. It's probably in my top 10 overall fanfics simply how it handles the characters with maturity. For me it's the anti-thesis to all the terrible Draco/Hermione fics out there, where Hermione just rolls over and just accepts being in an abusive/broken relationship.

IMHO a soulbond fic done right: Where the reaction is more akin to "Oh shit! This sucks" instead of being heads over heels for each other. Fair warning though: It's pretty dark (torture!) and the ending felt a little anti-climactic to me.

Moments before the nuclear bomb strikes, Hermione Granger uses a portkey. Little does she know that she'll be flung across not space but time. Now, she can reverse it all. Or not? [Bellamione]

  Time heals all wounds
#+end_quote

Can I just say how disappointed I was by this story? In a lot of ways it's really well written and tries to frame itself as a tragedy, but I don't think the author understands tragedy as a literary genre. Something where you say at the end: "Oh that's so tragic!" when it is used synonymously to "Shit happens!" is not a tragedy. It's essential for a proper tragedy that the main character is somehow complicit (through character flaws) in their own undoing. In Time Heals all Wounds Bellatrix is set up to fail by fate and it's just depressing instead of tragic.

The story is *really* nihilistic and the title IMHO more cynical than anything (though the author would probably disagree with me on that).

Apologies for the rant!

**** I loved THAW characterization of teen bellatrix. sweet but still has that edge to her. and for the tragedy thing...I think its because the time travel thing is a bootstrap to begin with. the author kinda tied down her options for changing the future by making "evil" bella be the one who sent Hermione back to the past. So, past Bella has to become evil future Bella no matter what coz...there wouldnt be a past Hermione without evil Bella. Its like that Time Machine problem all over again. :(
