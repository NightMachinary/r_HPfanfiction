** The most intense action scenes in all of fanfiction will be found in linkffn(Sword of the Hero) - particularly the second book of the trilogy.

Linkffn(wastelands of time) by the same author is similarly intense, and much more intense from the start.

Linkffn(Denarian Renegade) is another trilogy of nonstop action that is ridiculously well written.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

********* You can change canon, but a lot of people don't take the time to actually do so. It's pretty hard to justify why Harry should end up with the person who murdered his parents, tried to murder him, and ruined countless lives, including those of his family and friends. I've read Full Circle, and the relationship does indeed make sense, buts that only because of the reincarnation. And honestly, it could go the other way. Reincarnation could just as easily result in a Harry who is willing to do whatever it takes no matter the cost to completely eradicate Voldemort from existence. The story could still even be crack. The description does help alleviate some concern, but fanfiction authors are not famously known for their good writing, nor is fandom known for its good taste. The high amount of kudos helps, but without knowing beforehand how it compares in number to other fics does not actually give it any real value (FYI, it's only 12th among the top HP fics with kudos too). As mentioned before, fandom doesn't always have good taste. People are far too willing the glaring flaws in how a relationship started in order to start shipping their distasteful whitewashed characters. Other stories that are often given many kudos are stories with Mary Sues as the main character. A lot of popular fanfiction is just mindless creepy fluff or wish-fulfillment roleplay.

********** I guess it's dropped since the last time I checked. My bad.

Everyone always talks about their bad experiences with fanfiction, but honestly I've never had any problems. I think a lot of it is my quality threshold --- if it is not up to par within the first few chapters, I exit the tab --- and me remembering the good fics better than the bad ones. I honestly try to not let any previous bad experiences with a bad ship (for example) affect what I will read next. There is a ship who's every story I've read I literally cannot stomach, but that doesn't stop me from clicking the next story, because /maybe this will be different, maybe the story will be so good I can ignore the ship/

I think that's a big part of fanfiction, to me at least --- the picking and choosing. We choose which fics we want to read based on tags, and we don't mind skipping over bigger sections of the text because there are plenty more fics in the sea.

*********** I guess that makes you different from normal people. The instinctive reaction to something bad is to avoid it, and people remember what's bad for a long time. There's also a big difference between a ship that's normally at least decent and you reading a bad fic versus a ship that's inherently flawed where almost any random fic you choose will be problematic. A lot of people tend to stop reading fics once they find them distasteful, and repeat experiences that appear to be the norm tend to leave them jaded. You've somehow decided to ignore that aspect of decision-making personally.

You mention that you have a good quality threshold, but you also mention that you've found "many HP/TMR to be absolutely hilarious". I'd personally be hard-pressed to find more than 15 actually good HP/TMR fics in the fandom, and certainly no more than 5 that are hilarious. The reality of the situation is yes, every ship will have something horrific written about it, but there are also ships that are inherently awful and if you contemplate most of those fics, low-key horrific, and it isn't worth peoples' time nor sanity to try any random fic in those ships.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

**** This is by far the best indy!Harry I've ever read. The storyline is fast paced, and I as a reader was able to feel the intensity and urgency behind Harry's actions, as though he's on a timer. There are cliched moments, but they are very limited in number.

The action is riveting, Harry's power is believable given the premise of the story, he doesn't run around making fools out of Albus or Tom on a regular basis - he catches them by surprise exactly once - and after that, they wise up. Voldemort is also terrifyingly strong.

Yes it is abandoned, but the last written scene can be interpreted as an ending of its own, if you so choose.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included.

  Harry's had it with his destined role after the Order does something he can't forgive. Now he's done with both sides of the war and wants to be left alone. But since when have his wishes ever counted for anything? LV/HP Slash & MPREG.More warnings inside.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Oh boy, get ready!

linkffn(7899682) Schooled: HP/TR, when I'm in the mood for a good curve stomp.

linkffn(4924413) Dark and Light: plays a lot with boring cliche tropes. He's perfect but can't feel anything. He's not quite human. His magic sides with the dark side but that doesn't mean he's evil. If you're gonna use cliche tropes, this fic shows how to use them well.

linkffn(6099036) Café: nice slice of life. Not much really happens, but then again a lot really happens

linkffn(2900438) Unsung Hero: my favorite of the wrong BWL-Potter-twin fics

linkffn(11244373) Sine Qua Non: HP/SS, blink and you'll miss it. Two Harry's existing at the same time, one a student, the other a muggle studies professor. This is written in my absolute favorite way of writing couples: subtle. Are they really good friends or something more? That's non of your business. You can infer what their relationship is.

linkao3(3390668) C'est La Vie: I just really like this author's way of writing characters

linkao3(2677538) Fifth House: HP/SS, Some really interesting ideas about Hogwarts, magic, and soul bonding. Author only move 25 of 68 chapters to ao3. I have all 68 chapters if anyone's interested

Dullastacks' A Little Light Reading: taken off the internet. My favorite of the "characters reading the books" but it's just Snape and the fic never finished the 1st book before being deleted. I also have this saved.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
