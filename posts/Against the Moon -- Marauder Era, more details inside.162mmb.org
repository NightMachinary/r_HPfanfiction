This is the best fanfiction I have ever read. It's a Marauder Era fanfiction with Remus as the main character, but the author manages to capture everyone's personality and motivations so wonderfully well that I've basically just made this my headcanon. It has a lot of focus on how Remus comes to terms with and deals with being a werewolf at Hogwarts and the relationships between the four Marauders. All four -- even Peter -- are done justice and the characterization is just excellent. There are OCs, but usually just in the roles of teachers (particular DADA) and other minor students to flesh out the school setting. Everyone is handled well. The story also follows canon and there are no plans to deviate from what JKR laid out already.

This story is still in progress, but it starts at the beginning of Remus' first year at Hogwarts and has covered the first two entire years. These chapters are lengthy but I think this is a good thing here. She writes in a very similar style to JKR and I'm very please with the overall writing quality -- especially given that in recent chapters they have had to be audio transcribed.

Seriously -- give it a shot. I really can't sing its praises high enough.


** I'll happily second this one, I read it for the first time last week and I thought it was brilliant. I'm not normally a big fan of Marauder Era and I think this might be the only Marauder Fic I've ever read through to it's in progress mark and will be following.

A word of warning though it is very long, at just over 600k it is quite a length, particularly given that it's only just reached second year, if Stoplight Delight is planning on covering 7 years it will probably take a while. I thought it's portrayal of Remus' parents in particular was an excellent examination of what his condition must have meant to their family life, which is often glossed over in both fics and canon.

11/10, it's awesome!

*** There was a time when she was updating every-other-day, but the author is now sick and has to update using voice recognition software. Updates generally happen every two weeks or so. Sometimes more and sometimes not. She also occasionally writes one-shot companion stories which might examine something that she didn't have time to fit in before, or a chapter from another character's perspective.

*** Ugh me too, I hate waiting for WIPs because updates are either long in coming or unsatisfying.

*** What I mean in this circumstance is that she doesn't make any changes that don't follow what we know happened in the books. For instance, though we aren't at fifth year yet, they mention in the books that the boys perfected their Animagi trick in fifth year -- this means we won't be seeing it any sooner than that.

*** When someone says the book is Canon it means it is from the Author (J.K.Rowling). Canon also refers to the original books written by Rowling.
