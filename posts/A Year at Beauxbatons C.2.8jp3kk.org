** I liked it, but you probably shouldn't self-promote this much. You already made two threads for the 3k words first chapter, so it'd be best to wait until there's real meat to the story to promote further.

It's a decent story so far, hard to tell with how little has happened. As long as you avoid any more rewrites, and just focus on content and progressing, this could be a nice story.

*** Thanks. I'll keep that in mind for the future. Maybe every five or even ten chapters I'll make a post. It'll keep it consistent, yet fairly spaced apart since I'm going to aim for a post every half month.

  With the threat of Sirius Black looming, Dumbledore feels it best that Harry Potter does not attend Hogwarts this year. Fortunately, there is an alternative. Hopefully Harry enjoys France!
