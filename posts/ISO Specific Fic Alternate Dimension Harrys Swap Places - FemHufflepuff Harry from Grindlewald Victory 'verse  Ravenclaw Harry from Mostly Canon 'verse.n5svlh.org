:END:
As the title states, I'm looking for a specific fic where two Harry Potters swap places with each other. Elements I remember:

*Harry A is a Hufflepuff girl and grew up in a universe where Grindlewald won and the Statue of Secrecy was definitively broken. She is some kind of national champion I think?

*Harry B is a Ravenclaw boy in a timeline that is more or less canon, aside from Dumbledore dying a bit earlier than in canon.

*Harry A's universe has Tom Riddle as Headmaster, Harry B's has Snape.

*Flitwick is Harry A's account manager in her home universe.

*There's a scene shortly after Harry A finds herself in the wrong universe where Snape is trying to sus out her loyalties. She is confused and says something to the effect of "well I don't like the Irish nationalists, they keep bombing things and it's a problem" and Snape learns that she comes from a universe without Voldemort.

*Harry B loses his shit when he sees Headmaster Tom Riddle, and then there's some drama about the Hallows and having to get one before the Russians do.

Hopefully this is enough and someone can direct me to the fic! Thanks folks! :D
