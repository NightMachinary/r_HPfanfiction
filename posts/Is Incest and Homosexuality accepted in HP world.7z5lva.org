** I think first cousin marriage is canon? Homosexuality is kinda, JKR said Dumbledore is gay. But there's no gay relationships so IDK

** It's a very typical cliche in a certain subset of the fandom but at least in regards to homosexuality it seems like people would talk openly about Dumbledore being gay if it was completely normal. Clearly there's some kind of stigma attached to it.

In regards to incest I assume that it has the same bad effects on wizards as on muggles. So... just as in medieval europe I'd expect pure-blood aristocracy to engage in it (marrying cousins and such) if push comes to shove, but it wouldn't be talked about in polite society. Sometimes I joke about how the pervasive retardation in Wizard society might be symptoms of being mildly inbred ("I'd rather marry my cousin than a Muggle or Muggleborn"... it doesn't take long in such a small population to ruin the gene pool).
