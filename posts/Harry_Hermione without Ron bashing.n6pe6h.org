I think Harry/Hermione brings in an interesting pairing and opens the door for different chemistry, character development, etc, but it always ends up with horrid Ron bashing. I'd really like to see Fics with an intact golden trio but Hermione ends up with the other best friend. Thanks!

  The summer after Harry's fourth year would have been much better if just one person in his life had disregarded Professor Dumbledore's instructions to ignore him. And if that person was Hermione Granger? It would have been much, much better.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

*** I would love this, but I don't find it to be my experience in reading the canon. In most Harry/Hermione fics (if desired, I can provide an exhaustive list) Ron becomes either a peripheral friend or an outright antagonist. Even my favorite writings sort of relegate him to an occasional friend. Very often, Neville or Luna take Ron's place. White Squirrel is probably one of the best and most dedicated HP fanfiction authors out here, and it's a little enlightening to see how little they engage Ron as a character.

I can't blame fic writers because Rowling did very little to inspire a love of Ron. And where the films gave Draco an edge, I think they took away from Ron. But Ron is the quintessential “middle sibling” (even though he's not quite the middle) and I would love to see some fics where Harry ends up with Hermione while Ron finds his own way.

**** One of the reasons why we love jkr's writing is because how real her characters often feel. The same is to be said for Ron. Ron is a typical teen unsure of his own body and feelings. He is loyal, even if he struggled with it. he who had nothing shared everything with the boy he met on the train. He who left, wanted to return immediately. He who told Sirius that he had to kill him first. They were always three best friends but Harry loved Ron more than Hermione.

Well, there's certainly enough there for me, as Ron's my second favorite character in the series (after Hermione). Ron being pushed to the wayside is one of my few quibbles with White Squirrel's otherwise excellent stories.

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. M-rating for smut in ch. 4 and up.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.
