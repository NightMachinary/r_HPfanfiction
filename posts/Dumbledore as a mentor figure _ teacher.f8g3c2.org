I'm all for Dumbledore bashing sometimes, but I'm in the mood of a good teacher story - where due to circumstances, Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing and helps him reach unknown before magical heights. Dumbledore teaching Harry new things, helping him reach his potential, and even telling him of his past in a bonding moment...or something like that. Heck, I'd like to see something like this done for Ron or Hermione as well.

â€‹

Do you guys have any recommendations?


** A little one-shot where Dumbledore finds out the Dursleys aren't treating Harry well, but he doesn't want to give up the blood wards, so he becomes a regular visitor. The Petrov Gambit by OlegGunnarsson linkffn(13308375)

** Haven't read it, but I think linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has Dumbledore teaching.

Have read it, and in the latter two books he also teaches Harry in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and it's sequels.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
