:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The title says it mostly. Harmony fic set during the Triwizard Tournament. Harry was oblviated by Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic sometime between the first and second task and was put into a muggle school without knowing about magic. He was appareted to Hogwarts and his memories were returned by the Goblet of Fire just before the second task. I believe he also lost his magic during that time.

I'm not certain about the following things but I believe Harry refused to participate in the first task (and the MoM got angry about that). I also thought that Harry took the magic from all the wizards who voted to erase his memories with help off the Goblet.

  Sometimes playing by the rules is not just your best option, it can be your only option.

*** Thank you, that was it. In my head it was a bit longer but still a fun short read.
