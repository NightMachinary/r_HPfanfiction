So, I'm looking for two fics I read some time ago, and cannot find them again, for some reason.

​

First, a possibly potionsandsnitches fic, where Harry and Malfoy both stay at Snape's manor, for their safety or any other reason. Malfoy is being his regular arrogant spoiled self, while Harry is being given all the chores by Snape, who wants to punish and educate him. There's a part where Snape watches Harry with a lawnmower and is surprised he's not getting tired from working so hard while forgetting to eat.

​

At some part Harry and Malfoy get into a fight, Malfoy uses something similar to an unforgivable and Harry collapses. Snape is furious and sends him home, and while attending Harry he discovers evidence of physical abuse he endured. He then decides to train him and starts being somewhat kind to him.

​

The second one, I'm pretty sure is from [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], where during potions class Harry is given by Snape some sort of potion that takes the class into Harry's worst memories. They see the Dursley abuse, Cedric's death at the graveyard and possibly what happened with Umbridge. Basically, Snape wanted to humiliate Harry in this fic while diving into his memories in revenge of the pensive gig but it ended up biting him in the ***.

​

Any of those sound familiar? I'm going nuts trying to find them!

​


** The first one sounds like /A New Place to Stay/ linkffn(7104654), I think, though it's been a very long time since I read it. Sorry, can't help with the second.

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to do― he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.
