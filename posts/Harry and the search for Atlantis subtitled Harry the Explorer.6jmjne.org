I'm currently reading joe6991's Wastelands of Time---and not particularly liking it but still intrigued (for now)---and am at the point where Harry's speaking about Searching for Atlantis. And that 'triggered' a want in me. And that want is 'are there any good fics where harry is part of or leads a team to find/restore/rediscover Atlantis?' I don't want stories where Harry automagically knows where it is (unless we come in to story post research but with flashbacks to it during the exploration), I want adventure, excitement, traipsing through jungles with machetes looking for clues.

Actually, any stories with Harry exploring, searching for magicks long forgot would be good though Atlantis is preferable.

It's a one-shot, rather than the big long multi-chapter epic you seem to be looking for, but it might whet your appetite for more. For how short it is, there's a lot of good stuff going on here: adventure, romance, whimsy/humor, and some slight family angst. I don't know how you feel about Harry/Luna pairings, but if you like them, this is pretty sweet.

  Harry finds himself waking with a broken heart and a hangover. Apparently he's put an ad in the Quibbler at some point the night before. "Wanted: Diversion. Will do anything for up to a month. Serious inquiries only. Send an owl to the Quibbler Attention: Suitor 435138."
