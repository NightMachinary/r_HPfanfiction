I'm looking for any stories where Harry is betrayed/cheated on/rejected etc etc where he doesn't roll over and forgive everything. I want him moving on with his life without them. I don't care about pairing just no Harry/Hermione please.

Thanks!

** I strongly suggest reading "A Cadmean Victory". The story describes more introspective, thoughtful (and slightly more mature) Harry, who during 4th year re-opened the Chamber of Secret and discovered portrait of Salazar Slytherin inside. As a result of meeting his very distant ancestor Harry focuses more on his studies and learning magic. Confrontations after Goblet of Fire fiasco are harsher (but believable), Harry is ostracized within House and abandoned by his friends. Ultimately he successfully moves on with his life.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione disappears. Harry searches for her for years, but she is gone... until she finally comes back on her own terms. (Written to illustrate the flaw in this trope.)

** Forsaking a friendship because someone did something stupid is not conducive to longterm friendships, especially not year-long ones.

There are a few "Ron the Death Eater" fics that start off like this (usually from GoF)

I agree this is true but OP specifically wants a fic like that. So idk if the request post is the best place to try and convince them otherwise.

**** Oh, my post was very poorly formed. I wasn't intending to shoot down the request, merely asking if I understood OP correctly by posting what I extrapolated into a very dubious case. Sorry.

Basically I was asking if OP was looking for a Harry that was thoroughly betrayed (i.e. much worse than canon), or if HP is the lesser person here. I assumed the former and suggested tropes based on it to look for.

** That's not very nice of him. People can't go back in time and change how they behaved. The most a man can do to make up for his past grievances is to seek forgiveness for them.

Of course, if someone doesn't truly want to be forgiven for their actions, as they don't regret them, but just wants you to forgive them so you don't cause them any problems, that's not the same thing.

*** I get that and if I were talking about real life I would agree wholeheartedly. However this is the story in the mood to read, don't get me wrong I'm not saying it has to be a bashing story full of revenge. All I want is to read about him moving on with his life, (without whomever it is that hurt him) peacefully and happily. He doesn't have to bear a grudge against them, he can even forgive them but that doesn't mean he has to accept them back into his life. I'm just so sick of reading stories where he's so hurt and just forgives everyone straight away, forgiveness takes time and effort. And so I want to read something different where he moves on without them instead.
