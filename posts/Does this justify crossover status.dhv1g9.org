A more specific phrasing of the question: Is it acceptable to have a set of characters with X-Men like powers without reference to the X-Men universe?

This concerns an (existing and 11 chapters in) Harry Potter fic where the protagonist is an outsider to the magical community. I want to keep it fairly small scale: no world-level threats, catastrophes, etc. just ground level-ish intrigue. I worry whether this is really doable in a world that has seen the likes of Magneto and Proffessor X running around battling each other for decades. At the same time, it's important that the protagonist be endowed with non-magical superhuman powers, and that certain other humans also have them, just not on the order of potency routinely seen in those comics. It's a key aspect of the story's driving conflict.

Would it bother you, if there was a lot of OC but proto X-men-like stuff running around without reference to X-men canon? Would it be too obvious?

Another option: Would it be acceptable to have a set of characters who everybody who's read X-men comics or seen a couple of movies would recognize as mutants, but without reference to canon X-Men characters or events? Would you, in that case, keep the crossover tag on the fic?

It needs to be believable for my MC to be used to dealing with weird stuff, and yet flabbergasted at the blatant sort of whimsy with which HP magic operates. I don't know if this would be quite doable if just across the pond you have Jean Grey, Cyclops, Mystique, Magneto and all the other crazily OP mutants that I can't name just in plain sight (not to mention literally everybody else in the Marvel Universe).

Come to think of it I guess what I'm describing would be an X-Men Alternate Universe. So another way to pose the question: Is X-Men AU sufficiently common that readers would get it, and not just stare at the screen scratching their heads?


** In the fic Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power by Sage Ra there was a crossover with the main characters from Chuck who became side characters with fairly significant screen time. Thing is, they weren't treated like crossover characters typically are and just played the role of muggle intelligence agents and specialists that the plot required who also just happened to be crossover characters. I'm not even sure if they were named explicitly and their TV series was certainly never stated. They were not relevant or important to the majority of the story and it was right to not label the story as a Crossover, even if they had a large role at certain moments.

Similarly, Harry Potter and the Deus ex Machina had a James Bond crossover that was also treated with just enough significance to make then relevant and important characters but did not have enough relevance to the overall plot to categorize the story as a Crossover either.

Both of these stories are my ideal benchmark for inserting crossover characters without making your story a crossover in itself.

Crossovers have a lot of weight and expectation put on them. There is an expectation that either the two worlds will completely fuse, or else a character will be inserted into a world and be the main character, or an element of the crossover will be integrally important and essential to the plot. There is no room in the exception for a side character with little relevance outside their role. If you had Kakashi from Naruto show up as a judge during the tri-wizard tournament and have a few lines and funny moments and that was the entire role he had in your story that is not nearly enough to satisfy a crossover.

In your case, you have the option of marking your story as an AU HP/XMen Xover, or a plain HP story and including Psuedo Xmen AU in the summary. There is no getting out of explaining up front that a major portion of your plot hinges on these OC characters. The way to choose which one to go with is how OC they are. If there are blatant rip-off major characters like Fake-Logan who is a manor character for you then it might be safer to mark it as a HP/Xmen Xover. If you only include major ripoff characters sparingly or not at all you could get away with just using a summary tag and having it as a HP only fic.

You can't get away with not warning people about them up front. It can be a major turn off to be introduced to a major crossover unexpectedly. For the two fics I named knowing the source material does not significantly affect the enjoyment of the fic. If you didn't know who Chuck or James Bond were you could go about your day all the same, and those who knew would get a bit of extra appreciation.

For a major element like your OC characters they would most likely need upfront introduction or you will have a lot of upset readers in my opinion. This of course all depends on how relevant they are in your story.

Sorry for rambling, hope my point got across.

If it's not straight out of a recent capeshit movie, I doubt you can reasonably expect people to get what you're talking about. Even then, there probably are lots of people like me who can't be bothered to watch that stuff at all.

I'd put an xmen AU in the crossover section. At he very least mention it in the summary.

*** Great, it's on ffn: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13307866/1/Evil-Space-Wizards]]

...But I'm about to heavily rework it almost from the ground up, whence the crossover question, among other things.

** I think if you're just using the concept of the X-Men, rather than any characters or settings, you don't need to call it a crossover. You could put in the description something like "AU with OC superpowers" or something, and that should be warning enough
