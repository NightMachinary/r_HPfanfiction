For reasons that I cannot explain, I think the best would be Goblet of Fire or Order of the Phoenix, which in some ways is ironic because they were definitely not the best when it comes to the movies. Maybe someone can tell me why I feel like this.

Same goes for reasons that I cannot explain, the worst would be Chamber of Secrets. I wouldn't say it was bad, but in comparison to the other books, it was just... alright. It had the feel of JK Rowling trying to fill a gap or something while waiting on ideas for the rest of the story.


** Best: Prisoner of Azkaban\\
New magical concepts were introduced while not invalidating the old ones. Several interesting characters were introduced, such as Lupin, Sirius, Peter, Trelawney, and Sir Cadogan. The subplots were interesting and interweaved with the main plot; I can't think of a subplot that felt aloof from the rest of the book. This really was the most cohesive Harry Potter book and it was great. I didn't even mind that Voldemort took a back seat, because Rowling didn't really want to develop his character at all until Book 6 anyway so fleshing out how he had affected other people was interesting.

Worst: Deathly Hallows\\
I feel like too many of the characterizations in this book suddenly changed from previous books. There were a lot of really important plot points that were suddenly introduced in this book that should have been introduced in several previous books so that they had time to develop (Dumbledore's dark past, wandlore, etc). The pacing throughout was really off, and the final battle at Hogwarts felt unsatisfying.

** Goblet of Fire is the best. PoA is a very close 2nd. She had a her main character do some magic, expanded her universe a lot, and there was only a little idiot ball.

OotP is the worst and, for me, it has nothing to do with Harry's justified 'whining'. It's just a lot of pages and words of idiot ball. There was a shift in Harry and Sirius (and maybe Dumbledore's) characterization and, personally, I was just super annoyed with everyone.

HBP and DH are a lot worse in that regard. I find the idiotic decisions in OotP a lot more understandable than the ones in later books, especially in regards to Ron and Hermione outright rejecting Malfoy as a Death Eater.

**** My major problem with OOTP is how absolutely, mind-numbingly boring it is. It's basically what writing turns into without an editor. There are two interesting scenes(The Weasley Twins leaving and the Ministry fight), and the entire rest of the book is horrible. HBP has some interesting elements, and the major problem in the book is bad characters, which is a problem, but it's better than having a long, boring book. DH is basically the same. Ron leaving could have been a really good opportunity for character development on both sides, but it ends up changing literally nothing.

​

Edit: also, the forced romantic plots in HBP were really annoying. There was not a single good relationship that I can think of.

***** I think that the only relationship with nothing to fault at would be Cho/Cedric. Every other is problematic in at least one way, be it James obsession over Lily, the water under the bridge Ron/Hermione would realistically have or Lupin doing a runner. Harry/Ginny is bad because Harry broke Ginny's previous relationship up while under the influence of a luck potion. It was heading that way by the look of it, but Harry sunk the ship prematurely.

** Favourite: PoA.

Least favourite stand-alone: CoS. Dumbledore's role really falls apart in this one when you think about it. At least in other books, he had outward influences which forced his hand to some degree. But in that one, his mistakes are truly his and on one else's.

Although I have to say that as a conclusion, HBP and DH were more disappointing. HBP had that weird shift from a looming civil war to teenage drama and DH requires the idiot ball to be passed like a bong in order for the plot to even remotely work (Dumbledore not giving them the items they need, the Order playing DJ rather than effective underground work, the extraction plan, the military tactics a ten-year-old Starcraft player could best, no other resistance and so on).

** PoA, GoF, and OoTP (though it could have benefited from a little editing) are the best. It's where the story starts to hit its stride an you feel like Harry is starting to come into his own. If I had to pick one it would be GoF. It just feels like the most complete: Harry continues to grow up, there's some great world building, cool bits of magic, and fun story, subplots, and characters.

CoS and HBP are the weakest. CoS because it sort of feels like SS just with a different villain at the end. In some ways it makes sense, they're only 12, you can't expect them to go off on wild adventures and dig deep into magic at that point, but it still ends up being kind of a blah story. HBP is bad because it completely puts a halt to the story that was developing PoA to OoTP. Some of the Riddle stuff is cool, but Harry as a character stops growing and everything else is put on hold while Harry chases Slughorn and Ginny around the castle. I'd say between the two CoS is overall the weakest because of the aforementioned repetitive feel of the story, but that doesn't absolve HBP. I still enjoy these two, I just think they're the weakest books of the series.

I feel like I need to say a positive word about DH here though. While the story does have its problems (and I think some of those are due to the fact JK didn't have a definite plan of how she was going to end it earlier on) Rowling captures the despair and hopelessness of the fact that three 17 year olds are tasked with defeating Voldemort in a beautiful way. It also circles back on some of the themes of the series: love/hope, death, courage, etc. in its conclusion. Some the lore she introduces (albeit late in the game, I know) is cool too. I hated it the first time I read it but have really enjoyed reading it as I've gotten older.

That no one died in Harry's year is a series of very large coincidences. I don't think that they are probable enough to happen twice until Myrtle died.

Dumbledore is convinced that Hagrid is innocent, right? Therefore Hagrid must have told him what "pet" he really owned and that a spider does not have the ability to kill without physical damage.

Hagrid also tells Harry and Ron to follow the spiders. Aragog fears the Basilisk and can sense it. Logic dictates that Hagrid knows this (as he tells them to seek out Aragog) and that Aragog already sensed the Basilisk before (while Hagrid was raising him in the castle). Therefore Hagrid knows. And while Hagrid can be irresponsible, I don't think that he wouldn't have told Dumbledore about the Basilisk inside his school.

Also, Myrtle is a textbook example of a Basilisk kill and she remembers the eyes. Since the list of creatures which kill with their sight does not seem to be long and the chamber is linked to the Heir of SLYTHERIN (aka the snake fetishist), Dumbledore either knew about the Basilisk or was truly incompetent.

One could read the book, or simply look at the wiki, and see their sources, but very well.

Notice the plural use of the word attack:

--------------

/"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one."/

--------------

/"You mean all these attacks, sir?" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything./

--------------

/"What do you mean?" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. "Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?"/

--------------

There's no reason for Riddle to be lying here. And it doesn't make sense that they would've shut the whole school down just for one death.

Regarding Hagrid and Aragog, I don't see why either of them would know the name of the creature. Even if Aragog found out, he refused to speak the name. If he even knew it. He might've had a different name for it for all we know.

So no, Aragog knowing a basilisk is around does not mean he tells Hagrid, "Hey, that's a basilisk."

And even /if/ Hagrid did tell Dumbledore about it, Dumbledore might've dismissed it. Because, again, false clues fed to him by Riddle. The other victims testimonies.

Why would Dumbledore trust an uneducated spider over eye witness accounts?

#+begin_quote
  I don't think that they are probable enough to happen twice until Myrtle died.
#+end_quote

We see fate altering magic at Hogwarts already with the curse on the defense position. Why not other fate altering magic used to protect the students as much as possible?

#+begin_quote
  Also, Myrtle is a textbook example of a Basilisk kill and she remembers the eyes.
#+end_quote

This is not a logical argument.

Firstly, there is the fact that Myrtle might've not told Dumbledore out of spite or whatever (she was a shitty person, spying on naked students, wishing for Harry's death, hoping Hermione gets bullied).

Secondly, it is an insane logical leap to assume that just because Myrtle saw yellow eyes it means those yellow eyes killed her with its very gaze.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore either knew about the Basilisk or was truly incompetent.

Hmm. Hermione at the age of 18, during a time where Dumbledore's motives is being questioned, still trusts Dumbledore.

Is she also incompetent?

Honesty, Malfoy is probably the most problematic character in the book.

Rowling intended him to be a teenager forced into a bad situation (presumably), but his actions were truly horrible. Like, the simple fact that he's carrying out his attacks while still acting as a student is perfidy (since civilians are entitled to protections which do not apply to combatants), a war crime even the Allies executed people for. Or the fact that his chosen avenues of attack violated article 23 of the Hague Convention (poison, unnecessary suffering, treachery beyond the laws of warfare). Or that his use of the Unforgivables would put him into Azkaban for life, no matter the context. And that's not even considered that he forced another student to carry out his plots with the Imperius, something deplorable on many levels (and another war crime).

Had Malfoy actually attacked Dumbledore in person, I could get the sympathy. But given his chosen methods, especially against Katie, I honestly consider anything below life in prison too good for him.

** Like the others, my favourite is Goblet. I think largely because it's the only glimpse we get in the series of a wider magical world than insular Britain.

I don't really have a “worst” book, but Chamber of Secrets is the weakest book. I don't know why that is, but I just never have as much of an urge to read it as the others.

** I dont care for COS because it feels like literally a whole book was written just so JK Rowling could introduce horcruxes....

I don't care for DH either because it is literally Harry Potter and the perpetual camping trip. I feel like she really dropped the ball as far as climax resolution.

POA is a gem.

** I always loved GOF because I like the competition and getting to see wizards from a different country for the only time.

I don't like chamber of secrets. Mostly because I hate the movie for reasons I don't understand. O think because the first is so magical and the second is so down to earth? I really don't know...?

** I agree, and I think I know why. It has to do eith the world. Before those books JK is busily building the world. In those books JK is busily living in the world. After those books JK is busily tearing the world down. The characters of HP are one of the best things about it, but theyre amazing all the way through. The next factor to consider when it comes to quality is the setting. HP has one of the best written and world-built settings in existence. Obviously nothing is going to trump lotr for depth and quality, but JK managed to make a world that was shallow enough for kids, and deep enough for adults, while simultaneously seeming both like a part of our world and entirely seperate at the same time. In GoF and OotP the world is at its best, so the books are at their best as well.

** I actually really liked Chamber of Secrets. It was the book that REALLY made me an HP fan... that may just be because I love a good mystery story, and COS is basically a really clever murder mystery. A murder mystery where nobody actually dies, but still. There's suspects, red herrings, clues and a surprise twist when the culprit's identity is revealed.

I think Deathly Hallows is probably my least favourite. At least it's the only HP book that I haven't managed to read completely through more than once... I've re-read parts of it, and have a lot of fave scenes from it, but I never managed to slog through the entire thing more than once.

** I actually really liked COS, it has my favorite Voldemort concept and I liked how Harry was seeing these similarities between them. I'm not usually a fan of mysteries/twist endings but I really liked the diary concept. I do see how some of the logic falls through though, like especially at the end TMR is really stupid to forget about Phoenix tears...

My least favorite is DH, I found the horcrux hunt boring. I wish more had been done with the Deathly Hallows. I didn't really like the tone shift for the last three books, but OK TO and HBO had new developements and information on the wizarding world, in DH I didn't see much of that.

** Best: Order of the Phoenix. While GoF may have had more world-building, I can't help but feel that this book more exemplifies the /pressure/ of being Harry (and all that entails). Sure, Harry is written as a 30-something middle class mother's ideal of a teenage boy, but in this book you get the sense of frustration and annoyance and raw emotion that other books sort of gloss over or ignore. Not to mention this book is really the main source for most of the insight into wizarding culture, politics and government that actually exists in canon. The rest is mainly second or third-hand glimpses.

Worst: Chamber of Secrets. Sure, HBP is a bit meandering and slow, and DH is filled with just too many coincidences, they still can't really compare to what happens in CoS. I touched on quite a bit of this in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8osj6r/the_weakest_book_in_the_series_comedic/][comedic post]] here, but the sheer amount of ridiculous contrivances just stacks up and up by the end. And I get the impression that a lot of people haven't read the early books in a long while, so they may forget a bit. Basically /nothing/ happens in the book from January till April in CoS - basically up to Hermione's petrification.

** *Best:* OotP: With Voldemort back and the Ministry turned against them, the trio finally get a glimpse of the big picture and a sense of what is at stake not just for themselves or even for Hogwarts, but for the broader society. And, they mostly rise to the occasion, while still having relatable difficulties and limitations.

*Worst:* HBP: Others have already pointed out that the protagonists had spent OotP trying to prove to the world that Voldemort is back, and then they spent HBP pretending to themselves that he wasn't. Furthermore, anything in the book that Harry did of his own initiative (i.e., investigating Draco) ended up having no effect whatsoever; Hermione went from organising a well regulated militia in a school to moping and domestic violence; and Ron mainly went about getting hurt, usually through no fault of his own.

Let's just say that after reading HBP, it was a long, long time before I got around to DH.

** That depends upon what you mean by "best": I would say that OotP was the best-written, but PS/SS was the most enjoyable.

Worst I'd put it as a toss-up between HBP and DH - 6 was poorly-written but 7 was a massive failure to stick the landing.

** Best: POA and COS. POA, introduced time-travel to the HP universe. And if I'm not mistaken, time travel was and still is uncommon in YA books. A novel concept that made the HP universe much deeper. COS as there's that sense of sinister evil. Of course, in Philosopher's Stone, Voldy is introduced. But COS induces a feeling of much more evilness. It made me realise what Voldemort actually was.

Worst: OOTP. Theres a reason why the majority of fanfics begin here. Weak, spineless MC. A whole 500 pages of meandering nonsense. Most of the book felt like a rabble.

** I have multiple criteria regarding this question.

Best in terms of fun: 'Prisoner of Azkaban' - almost no real villain (the only book in which V does not appear in any form), also the purest 'Hogwarts' experience, e.g. it's the only book with all three Quidditch matches. Also I think Rowling had the most fun writing it since she had just gotten rid of her financial troubles and she wasn't yet so famous as to be distracting.

Best in terms of actual prose: 'Deathly Hallows' - I love the almost lyrical descriptions in some chapters ('The Silver Doe', 'The Deathly Hallows') and also the confidence of the narrator, you almost feel that some parts had been planned for 15 years and she's dying to tell them.

Best in terms of maturity: 'Order of the Phoenix' - a villain which is scarier than V (Umbridge), but not a dark sider, someone who just symbolizes the messiness of human life. Also the image of James Potter gets tarnished here.

Best in terms of my personal enjoyment: 'Half-Blood Prince' - unpopular opinion here, but I simply love than we got a breather episode during the war and a Harry that mainly has fun instead of training for combat like in many fics written circa 2004. Also I like that Harry is right about suspecting Draco, that he seems more mature and for once he is quite popular, so it's like a return to the PoA days.

Worst in terms of my personal enjoyment: 'Order of the Phoenix' - when I first read the book, I felt that the plot didn't advance at all since we were now almost in the same position as at the end of GoF (also I had gotten the impression that Fudge was convinced in GoF that V is back after seeing Snape's Dark Mark so it felt weird spending an entire book just on getting him convinced).

Worst in some ineffable sense: 'Chamber of Secrets' - it's the first HP book I ever read (back in 2001) so maybe it should be my favorite but for some reason it feels off. On the other hand, it's the only book that feels like a pure whodunit so that's a plus.
