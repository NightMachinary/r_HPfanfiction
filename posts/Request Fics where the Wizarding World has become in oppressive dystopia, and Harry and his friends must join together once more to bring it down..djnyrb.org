** I mean isn't British Ministry of Magic one to begin with?

When Voldemort took over, large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically to carry out his sadistic genocidal policies.

Therefore, any fic that has them overthrowing or fundamentally reforming this abomination should qualify.

Beside the radical “The Sum of Their Parts” and “Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution”, which have been often recommended here, I like the almost canon compliant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492), a lot.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Not exactly that, but I really liked the “1984 with dementors” part of linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts -- Return to Neverland by Forest_of_Holly) (part of the longer series, which I unreservedly recommend as whole). The scene with “The White Cliffs of Dover” really got me.
