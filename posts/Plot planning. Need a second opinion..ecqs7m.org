I'm currently developing or thinking of a plot for a potential time travel Harry Potter fanfiction.

I'm looking for someone who can give me a second opinion of it.

The person has to have a good enough knowledge of canon information. Read tons of time travel fics. Have a good understanding of the characters.

Also. I need a beta.


** I could help you out. What's your chosen era and main characters? What genre do you plan to write?

*** Marauder Era. I'm still undecided on the main main character. Its between Harry and Albus Potter. Other characters will be Severus, Lily, the Marauders, Regulus Black and Barty Jr.

**** Personally, I'd rather read fics where the main character is Harry. Should also be easier to write having an established character and personality.

It'd mostly depends on how you want to handle Snape. It's one of my bigger pet peeves when characters with any form of actual interaction with Snape suddenly forget that he's a petty, cruel person and not a misunderstood angel.

**** For what it's worth, I'd rather read a story with ASP id the main character, as there are significantly less fics with him in this situation

** How do you plan the mechanics of the time travel to work? Free diverging timeline with anything goes?

** Well, you don't need a beta until it's written, so it's too soon to be worrying about that.
