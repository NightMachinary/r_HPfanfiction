Is there something out there which focuses on duelling and goes very in depth? Bonus points if the writing is beautifully visualizable.

Can be anything from a club at Hogwarts to a big tournament.


** The Lie I've Lived has some pretty decent duelling, both w staff + wand

** Harry Potter and the Phoenix Order and Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients had a dueling club at Hogwarts that involved a lot of unusual magic and the writer had pretty awesome knack for writing anime-style tournament battles. The stories themselves are also pretty awesome, they are the fifth and sixth books (unfortunately no seventh book) and were written pre-OotP. I, however can't find them online, but since they are some of the most famous HP fanfics of all time, someone might be able to direct you to them.

** There's a fair bit in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. A school duelling club run by Draco. A free-duelling tournament in the Lower Alleys (free-duelling ie weapons and dirty tricks are allowed). One of the six Triwizard tasks is a bracketed duelling tournament.

Book four finished in January, book five is starting probably sometime this year.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
