:END:
Hi! I was looking for a fanfic where snape leaves hogwarts to live in the muggle world and becomes something like a handyman.

Main points: The story takes place after Harry's trial in Order of the Phoenix. At one point, Snape gets a hammer and smashes the wall where Sirius' mum's portrait is. Molly yells at Snape about the way Harry grew up.

If you could find the name, that would be great! Thanks.
