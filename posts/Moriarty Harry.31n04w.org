There was a story I read a while ago, it wasn't very long, that was about Harry being obsessed with Sherlock Holmes and aspires to be like Moriarty. Any google searches brought up the version that was deleted, so if anyone knows where I can find it that would be great.


** I'm pretty sure it's Business by esama your referring to, i couldn't find the ff.net version but is Ao3 good? Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]]
