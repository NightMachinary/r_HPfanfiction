** Um I know I've read this, but I can't recall the exact title. So I grabbed some potential ones that might be it from my bookmarks and I'll just have to hope for the best:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12117954/chapters/27480975][Captivated]]: After his graveyard resurrection Lord Voldemort comes to a shocking revelation, Harry Potter is his horcrux. A quick legilimency attack on Harry convinces Voldemort of three things, firstly that Dumbledore knows about his horcruxes, secondly that he needs to reabsorb the errant piece of his soul that was released from the destroyed diary, and thirdly that Harry Potter can not be allowed to fall back into the hands of his enemies. And so Harry's year as the captive of Lord Voldemort begins.

Or

When a recently restored teenage Dark Lord determined to gain the loyalty of a former foe resorts to using love potions with unexpected results.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10349112/chapters/22868751][Whispers in the Dark]]: Enough is enough for Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived. One can only take murder attempts so many times in their life before it gets to be too much. So Harry does something stupid and reckless, as per the usual Gryffindor stereotype. However, the reaction he gets is nothing like what he expected.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286/chapters/8981407][FeS2]]: Harry learns something about pure-bloods, and his father, which rocks his world. And not in a good way. And oh, the repercussions!

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9395963/chapters/21270485][Prized]]: Severus Snape's loyalty has always been to Harry, not to Dumbledore or the Order. When he finds out that Harry is a horcrux and Dumbledore intends to have him killed, Severus goes to the Dark Lord with the information in an effort to save Harry's life, and in doing so changes the fate of the world.

Edit: just saw that it was on FFN, so maybe none of these are the right one. Apologies if this is a waste of time...

** Damn, was interested in finding this as well, but turns out it's slash.

On a slightly unrelated note, I honestly don't know why the major archive sites don't just have an easy way to filter for hetero/homo/other in regards to major pairings (within the story).

It wouldn't even be that hard to retroactively apply, and certainly incredibly easy to enact moving forward.

People have been asking for this for years.

You still had harem shit with all of the above - even with only 50 fics left after those filters, there were still at least a dozen, probably more, that slipped by the filter.

And I want to avoid it because it's disgusting to me, straight up, because It's not my sexuality. I don't care about people writing stories like that, I just don't want to read em.

**** Because it's rarely just slash, it's often dom/sub and/or mpreg as well. I call it slash+, and the target demographic goes from "sizeable" to "microscopic".

Slash is great, I could read a lot more slash as long as it was /just/ slash. But dom/sub, mpreg, and ridiculous pairings turns it into /special interest/. I'm not at all interested in a pregnant Harry in a submissive relationship with a dominant Snape. There are +3+ 4 things* wrong with that, and it's not the slash. There's /at least/ one fic like that out there.

I've read 1 (one!) good slash story which is linkffn(Everything I do by Lily Ann Lyones)

And then there are the other ones, like linkffn(The Beguile and Devotion of a Black Heir by StarLight Massacre), linkffn(Café by Pleasedial123), and linkffn(Curse of Fate by Mistress Nika)
