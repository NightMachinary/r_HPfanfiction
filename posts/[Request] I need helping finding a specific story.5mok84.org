Years ago I started reading a HP fanfiction story and I want to read it again, but can't find it.

In the story Harry is taught how to pull things out of a portal of pure magic by Remus, pretty sure that it was at Bill and Fluer's wedding and Ginny was there. Also, pretty certain it was a HPGW story.

I have tried google searches, searching all the sites I know, looking through my bookmarks and asking friends and I just can't find it.

Edit: I know the portal is accompanied or created with sparks and that after pulling something out of magic he had to shake the sparks off.


** Something that helps me find stories like this is to try and type out complete sentences you may remember from the story. I got a little embarrassed to keep posting "LF" posts, so tried this method, and it worked for me. For instance, see if you can remember the exact sentence that Remus says to Harry or even the description of the portal.

*** I wish I could but it has been at least 5 years that I have been trying to find it.
