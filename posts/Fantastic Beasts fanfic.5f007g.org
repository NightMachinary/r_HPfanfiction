*** Ugh, they'd be so cute. Imagine Harry telling Newt about that one time he road a thestral, or saved a hippogriff, or fucking squared up with a mountain troll. Newt would be so interested and concerned it would be amazing.

***** I understand it's a common mistake but it's actually 'could/would have' not 'could/would of', despite sounding similar when spoken. Sorry.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

**** This one started out interesting but it's quickly turned into just a weird, confusing mess.

Still reading it, but not enjoying it as much as I was in the beginning.
