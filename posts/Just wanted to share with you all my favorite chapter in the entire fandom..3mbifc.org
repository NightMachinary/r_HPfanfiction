** That fic would be my all-time favorite if it wasn't for that last quarter of the story, I don't know what nonjon was thinking.

*** The last quarter could mean a whole lot or very little. Do you mean everything after[[/spoiler][Earth-That-Was]], the [[/spoiler][Wizards vs Reavers]] bits, or the very last arc after [[/spoiler][Miranda was settled]]?

If you feel there was a noticable drop in quality , I can tell you it was because of a combination of the very strict release schedule he kept the whole way through, and his mother's severe illness he dealt with over the course of his writing. He even noted in A Black Comedy that he couldn't and wouldn't force that kind of schedule on himself.

I however found nothing wrong with the ending. Okay I lied, the [[/spoiler][vanishing cabinents]] were definitely OP but itworked in my opinion. As did [[/spoiler][Frank the ship, Miranda and Reavers being magical, and the Alliance attack and Harry's OP response.]]

I like the whole dang thing to be honest.

**** The Miranda twist was good, but the execution was not. Your first spoiler was just depressing, and the epilogue arc is just not what I was reading the fic for. It was just classic nonjon comedy until they got to Earth, and then it became kind of angsty. But I guess if his mother was ill that explains a lot.

***** The way I see it is that a lot of what nonjon writes is what I would not so eloquently call [[http://41.media.tumblr.com/9a25aafa40c8fd2806ddc7ecadcfc251/tumblr_inline_nrjr5hy7a21qf76o9_500.jpg][Oh, you!]] type humor that is entirely driven by the fact that the characters bug the shit out each other and are kinda dumb some times. Not like idiot ball levels of dumb, but more legitimate lack of education dumb. Just by being themselves and poking each other and saying dumb things they get a laugh out of the audience. And they are some of the best characters I've seen written. They're both true to their canon selves (both universes' characters) and they grow well over time.

The thing about it being categorized by genre is that it's written like a tv serial. It's a space opera which by default is an adventure, but it starts off with humor and changes tone a few times like a show might over several episodes, yet overyall it was alwas a drama. In the end it really pours on the angst bits that you should have seen coming from the very beginning. Much like A Black Comedy, Harry is just trying to find a place in this crazy universe, though unlike ABC, he's lost a lot more of his old life and he's pretty fuckin torn up about it. Early on its glossed over by humor but it comes out more and more as the characters get to know each other and we get to know them.

Over all yes it's funny, but that's just the bait to get you invested in the characters. I wouldn't recommend it specifically as a humor story without stating it's primarily about the drama and character growth.

*** Sorry for offtopic, but I see this fic recommended a lot. I've never watched Firefly so no idea what it is about. Is the fic worth a read for someone like me?

**** This fic is more of a Firefly fanfic than a Harry Potter one, so you need to watch it before you can understand it IMO.

It's only 14 episodes and a movie (Serenity), and it's always been one of my favorite sci-fi shows. It's worth the time investment.

***** I wouldn't say that it's necessary to watch Firefly in order to understand Browncoat, though it definitely helps to have seen it. I first read it about 5-6 years ago without having seen Firefly, or even having much of a concept of what the show was, and still enjoyed it immensely. I've since watched it (mostly because of that fic) and some things make a little more sense in context, but pretty much everything is explained enough to get by.

****** I dunno man. It might be readable, but it's far, far more enjoyable when you have the voices of the characters in your head as you read it, and the fic pretty much spoils the entire show too.

**** Honestly the fic is so true to the characters that you can learn who they are and what they do just as easily reading the fic as you could watching Firefly/Serenty. You'll miss little things obviously and the show and the series is good enough I would recommend watching it anyway. This fic spoils the events of Serenty, but you've probably already had that spoiled here on reddit or elsewhere. I'd say go for it =)

**** It was actually this fanfic that got me to watch Firefly. I went in with no knowledge of what firefly was and came out a huge fan.

** Sonovabitch I've read this one dozens of times but only just now caught this in chapter 20:

#+begin_quote
  Durran felt his wrist vibrating and turned off his watch's silent alarm noticing the time. He suggested, "Why don't we adjourn to the dining room? Alejandro's prepared a veritable feast. I hope you all brought your appetites." Durran stated and turned to lead the group inside.
#+end_quote

It's a scene that immediately follows a feasting of three predators on the sacrificial cow, and immediately precedes the change in tone from awe and wonderment to drama and mystery. Something that I, of all people, should have seen as a subtle reference to Jurassic Park.

Edit: I guess I should read fanfic on 4 hours of sleep in the last 40 hours more often because I'm having Matrix level moments of seeing connections to other media.
