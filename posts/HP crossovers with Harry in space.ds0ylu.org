Pretty much what the title implies. Looking for good crossover fanfiction which features a Harry who's intergalactic. The whole idea of him meandering in the cosmos with his very own spaceship being all mysterious and quirky really got an appeal.

Examples would be fics like TsuDohNim's Havoc side of the force, Mightyfish's Lost magic first contact and nonjon's Browncoat green eyes.

At least those were some of the best I found. Prefer it if he's kinda the only of of his kind. So we're talking character insertion into another fandom rather than a mesh of both. Though I'm open to try that too.


** Oh, I know this one fic. He doesn't have a lot of adventures in it, he only discovers the Room of Requirement can turn into a space ship and flies around the Milky Way for a bit, but it's one of my fave fics ever so I'll link it anyway.

** Not actually a crossover until the sequel, but linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) takes Harry into space. Despite giving their ship a cute name, the story itself is anything but; getting into space and colonising another planet is /hard/. Named characters will die. /Species/ will die. And those who survive will not be unscathed.

Also if you didn't know TsuDohNim's Havoc side of the force has a 50,000 word companion story called The Unsuspecting side of the Force. It's basically the main story from other character POV's and is just as amazing as Havoc.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
