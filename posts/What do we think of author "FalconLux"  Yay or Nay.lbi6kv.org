** I like many of their fics, or at least aspects of their fics.

I don't care for mpreg at all, but shit man, "it puts off normal peope"? Really? Fark off with that nonsense.

And are you asking how you can remove slash from a posted slash story? If so, wow. Seriously, as a gay guy, get over it. I'll happily skim past the loving description of Hermione's breasts for a good fic. It's really not hard.

** I love some of his fics. But I'm a huge fan of Harry/Snape and I write mpreg all the time. I think it's sexy. I definitely don't think of myself as normal.

But also they're very well written and I would enjoy them even if they weren't my favorite pairing.

As far as editing out the most delicious parts. You could download them and edit them with an ebook editor but it would be rather tedious. At least then if/when you reread them those parts wouldn't burn your eyes though. Other than that option I have no idea, I like all smut, straight or slash, so I've never had a desire to edit those bits out.

** My biggest "problem" is that almost all of the stories are marked WIP. I wish more of them were finished.
