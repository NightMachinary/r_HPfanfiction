*** I'm reading that one now, I like it, but Meciel isn't as much fun as Lash. Concept is the same but the tone is different. I ought to specify that the voice doesn't need to be a Denarius, Tom, or even a botched SI or Peggy sue could work.

**** Alright then, I've got a few others.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-
#+end_quote

Both of these have fem!harry. In moratorium, Harry binds the horcrux in the diary to herself and he floats around Harry,invisible to everyone else.

**** Shezza was a fairly new writer when he started Renegade. Finish it (becomes very good by the end), and then its sequel Denarian Knight is better in every way - really great story.

There are further sequels as well.

** I'll humbly submit my own story. Different tone, but there is a voice in Harry's head.

*** The truest joy of a failing memory. I /know/ I've read this, and yet I can't recall the details with any degree of clarity. Back onto the 'to read' pile it goes!
