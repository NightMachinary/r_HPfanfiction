  A trip to Egypt, an attempt to find new purpose for their friend results in Ron and Hermione losing her entirely, and gaining back something new... and something very, very old. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates!)

  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards.

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]] by Amerision is fantastic, if perhaps not quite what you're looking for (that is, fem!Harry features prominently, but isn't the protagonist/PoV).

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

** Can't believe nobody's said [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]] yet.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet.

*** I'll agree to this one. Snape and anyone let alone kid/Harry is not for me BUT making Harriet actually a girl- and really a whole new person while maintaining the Potter-ness was really well done. Also it is a very slow roll where in the realization of her feelings doesn't happen til she is at least near an adult and skips any sort of Snape discovering Dursley treatment first year/taking her under wing etc. So anyway surprisingly recommended.

From author: Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
