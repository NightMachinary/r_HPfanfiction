Lets be honest, canon Harry is a complete idiot. He knows ole' moldywort is after him, yet instead of trying to get powerful- he goes and does a bunch of stupid crap. Seriously its like he TRIES to get himself killed.

So i'm looking for a fic where he actually TRIES and gets powerful (And eventually achieves godlike power). If you can add it (Though its not required) I WOULD like to see some fics that delve into the Dark Arts.

Preferably over 70k words, thank you!

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
