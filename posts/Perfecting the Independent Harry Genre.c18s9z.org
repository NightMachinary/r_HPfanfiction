One of the great tragedies of fanfiction is that so many words get written and yet there's so little to read that's actually good. Nowhere is this more true than the independent Harry genre. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of independent Harry fics. And yet... I don't think the idea has ever really been done particular justice. We're still waiting for the genre-defining story.

So let's say we have decided to write the perfect, genre-defining, indy!Harry fic. How do we go about it?

The key here is I think to identify the elements of this genre that make it appealing and extract the core, good ideas from the terrible tropes that are generally associated with them.

In the comments section I will start us off by commenting on three such core ideas:

1. Harry taking his own path

2. Political Harry

3. Rich Harry

I encourage you to to throw in your own ideas, or tear mine apart. Two key elements that I haven't touched upon yet are:

- Harry's magical development. How powerful will he be? How powerful will he get? How will he get there?

- When should the story start?


** *Political elements*

It is of course a core element of the genre that Harry will get involved in wizarding politics.

In the established corpus, this generally consists of Harry inheriting a bunch of titles and everyone immediately having to do what he says. Not only does this result in a boring lack of conflict, it's basically the complete opposite of what makes politics interesting. Fundamentally, politics is about relationships: building them, maintaining them, and occasionally, when it is in your interest, discarding them.

So how to fix it?

Harry will still inherit a title - this is an indy!Harry fic after all, and the idea is to perfect the genre, not to avoid it. There is something fundamentally appealing about watching Harry navigate an aristocratic high society as a budding member of the elite.

Here's how we save ourselves from the bad tropes:

A. News of the inheritance is not delivered at Gringotts or by goblins.

B. Harry only inherits one title, and it will be a relatively minor one - it is enough to entitle him to a seat at the table, but not much more than that.

C. The title comes with some actually meaningful history behind it which can be used as a vehicle for worldbuilding. As part of that history, it may come with responsibilities as well as privileges.

D. Most importantly, the title only gives Harry certain legal entitlements, it doesn't result in any actual political power.

Politically, Harry is still just a kid. Adults are inclined to ignore him, though they have to tolerate his presence due to his legal entitlement to be present in that circle of government/society. But anything he does say tends to be dismissed because he's a young adult.

Harry will have to build his political power the hard way, like everyone else. He has a step-up by being the Boy Who Lived and having this landed title, but he still has to establish useful relationships.

*** I'd say regarding relationships the C.M. Black series does it well. It doesn't go into a lot of detail because that's not the story focus but it talks about how Lucius knows pretty much everyone in addition to being rich enough to bribe people as needed. I think the a good Indy! Harry story's politics should have Harry unable to get his title for a few years but him be fully aware of it.

So say he gets to inherit at 15, he would know since he's 11 that he's going to inherit. Maybe if people really want his title to be super cool or something have it have lost power because of how long it has been since anyone did anything with it so alliances fell apart, blackmails outdated, stuff like that.

Finally any politics should not be a simple divide between good and evil. linkffn(to reach without) did a good job of this. A few basic things were the “light” wanted more regulation of creatures and Magic's and more rights for muggleborns and muggles while the “dark” wanted the opposite.

*** I like your premise but i think we would need to blend in some of the tropes in a traditional way to how its done. Take this series of events:

- Snape AK's Dumbledore
- Harry duels Draco and has him disarmed and is about to kill him until Snape intervenes
- Dumbledore Funeral
- Called to Headmistresses office where his will is read like how it was in Book 7
- Info given with respect to wealth, titles etc. Elder Wand and Stone is passed to Harry directly
- Battle actually happens on the Train back to Kings Cross

  - Students/Order members running off of the emotion of the fight @ Hogwarts and the funeral actually open up viciously on the Death Eaters
  - Death Eaters go down easier due to shock of their own children fighting back against them.
  - Harry starts Duel with Voldy and wand effect happens
  - Aurors/Order members seeing Voldy wand locked due to brother wand effect fire everything in the book at him leading to the outright destruction of that body
  - Majority of Major DE's captured\\

​

IMO that would set up the most interesting version of political Harry since he wouldn't have the full credit of that victory and we have a decent set of factions at play:

- Ministry
- Order
- Death Eaters (leaderless)
- Dark (Children that rebelled against DE family members)
- Light (non Order)
- Neutrals

​

We also have a state in which the war is effectively over but Voldy can still come back in as a threat and in which there is no credit/power due to being the person that ended the war but Harry is still somewhat respected for going toe to toe with Voldy.

*** Post-Hogwarts political!Harry done well is my fanfiction holy grail.

Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean that everything will be solved. Does the entire ministry from Voldemort's regime guilty? How about the Wizengamot? Will the imperius defense works the second time?

We can see Harry using his public image to enter the political world, we don't even need the Lord Potter and Wizengamot is inherited title trope for this to work. Shows Harry's early failure because he's still naive. Arthur Weasley can be his mentor, use him as a gateway to know a lot of people in the ministry. Don't forget about Ron, Hermione, the remaining Weasleys, and the DA. Each of them can have a different role.

Harry will gain some new allies; Griselda Marchbanks, Tiberius Ogden, Greengrasses, Notts, Malfoys, and many other can be used here. However, he also lose some allies; maybe Ernie Macmillan doesn't agree with how Harry views werewolf, Zacharias Smith can be a new Malfoy, someone who opposes every move Harry takes.

Use the press to his advantage, he already has the experience with Skeeter and the Quibbler in OotP. Use his wealth to gain allies; sposoring a business, 'helping' a family, creating charity, etc. Shows how Harry falls into darkness, no one can be successful in politics without a bribe and blackmail.

** *Rich Harry*

It's of course common in indy!Harry fics for Harry to inherit a fortune which varies from "one of the richest wizards in Britain" to "literally the richest person on the planet".

As with political power, simply gifting Harry ultimate economic power at the start of the story removes conflict and, in most stories, Harry never actually uses this money for anything other than vague allusions to "funding the war effort".

However, similar to political power, there is a kernel of something genuinely interesting here. Harry being an economic major player can be an interesting door into worldbuilding the broader wizarding world, allowing you to expand on the nature of the wizarding economy and thereby detail how normal wizards live their lives. Coming up with varied professions, goods and services to establish a credible and interesting wizarding economy adds weight to the world.

Additionally, there is the Bruce Wayne factor: having the hero use wealth to progress their goals can just be good fun for the reader (and if you are going the "noble title" route, then a certain amount of wealth needs to back that up).

So, how do we fix this story element? Much like we did with political power:

A. Harry is not going to inherit a huge amount of money. As in canon, the Potters will have a decent pile of gold, enough to make Harry comfortably middle class, but he's not filthy rich. Rather, Harry is going to have to build this wealth himself and earn it.

B. Tying in with point C of my Political Elements post, Harry's title will be tied in with land. He won't just be "Lord Potter" (or whatever title you give him)... he will be Lord Potter of [Placename]. The estate which he inherits is in ruins, both physically and financially, and it will be Harry's task to rebuild it - something that will not happen overnight, but which will be an ongoing long term theme of the story.

C. The story will do enough "wizarding economy" worldbuilding to establish good, credible reasons for why economic power is actually relevant and useful in a wizarding conflict. Readers will understand what money can be used for, and there will be good reasons why those things can't just be obtained through the exercise of magical power alone. This worldbuilding will be more detailed, subtle and realistic than simply passing politicians envelopes stuffed with cash.

**** As someone with a econ background and a pretty strong poly econ foundation, I think it's extremely difficult to use money in about interesting way in the harry potter universe. This is mostly because the universe's economy makes little to no sense.

The first major problem comes in what money can actually be used for. We see very few uses for money in the series and honestly the gemino (or whatever the multiplication charm is) makes nearly all of them fairly pointless. With the charm there shouldn't be scarcity, which is the foundation of economics. Even if wizarding goods can't be multiplied for whatever reason, muggle goods should be able to. Which means an infinite supply of anything you can buy or steal in the muggle world for ant wizard. This even applies to land. While land probably can't be multiplied, you can certainly multiply some metal or food (which can be multiplied) and sell it back to muggles for money. Or multiply money. And then buy land. Land should not be a resource that any wizard wants.

So really all that should exist in the economy are some materials (let's say things like dragon heartstrings can't be multiplied for some reason), wizard made goods (robes and wands and stuff), and services (Hogwarts and something? I can think of little else off the top of my head from canon). Then we come across the problem of scale. By Rowling's world building there just aren't enough wizards for a wizard economy to work, especially one in which nations are as insular as they appear in the books. If you take 5 members per gender per house per year over a hundred years that's still only 4000 people. Extend the world and say that with war and stuff half the population died you get 8000. Hell you could multiply by ten and still barely have the economy of a large town. You don't sustain sports leagues with those numbers.

Finally wizards don't need jobs. And magic makes most jobs extraneous.

To actually make a magical economy somewhat functional you'd need to get rid of the multiplication charm, severely restrict transfiguration, increase the wizarding population dramatically, have strict and enforced laws against using muggle resources (especially land), fix the imperio problem (can't have people able to sign away everything when controlled), have some level of wizarding specialization (I guess newts are a start but really you'd want a much bigger range that could be applied internationally), etc. Without these changes I think an interesting story could be told if isolation from muggles is strictly enforced. Then you could have a faction for isolation in the name of not using unfair advantage and a faction that wants to be able to operate in the muggle world, as essentially gods.

***** See, a lot of this is great! Either that, or I'm just a big nerd.

Anyway, I've seen in some fics that only Transfiguration "Masters", ie McGonagall, have the ability to create a permanent Transfiguration, and this is relatively rare among the population. There've also been fics where magical items cannot be duplicated (ie wands, Omnioculars) plus there's the quasi fanon Gamp's Law which you can extrapolate to prevent food from being made from nothing.

Imo, the wizarding population should be much larger -- I like to work off a scale of 30k-40k wizards, which is about the size of a micro nation such as Monaco or Liechtenstein.

****** Yeah I've seen solutions but honestly never felt they were actually sufficient. No permanent transfiguration doesn't really solve the key problem of scarcity. I think a properly done magical economy would make the magical world look dramatically different than the one we see. Really I think we'd see a lot more piracy from muggles and a much more integrated world. I don't think these stories would be interesting though, the logical conclusion to any magical world seems rather harsh and I don't think it really fits in the hp world. I think ignoring economics is really the best way to go outside of severe au.

***** I think you're focusing a bit much on commodities/resources. It's perfectly possible to have an economy without a significant amount of primary industry.

Most wizarding goods are going to be enchanted items, so not capable of easy duplication. And while magic eliminates the need for lots of low-skill non-magical services, wizarding services are going to be in high demand. And you will still have a decent amount of primary industry in the form of magical creatures/plants.

So I think there's plenty of scarcity /of the things that wizards demand/. It's just that they demand different things to Muggles.

Aside from the fact that there probably can't be that many specializations you also can't expect everyone to be able to take skilled jobs.

********** The problem is most of your careers are skilled and many are illogical in the first place (leaving aside the fact that they exist in canon). The only non skilled choices you've suggested are essentially in retail which cannot cover the entire unskilled population. Not only does magic eliminate the need for a lot of retail positions, compounding the nonsense of a retail based society is the fact that most spending should be on big ticket items. Magic eliminates most common spending (all needs can be easily met) and anything easily created and from that we get that any relevant spending would be in essentially luxury goods. And that's made worse by the main problem of population. The low population of the magical world means that there shouldn't really be business to sustain most of these stores - a wide variety of businesses shouldn't really exist. This also goes for things like sports leagues and the bureaucracy of the ministry. Even with a dramatically expanded population (which you need to justify things like a single newspaper) you still have issues - you need more unskilled jobs, more industries. You can assign a generous 20-25% to the public sector but after that you really just don't have slots to fill.

*********** And?

The Wizarding Economy is fundamentally different than the non-magical one. I don't think we necessarily need to have "unskilled" labor, or at least where we do it isn't required to be exactly the same, since magical ability seems only related to intelligence in terms of breadth and speed of learning. As an example, consider Crabbe. He's canonically a dumb brute, but he is seen to be able to cast spells including Fiendfyre and other dark spells without any major difficulties.

Particularly since in general, as you said, many positions which would be "unskilled" in the non-magical world are irrelevant in the skilled world. That means that most people only barely have to work for a living. That fundamentally changes the nature of how we need to look at work. Unskilled labor might not be as prominent, but it's also much less necessary for society to function. That means there's a lot more freedom for people to work in professions they enjoy rather than professions that they need to work in.

I don't know what you are referring to as careers that are "illogical", because they seem pretty logical to me. And in regards to population---first, JK Rowling is not good at math and contradicts herself wrt population; second, wrt the newspaper, I recall my high school had a student-run newspaper, and they were far less population than even conservative estimates of the magical British population.

That's literally the point, the economy would be fundamentally different so you can't just fit in things and say that magically equivalent careers exist. You need unskilled positions because unskilled people will inevitably exist. Either you have no place for them in society or you find work for them. Crabbe even backs that up - he may be able to cast spells but he literally dies to them because he can't control them.

Yes that population problem is literally the point. It makes supporting industries like sports insane. But even if you fix it, you still have the problem of essentially having a top down economy with no use for a large percentage of the population.

Not really? The economy works inherently differently. Everything that goes for a ministry worker goes for a Quidditch player or a newspaper editor as well. I can't say whether the Prophet was sponsored or not, but it certainly didn't need to provide a living for its staff in the same way a modern newspaper would.

I agree that if there is the same proportion of unqualifiable laborers, you'll need unskilled labor jobs to avoid unrest---but it's not clear whether that's true or not. This economy has been in this semi-post-scarcity mode long enough that it's really post-post-scarcity. It's entirely plausible that unqualified people have caused unrest in the past and gotten themselves killed in the process, removing them from the gene pool. Or done a Crabbe and gotten themselves killed with dangerous magic. Combine that with the general importance of learning to any good magic user, and I'd be surprised if there were too many people like Crabbe or Goyle out there at all.

There are also likely a few jobs that only require mastery of a spell or two or other non-skilled work to handle the outliers. I couldn't say what they are without having more detail about e.g. how magical items are made, though---how do you make a broomstick or any other item? Is it a single set of spells? Runes?

***** The wizarding economy is almost entirely a service economy. While all wizards get the same basic education, they all have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Lockhart is at best average at most things, but he's a genius with memory charms. Or else they've spent years honing their abilities with a particular set of skills - maybe anyone can get hold of as much ice cream as they want, but if they want amazing ice cream, they've got to go to Florean Fortescue, who has mastered the arts of perfecting it. Meanwhile, most adults can't reliably cast a basic shield charm. Most wizards are specialists, not generalists.

Wizards have different/greater needs to Muggles, because they need the special magical version of most products. How many people today make their living based purely on the internet or mobile phones, even though those were almost unknown 50 years ago? Clearly we can get by without them, but they're still considered basic needs today. In the same way, magical goods and services are basic needs to wizards, even though they could easily live with only the muggle versions.

The only major plothole is wizard/Muggle exchange. Perhaps there's severe limits on how much Muggle currency you can exchange for Galleons; or maybe the ISS criminalises any large-scale meddling in the Muggle economy.

***** While I agree with your ideas on the power presented by duplication charms and transfiguration, there is a core fact that makes both of these much less powerful: impermanence.

In most HP Fanfictions (I believe this also includes canon), transfigurations, duplications, and conjurations are generally described as temporary, and usually are very limited in their application (i.e. do not retain magical properties). In the Powerful!Harry trope, he sometimes finds a way to make it permanent, but as he is the only one who can, the economy hasn't broken down before he comes up with a way to do this.

****** In canon there's no hint of impermanence. But even if you take that, there's still the problem of being able to take basically everything from the muggle world. Or, if for some reason you have the statue of secrecy enforced unrealistically well, to still get anything you really need through magic. I could see an economy based on secretive guilds or family secrets, but even that would still require quite a bit of world changing. Basically outside of wands and potion stuff everything we see is only enchanted to be different. And enchanting doesn't have a non educational barrier to entry.

People don't want kids in a war usually as well as the death and after wars isn't there usually some sort of boom?

** *Harry taking his own path*

Obviously, to have an independent Harry, he cannot be entirely in Dumbledore's camp. Nor can he switch over to Voldemort's camp. He must establish his own position.

The main tropes to avoid here are:

A. Cartoonish, overly-simplistic Dumbledore characterisation.

B. Giving Harry a complete character transplant (which includes having him completely abandon all his current friends and adopt an entirely new friendship group).

How to go about this, then?

Obviously, a wedge needs to be driven between Harry and Dumbledore. I think there are plenty of ways to do this without completely ruining Dumbledore's character or making him into an absurd villain who is going around arranging for Harry's death, bribing his friends and stealing his money.

Dumbledore by his own admission has made certain mistakes with Harry. There are also a number of issues they simply do not see eye to eye on, like Snape. And of course you can easily introduce philosophical differences between them.

The key here is to introduce complications into Harry and Dumbledore's relationship, such that they still must occasionally work together, but are not exactly on the same side.

On the flip side, some work also has to be done on Voldemort's side of the camp to make his position a bit deeper and more philosophically sound than a racial genocide project. Purebloods need to have some genuine grievances which Harry can develop some sympathy for as he learns more about that side of society. Harry's "third way" should be winning supporters from both Voldemort and Dumbledore's camp.

With respect to friendships, while it's a staple of the genre that Harry develops new friends from the "high society" side of things, I think it's been a consistent error to have those new friends replace his old friendships, rather than develop alongside them. Harry's dynamic with Ron and Hermione is a rich one which is a waste to throw away. Just see Forging the Sword for inspiration on that front - Harry, Ron and Hermione engaging in an Independent!Harry project in a collaborative manner can be a recipe for awesome. Further, giving Harry two friendship circles is also an opportunity to compare and contrast different ideas and lifestyles, with all sorts of fun tension to be explored between the two circles.

*** I don't think changing canon Dumbledore or adding a major conflict between him and Harry is absolutely necessary. Harry could simply lose blind trust in him after the revelations at the end of the OoTP and decide to act on his own since it's what he's done all his life. Then Dumbledore might not approve of Harry making major decisions without consulting with him first, because Dumbledore is a control freak despite his good intentions and Harry is still a kid who spent the first decade of his life in a cupboard, so Dumbledore has valid reasons to be doubtful. They can still have a clash of personalities even while working towards the same goals.

*** Yes, Harry should never throw in his lot with his parents's murderers. Canon Voldemort is also a terrible boss who gets dumped by most followers after suffering a major setback. A truly intelligent and independent Harry will never subject himself to a piece of shit like that.

The relationship with Dumbledore is going to be complicated. Harry needs to remain on good terms with him because in the grand scheme of things, Voldemort and Death Eaters are the true enemies. Harry also needs a lot of time and resources to get strong. 16 years beating Voldemort in a fair duel is bad teenager power wank.

The Trio friendship should remain a central theme, Hermione and the Weasleys are obviously trustworthy and powerful allies. But Indy!Harry will of course need a lot more support. JKR has created quite a few characters with interesting backgrounds, but they remain horribly underutilized. Every major player should have their moments and make meaningful contributions.

*** Maybe have Dumbledore be a great man yes but not a good one. Him being willing to sacrifice Harry not because he's evil but because whats one life compared to thousands. I brought up To Reach Without earlier and I remember Dumbledore was leader of the light but he was a true neutral so a ton of policies that aren't really good get passed because dumbledore is way too willing to give ground. Have Dumbledore be in a similar situation at the beginning of his career so maybe the fact that he was never prepared for politics(his family not having a title to inherit) so he accepts his position thinking it's what he'd support but by the time he realizes it isn't, he's already firmly entrenched in his position.

This would give an opening for Dumbledore to actually help Harry by giving him advice perhaps telling him how hard it was for him when he became a political power so he would want Harry to make his own way and Harry would disagree with Dumbledore on some policies which is where his own path would come into play.

Basically have Dumbledore be somewhere between ally and rival but the rivalry doesn't need to be a bitter one like Lucius vs Dumbledore.

Post-OotP is the classic, but I wonder if post-Hogwarts might be an interesting angle - it would eliminate some of the inherent absurdity of political teenagers, would permit more adult themes and tone, and gives the characters greater freedom.

*** IMO a really AU fic should start roughly at the same point as canon or earlier. This enables an essentially OC!Harry, allowing the writer to build up the character from the ground up (i.e. personality, friend groups, etc.)

I understand that the AU could follow canon until whatever time, but this puts constraints on original ideas as you are essentially forcing yourself to avoid contradicting the original story, while in entirely AU fics you can form the foundations for whatever you want Harry to become in the future.

This does not mean, however, that lordships, politics, and real "independence" should be rushed from the beginning, as like OP said is a common trope that is really unrealistic. It just enables groundwork to be built so that whatever lord!Harry or independent!Harry becomes is credible in the context of the story.

The amount of personal, magical power they posses is really crippling to any meaningful political discourse.

In OotP Dumbledore claims, that he used his position as headmaster to build an army of child-soldiers to overthrow the minister. He can do that, because even though he is outnumbered 5:1 (Fudge, Umbridge, Dawlish, Percy, (Kingsley)), there is no way he can actually be captured and held accountable for his actions.

The older and more competent Harry is, the harder it is to limit his agency. (Rowling herself struggled with this a bit in book 6, which is why some complain he seemed aimless and weak.) I wonder if that's why early year fics tend to be a more reliable bet --- the author is given plot cues from the books, and obvious constraints on Harry's influence / ability.

** I'd prefer a post-Hogwarts indy!Harry fic, where everybody wants a piece of him after the war, but he learns to stand on his own two legs and play the game.

But it can easily work with post-OoTP or even GoF if the fic doesn't tread same old tropes.

Harry can be given a title (let's limit the number to one), but it doesn't mean it would suddenly give him any type of actual influence over the Ministry and Wizengamot. The Gaunt were legitimate descendants of Salazar Slytherin and the Peverells, and they lived in a shack. Harry could use his title and goodwill as the Boy Who Lived, but he should work hard for people to take him seriously.

If Harry is given a lot of money, I'd like to see him actually using it for things other than a multi-compartment trunk and robes from acromantula silk. Maybe he could invest it into businesses of Muggleborns/creatures and build his support this way. Or bribe his way up. Or set up his own newspaper to compete with the Prophet on the ideological battleground.

Independent Harry fics are often wish-fulfilment fantasies, so Harry becomes a Mary Sue, in the sense that the world warps around him. In a good indy fic, Harry should struggle with his goals, and all the other characters shouldn't be treated depending on whether they are his friends or foes. They should have their own motivations. Adults would try to use this green kid who decided he is an ace politician, and Harry should make mistakes before he learns better. His adult allies should have to need convincing and they should play a major part in the story.

As for OP!Harry, I personally prefer that he wouldn't. My ideal indy!Harry fic would be about canon Harry trying to make the most of the resources available. And the more political the story is, the less emphasis on raw power and super special abilities should there be. It's just not satisfying to read about cunning plots only for Harry to show up on a dragon he's bonded to and burn all his enemies to the ground.

- First Harry needs to generate the wealth to start the paper.

- Harry has no experience running a newspaper, so he needs to persuade an experienced, talented managing editor to drop their job and come work for a kid at a completely unknown publication. So this requires careful relationship building.

- The aim of the paper is propaganda, requiring Harry to articulate a clear political position which will attract the key people he wants to attract - which involves him first interacting with political stakeholders to identify their desires and figure out if he can deliver on them in a way that is compatible with his own goals.

- Once the paper is up and running, he needs to protect it from aggressive commercial competition and legal challenges designed to bankrupt them before they get off the ground (e.g. Lucius buries them in expensive defamation lawsuits).

The biggest issue with Rich and/or Political paths is that Harry's patents and grandparents had the same or likely even more resources and still they were losing the war.

** One idea that is almost never used but could make a really great independent Harry story is the DA. Rename it so it's not called Dumbledore's army and start training for war. Create a full student militia and start his own fight against Voldemort. It's not in Harry's canon character to do something like that, but you could always make a few changes.

This would obviously be best after OotP. Let's say Sirius leaves Harry some memories or information which hardens his resolve to pick up the fight himself. I guess you could throw in the emancipation trope just to make sure he inherits a title too. He could still align with Dumbledore, but work independently, just for the same goals. I can't see Dumbledore easily approving of a student militia though, so a lack of cooperation at the start would be expected, until either the militia starts to prove its worth, or there is an attack over Christmas or something against a bunch of students which causes Dumbledore to realise they need all the training they can get to survive.

As this could massively strengthen Harry's side, to keep it fair, you need a smart Voldemort with some creative death eaters. Maybe Malfoy has a mission to infiltrate it in some way. It would be believable. I would keep the wizengamot out of it for the most part. If necessary to keep Harry involved in politics, maybe just have him gain the minister's help in some way. Politics often gets out of hand when used in fanfictions, and Harry ends up with some ridiculous wizengamot majority coalition which makes everything boring.

For this, Harry doesn't necessarily need to be the strongest wizard - super Harry gets old - but maybe the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not is the power of leadership? It would be a nice change from Harry killing all the death eaters singlehandedly without breaking a sweat.

As for money - Sirius could leave him a bunch and that's all he'll ever need. He could use it to outfit his militia with battle armour, spare wands, and other things useful in a fight, like broomsticks. It makes no sense when he has a ton of money and just doesn't use it for anything but bribing people or a ring for whatever girlfriend he has.

As for a pairing, a lot of things could work (just don't let it be a harem). I don't really like Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny, but both could work fairly well. I feel like his partner would have to be someone in the DA, so it could be someone very lightly touched upon in canon, like Susan. But personally, I feel like as the leader of a militia, he'll be under a lot of stress, and he'd need someone to keep his life a bit lighthearted. So I think Harry/Luna could work.

Well that was a bit longer than I expected, but let me know what you think. I haven't actually written anything before, but I would like to try, so maybe I should give this a shot sometime?

I wouldn't classify it as an independent Harry fic though, unless you count the leave me alone to do my thing as being independent, but it does take those core ideas and do something different.

Politically, young people often try out different political stances and ideas, and it would be fun to see Harry or other characters being( or having a phase of) young left wing radicals, or libertarians or the wizarding equivalents.

** I'm probably going to get a HUGE backlash for this, but... I think the Independent!Harry genre is inherently flawed.

Problem with most "independent Harry" stories is that they're just poorly-hidden power fantasies. Unless you identify with Harry and see his situation as a wish fulfiillment (which I don't), most of these stories don't have a whole lot to engage...

It also doesn't help that Independent!Harry tend to be pretty insufferable. Either he's a total douchebag who slings insults and throws his weight around by treating others like crap, or he's a ponmpous and overbearing snot whom the author thinks is a brilliant political manipulator because he doesn't use contractions and adresses people with grandiose titles while blatantly undermining and using them. And yet, SOMEHOW, he's admired and respected the hell out of.

Let's be honest. Boy Who Lived or not, if a snot-nosed teenager who hadn't even finished his basic education came into an adult society and becan treating people more than twice his age like that, he'd be viewed as an insubordinate child. He'd be a laughingstock at best, and despised at worst. Even if he had some sort of power so that people would be polite to his face, they'd more likely talk trash about him behind his back and he'd find that people would be reluctant to make alliances or even listen to him.

So what would I do to "perfect" the Independent!Harry genre? Hmm.

Well, I have a COUPLE of ideas that might help.

1: Set it AFTER Harry's Hogwarts years. Either just start the fic after the Battle of Hogwarts, or make it an AU where the war and confrontation with Voldemort doesn't happen until Harry is an adult. A Harry who is of age, has finished school and maybe even has a job is a lot easier to accept as truly independent. Not to mention, it'll be a lot less jarring that other adults take him seriously if he is also an adult. If he isn't of age then he can't be independent in the eyes of society.

2: If you really want an independent!Harry who's still at Hogwarts, then make people's reactions to him more realistic. Say he's a loner who just goes his own way; have people treat him as such. Students leave him alone, teachers are exasperated, adults either patronize him or think he's an uppity snot.

3: If you don't know anything about politics, then don't try to write about Harry as a master political manipulator. It never works.

4: At least do some research on how titles and nobility works before inserting them in your story... and if you want the wizarding world to follow different rules, then establish those rules as separate, and think them through before writing them.

It's common to have Harry as "Lord Potter-Black" because Sirius named him his heir, but the thing is... you can't name an heir for a title. If Sirius was an actual lord (which there is not evidence he was, but IF), then that title could ONLY pass to his biological son. He had no right to bestow the title on Harry... he could give him his things, his money, his house and lands, but not his title. And Harry being distantly related to the Blacks wouldn't change this... even Harry getting adopted by Sirius would not mean he inherited the title.

You can of course handwave this by saying that "wizards do it differently," but most of these fics where Harry becomes a Lord has no real thought put into them. If, let's say, wizards bestowed titles based on someone's accomplishments, that could work... say for example that Harry finds out he technically gets the "Lord" title because he defeated Voldemort.

Of course, that'd mean Dumbledore's a Lord too, for defeating Grindelwald... but if you don't want to deal with that you could always say that Dumbledore renounced his title or something... Or you could just have the "Lord" title be more common. Could be interesting to have Gilderoy Lockhart as a Lord thanks to his accomplishments, and then he gets stripped of the title when it's discovered he's a fraud...

Okay, now I'm just talking about titles, but this could make an interesting AU set-up. At least it'd be more interesting than the author just thinking Harry could inherit a title from Sirius. Plus, hey, if the title was merit-based it WOULD make Harry more independent since he got the title because of something he did, or at least something he's been credited with, and not just because someone gave him a title he wasn't born with and did nothing to earn.

All in all, I think Independent!Harry fics work best in fics that are very clear AUs. And not just of minor AUs of the "Harry gets sorted into Slytherin" types either... more like AUs where wizarding society is either slightly different or very different from canon.

** You forgot the Family Magics, a classic of the genre.

I wonder how one could get this right.

** I despise the lordship trope.

My idea is that Voldemort around when Harry graduates. It's symbolic of about 17 years from the attack to wizarding adulthood.

Harry is an adult with a nice nest egg from his inheritance, but he has to work.

I can see clashes with Dumbledore as Harry, annoyed with decisions made about him without his input, splinters off.

I'd try having a smarter than canon Harry however. Harry when he starts should be able to challenge any death eater and be rapidly gaining ground on Voldemort and Dumbledore, as Voldemort started his campaign of terror in his 40s.

Getting Harry into politics would be interesting, but is often unnecessary. Politics is an old man's game.
