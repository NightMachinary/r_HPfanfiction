I have not read much next gen stuff but every thing I have read either focuses on Albus/Rose/Scorpius or occasionally James. I would really like stories where Lily is the protagonist. I'm looking for stories where she is a prankster or Quidditch star or caught up in an adventure or something not just a romance story.

  Lily Potter, Harry and Ginny's youngest child, heads off to her first year at Hogwarts, hopes of a future of love and ambition at hand. But more than just school, boys, and the trials of growing up will challenge her: A lost mystery has stirred from a long rest in the years since Voldemort's final defeat - and evil abhors a vacuum. Hogwarts again will be a magnet for trouble.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  James Potter and Scorpius Malfoy are enemies, everyone knows that. So when a Malfoy is put in Gryffindor, sparks soon fly. But with dark magic rising, the Malfoy family in trouble, and the Muggle and Magical worlds set to collide, old rivalries may have to be forgotten. Various pairings. Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone.

**** yeah I stumbled upon your post searching for the same thing. I didn't realize it was posted two months ago until I had already commented. :P

EDIT I forgot to mention in my original comment that Lily is portrayed to be a bit of a Mary-Sue in this story but it's something I can look past, but I guess not everyone can.
