Creations of talented brothers or gifts/curses from the personification of death himself. Individual objects or parts of a set that give ultimate power. Deus ex Machina, or normal tools. Overpowered artifacts or unique enchantments.

There are a lot of different interpretations of the Hallows in fanfiction what are some of your favorites?

Elder Wand

I like the idea that just like some wands are "suited to Transfiguration" the Elder wand is suited to killing. It doesn't have godly powers, it's just better at some things the same way other wands are better at charms.

Or, it is overpowered and just makes every spell it casts stronger.

Or it actively helps its user the way Harry's Holly wand did during the Seven Potters battle, using its experience from generations of wielders to help it's current master.

Resurrection Stone

I am pretty happy with canon on this one, that it brings back inteloigent shades of the dead. I have seen the idea that it gives some level of power over the dead and can be used for classical Necromancy, eg gaining knowledge from the dead.

Cloak of Invisibility

I think that the cloak deserves a bit of a power boost. I like when it makes the user completely undetectable to any magic, as well as being spell, wear, and tear resistant.

The Set

I like the interpretation where the Hallows are in fact from Death, and are cursed. The wand protects in fights but attracts death through treachery. The stone convinces its users to commit suicide, either through a desire to be with loved ones or from a curiosity to know what's on the other side. The third brother is described as having hidden from death until old age, when he greets him as an old friend. I think that implies familiarity. The curse of the cloak is one of vengeance rather than causing death directly. The users of the cloak bring death down upon the ones around them and are forced into situations where they have to kill to survive, as well as near death experiences. Making them very familiar with death.


** I have generally preferred Dumbledore's view, that the whole Death thing was simply a fairy tale. The brothers Peverell were simply supremely gifted artificers, and each created their artefacts themselves.

Also that the Veil of Death was one of Cadmus' early experiments with accessing the plane of the dead.

Meanwhile, my personal theory about the Master of Death theory was that it was a prophecy about the man who would do it, rather than a mantle he receives. Harry united the Hallows because he was the MoD, he didn't become the MoD by uniting them.

*** I like that concept of the Veil of Death as well as the prophecy regarding the Master of Death. Both very good interpetations.

I enjoy both fairy tale and accurate history versions of the Tale of Three Brothers as long as they are well written.

** I have started to think of the Deathly Hallows as Love. In the book it says the the master of the Hallows become the conqueror of death. The Elder Wand is the the most powerful weapon, and there is nothing more powerful than love. The Resurrection Stone can bring back loved ones, or more realistically represents the memory of the ones we have loved and lost but carry with us forever. And the Invisibility Cloak, is something you can shield yourself with to protect you from danger. If you surround yourself with those that you love and that love you, you protect yourself from the dangers of our world. So the Deathly Hallows all refer back to Dumbledore's great weapon of all time, love.

*** That seems kind of... loose.

**** About as loose as the whole â€˜love is the ultimate power he knows not'. I mean, it's a nice thought but there isn't really any power behind it.

** I like the interpretation that the wand and stone corrupt the owner into wanting death on a (not so) subtle level. The stone is pretty obvious, but I think that it merely projects memories from a person rather than skype with the dead. The wand also kills, but that's mostly through hubris. Yet a supposedly powerful wand gives you confidence and calm therefore making you a better duelist through its reputation alone. Eventually, you pass a breaking point and end up dead due to your own increasingly aggressive tendencies and overconfidence.
