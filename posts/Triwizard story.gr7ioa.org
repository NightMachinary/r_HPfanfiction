Triwizard story where Neville is chosen and I believe he is paired with Cho and Harry with Fleur, can't remember if it was finished or even that good but I enjoyed it at the time and can't find it anymore.


** I think the story you are looking for is Harry Potter and a Very Different Goblet of Fire by Mionefan

It used to be on ffn but i think it's only available on hpfanficarchive

#+begin_quote
  A what if AU story where too many people meddle with the Goblet of Fire with surprising results. Neville is selected instead of Cedric and Harry is Fleur's hostage to rescue. Dark Dumbledore. Rated M for a reason!
