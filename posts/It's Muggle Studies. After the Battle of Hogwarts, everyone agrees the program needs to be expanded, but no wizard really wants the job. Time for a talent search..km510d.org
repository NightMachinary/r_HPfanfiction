  (Sequel to Petunia's Invitation) Evanses, Dursleys, Weasleys, Potters... All these families, past and present, and all of them a source of some strife or another. Petunia doesn't seem to be able to disentangle herself from any of them.

#+begin_quote
  When their muggle studies professor retires, Hogwarts decides to try something they've never done before: hire a muggle to teach muggle studies. Katie Harris is a muggle fresh out of school and looking for a job - any job. When she applies to teach at Hogwarts, she has no idea what she's getting herself into. But maybe, just maybe, it'll be the best decision she's ever made.

** Arthur was eager enough to do it, but it was soon decided that nobody in their right mind should let him anywhere /near/ anything muggle if you wanted it to remain in one piece. Harry was knowledgable and a good teacher, but prefered to be a Auror. Hermione had a tendency to assume such alien things as common sense, logic, and a certain amount of knowledge from her students, so she wasn't a great succes either.

Pt. 2 will detail who is going to teach em

** I'm picturing this kind of like Around the World in 80 Days meets My Fair Lady.

A bunch of teams of two, each made up of one isolated Pureblood and one possible Mug-Stud teacher. They've got to get around the planet and complete a vaguely-clued scavenger hunt (with clues relying on muggle knowledge to be interpreted properly), then get back with all the right items and knowledge to win. The Pureblood has to make all the decisions, and all the teacher can do is vaguely advise.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?
