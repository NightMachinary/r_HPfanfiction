I'm fine with Hermione being a total badass heroine, but could someone recommend some Hermione romance where when she gets hurt/threatened/tortured people lose their shit? I feel like everything I've read lately Hermione either doesn't ever get in dangerous positions or it's totally brushed off.

Hermione/any male pairing, tho I'm not feeling Draco or Snape lately.

Thank you!!!


** There's actually a LOT of fanfics where Hermione is weak, tortured or abused... but they're usually pairings with Death Eaters or Tom Riddle. Frankly, I can't stomach a lot of them and I pretty much read them while going through some bad times. If you insist, just look for Bellamione or Tomione fics, you'll find a lot of this kind of shit.

For something a bit better, there's an ongoing fic called World Changer, with a dimension-travelling Harry meeting a subdued and meek Hermione, but she steadily gains confidence in herself.

Ugh, I couldn't read that. That fic has a giant asshole Harry, who is deluding himself that he is being noble. It really makes my bile rise. "Yeah, Hermione will be much safer if I pursue her, put her into the spotlight and I'm sure she would want to have a glamorous life at the expense of everyone else".

It's very obvious that the author usually writes Dramione and Tomione fics. Abusive and unhealthy relationship all the way.

**** You are right about Harry's flaws, but if you read the last chapter you'll see that he realises that himself. He didn't acknowledge Hermione as her own person with ambitions and goals that might contradict his own. He was bitter about the losses his heroism led him to in the previous life and wanted to be self-centered. But I'm appreciating the fic much more now that he has to deal with the fallout, without Hermione simply succumbing to him because of his dark charisma. I think it's one of the most interesting stories going on right now.

I'm not surprised. The author deleted the reviews of people telling her (?) that Harry is a huge cunt.

In any case, the starting motivation was that he wanted to save Hermione, yet everything he did was for his own sake and put her in danger. Just stick to writing Draco fics? It's an absolute joke that this is supposed to be the selfless canon Harry, no matter how bitter over the events of the war.

I think it's just dumb. Harry is both an idiot and an asshole. I managed to read up until the point when Harry was surprised that the Death Eaters were the actual bad guys and not just playing dress up. *He doesn't need to learn this lesson, he already know this!* This is Draco in a Harry skin. It's literally taking the most annoying cliche elements of a Dramione fic and putting it into Hr/H. There's a good reason I don't read Dramione anymore unless it comes highly recommended. "Oh gee, are we the baddies?!" [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU]]

and

In those fics, Hermione is smart, but always needs rescuing by Harry. No idea why you would want that, because usually intelligence=power - in particular when an equalizer like Magic is involved - but there you go.

** In relation to this, I'm still looking for this story which might have been part of a plot bunny bin storage which is why it is so hard to find. Hermione marries a muggle who is as intelligent as she is and is happy. She's working in the magical world, her husband's working in the muggle world. They respect and accept each other even if they're from different worlds. She's secure because she doesn't feel the need to constantly "prove" herself, which she thinks would happen if she had married a wizard. It was a one shot and written drabble style.
