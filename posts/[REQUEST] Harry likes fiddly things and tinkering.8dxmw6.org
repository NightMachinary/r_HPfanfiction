  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

** linkffn(6466185) Harry the Hufflepuff is a bit like this--Harry is described as inordinately lazy, so he's always making little gadgets to do his work for him. The example that first comes to mind is that he figures out how to splice together a dictaquill, a auto-correcting quill, and a self-inking quill and then starts selling them to the other students.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

Oh, God, I wish!

The only [decent] Worm/HP fic I know is linkffn(12671206), and that's just "HP in Worm", although complexified by being in some ways a sequel to his series of fics wherein HP is kinda immortal

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

** linkffn(5077573) is /somewhat/ what you want. He invents things using runes to make the fight against Voldemort easier. There aren't really many scenes where he's tinkering in his shop but there is a little of that.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
