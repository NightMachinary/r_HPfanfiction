I know there's some fics where Florean helps show Harry some of the basics of the wizarding world (or at least the Alley), but there was one where he was more mysterious about it, and even Augusta Longbottom - if I remember right - was wary of him or his interactions with Harry. This sound at all familiar to anyone?
