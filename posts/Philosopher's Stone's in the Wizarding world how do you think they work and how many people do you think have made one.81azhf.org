How do you think Philosopher's Stones in the wizarding world makes you immortal:

does it make a potion that stops your ageing or does it they allow you to make Panacea the Cure all that can cure even ageing?

do you have to keep Drinking the elixir made using the stone or do you have to take the elixir/Panacea once and then you have eternal youth forever?

has only Nicolas Flamel manage to make a Philosopher's Stone or has he been the only one to tell the world that he has made one and the rest of the people who have made one since have kept there mouth shut about having one?


** Well it's not something you take once and live forever as Dumbledore said that the Flamels' have chosen to die by destroying the story. So it probably creates a potion you have to take every so often

*** Depending on how long the Famels had to live after destroying the stone he could have made another one and thats not even taking into account that he probably had multiple stones after all I doubt he stopped at creating one. He probably made multiple to perfect making them. I would guess he made at least two with the second one being made rather quickly after the first to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

**** I always assumed Dumbledore was just bullshitting Harry or Flamel was bullshitting Dumbledore. Or maybe 600+ years was enough and the Flamels just became jaded with life.

** Unfortunately I can't remember which fic, but a particularly interesting permutation was a Stone which, when meditated upon, allowed you insight into how the Universe works at the cost of your eroding sanity. The longer you look, the more you are able to do, but the crazier you become.

I personally think of the Stone as a "unique item" like the Veil or the Hallows. I think such items were created in a moment of epiphany which is what allows them to transcend the usual bounds of magic. I also think of the Stone as keeping the user from ageing or having their health naturally decline rather than preventing death i.e. the Flamels could be assassinated but won't die of cancer.

In actual historical alchemy, the creation of the Stone is intricately entwined with the refinement of the soul. I personally think there might be something to this, as JKR is known to have read up on Alchemy beforehand and included alchemical imagery throughout the entire series. Perhaps the Horcrux is the Stone's dark reflection?

** SuperCarlinBrothers theorizes that the Stone requires a phoenix to make, given how they are both immortal and have red and gold feathers, and the stone is red and produces gold.
