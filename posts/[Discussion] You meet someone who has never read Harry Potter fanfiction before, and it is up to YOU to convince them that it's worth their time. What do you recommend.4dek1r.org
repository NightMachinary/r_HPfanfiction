Assume that they're willing to give you two shots. Two fics of any lengths that they'll read all the way through. Your goal is to make them want to read more. Also, assume that they haven't tried any fics before, which means that it's safe to recommend work that might be less original, but enjoyable.

Oh, and you just met them, so you can't tailor your recommendations to their personality.

What would you give them, and why?

*** I gave the same answer in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3rckk0/help_me_interest_my_coworker_in_fanfiction/][similar thread]] last year . . . but I've come to think it's best appreciated in the context of other trends in the fandom, i.e., the tendency to romanticize the post-war period as a time of peace and plenty, or the opposite tendency to ratchet the angst and woe up to 11. /Cauterize/ occupies a fairly uncommon middle ground, depicting characters deeply damaged by the war, but not utterly consumed by that damage; characters who are in need of healing and catharsis, but are able to confront that need and address it. Perhaps it has power just in the context of the epilogue and "all was well," but it is responding just as much to the other side of the coin.

** Choosing two make or break fics is tough. Definitely a fic that either picks up where the books left off, covers what they left out, or views canon from another character's perspective. Something like linkffn(The First Day), linkffn(Not From Others), linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince). I know that the only reason I got into fanfiction was because I just wanted MORE. So stories that are decently canon-compliant and just expanded on the series were what I started out with.\\
Or if they have issues with certain character deaths (like me!), something like linkffn(A Little More Time)

*** I'm utterly gobsmacked that somebody else recommended "A Little More Time!". That was my first foray into fanfiction many years ago and I was going to put it down before I saw your comment. It built upon the world I already knew, managed to tie things up nicely while connecting it to canon and after reading many time travel AUs, dealt wonderfully with people being thrown forward in time. I actually prefer such fanfics that don't touch the main canon and but either pick up where it leaves off or explores other characters off screen for a first timer.

** I hate to say this (because my personal opinions are not far from the general consensus on this subreddit), but I might have to go with /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/---it has, if nothing else, a proven broad crossover appeal and enough coverage in external media to legitimize it as respectable reading. I can't count the number of friends not inclined to fandom who brought the story up to me in real life, to recommend it or trade theories or otherwise get my opinion. (And it's not like looking back after long years and thinking /I liked that?!/ isn't an essential rite of passage in the fanfic community.)

Otherwise? Probably /The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks/---it's a poignant, canon-compatible mystery that wraps up in under 40,000 words. Long enough to get sucked in; not long enough to drown in bloat.

**** I /know/!! :-) But my friend isn't really even into fanfiction in general, and the Alexandra Quick series is not only the best fanfiction ever written, it's also one of the farthest from canon that exists. So perhaps I recced correctly.

** I'm partial to linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday). It's canon compliant(a big plus for someone just starting in on fanfiction), humorous, decently written, and all around fun to read. It's actually what I do tend to point people at when introducing them to fanfic.

Honestly, there is almost no circumstance I can imagine that I would recommend a fic knowing nothing about the reader, and my recommendations would depend heavily on that.

Hermione fan? linkffn(The Arithmancer).

Liked Ender's Game? linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

Want more of the Weasely family, or to see canon from another viewpoint? linkffn(Untold Weasely tales)

Want to know how the story might have gone if Harry was a family member instead of a freak? linkffn(A Better Man by Valandar)

Want the Maurader's era? linkffn(The Teachers' Notebook)

Really hate Ron? linkffn(The Champion's Champion)

Want to go back to WWII to prevent Voldemort from ever happening? linkffn(Altered Destinies by Dobbyelflord)

What people like all comes down to like. Some people hate the sappy stuff, others love it. Some will enjoy crack, some won't. Some can tolerate poor spelling/grammar for a good story, others won't. So I make a point to try to get an idea of what someone likes before recommending something.

The second is one of the best fics i have read in a while with interesting twists. Both feature pairings that are not canon, arent drowning in cliches and tropes (they do exist however) and are fairly well written.
