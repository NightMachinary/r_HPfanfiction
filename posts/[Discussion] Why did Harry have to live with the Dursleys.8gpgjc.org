I know /why/ from Dumbledore's explanation, but say he were to carry a vial of Petunia's blood on certain properties (The Burrow or 12 Grimmauld Place), vice versa. Would that work or has that been covered as a debunked option?


** That's a silly question. HP magic isn't supposed to work like this.

The better question is whether the blood wards were all that vital for Harry's protection. There are other magical protections that seem quite useful and I have my doubts that the blood protections at Privet Drive were as effective as Dumbledore made them out to be, since they are based on familial love and the idea of calling Privet Drive his "home".

***** The second one is something I hadn't considered so good point, but there's still Dumbledore's own protections to take into account. As for the house elf problem, while this is true there is also no known way to protect against it. Also while this is pure speculation it is possible the the protective charms around No. 4 let Dobby in because he didn't have any harmful intent (at that time) towards Harry.

Finally, the only two times that Harry is ever attacked in Surrey where the Dementor attack in OotP and the in the battle of the seven Potters. Both times Harry was outside of the area that was covered by the charm. Also even though Voldemort controlled the Ministry he still thought it was easier to attack Harry while he was on the move rather than when he was stranded at No 4.

I'm aware, hence why I said he could have Dobby Apparate Harry out. Apparition isn't inherently harmful, so Dobby isn't doing anything wrong. Or hell, we know Dobby could do magic there so Lucius (or whoever) could have their elf do something which indirectly handles the matter without directly seeking to harm him. Dobby, after all, did so.

I think those examples prove that the bond of blood was no better in protecting Harry in general than something lie Fidelius, meaning Dumbledore placing Harry there was negligence. If he can be attacked up the street from Number 4 then that enchantment is no safer. He'd be vulnerable most days for most of the day while at school...

I'm not sure that an argument that goes "Voldemort would do the smart/sensible thing" is very compelling right after a sentence about "The Battle of the Seven Potters", which was the smartest plan a bunch of Order of the Phoenix members and Aurors could apparently come up with. I'm not going to spell out how idiotic that whole ordeal was (and it cost poor Hedwig her life).

Just from that alone I'm very reluctant to follow any line of argument that presupposes "surely a Wizard A would just do the simple thing X if it were possible". Evidently they don't. They prefer to do the most convoluted and stupid thing imaginable in order to appear clever.

--------------

Methods for Harry to escape from Privet Drive in DH.

1. Moody says: "A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out.". They think the Minister is loyal to Voldemort and they are worried to commit an imprisonable offense? WHO CARES AT THIS POINT?! Just make a portkey. They are out to kill you and subjugate all of your loved ones, it literally doesn't matter if they want to imprison you too.

2. Invisibility Cloak: Harry just walks out of the House on a random day and takes a bus to anywhere. Portkey from there.

3. Polyjuice/Animagus: McGonagall walks in to visit Harry and leaves an hour later. During the night a cat jumps the fence.

4. Polyjuice/Metamorphagus: Nymphadora visits Harry and leaves an hour later. No one takes notice of "Petunia" going on a shopping trip she never returns from later.

5. Polyjuice: Dudley Dursley takes a ride on a bus. He never returns.

6. Harry takes off his glasses and wears a fake moustache. Leaving the house in broad daylight he takes the bus to the next town. Or just takes a long walk.

7. Polyjuice: Order members take polyjuice and get their pictures taken anywhere outside of Surrey pretending to be Harry. Leak picture to the daily prophet. If you want be really elaborate get seen in Hogsmeade or somewhere else. Be real Harry: No one care about Privet Drive anymore

8. Vanishing Cabinet: Acquire a pair.

9. Build a giant wooden horse with a garland that spells in huge letters "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY!". Roll it in front of the entrance of the house. Roll it away a day later. [still makes more sense than that Seven Potters crap]

It makes absolutely no sense to me that they would intentionally create such a huge hubbub.

******* Indeed - why polyjuice people into Harry, why not Harry into someone ELSE, someone nobody is looking for (hell, maybe even into a girl so that DEs etc. are even less likely to think it's Harry)?

Rowling is decent at world building (yes, decent - not great because so many things aren't fleshed out - sure, that's why fanfiction works so well in that universe, but doesn't do the story itself any favours IMHO!), but she's not a great storyteller, because her stories have plotholes large enough to fit a supertanker through with room to spare!

Dumbledore understood that despite Voldemort's intention and thoughts on the matter, that by taking Harry's blood he made himself weaker, not stronger.

While it is true that due to the process, Voldemort was then able to touch Harry without burning alive. In the overall scheme, Voldemort traded away his long term goal (remaining forever unchallenged), for a short term reward. In short, Voldemort opened a door, to close a window.
