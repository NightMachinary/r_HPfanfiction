I'm looking for completed stories that are at least 50k+. No Harry/Ginny pairings and I'm indifferent to Harry/Hermione pairings.

TIA!


** We just had another thread about linkffn(The Venom Peddler) which fits your description. It's about 110k words. Pretty good story except maybe for the ending. No shipping but Harry is pretty cuddly towards both Hermione and Luna. Ginny is also in it, to a lesser extent iirc.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
