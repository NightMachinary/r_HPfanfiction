So, this is twofold. Firstly, I'd like to hear about what y'all think on the time travel mechanics in Harry Potter. Canon or fanon or headcanon. And any ideas you have that might be cool to integrate - Closed loops, laws of conservation of chronology, etc.

Second, I want to see the best fics where time-travel is an intrinsic part of the plot. Not just a single backwards hop: I mean fics where Harry jumps all around the timestream like he's Doctor Who, where causality and paradoxes are discussed over tea and crumpets, where time is wibbly and/or wobbly and Harry has to deal with that. Again, no filters. Slash, het, weird kink shit, bashing, cliches, tropes, whatever.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Canon Harry Potter time travel is actually one of my favorite examples of time travel since it's a closed loop. Harry and Hermione don't actually /change/ anything, since everything has already happened.

This is one reason I hate Cursed Child so much. It breaks the established, non-paradoxical mechanics and messes with the time stream. However, if you want wibbly-wobbly you might as well read that.

** Harry gets in trouble for the reckless misuse of his time-turner in [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] . This fic uses the closed-loop idea, where paradoxes are impossible.
