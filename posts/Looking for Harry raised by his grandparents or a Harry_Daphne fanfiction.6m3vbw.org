looking for Harry raised by his grandparents either (Fleamont and Euphemia ) or fanfic classic ( Dorea and Charlus ) , a good Harry/Daphne Greengrass fanfiction


** And here's our daily Haphne request. Was getting worried we weren't going to have one today.

Never read a story where Harry was raised by his grandparents, though. So I'm interested if anyone has read any.

*** I'm happy to get one every day. Shes such a flexible character to work with since little is known of her other than shes in Slytherin, and that just makes things more interesting.

And like you, ive also never read a "raised by grandparents" one. Color me intrigued.

**** My issue is that, when a thread is posted asking for Harry/Daphne, almost every story has been recommended in numerous previous threads. With the shift in focus away from writing Harry/Daphne fics, there isn't much new blood coming in to make these threads interesting.

***** Fair enough. But that's simply a lack of understanding of how to search and sort through reddit content. And to be fair, that's an issue across reddit, not just here.

In addition, when you make a new thread, you never know when someone who did not see the first thread is going to see it, and recommend something brand new of often overlooked. It happens more often then one would think.

Finally, I have heard this from several people recently:

For the life of me I cant figure out why folks would shift away from writing such fics. Its got huge demand, and is probably the most demanded outside of Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Its a safe pairing to attempt because without much Cannon to work off of, or divert from, you have massive flexibility with her personality, nature, and direction.

****** It's still being written, plenty of it, it's just mostly poor quality. It's been a while since the books came out and the FanFiction community is getting older, as such our expectations are going up. As such very few Daphne stories that are new will be worth recommending, some of the older ones, while not great are too ingrained in the community to be forgotten. We also have some people who are quite critical of anything involving Daphne, especially if they use the 'ice' theme. I also think the pairing struggles with a definitive fic, my favourite is contractual invalidation but I'm still waiting for the fic that hits all my requirements, especially the ones I didn't know I had.

The pairing also suffers from its association with Indy/dark Harry which was all the vogue a decade ago but is now judged more harshly.

***** Shift away from opportunity to use a blank canvas anyway writer wants to a red head fangirl who reminds hay of his mother or unidirectional bookworm character with bossy know-it-all attitude?

Why would writers do that?

** "Hadrian Potter" by J-wagg. Harry's raised by Charlus and Dorea, who are bigoted against muggleborns and keep the whole BWL thing from him. The sequel, which starts 4th year, is up, but hasn't been updated in about a month. The sequel gets a bit more bashy than the first, whereas when the first introduces Dumbledore bashing it's in an interesting way. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12421722/1/]]

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG
