Hagrid, Flitwick and Fleurs mother and madam Maxime all to be in the same generation, so marrieing and reproduceing with others magical races see to have been a faze the wizarding world went threw.

So any stories were this effects Harrys generation? With there being lot more people like Fleur who have at least one grandparent that is from another magical race?

And what sort of advantages would you give for each magical race? We already know what advantages being Part-Giant gives with them getting the high magical resistance.

so what advantages would the other magical races give to hybrids?

And what about people that have two hybrid of different magical races for parents?


** *Phase, not faze.

And I highly doubt that it /is/ one. Given the /mildly/ racist (HA!) views of wizards at the time, and the subsequent views of society on the half-breed children, I strongly suspect that at least one of 3 things may be the case:

1. Hagrid/Flitwick/Madame Delacour and people like them are outliers. Their parents are considered weird.
2. Most hybrids are children of interspecies rape.
3. There have always been hybrids because banging other "beings" (and the occasional "beast") is considered normal.

In option one, you have deviants that go against social norms. In option two, you have children born of forced sex - a supply of hybrids that doesn't come from a /deliberate/ violation of social norms, at least for the victim. And in option three, people just accept it as part of life; we've had hybrids and such in stories and myth for ages, so considering how JKR's world works, it's possible that that's the case in HP too.

tl;dr, I think it's unlikely that it's a phase, and I don't think having a /bunch/ of people with nonhuman ancestry is particularly likely, but at the same time, having a few is normal.
