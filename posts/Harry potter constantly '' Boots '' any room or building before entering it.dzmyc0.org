Harry potter constantly throws one of his own shoes into a room before entering. This confuses everyone around him.

*** Mayhaps he has had one to many encounters with trapped rooms, and therefore throws his shoes into the room to be sure that there are no traps, and therefore has developed the habit of throwing shoes into literally every room before he enters.

** Hes in a long standing fight with a wardmaster. One time he was put to sleep by crossing a threshold and woke up sans kidney. Now he makes sure to have an object cross boundaries before he does to check for foul play.
