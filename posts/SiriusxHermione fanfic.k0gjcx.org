:END:
Hi I'm looking for a SiriusxHermione fanfic, maybe someone could help me. I think it takes place after the second wizarding war. I remember Sirius going camping with Hermione, Harry and Ginny and teaching them how to become Animagi (everybody is the same as their patronus, so Hermione's an otter). Hermione's parents are alive and remember her in this fic (her mother walks in on her and Sirius playing tag or something as otter and dog). And Sirius buys Hermione a puppy. That's as much as I remember. Thank you in advance!

#+begin_quote
  At the Ministry after graduation, Hermione Granger works to untangle her Department's Mysteries. Her research, dealing in the heretofore unknowable forces of magic, memory, and death, has unexpected consequences-some joyful, some troubling, and a few life-changing. HG/SB, rated M so I don't have to pull any punches. Not sure how fast this train will go, but likely slow burn.
