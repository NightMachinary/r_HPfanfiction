To be frank, I have forgotten dos of the details of this fanfic (which is why I want to read it again). It's main premise is that Harry has James in his head and thus he know and can do things that he can't remember learning (like using a spell to brush his teeth). There is also the fact that on the Marauder's Map, his name is Harry James Potter while others are just first and last names like Hermione Granger. I can't recall the pairing if there was one, and I want to say it was set in GoF but I am not certain. Thanks in advance!
