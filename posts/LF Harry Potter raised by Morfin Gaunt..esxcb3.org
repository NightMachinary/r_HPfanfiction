I have seen plenty of Black family fics and I thought that the Most Ancient and Inbred House of Gaunt deserves more recognition.


** Albus Fucking Dumbledore was less than useless. He knew the bastard had sold him out for some reason or another. He had been ready though, ha!

Making a Simulacrum was old magic lost to almost all anymore. All except Morfin that was to say more accurately. Once activated they only lasted a few days at most before falling apart. Though they could be held in a stasis spell for years until needed.

When Dumbledore had offered a safehouse when his foolish nephew had tried to kill him Morfin had been prepared.

Gaunts always had at least three plans and Morfin was a true Gaunt through and through.

When the proximity alarm had went off on night it sent him an image of the actual bastard arriving.

Activating the Simulacrum he had then used a self transfiguration spell he had devised working as an ICW unspeakable. It would wear off automatically two days latter. It was a last ditch survival spell.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Morfin looked about the absolute destruction the idiot boy had wrecked of the supposedly secure area. He had known this would happen and was glad it had taken only a few months to happen.

Now that all the players thought he was dead he was a shadow player. This also technically satisfied the damn prophecy that had brought him back to this shithole island.

He had been a proud son of Durmstrang and been recruited straight into the ICW Oblivators in 1917 for the first muggle world war. He had only returned now in '81 to get that balsted prophecy out of the way.

Working as a Fate Breaker was a job filled with tons of nothing to do, only to be frantically trying to survive the next moment. He was glad the prophecy of his death had been easy enough to subvert.

Well he had a few weeks until the he had to get back to work so he wanted to see what trouble he could stir. There was that chosen one prophecy about his idiot nephew floating around still after all. Oh the perks of getting copies of every prophecy made were rather nice as an ICW Fate Breaker.

Over 60 years of working in the halls of the ICW and he had reached a rather high level of success. While his family had mostly squibbed out he had gotten the bulk of the magic it had seemed allowing him to become a powerful wizard.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Morfin stared at the absolute worst series of protections he had ever laid eyes on. How the fuck that rank idiot Dumbledore had thought he could set up love based protections absolutely baffled Morfin.

Dumbledore was a Kin-Slayer (despite his protests the case was clear for anyone who looked, he had killed his own sister), Betrayer (he had turned on his lover without renouncing his love), and Oath-Breaker (how he had gotten around dying from that was unknown but for anyone who knew what to look for his magic loudly declared him an Oath-Breaker).

With those three titles engraved into his magic Love based magic was bared from him entirely. The fool had attempted to force it anyways and it looked like the damn thing was about to invert.

The Potter boy would be living a hellish life here if left. Casting he began lifting the magic and shaping it. Morfin had fallen in love years ago and she was his everything. She was barren due to a curse but they loved each other no less. They jad spoken of adopting but had held off for the right time, it seems that time was now.

Holding the Potter boy he could feel the soul fragment from his foolish nephew trying to stabilize. Calling on the love magic from the sacrifice ritual his mother had set up he purified the fragement.

Once cleansed the soul had tried to pass on only to be stopped by a golden cage Morfin had created. Dropping three drops of blood into the cage they suspeneded themselves floating there inside the soul.

"By Blood from the Head of the Family freely given I grant this child a place in our Line. By the Cleansed Soul of this boys Mortal Enemy I clear any debt owed. By the magic of his Mother's Sacrifice I call forth A Mother's Love to Protect and Nourish him. So I Say So I It Shall Be!"

He felt the ritual take place as the three magics wove into one falling like a sheet over the child before settling in.

The blood had been a bit of a gamble, though he was about 70% sure it would work. Freely offered line bestowal from the line head to a victim of someone from said line. Tricky but it should massively increase the power of their line gifts in the boy. The child would at the least be a Parsel tongue and would likely have an powerful affinity to healing and death magics.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The ICW Fate Breakers were a small and extremely elite part of the ICW with extremly strict entrance requirements and stricter oaths required to become a member. Any one of Dumbledore's magic cursed titles would keep him from being eligible.

After Grindlewald had rampaged across Europe the ICW had focused heavily on building its numbers up. Tax incentives and scholarships for families having four or more children were common. Adopting was seen as something prestigious now as it meant you had a larger family.

Dumbledore's fiefdom had followed the man's directives and not went along. He had argued it would be to expensive and harmful in the long run. Well the old fool had proven himself just that as the rest of Europe was in a renaissance right now while Britian stagnates.

This all meant it was near impossible for him to track down a black haired green eyed boy that had been adopted somewhere possibly in Europe. If he wasn't hidden away somewhere in Britian.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

End of this little ficlet for now, hope you enjoyed it.

** There is an unfinished fic on AO3 tagged as [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18217229][Morfin Gaunt/Lily Potter]] but I haven't read it so I can't vouch for it. Its tagged Harry/Voldemort, but if Morfin is Harry's father then I think that's an incestuous relationship...? I haven't read it so I don't actually know

​

To answer your question, there is no such fic that I know of. I don't think I ever saw a fic featuring Morfin in any degree as a character. Other than the known HBP memories.

  The time has come - Harry Potter, the prophecized Chosen One, turns 11 years old. It's time for Albus Dumbledore to become his savior, who takes him away from his abusive, neglecting relatives and introduces him to the Wizarding world. But... there is one, small problem. Dumbledore's whole plan is falling apart, when it turns out that Harry Potter doesn't need a savior. He had been given out by his relatives the very day Dumbledore put him on their doorstep. Now, he lives in the Gaunt Shack with his foster Father. He is a well-trained Wizard. He doesn't intend to go to Hogwarts. He speaks only Parseltongue. He is agressive towards any uninvited stranger.Dumbledore is an uninvited stranger.

  The boy grows more confident, smirk curling at his lips, “You don't recognise me, cousin?” he sticks out his hand, “Hadrian Gaunt,” he introduces himself, “It's always nice to find long-lost family, am I right?”It's only then that Tom realises the whole common room is staring at them, and it takes him too long to realise the reason why is because the whole conversation between the two of them hadn't been in English.It had been in Parseltongue.
