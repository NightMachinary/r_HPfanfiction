"Oh my god! Nobody ever asked me that, you must truly love me!"


** I never really understood how many fics makes this basically the cheat code to Tonks' heart. I can see it be a legitimate question -- but not as a pickup line, but merely sheer curiousity over how Metamorphmagus transformation works, if there is a baseline appearance if the transformation is "turned off" or if it's completely fluid and there's no such thing as "turning it off".

** Okay. I wrote this, and it went in a bit of a different direction than I'd thought, but what the hey. Harry's characterization in this scene is inspired by a a few harem fic Harry's I've read, and Tonks is about as unimpressed with him as I was when reading these fics...

--------------

Tonks looked a little forlorn, there she sat in one of the deep chairs in the living room. After she'd accidentally broken three soup-plates and one vase, Mrs Weasley had gently but firmly told her to go sit down and stop trying to be so helpful.

Harry slid down in the chair next to hers. Strictly speaking, he had /not/ been told to sit down and stop helping, but he figured that he could take a little break before anyone noticed. Besides, this was an excellent opportunity to get to know the Metamorphmagus a little better...

She looked up. "Wotcher, Harry," she said, not /quite/ with her normal cheeriness.

"Hi, Tonks." He looked at her. She was rather pretty, with her heart-shaped face and slender figure. "Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?"

She looked at him then. "Is it about my /true form/?"

"Er... what?" He blinked.

"That's usually what people ask when they want to ask personal questions," she said lightly. "Well, the less vulgar ones anyway. The /more/ vulgar ones tend to revolve more around /certain parts/ of my body, if you know what I mean."

"Oh." Harry immediately shifted gears and tried to pretend he hadn't been looking at her chest. "No no, that wasn't what I was thinking at all."

She scrunched up her face and cupped her breasts, which immediately grew much larger, stretching out the fabric of her shirt. "Because yes, I /can/ blow these up like balloons. Or shrink them down. Even make them vanish completely. It's why I never wear a bra."

Oh. So she /had/ noticed that he was looking. "That's, well... I wasn't going to ask about that!"

"Oh, so it /was/ about my true form, then?"

"Yes! I mean, no! I mean..." Harry desperately tried to get the conversation back on track. This wasn't going at all like he'd thought. "Look, you have so many forms," he tried, letting his voice go smooth again. "And I saw how the others made requests at dinner... I just thought it had to be a little upsetting that they command you to change your appearance like that..."

"No, why should it? It's a challenge, Harry. Fun for them, good practice for me. I'm good at it too," she said proudly. "Took me /ages/ to get that good, but now I only need a couple of seconds to completely change my face. Look!" She scrunched up her face again, and before Harry's eyes her pretty features morphed and grew less pretty... now her face looked disturbingly like that of a female Kreacher, with a bulbous, snout-like nose and bloodshot eyes.

Harry instinctively backed away ever so slightly. Kreacher's wrinkled face on Tonks's shapely body was not his idea of a beautiful sight.

"One second," said Tonks, running her fingers over her face to feel its shape. Her voice had turned somewhat hoarser and deeper, even if it wasn't quite a copy of Kreacher's bullfrog-like croak. "And I didn't even need a mirror."

"That's... nice," Harry managed to say.

"I hardly ever get to do this, Harry!" said Tonks, her hoarse voice really suiting the indignant tone. "I have this ability to change my appearance to whatever I want, but all too often I don't get to /use/ it. I can't change willy-nilly out on the street because the Muggles would panic, and even when I'm inside among witches and wizards they usually tell me to keep to a familiar shape. Do you have any idea how /frustrating/ that is?!""

"I --"

"You know when I was at Hogwarts, the teachers told me I had to stay consistent? Watched me like /hawks/ so I wouldn't suddenly try to change into someone else to get out of trouble, or cheat on tests. The only thing I was allowed to change as I wanted was my hair, because they bought my excuse that I couldn't control it that well."

"But --"

"Of course, /sometimes/ I did manage to fool them... there are a lot of fun things an imaginative Metamorphmagus can get up to at a place like Hogwarts..." Her ugly face split into a disturbing, wolfish grin. "But I won't sully your innocent ears with details. Come to think if it, some of those fun things was probably exactly why I wasn't allowed to change in the first place...."

"All right, all right, I get it." Harry once more tried to steer the out-of-control conversation back under his control. "You enjoy shifting, and that's fine. It's an amazing ability and you're very good at it... I just thought, well, like I said, you have so many forms. Don't get me wrong, they're all quite lovely! But I'm sure your /true/ form is even lovelier..."

Tonks sighed. "Harry. I understand that you don't quite get what it means to be a Metamorphmagus, so I'm going to tell you this once. This /is/ my true form." She motioned to herself, Kreacher-face and enlarged breasts and all.

"It is?! But --"

"And so's this." She scrunched up her face again, and this time her entire body shifted. Two seconds later, a girl who could have been Harry's twin sister sat there, with long black hair and a slender build, even a lightning-bolt mark on her forehead. "And this." Harry's twin was swapped out by a blonde, handsome man in his forties. "And this." The handsome man shifted into a buxom woman with supermodel-looks. "And this." The woman once more changed into a form closer to the one Tonks had started out with, with pink hair and a heart-shaped face.

Harry could only stare. He felt slightly dizzy after seeing all those changes.

"I'm a Metamorphmagus, Harry," said Tonks seriously. "I don't have /one/ true form. It's not like there's one basic shape and then everything else is just an add-on. /It's all me./ When I was little I was always changing form and colour depending on my mood... then I learned to control it and could change depending on what I /wanted/. I have no idea what I would have looked like if I'd never changed at all."

"So..." Harry said slowly. "You don't really have a true form then."

"Weren't you listening? It's /all/ my true form. My true form is that of a Metamorphmagus. A Metamorphmagus changes. That's the whole point. The form I'm in now is one I'm fairly comfortable in, so I decided to make it my default... but it's no more or less /true/ than any of the others."

"...oh."

"Yep. So, next time you want to flirt with me, do us both a favour and don't try cheap phrases about my so-called true form. It doesn't make you seem deep, it just reveals that you don't have a clue what you're talking about."

"So Tonks: what do you really look like?"

Tonks regarded Harry carefully. "You really want to see it?"

"Yeah," Harry said, earnest. "If you want to show me, I mean."

Tonks smiled. "No problem."

She stood, and she started to change.

Harry yelled in shock, in unbidden revulsion - and a dash of fear as he took her in, in her entirety. He had to crane his neck to look up at her face.

"You asked," Tonks spoke, in a deep, gnashing voice like shrieking metal.

Harry gave a shaky nod, and kept the thought to himself that he /really/ wished he hadn't!

** *Here you go. Have a tragedy.*

--------------

Harry was hanging out with Tonks in Grimmauld Place, the summer before his fifth year.

"So, err, Tonks, what do you really look like?" he asked curiously.

Tonks's typical cheery demeanor vanished immediately. Her eyes were as sharp and furious as her cousin's. Then, this, too, left her, and her whole body went slack. Her shoulders slumped. Her gaze dropped to the floor. "I don't know. I've never known; I've been shifting and changing from the moment I was born. It didn't stop until I was around nine years old, when I finally got control over my abilities and /made it stop/, but...it didn't matter by that point, because however I was supposed to look was long gone to me." She lifted her gaze to Harry, gave a small, forced smile. "At least the teasing stopped, though. The ever-changing girl wasn't too interesting to her classmates anymore, then."

"I'm sorry," Harry stammered. He left the room quickly.

** I have written a "base form" dialogue between Hermione and Tonks for one fic where it is just Hermione being her usual self (aka socially awkward and curious)

#+begin_quote
  "What... I don't get... Oh... Ohhh. Uhm, no I wanted to ask something else. Some books claim that metamorphmagi have a base form while others argue against that. Which one is right?"

  "Well, I have a base but it's neither what you'd expect nor is it fixed. A metamorph needs magic to hold a form. If a form is uncomfortable to be in it is far more difficult to keep it. For example, I can shrink my nose and it stays that way for days but I can't keep a beard for more than five minutes. The base form is just what feels most comfortable, like your favourite pair of sweatpants. If you'd stun me now not much would happen since this is basically the form I'm most comfortable in. I think my jawline would become a little sharper while my eyes would get a touch darker. Oh, and the tattoos would fade since they are only morphed."

  "So your base form has pink hair, magenta eyes and a dozen piercings?" Hermione asked with a mixture of awe and scepticism while her eyes trailed the ink dragon on Tonks' neck and down her cleavage before the younger witches realised what she was doing and quickly averted her eyes.

  "Yes, yes and no. The base is a representation of your personality, not how your genes look like. If you change it changes as well. At least that's how I understand it, but magical theory was never my strength. And while the piercings were put in with a morph they have no reason to go anywhere. So they would stay even if I'm unconscious. Of course, I can simply shift them around," Tonks replied grinning and slightly altered her nose so she could remove the ring from the right and put it in her left nostril. "So, any more questions?"

  "How does it feel to shift?"

  "It's natural to me so I'm not sure how to describe it. I guess the closest approximation would be the Polyjuice potion but you are a little too young to use that."

** you want to see my favorite allusion to that trope? here is it:

"Waiting on the muggle side of London, Tonks really had to wonder how she'd gotten roped into a date with a kid that didn't look quite as young as he should, nor act like it.

Ah yes, of course. He'd been funny, charming, very persistent and depressingly enough, more interesting than her usual brand of suitors. If she had to put up with one more idiot who thought he was being clever by asking what her 'true form' was, she might have seriously started considering the use of the Cruciatus as a corrective measure. The fact that she'd also found him rather attractive was best not considered. That way lay confusion."

For Love of Magic (Chapter 10)

​

A short ridiculing note, is all that it deserves, is neither clever and I don't think it would be unusual, I mean if I had a girlfriend that can change forms I would be pretty curious if she had a "base" form.

Another thing is the "everybody asks me to look like the girl of their fantasy except you" trope... somehow fanfics intend to paint all non-Harry males as insensitive idiots with half a brain cell that don't get that a girl wouldn't appreciate being asked to make herself look like another girl.
