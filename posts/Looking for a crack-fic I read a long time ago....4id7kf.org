Ok so way back when, when I was first getting sucked into the text-based room of requirement that is HP fanfiction, I read a crack-fic in which Dumbledore teaches Harry how to become like him - with the help of a book I think he wrote. This book was called something like "How to defeat Dark Lords and looking good doing it", and Harry's eyes start twinkling, he appears in outrageous ways and wears crazy robes with a billowing cloak.

This was a good laugh when I read it but for the life of me I can't remember which site it was on or what it was called, if anyone could help I'd be certain to only maim or seriously injure with my gratitude. Thanks!


** I'd love to read this.

** Well, I don't know if it is the story you are looking for, but in chapter 37 of linkffn(Harry Potter and the children of change) Lockhart gifts him such a book, and Harry and his buddies show up a bit later with twinkly eyes, billowing robes, etc. It's been years since I checked it, but I am pretty sure that the story was a big crackfic more or less.

So yea, no Dumbledore giving the book, but everything else fits.

** I still can't find it, but as a side note, there are some funny scenes in linkffn(9750991) where Harry gets a copy of a book of little glamourous charms that Lockhart uses, and then he and his group terrorize him with them.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
