If I remember correctly they came from a dimension where Voldemort decimated the resistance and they were fighting a desperate war. They somehow get transported to another world where they try and kill that world's Voldemort.

Major points is Harry and Hermione's combat abilities, and how Harry is almost insane from overuse of liquid luck.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
