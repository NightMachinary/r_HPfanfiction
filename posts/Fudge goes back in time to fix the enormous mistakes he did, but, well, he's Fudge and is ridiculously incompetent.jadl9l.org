** In the first war, when Voldemort returned, Fudge immediately went to a war footing. Because of this, Voldemort saw no need to hide. Voldemort's sudden violence and Fudge's incompetence lead to many lives being lost. Fudge decided to go back in time to fix everything.

Having gone back in time, he decided to cover-up Voldemort return this time, to avoid the blood-shed that Voldemort would do. I think we all know how this turned out.

** I had this idea ish for a fic myself. My take on it is that he's slowly becoming more and more competant by virtue of having to deal with the concequences of his actions, stuck continuously going back in time and repeating Harry's 5th year until he's succeeded in preventing Voldemort from getting a foothold in the country. Problem is, that the deck is already rigged against Fudge to an absurd degree, mainly due to his own actions ever since he arrested Sirius Black.

​

My end for it would be Fudge going back further, breaking the time travel device in the process, and ending up just before arresting Sirius. That way he can stop the rot settling into the ministry in the first place.

** There is a fanfic like this called the greatest minister of magic where fudge went back in time, is super competent, but it is implied at the end that if it fails "again" He will have to try again
