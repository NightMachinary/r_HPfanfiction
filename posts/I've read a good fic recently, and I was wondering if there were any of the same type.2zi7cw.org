I recently read a fanfiction named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686394/Hell_Eyes][Hell Eyes]], and I quite liked it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

It wasn't the most well written fanfic I have ever read, but the storyline was very decent, and the grammar and quality of writing were /at least/ decent.

So here I am, wondering if there is any other fanfictions out there with storylines similar to this one, be it closely or very loosely.

EDIT: Here's me trying to explain the storyline without spoiling the story if people want to read it.. :P So, it's basically a story where Harry isn't human, but belongs to another world called Origin. This world was created by some gods, and one of them especially, created a race, race to which Harry belongs. However, he cannot be normal, and was Cursed by the god who created this race. I'm not saying more than many interesting things happen to him, and that I particularly liked all the surprises that were dropped on me along the story.


** You'll need to explain the storyline if you want recommendations on similar ones.

**** I can't say I've ever read a fic quite like that.

Closest ones off the top of my head are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] abd [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10131514/1/Back-to-the-Beginning][Back to the Beginning]], but they're not all that similar.

** If you're looking for a fic where Harry is powerful, has unusual anatomy, and is aiming to make wide changes, I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] by AngelaStarCat. It's a bit slow at first but it really picks up as it goes along, and the quality of writing is excellent throughout.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white.

** Well... In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9566395/1/Entwine][Entwine]], by Amouru, Harry is a Lamia, which is a species created by the curse of a goddess.... There's no dimension-travel but there is time-travel, and I like it a lot. I get excited whenever (she?) updates

*** I'll look at it, but from what I see, it's not very advanced yet. 12 chapters doesn't seem very much :P

**** It's ongoing, of course, but at least it hasn't been abandoned. Definitely dark!Harry though.
