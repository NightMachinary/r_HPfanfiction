** I don't think the resurrection stone works as advertised, I think it just creates shades of your loved ones that then try to convince you to kill yourself. I find the conversation Harry had with Sirius, Lily, etc to be very disturbing. Who in their right mind would tell their child that it's okey to kill himself, that it won't hurt and that he is nearly there. Cadmius killed himself shortly after using it, and Dumbledore himself seemed to become suicidal in his last year, he didn't care about Draco killing attempts and asked Snape to kill him (weren't there better euthanasia methods? Wtf). I think Dumbledore give him the stone so that he wouldn't chicken out at the last moment lol.

*** It is my belief that the likelyhood of someone who uses the resurrection stone committing suicide is highly dependant on their intentions when using it.

I believe it truly does allow you to speak to the souls of the dead but DOES NOT actually bring them back to life. The reason why so many users commit suicide is it of grief when they try to bring people back instead of utilizing it in small "dose's" so to speak for information or closure.

Also while it is a little disturbing, you are forgetting that there was no other way in Harry's case. He had to 'die' to remove voldemort's horcrux. Such words are less disturbing when you recognize that they are not trying to convince harry to kill himself, (he has made that choice already) they are trying to comfort and reassure him

Edit: basically I think the stone is like a cellphone for the dead but people keep trying to use it as a tool to 'revive' people instead

**** Honestly I think it fits the evidence we have better than the idea that it was simply a powerful magical artifact. As [[/u/SummerLake69][u/SummerLake69]] pointed out, what loved ones would encourage someone to commit suicide by dark lord?

***** Living ones? Few. But they're dead. It is entirely reasonable that they have a very different view of death than the living do. After all, why do we mourn the dead? Because they aren't with us anymore.

*** I mean, if I was dead and the afterlife was great, I'd probably try to tell my friends and family to hurry up and come chill. You're looking at it from the perspective of a person who is alive, which they aren't.
