:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't think there was Weasley bashing, I remember Ron being a bit wary against a Slytherin sharing the Head's room with Harry, and maybe Hermione being overworked? Like I said, I may be mixing up two or more fics. It might even be a fic from James Spookie. Idk. Help pls!

*** It isn't, and the only reason why I know it isn't, is because its on my 'to-read' list for a couple of weeks... Thank you, however, for the suggestion.

** There's loads of those elements in linkffn(12408440)

They're both Head Boy and Girl and Harry has Teddy living with him. However there's no real hate between them as far as I remember. There's some slight bashing afaik.

#+begin_quote
  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE
