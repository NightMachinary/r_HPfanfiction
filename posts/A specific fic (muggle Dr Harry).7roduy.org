I'm looking for a fix I read w while ago. Harry had left the magical world at some point and became a Dr. A children's Dr if I'm not mistaken. He's married to a muggle woman and has a child. Eventually I think Dumbledore finds him again and wants him to return to teach at the school. That's all I remember. Any ideas?


** linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) I think it might be what you are looking for, but I am unsure. He definitely left the magical world, married a muggle woman, became a doctor and had kids. But I am not sure if Dumbledore asked him to teach...
