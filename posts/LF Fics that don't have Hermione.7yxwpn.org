Preferably looking for Harry-centric fics that don't have Hermione in any way, shape or form, or at least don't have Hermione as some sort of weird sub-pairing. Also: No Slash and no Harry/Ginny

** In rise of the wizards and paid in blood, they stop being friend. In Harry Potter in the claw of Raven ans the sequels she is barely mentioned. There also is Midnight Gold, the rise of the forgotten Lord which is pretty good but abandoned. They Shook Hands is also worth mentioning, good fix without Hermione.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
