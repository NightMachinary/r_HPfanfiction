Bits I remember:

Takes place while Harry is a student; there is a separate, adult Harry teaching defense.

The time traveling Harry has some kind of bond with another version of Dumbledore.

Due to this, he uses a blood quill on himself (I think he writes "I must not interfere" or something) and cannot help when things happen at Hogwarts.

Thanks for your help!!!
