:END:
Searching for a specific Remus/Tonks fic where Remus and Sirius go on a mission in Ireland where they meet Tonks. Remus thinks Sirius tries to seduce Tonks and then worries if they want a threesome with him.

The mission includes kidnapped selkies (I think) and Tonks dances a lot cause Moody had told her to dance or have sex. It ends with Remus and Tonks dancing in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place after Remus changes the scene with some kind of altered Howler and Sirius had made fun of it.

It wasn't too long a fic, I think not even 20 chapters. POV was mostly Remus.

I could be wrong on the details here and there but it's been a while and I really need something cute and vaguely familiar so I thought, why not give it a shot. I've been searching for a while now but it seems impossible to find.
