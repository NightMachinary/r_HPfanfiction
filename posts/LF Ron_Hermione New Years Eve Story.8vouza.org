I have been trying to find a Ron/Hermione story that used to be in the Bedchamber section of Checkmated but I can't for the life of me remember the name or author which is making it very hard to find.

I remember that Hermione went to Ron's (and Harry's too I believe) apartment on New Years Eve and caught Bill and Fleur having sex. However, due to only seeing his back and Bill having cut his hair short, she mistook the situation as finding Ron and Fleur. She was very upset by this, angst ensued and Ron ends up coming home and finding her eventually leading to a declaration of feelings and sexy times.

This would have been published originally in the mid-2000s (maybe 2005-2007). Any help anyone can offer is very much appriciated! Thanks!
