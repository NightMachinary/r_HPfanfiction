** It's ironic since I always imagined Herpo as a misunderstood hero. He lived in Ancient Greece during the time of the Greek Gods. In my mind, the Greek Gods were wizards who had similar ideas as Grindelwald and thought they were superior to .Muggles. Herpo was misunderstood as the son of titans called Typhon, when he rode his Basilisk up to Mount Olympus to overthrow them and gave Zeus a run for his money. That's especially since Typhon and Echidna are considered the parents of all legendary monsters such as the Hydra, the Nemean Lion and the Chimera.
