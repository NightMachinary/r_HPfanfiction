Hi all! I'm new, so feel free to flag this/move it if I've posted it in the wrong place.

I just found the super awesome class schedule generator tool by LittleDinghy (archived post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b93g9f/harry_potter_and_the_hogwarts_class_schedules_a/][here]]) and got all excited to use it for fic planning. But, when I tried to use it, I found that it only filled out the schedule completely for Gryffindors. Other House schedules were incomplete and had several classes missing entirely.

I made sure to follow the instructions so each House was paired together for exactly 2 core classes and 2 electives, so that's not the problem. That resource was posted a year ago, so I can't comment on the original post.

Does anyone know if the tool has been updated or fixed? I would really like to use it, but my fic centers around Slytherin, so right now it doesn't work. Thanks!
