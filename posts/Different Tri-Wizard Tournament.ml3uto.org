Harry is participating, but the different part is that the department of mysteries has something that allows the competitors to go into alternate dimensions. I know Victor goes into GTA and Harry goes into Skyrim, but not much else. I also know that Harry is hiding a lot of his abilities and plans to milk the trip to a new world for all of its resources.
