**** its like the most I care is kinda hoping two charcters who have chemistry get together but if it doesnt happen you just move on

its kinda weird treating it like a religion and holding onto it for decades

the only time I actively hate pairings is if the writting goes down the shit due to the pairing

like in arrow, the pairing was fine but the writting went to hell and the love interest started acting like a massive wanker while the show acted like she could do nothing wrong so the pairing was bad as it ruined a charcter I enjoyed but thats mostly due to the writting of said relationship

** I would say, rather, that the story has failed to prove that they belong together, which is not the same as proving that they don't.

It could be considered weak evidence that they don't belong together; one person who sincerely believed it turned out to have a flawed argument, therefore it's /slightly/ more likely that there are no good arguments. It's far from conclusive by itself, though.

** You're not proving anything. Bashing is stupid but there are plenty of non-bashing stories where Harry and Hermione get together. Vox Corporis is probably the best example. Unlike a sister does it differently.

Bashing Ron and Ginny to get Hermione and Harry together is lazy writing, and probably genuine bad writing, but it doesn't prove anything about the HHr pairing.

*** You know what is a better (canon supported) reason why Harry/Hermione makes no sense?

The fact everytime Ron got into a spat with either Hermione or Harry, and so Harry and Hermione interacted as a duo rather than as a trio, Harry found himself hating it.

Seriously - he found it boring beyond belief - go read Prisioner of Azkaban when Ron refused to talk to Hermione after the Firebolt incident, or GOF after Harry is choosen as a Champion or hell even Half Blood Prince - When Hermione gets offended at Harry using the book and Ron stops talking to her.

Every single time Harry's reaction is the same - he finds himself underwhelmed and somewhat bored. They're just not good together as a pair.

Also on the same vein, what do Ron and Hermione have in common? Pretty much nothing. They just suddenly discover hormones in 6th year and start kissing. That's the foundation of their relationship. Everything else about one another makes them fight.

  But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend.
#+end_quote

Lol dude's still spending time with her, it's just that his relationship with Hermione is different to the one with Ron. If one of your best friends suddenly cuts you off it's normal to miss them and that dynamic. Harry still says he liked her very much. Are we expecting a 14 year old boy to not miss hanging out with his bro? Ron would feel the same way if he was alone with Hermione lol. And this is at 14, we see their personalities shift over the course of the books. This is always what I find vaguely ridiculous about shipping arguments, we're debating lifelong relationships from what these people are at 14. Who I vibe with now is different from who I vibed with at 14.

In real life, Idk if Harry and Hermione's personality would mesh well together if they just met and hadn't been through anything formative, but I think the strength of the experiences they've shared creates a strong enduring bond which means they could work through any difficulty, especially in post-Hogwarts fics where everyone's older and more mature and I see evidence of that bond in canon. I could see Ron and Hermione working but I think it would be more difficult, and I feel like the bond between Harry and Hermione in canon just seems stronger and steadier. If I found someone the relationship I'd want with them would be with the strength of the bond that Harry/Hermione share.

** I don't think it is that simple. As someone who ships Harmony, I care little whether Ron and Ginny are bashed or not. It may be entertaining, and it may serve for the author's plot, but I don't think many Harmony shippers view it as necessary to justify their ship. It is unfortunate that it is so widespread, but I for one relish fics where this is not the case.

Your critique seems to be more of the shippers than the ship itself, and I can agree with that assessment. It does get draining to always read about Weasleys who rely only on potions to pursue mere wealth or fame. Entertaining it may be, but even the most entertaining things grow boring after excessive viewing.

If I were to say that I ship Harmony because I find the concept of their relationship to be an ideal I should seek in my own romantic relationships, would that be a valid reason in your mind to ship Harmony? Would I be guilty of shipping an incestuous relationship, despite the fact that Harry and Hermione are not related by blood? I personally do not believe I would be. I have a sister, and the way I treat her is nothing like how I've read Hermione and Harry treating each other.

You may ship Romione and Hinny. Then good for you! Read all the fics! Share all the arts! Let your ships sail off into the sunsets, and I'll let mine sail into the dawns. We shall wave at each other in goodwill from the bows of our ships as we pass in the night.

** You can deny it all you want or masquerade it as delusional fandom-misinterpretation, but in reality, there are many reasons Harry and Hermione would make a good couple, with evidence to the fact littered throughout the text. Bashing is a trope that has generally fallen out of favour with every corner of the fandom. Very few popular HHr stories nowadays have much bashing in them at all (Strangers on a Train being a notable example that directly goes against bashing of any sort).

The ones that do often are there to fulfil an anti-establishment, adolescent power-fantasy, where magical prowess equates to sexual dominance, in which case the actual object of desire is interchangeable and often multiple. HHr stories often are brought up as examples of this, notably due to an excessive backlash to the idea from canon shippers, when really any ship is guilty of this. It's just common practise for inexperienced writers to demonise one side to make the other seem more logical, it's hardly a habit exclusive to writers of one ship. Why HHr gets the most flack for this, I can only guess, but the popularity of these stories certainly springs to mind, that and the pairing of HHr directly contradicts not one integral canon ship but two.

A lot of HHr stories partake in hints of bashing, but mostly it's done to expose character flaws in certain characters and allow them to grow from it, which is a treatment that is consistent with the main pairing too. There are also stories without external bashing where Hermione and Harry are deliberately brought to task for their own failures and forced to grow from that conflict. One example is Hermione Granger is Stupid.

Perhaps that is the point of your post then, that those who rely on bashing to facilitate a relationship are flawed writers, but the fact that it is framed around HHr in particular wreaks of ignorance. Nuff said

Not only that but one user on the subreddit recently wrote a four-part essay detailing the evolution of Harry's attraction to Hermione with evidence straight from the text as well as renowned psychological studies.

But if you want my recommendation specifically for strong evidence, I can direct you to a saga of 7 books written by JK Rowling called the Harry Potter series.

****** What's wrong with Tonks/Harry? I mean, I know that she's a little bit older than him, and they barely interacted with one another in canon, and they are related to one another, but she is not that much older than him (a 7 year age difference between her and Harry, compared to the age difference between her and Lupin which is almost double that at 13 years conservatively), fanfics can change the amount of interaction time between them so that they can get to know one another better develop a romantic relationship, and as for being related to one another, that's through a Great Grandmother, and possibly due to marriage only (I'm a little iffy on the details of the family tree there) making them 2nd or 3rd cousins if I'm not mistaken, which while a bit squicky isn't unheard of, even outside of the wizarding world.

** I'd say "prove" is a very strong word. That said, it's even more general than that. Any 'shipping-centred fic that rewrites one or both partners' personality from scratch or bashes a romantic competitor is an argument /against/ the 'ship. For example, just off the top of my head,

- /Harry Crow/: Harry and Hermione could be a lovely couple... if Harry were raised by goblins.
- Robstfic in general: Harry and Hermione are destined for each other... if Harry were a gentleman, a scholar, and a badass and Hermione had no personality.
- /What We're Fighting For/: Harry and Hermione could get together... if Harry were an emotionally stunted killing machine with a heart of gold and Hermione were isolated and helpless, with Ron being one of her biggest bullies.
- /Unsung Hero/: Harry and Hermione could happen... if Harry were much more hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and level-headed.
- Majority of Dramione fics: Draco and Hermione could fall in love... if Draco were suave and steadfast, Hermione were a flighty ingenue with no personality or values, and Harry and Ron were crude, inept, and incapable of changing their mind about a person.
- Majority of Haphne fics: Harry and Daphne could be a real power-couple... if Daphne were a smart, cunning, skilled pureblood who is proudly neutral about Voldemort (as if it were a good thing) all is about Pureblood Culture and Traditions but is not at all prejudiced against Muggleborns.

** No, it just proves that the author is poor at writing. Harry and Hermione /can/ get along without Ron and Ginny getting bashed, if it is written right. Most people writing such stories already don't care much about those two characters, so it is just easier to shove them to one side and use them for comedic/antagonist/insignificant purposes.

Personally, I don't think Harry/Hermione pairing works at all if you take them at canon value, both or either must go through heavy change in the fanfiction story in order for it to be organic. Harry doesn't like pushing himself when there's no necessary need for it, he's content with being above average, while Hermione is far too judgemental of those who don't value the things she does, such as studying and academic excellence.

Whenever there's a fight in the Trio - Scabbers/Crookshanks and Firebolt in PoA, Harry as Triwizard Champion in GoF, and Won-Won/Lav-Lav in HBP - Harry finds his time spent with Hermione to be dull and uninspiring. He prefers Ron's company unless there's something necessary he needs to figure out which is when he goes towards Hermione. Their pairing simply won't work because canon!Harry is not interested in studying and other pursuits that Hermione is in, and canon!Hermione is very serious and doesn't like wasting her time with unproductive tasks or laze around doing nothing of note.

******* Ok, so, first of all, addressing your reddit comment links, these are all about traits being noticed. This is not odd when put in context. One of the things that makes Harry Potter so great is that JKR in all of her books pays amazing attention to detail. This is just her writing style. The article "Giving Her The Power"(You can find easily on google, the website's called sugarquill) points out many of the same things with Ginny. Yes, it points out instances where he happens to notice Hermione and not Ginny, but these in the end are cherry-picked, and most come from moments where Harry is talking to Hermione or vice versa. Secondly, there is nothing here proving that Harry and Hermione work well together romantically. The two main times they were alone were the Horcrux hunt and the start of fourth year. Both times, morale was extremely low. To give a comparison, in second year, at times Harry was being treated much the same way he was in 4th year, but he was much happier. Why? Ron was with them. Bottom line, Hermione is too bossy and Harry is too far from the high tier intelligentsia for them to be good together. Lastly, you are wrong. I know you are. That might seem a little pompous, but let me explain. I started out as a fierce H/Hr shipper, probably the fiercest there was at my age in the entire US. However, I started re-reading the books. And less than a year ago, I looked at the problem with logical thinking. I watched YouTube videos from each side, read articles from each side, thinking they would prove H/G wrong and that I had foolishly overlooked something. And then, I got a huge shock. I was completely wrong. What did it for me was a video by a guy named BucReviewer, about H/G versus H/Hr. So don't give me more evidence, I've read all the points. I'm not going to switch my view. I switched it once, over a few months and many hours of reading and youtube videos. The ship is wrong, and that is just a basic fact. And to finish this off with a quote from Brennus:"Oh, and JKR never said that she should have paired them up: actually read the bloody interview before using it as supposed proof."

I only bothered to skim the first link, but that alone raises the most important narrative argument in favour of Hermione as romantic interest. Harry is the MC, Hermione is the female character with whom he interacts the most and with whom he goes through the most and worst shit. Like, not to rain on Ginny, but there was only one instance were she fought alongside Harry, and that was the DoM. Hermione was there for all but one adventure, where she was almost killed gathering crucial information.

An argument which convinces one person does not necessarily convince the rest. Case in point IMO it is pretty clear that Draco Malfoy committed the most war crimes in the series after Voldemort himself, war crimes for which even the allies outright executed people (perfidy in particular, but there's a long list). Yet despite me reaching that conclusion, not many others do, which proves that an individual "enlightenment" hardly makes a truth.

Each of these arguments does not sway most people, otherwise there would be only one OTP for this fandom.

********* For point 1, you're cherrypicking. Point #2 is absolutely stupid. Because she's the main female protagonist, she goes with Harry? There are 3 things Ginny shared with Harry by the way, not two. She shares the chamber, which even if she didn't actually fight the basilisk, it is a traumatic experience only the two of them can share. The second is Tom Riddle having invaded their minds, practically raping them mentally. Again, only the two of them can share or understand it. The third is the DoM. All experiences Harry and Hermione share can be comprehended simply, and would be shared by most if not all resistance fighters in europe during WWII. Harry and Ginny's can't, only they can understand that, only they have the Horcrux having invaded their minds. Point 3 isn't read correctly and was accidentally taken out of context. I didn't use an Oxford comma there. I meant as a combination, they react terribly based on other personality traits in addition(E.g, Harry's stubbornness). For your last point, I'm not saying one does. I'm saying a COMPLETE analysis forces those who are willing to admit they were wrong to switch sides.

That would imply that someone else was fighting since all resistances had networks such as the Polish Home/National Arm, the French one or the White Rose.

The Order ran a radio show and that's it. A few people sprinkled across the countryside trying not to be caught also does not count as fighting. However, you unintentionally make a nice point there, the two or three months Harry and Hermione were alone are an experience no one else can relate to. Ron had his family to fall back to (as he did), the Order had their cozy radio station, everyone else was merely trying to survive. Yet for a good chunk of the hunt, it was literally Harry and Hermione against the World, literally the last people still fighting out in the field for the cause.

However, having a traumatic experience does not mean that you want a partner with the same experience. I was kidnapped when I was twelve and I'm certainly not looking for women who were kidnapped themselves.

Ron and Hermione each are constantly on a desktop computer with a microwave cooking next to them. Ginny was in Hiroshima when the bomb dropped. Harry has had the Tsar Bomba dropped on him. For the chamber, while different, they both were there, and both almost died, with Ginny coming very close to death. For the resistance fighters one, my point isn't specifically them, my point is you can very easily say what their experience was. Only Harry and Ginny can understand each other's pain from those experiences they shared. And while being kidnapped is terrible, if Harry Potter was real, it would be a picnic compared to what he and Ginny would have gone through. Even if this isn't proof for Harry and Ginny, it is proof against H/Hr. Hermione's thirst for knowledge would have her push and push and push Harry to give her details and talk through it with her as if she was a pyschiatrist. Harry would hate this. And speaking of "For a good chunk", a) That doesn't have to be romantic, it could and in the end would be platonic, and b) What did they do without Ron? Nothing. Harry and Hermione is a fucking TERRIBLE team. Their only main successes ever as a team have been Sirius and the potions in TPS.

You seem like a purist, a Canan writer and that's fine, perfectly respectable but Canan writers tend to be very rigid in interpretation. As you said, there's no Canan to support the pair -- of course not, I wasn't saying their was...

Now stick with me. The second type of writer is AU writers. We -- myself among them --tend to look at fanfic as a tool, being in my opinion more creative and flexable, using Canon as a drawing board, but using fanfic to Fix or improve aspects of canan with plot-holes or haven't been fleshed out.

I did not mean that there is direct published Canon to support it no, but the /subtext/ does, having far more substance in terms of Friendship and years of interaction at Hogwarts as Best Friends then there is for H/G. Seems to me personally that JK basically forced it at the end, having said in an interview somewhere that she Started with the 19 yrs later epilogue and basically worked backwards

Objection, crack is perfect for bashing.

There's a famous German YT parody where Quidditch is teleshopping, the Weaselys are inbread and practice incest, Dumbledore finances the school with CP since his rap career does not earn enough, Slytherin is gay (with Potions being a special class for hardcore stuff "without lube"), Hermione a lesbian who got petrified/rubberised from a faulty sex toy which pornstar and professor Fuckhard (Lockhart) sold and everyone is a horny idiot 24/7.

It is utterly hilarious because it is so far out that you can't take it serious. Bashing only sucks if you get the feeling that the author is serious about what they write.

**** I don't really care about that. For me it depends in how you change it personality and if you justify it properly. There are some fics where they give stupid reasons in order to make Harry (or any other character) dark, or more independent. But in order to do that there are many ways, like creating an alternate universe where Harry was raised by Voldemort, for example.

I personally like when people change some aspects of the character, but only if it is realistic.

**** Well it depends on the person. Some people don't like to see their favourites characters to be different, but others, like me, are ok with that.

It's something personal, and I don't think that a fic is bad if it changes some characters personality.

** Honestly neither of the two male leads are good for Hermione in my opinion, at, least with what is presented to us in the novels. Neither is intellectually at her level which is why many stories trying to get them together forces Harry to become uncharacteristically interested in learning, Ron to be a strategic genius or some such, or Hermione basically ignore Hermione's love of knowledge.

Honestly the second and third tier characters make the best love interests because we don't know a lot about them so they're easy to fill in to more easily mesh with the main characters. Haphne is a meme but it can be done in an interesting and well written manner. Luna as a love interest is hard To write correctly but anything you want can be behind the dreamy mask, or it could not be a mask at all. Sue Bones apparently has huge breasts according to every Fan Fic ever but besides that she can match your stories version of Harry perfectly. Tonks and Ginny also fit here.

It's funny to me that some of these second and third tier characters have somehow developed their own semi consistent personalities so now we're turning to new third tier characters so people can keep trying to make a girl their perfect match for Harry. Tracey Davis is popping up more often, Harry and grown up Gabriel has become almost common place, and it seems like just about any girl around his age is matched to him at this point.

There is no right ship. That's right I said it.

*** Where has this lie that you have to be intellectually equal or have the exact same interests to be in a relationship come from?

** But I like bad!good guys. It's interesting. Though at the same time to force them together by making Ron and Ginny bad is dumb too.

** I don't have to, but I've never written one. I've considered it, but I'd have to do novel-length rewrites of GoF-DH to satisfy my own wants and ideals of how I'd want it to turn out, and I've got professional writing endeavors to complete.
