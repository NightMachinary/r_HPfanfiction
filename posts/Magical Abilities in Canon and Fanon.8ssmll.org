So this is something I have been thinking about for a while, but am unsure where canon ends and fanon begins. Magical abilities (natural abilities I mean) are a thing in canon. The only examples I can name though are metamorphmagus (oddly not the normal way it is pronounced in fanon), seers, and parselmouths. I am not referring though to abilities like animagus transforamtion, which is an ability that must be learned/gained/produced by the wizard or witch.

Many fanfics include other abilities, some more believable (magical polyglots, variations of psychics, magical synesthesia, etc.) and others that can stretch belief (true shapeshifters, weather manipulation, magical regenerative/healing abilities, etc.). So here are some questions I have for discussion here, to see if I can gain a bit more clarity:

- Why do some people develop magical gifts in particular? Magic isn't necessarily heritable, but examples such as Trelawney, Teddy Lupin, and the majority of the Slytherin line suggest the traits are somewhat related to genetics and "blood."
- What are some interesting ideas for magical gifts that fit with the style of canon abilities?
- Why is there only a language for speaking to snakes? Are there others, like Slytherin or Herpo the Foul, who can speak to say birds or fish?
- Do the magical abilities of creatures like dragons (spitting fire, etc.) or basilisks occur naturally (e.g. evolution), or were they the result of wizards and witches attempting to create new creatures?
- Is it possible that some of the existing powers are related to some mixing of magical creatures (maybe added a part of a hydra or runespoor, eventually develop ability to speak to snakes in their children)?
- What less believable abilities would you like to see in fanfics? Personally, I would like to see someone with the ability to travel through reflections, such as mirrors or windows. Its useful, but limited based on the situation and forces the character to be creative.

What are your thoughts?

I think Parseltongue is definitely something which a past wizard went out to create --- he found a way to magically implant linguistic knowledge of Snake-speak in his own soul /and/ have it magically transfer to all descendants. Other things, though, like Metamorphmagi --- I see that as rather a magical-Lamarckian mutation in someone's magic that was naturally passed on, and might end up splitting into another species altogether depending on semantics.

#+end_quote

Because only one species that Muggles think are just dumb animals, but which are really sentient, is plenty enough to break the universe, thank you very much. (Although, speaking to whales or dolphins might be imaginable.)

#+end_quote

Basilisks were artifically created by Herpo the Foul with Dark Magic, and we know Acromantulas are also an artificial creation, but that may be the exception rather than the rule. I think magical beasts are a mix of creatures which developped the magic trait and improved themselves generation after generation along Lamarckian (as opposed to Darwinian) evolutive mechanisms, and creatures which wizards specifically bred or enchanted for their own purposes.

That's a nice idea. It doesn't seem like something that would be an inherited trait in canon, more a characteristic of a nonhuman creature or something you could do with enchanted mirrors (a la Floo) or at least with a spell/artifact you have to actively use. But it's not quite foreigh either; the Mirror of Erised and the Locket of Slytherin prove that moving things into "mirror-space" is possible with magic.

*** The mirror thing reminds me of the Paranoia boss from Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow. It was a demon that lived in a mirror and its soul let you enter mirrors yourself to collect additional items and, in one case, fight another boss that was responsible for an antagonist's fire powers. Enter the mirror, kill the boss, no fire powers for you anymore.

**** I had the idea that a person could make a reflective surface show other reflections around the world when the mage places their hand on it. The difficulty is they need something to find; they have to have been there before or have someone or something they are looking for, otherwise there are billions of locations to sort through.

Then when the caster finds where they want, they are "refracted" to the new surface in the opposite orientation (mirror style) and the old surface shatters or explodes or what have you.

*** Achille no! :( Why is it breaking the universe with just ONE sapient species that just no one can communicate with? :( :( Why can't there be more? It would bring up lots of super interesting moral questions that would force people to confront about themselves, like it literally being murder to kill "animals," and literally forcing everyone to go vegan because mass slaughter of proven sapient beings like cows can't be accepted anymore.

But yes i would love to see aquatic conversations! :) I bet there is such cool stuff underwater that they could talk about. :o Especially magic stuff.

**** Well, because we'd /realize/ if all those animals were sapient. Justifying snake sapience already has me going through hoops about how only /some/ snakes "get" smart as they age based on how mentally stimulating their world is, and I'm assuming the Wizarding World knows about that and Obliviators take care of any cases were a snake acts a little too smart in the presence of a Muggle. If animals as widely, carefully observed as cows or pigeons were also sentient... I don't know how the Obliviators would even physically find the time.

** Certainly, canon has shown that characters often have a focus ability that approaches the magical.

- Hermione learns quickly - she's self-taught in magical law in 3rd year for the sake of Buckbeak's defense at the same time she was taking more classes than anyone else

- Harry has a gift for flying (and a very hard time with dying; he can't quite get the hang of it)

- Neville is a plant brother

- Seamus is able to detonate all sorts of things (in the movies, but still)

- I've seen Dean with a gift for illustration, or the ability to do a wandless Compulsion charm with only his voice (probably should have been Lee Jordan's specialty)

- The term 'Augury' is a form of divination based on watching flocks of birds in flight. I've also seen it as a term for bird-speak, not unlike a Parselmouth. Then there's Dr. Doolittle...

As for less common options, you can look over myths and legends from around the world for inspiration. The tale of the Chinese brothers had some epic abilities - one couldn't be burned, one could stretch his body, one had a neck that couldn't be cut, one could hold an ocean of water in his mouth.

  What are some interesting ideas for magical gifts that fit with the style of canon abilities?
#+end_quote

In my own stories, most people have gifts for certain areas where things just come "natural" for them, to the point where they, for example, can cast those spells wandless. And it does not make those characters overpowered in any way because I make sure that none of them are an instant "I win" button. For example, I write Lisa Turpin with an affinity for colour changing spells. It is a pretty useless thing, even embarrassing for her, but not every bit of magic has to be useful in combat. On the other hand, in the same story, Katie's friend Leanna has a natural affinity for potion making and has an intuitive understanding of the ingredients and their interactions. While certainly useful, that doesn't make her the forensic lab of CSI Hogwarts either.

*** Bit late but Leanna's gift is very similar to how Lily was described by Slughorn because he describes her as 'intuitive' and 'instinctive' so it's not too far out of canon possibility! That's actually pretty neat. I can totally see Lily having a natural talent for it and Snape altering Potions to keep up with her.

** Regarding metamorphmagii, we know they're born and not made, so my theory is that it's a recessive gene and Teddy got it from his mother's X chromosome where there was nothing to counter it on his father's Y. I figure it could also come about in a mutation.

For languages, DD does speak Mermish, but Merpeople are people, not animals, so not really on the same spectrum as Parseltongue. Maybe there's someone like Radegast the Brown with birds that live in his hat and poop down the side of his face? One of the regular posters has a story where a female Harry can talk to spiders.

Traveling through reflections is a neat idea. I wonder what would happen if one tried to travel via the Mirror of Erised?

** These specialized abilities seem to be restricted to certain lines, which is possibly why the Gaunts ended up so inbred (to make sure Parsletounge was passed on), though some get their start spontaneously it seems (Tonks) before being passed on for some time. So I think that's likely then origin of Parsletounge as well. In my current story, such extra abilities (called "Extras", because I'm so clever) are passed down what is essentially the magic equivalent of DNA as opposed to their normal DNA.

It'd be neat if someone, say, had the ability to cheat a bit, like creating sturdier conjugations of whatever they wanted (within reason). Or maybe one where someone has like a reverse Felix Felesis ability where they can make everything around them go awry for a short time. I dunno.

Also: Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy in a way that doesn't copy the concept of the Avatar series.\\
I am always thinking, when it comes to element-based magic, that the its probably the most archaic form of magic. People, that discovered the ability to do something magical, copied the strongest forces they encountered to help better their life or be stronger in wars between tribes. Those forces most likely were part of nature. Thunderstorms, lightning strikes, gigantic tidal waves, erupting vulcanos, bush fires etc.

I'd like to see the Monsters from the Dreamtime of the aboriginal people getting defeated by the chants of the shamans, fighting for the lifes of their tribesmen. I want to read about the maori dancing their wardance and summoning the spirits of their ancestors to guide them in battle.\\
I want to read about the Norse, entering the Furor Teutonicus, the state of a Berserker, enhancing their body and mind by magic.

I want to read of grand battles, in which they (the sorcerer) summon the forces of nature to do their bidding.\\
