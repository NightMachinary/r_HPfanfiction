** Harry has enough money, so I doubt he's corrupt in this sense.

But his weakness is his longing for a family, and I totally expect him to cut some serious slack for those whom he considers "family".

A few years ago, there was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qxmgc/are_the_weasleypotters_the_new_super_wizarding/][a thread here about postwar Weasleys]], and that's what I wrote:

Yes, and here are some of my assumptions:

- Our characters were NOT saints to begin with. Harry was quite proud crucioing Amycus Carrow near the end of DH. Hermione had a huge vindictive streak such as keeping a slanderer in a jar for several days and permanently scarring fellow students. Ginny's aggressive and mean streaks were well described in Book6. Ron was ready to kill Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe.
- Wars hardens and changes people, especially when you were tortured and saw your friends and families die. You wouldn't be lenient toward your enemies, who also turned out to be sadistic and genocidal maniacs anyway.
- Politics are inherently dirty, more so if life and death struggles were involved. According to JKR, our heroes made it to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic within several years. You shouldn't expect them to be 'innocent' children anymore, but cunning politicians and hardened warriors.

Based on the above assumptions, here is what I think would happen after the War:

The Battle of Hogwarts created a huge power vacuum as a result. Not only did most Voldemort's Inner Circle and Death Eaters go down, even the Ministry's own forces had to be decimated since Minister Thickness himself was drafted to the frontline. This Battle had to be so bloody that JKR skimmed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/54c4y9/battle_of_hogwarts/d80mg1b/][those gory details]] mostly. By default, the DA and what remained of the Order became the only credible and organized military after the Battle.

Harry had to be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would get themselves organized and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. The Ministry would be in no shape to resist their wraths.

I think their entire generation was fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. Many more traumatized people of magical Britain would also demand massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major shortcoming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

After the First War, the public went easy on Voldemort's sympathizers, and watched where that led to. But as the phrase 'Fool Me Once, Shame on You; Fool Me Twice, Shame on Me!' goes, they would more likely to go overboard this time. Harry and his friends, in their zeal to prevent the rise of another Voldemort, might have created a much more controlling government as the result. Harry apparently was very successful in his job, since he became the youngest police chief ever in 2007. He seemed to often fight on the front lines himself, and would have earned the loyalty of his troops. It would not be too far fetched to consider Aurors to be his private army.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?

*** There is no way anyone is denying Harry anything after the war. Being their only hope and then defeating Lord Voldemort at 17, even if Harry isn't some super wizard every one who doesn't know him is likely to think that. Defeating the most powerful Dark Lord with 50 years of Dark Arts knowledge and experience with a 6th years education? He could literally get away with a completely unjustified murder, he could walk into a shop steal something and the owners would thank him for coming, nobody would ever deny him anything. It is a good thing canon Harry doesn't enjoy abusing power because he could easily create a government more controlling than Voldemort's if he wanted. What you're saying is totally a possible.

Although, I do think canon Harry wouldn't be doing it intentionally if he did. Considering how he reacts to people dying because of something he started in the past he would likely be grieving for a few months before he got back on his feet, along with most people. People like Kingsley and Professor McGonagall are more likely to put things back together and by the time Harry gets out of his funk most of the work would probably be done. A 17 year old is going to be extremely traumatized after a battle like that and I highly doubt he, or anyone else, would get into revolutionary mode. So I doubt they went overboard on the death eaters but once he got into the ministry he would likely be making better changes and would likely be unstoppable in the Wizengamot. Not to mention he would have to go through Auror training for presumably a year or two, cutting out some revolution time.

But yeah the Potter-Weasleys would control the wizarding world for sure after the war, but I doubt they would go into revolution mode and overly punish the death eaters and make things super controlled, other people would be punishing them.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** Perhaps not exactly what you are looking for, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][This story]] by Refreshingly Original manages to craft a Harry that seems somewhat divorced from "nice-guy"ness.

It isn't exactly a feature I like about the story. It's a crossover w/ avengers and not much has happened in the story.

One thing that does happen is that Harry kills a guard so they can't tell anyone about him and his abilities. This guard is employed by a dubious organization that pulled Harry from his home and family, and Harry does feel bad when he finds a picture of the guard's daughter, but the weight is disproportional. It feels like Harry spends an equal amount of time agonizing about using charms to trick muggles into giving him free rooms and food. (though he does so liberally). I don't know, there's enough to the fic to enjoy. It seem like the narrative is building up speed, so if it gets updated, it would be cool to see what happens.
