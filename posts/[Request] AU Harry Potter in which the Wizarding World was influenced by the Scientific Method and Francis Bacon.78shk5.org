The Statute of Secrecy was established in 1692. Francis Bacon published "Novum Organum Scientiarum" in 1621. What if the Wizarding World was as heavily affected by the Scientific Method and Rationalism as the Muggle World? Surely Magic must follow a repeatable logic on account of the fact Spells work. Canonically we know other Wizarding that muggle philosophy has either run parallel to or influenced important wizards (Gellert Grindelwald seems to follow the Amoral philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche).

I'm not looking for a rationalist's outlook on the canonical HP Universe such as Methods of Rationality but an AU wherein the Wizarding World (or at least the approach to studying and learning magic) is rationalist.


** Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) attempts to make much of the wizarding world make sense. Of course these answers eventually lead to a huge divergence from canon.

Wizards are also very aware of the muggle world (Dumbledore is firmly a Deontologist, where as Scridgemore is a Utilitarian, and the two discuss the differences in their philosophical views).

Some highlights include a discussion of the economy (and why the Weasleys are even poor when magic exists)

#+begin_quote
  The older man shrugged [at Harry]. "Most common wizards don't have a lot of currency because they don't need it. With limited exceptions for food and shelter, magic can give you whatever you need to survive. If you know how to apparate, you can transport yourself almost anywhere. If you're good with Transfiguration, you can make most everyday items you need. If you know the Reparo Charm, nearly anything tangible you buy will last a lifetime or longer. In all of Diagon Alley, there are only four stores that sell clothing because only rich wizard-folk -- or wizard-folk who want to be perceived as rich -- bother to pay for clothing produced by other wizards instead of simply transfigured out of used garments. I believe the comparable Muggle term is post-scarcity society.

  Most wizard-folk only need galleons in large quantities if they decide to operate a business of some kind, and they usually get the money from investors among the old rich families."
#+end_quote

as well as (explained in another part of the fic) why we don't see a lot of investment from wizards (no stock exchange, no real startups/businesses):

#+begin_quote
  Draco pressed on. "Tell me, Father, do you know what a stock exchange is?"

  Lucius's eyes narrowed slightly. "I am ... familiar with the term."

  "Then perhaps you can explain to me why wizards don't have one. Is it something the Muggles have thought of that we just haven't yet?"

  Lucius went very still at that, and Draco suddenly began to wonder if he'd overstepped his bounds. Then, in a swift motion, Lucius slid his holdout wand from its place of concealment in the walking stick that never left the man's side. Draco's eyes widened.

  "Okay, my father is about to use the Cruciatus on me. I guess I did push too far."

  But to Draco's surprise and relief, Lucius aimed his wand over the boy's shoulder and fired off powerful locking and privacy charms at the door. Then, he rested the wand in his lap and regarded his son intently for a moment before speaking.

  "The current wizarding population in Great Britain is less than 30,000. It is less than half a million in Europe and about five million worldwide. Generally, but particularly in Britain, material wealth among witches and wizards is concentrated within the top 1% of the population. By some estimates, the twenty richest wizards in Britain collectively hold more galleons than the bottom three-quarters combined. Because there is so little liquidity held by the vast majority of wizards and witches, a stock exchange is an inefficient medium for investment. Rather than sell shares in a new business venture on an open market, wizards who seek to start new businesses instead sell stakes in them either to Gringotts or, more commonly, to wealthy individuals. Thus, broadly speaking, our economic system more closely mimics the Roman patronage system rather than modern Muggle venture capitalism."

  Draco stared in confusion

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

World of HPMoR has nothing to do with canon.

Anyway, how is what you want supposed to differ from canon, outside of attributing already existing scientific research of magic to Bacon?

*** Grindelwald's actions draw parallels to Nietzsche in that Nietzsche promoted the pursuit of ones goals without the bindings of a higher moral code or limitation (as I understand it) Some aspects of Nazism actually are drawn from Nietzsche and both Grindelwald and Nazism's philosophy are similar.

I've never read past the 3rd chapter or so of MoR but it seemed to be and is described as the Harry Potter setting from the view point of a rationalist.

I will note I am wanting this story to have a greater weight on the scientific methods effect of the pursuit of magic and a culture dedicated to magic (rationalism merely being an inevitable reaction to endorsing the Scientific Method).

From the perspective of a magic understood through the Scientific Method classes like Charms would make no sense. (What is a charm? Why is it different from transfiguration?) We know through science that a color change would be just as astounding as turning wood into metal.

Potions texts are described more as recipe books than text books implying to effort to apply the scientific method to potioneering has been done. We hear nothing of how or why ingredients react in the ways they do.

Magic in HP is largely rote and haphazard, more the result of centuries of wizards all adding their own spells to a big book, yet again like recipes, than understanding why spells work the way they do. I'm asking about a fundamental change in how knowledge is pursued in a society. Not a different viewpoint of the same society. Magic and the Wizarding World would NOT be like it is in canon.

#+end_quote

A charm is different from transfiguration because even if they might both do similar or identical things from a Muggle perspective (it's all just manipulating atoms!) it has a different /magical/ mechanic.

The laws of magic /are/ internally consistent, and follow their own logic; it's just not a materialist kind of logic.

#+begin_quote
  Potions texts are described more as recipe books than text books implying to effort to apply the scientific method to potioneering has been done. We hear nothing of how or why ingredients react in the ways they do.
#+end_quote

And textbooks in real life (for teenagers, at least) spend most of their time discussing /what/ has already been discovered, rather than /how/ it was discovered. It's more effective to teach the next generation to "stand on the shoulders of giants," as it were, rather than to teach the next generation to reinvent the wheel.

If you plan to go onto a career in innovation or discovery, then a finer understanding of the scientific method /is/ required; we saw that Snape was capable of great innovations in potions, and presumably those in the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers have similar competence. The Unspeakables are also surely familiar with the scientific method, for all of their experimentation.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And if they went looking for a 'why,' what explanation could they possibly find at the bottom of it all? /Why/ is about purpose, but on the fundamental level, science can only tell you /what/ happens and /how/ it happens.

If magic is actually happening right in front of your eyes, according to self-consistent non-materialist principles, then there's all of the evidence in the world to suggest that the laws of the universe are non-materialistic, in part or in whole; and it's perfectly reasonable to take it for granted that waving your wand and speaking an incantation directly causes a spell effect.

That's /what/ happens and /how/ it happens, and if there's a /why/, it's in the original design of the Wizard or Witch who invented the spell, constrained by the greater laws of magic.

#+end_quote

I think we can both agree that the muggle world was deeply influenced by the scientific method, but how many people do you know who understand -- on a fundamental level -- all of the technology they use, and how it was discovered or invented? Many many many people are just fine, treating technology as nothing more than a kind of toolbox, and giving it no more thought than that, because they're too busy living their lives and pursuing their other passions.

***** When did I say anything about this being a materialist story by necessity? Just because something isnt materialistic does not preclude it from being quantifiable. The Scientific method applied to a variety of spells would reveal far more information than 'thats how the spell was made'.

Also there is not indication that the scientific method is ever applied in potions at a higher level, in all likelihood it follows the patterns of pre-enlightenment alchemist. Their work was haphazard and disorganized and inherently secretive but it produced a number of early scientific developments such as a predecessor to the periodic table. This is likely the nature of the Unspeakables as well.

As far as Magical Laws go, the only ones I recall are the Gamps Law regarding the inability to transfigure food (which sounds more like a safety procedure than a Law assuming that Transfiguration is inherently finite) and Avada Kedavra kills you (which ends up more as a testable and accepted scientific theory than law given canon).

Also I recall the majority of my hs chemistry class being dedicated to reaction tables and foundational experiments.

'Why' is a misleading word because it can be taken to be asking for the purpose or the cause of something. When talking about Science Why always refers to the cause, never the purpose.

As far as the necessity to understand this in the average person, thats true but then why did Percy Weasley go to Hogwarts to aspire to a desk job where he may never have to cast a spell outside of convienence. (Unrelated this is a major problem I have with Canon, having the power to bend reality to your whims and one aspires to be a desk jockey). But in the US at least, the number of students that graduate and dont understand the basic of weather, physics, and mathematics are few and far between. While no one expects Hogwarts students to leave as multiple doctorates, Id hope they leave knowing more than a few rote spells and the history of the Goblin Wars.

Its only the lack of rational and scientific pursuit of understanding that has allowed the Wizarding World to Stagnate to the point it has. Century old artifacts should never be greater then the artifacts of the current age unless there is a very good reason (such as they increase in potency with age).

(This is disjointed and unorganized. I apologize.)

#+end_quote

That's a terrible simplification. Anyway, the key thing is that Nietzsche proposed pursuit of goals, yes, but by everyone. Grindelwald system was to be enlightened tyranny, which automatically implies the master-slave relationship, which Nietzche blamed for contemporary nihilistic trends. Nazis really aren't a good representation of Nietzsche's philosophy.

You may like [[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]], it is focused on Alexandra researching transfiguration and rules of magic in general.

#+end_quote

Charm is different from transfiguration because it assigns additional properties, whereas transfiguration changes object's structure. Thus charms are active and dispellable (and generally end on their own), but transfiguration has to be specifically reversed (and aside from conjuration is permanent).

#+begin_quote
  Potions texts are described more as recipe books than text books implying to effort to apply the scientific method to potioneering has been done. We hear nothing of how or why ingredients react in the ways they do.

We don't hear many things about magic as we see only fragments of a few lessons, but for example we learn about Golpalott's Third Law (note that it means that he ha more of those)

#+begin_quote
  The antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.
#+end_quote

In charms we also see students having to read multiple books about single spell as a preparation for a lesson about this spell, there also all those papers that they turn in.

#+begin_quote
  Magic in HP is largely rote and haphazard
#+end_quote

It's not, there is national research agency Department of Mysteries that exists for at least three centuries. There are scholarly journals like Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer (all mentioned in DH in context of submitting papers). It's systematized science with progress being made.

#+begin_quote
  As far as Magical Laws go, the only ones I recall are the Gamps Law regarding the inability to transfigure food (which sounds more like a safety procedure than a Law assuming that Transfiguration is inherently finite)
#+end_quote

It's one law, and the inability to create nutrious food is one of Five Principal Exemptions to it. And what "safety precaution"? How did you even reach that convulted idea? It directly mentions that you can't create food that will nourish you if you don't start with food. No "don't eat tranfigured things" or anything like that.

#+begin_quote
  and Avada Kedavra kills you (which ends up more as a testable and accepted scientific theory than law given canon).

That's not a law, that's just how this spell works.

Wizarding World is not stagnated it both progress magically and changes socially. The only examples of old artifacts that are cool and uncopy-able are Hallows. And someone in the future probably rediscover what they used to make such potent magical items. Knowledge is lost if it isn't passed, I don't know why this is such a weird concept for you.

Actually, they do.
