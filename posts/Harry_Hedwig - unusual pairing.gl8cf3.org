  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

** An abandoned story by grenouille7777 called More Than Familiar had a interesting twist on the Harry/Hedwig bond. It is close to what your looking for except for the story happening at the end of OOTP. It's a shame it was never finished. Be aware it does include some explicit scenes.

  While searching the Black Library for something to destroy Riddle, Harry is led by his oldest, dearest friend to an ancient tome. After reading it, their lives are further linked and forever changed. Very unusual pairing.

However, during his fourth year, a mishap happens that'll change his life and a few others forever. Harry/McGonagall/Multi - if you don't like this paring, don't read on.

So you know, the story as teken a life of its own, and because of this, you'll find that this story as taken a darker path... so you have been warned. Harry'll no longer care about the wizarding world, he'll not be evil in such he'll go out to kill everyone, but he won't be good in such he'll save everyone who is in trouble, unless he can get something out of it. He'll protect what is his, and nothing else... that doesn't mean he'll won't deal with Voldy when the time comes.
