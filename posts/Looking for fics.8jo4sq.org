Alright In the fic "core threads" Harry goes to another dimension and helps his female counterpart, now I've read another story where Harry just up and appeared in another dimension doesn't know how he got there and helps and then falls in love with his female version before getting sent away by the Illuminati or some shit really kinda weird BUT I'm looking for any story's where he goes to another dimension or alternate reality and helps his counterpart whether it's his female counterpart or it's just another version of him.


** There's about a million version of SilverAegis's story. But, you're probably just looking for linkffn(11160991). It's pretty boring and repetitive, but it's well written.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
