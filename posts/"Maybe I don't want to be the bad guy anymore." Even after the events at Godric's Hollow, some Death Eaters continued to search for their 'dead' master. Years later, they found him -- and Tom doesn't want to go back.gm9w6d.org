Perhaps, it was due to magic, or existing as a wraith for many years. But Tom Riddle, formerly known as Lord Voldemort, does not want to go back -- to being a monster, to England, you name it.

He is still powerful, more than most magical folk. He has just turned over a new leaf -- if only the DE's understood that.

** PART ONE OF TWO

"My Lord, I don't understand - "

Tom gestured for Bellatrix to sit across from him on the rug in front of the fire.

"Please, Bellatrix, it's Tom now. I've long since realised the futility of raising yourself above others."

Bellatrix's nose wrinkled at such a common name. Later she would realise that was the moment she began to see the Dark Lord as human; after all, it's hard to idolise "the Dark Lord Tom."

"Tom, why-y-y-y?!" She drew the syllable out into a whine.

"What can I say?" He shrugged. "There comes a time when you've been thwarted by the eleven year old you couldn't kill as a baby, and as you 're hurtling out of your faithful servant's decaying form you just find yourself thinking: "God, what am I doing here? How is this my life now?" It's sobering, Bella."

"Surely, you could still kill Potter or have another do it for you?"

"I could. But why? Because he offended my pride by besting me? I am a wraith, Bella. And what for? Blood purity? Magic? It's nothing in the end. In the end, we all die and we all feel pain. It is arrogance of the highest order to believe otherwise. I ran from pain and death and all I found was more of the same. I was so scared of dying that I forgot to live!"

The spirit formerly known as Voldemort became quite agitated. The walls began shaking.

"Uh... My Lord..." She looked with concern about her.

"I destroyed so many lives! So many! My loyal Death Eaters! Random muggles! People who just didn't agree with me! How fucked up is that...?"

Bellatrix became very worried as debris began to fall into the fireplace. She sat transfixed as she was torn between fleeing the destruction and the sight of a once Dark Lord purging his sins.

The wraith ascended and pieces of the falling cabin seemed to fall upwards and surround him as he seemed to glow red.

"I killed my own family because they didn't want me! I killed Myrtle Warren because I wanted to be better than /someone,/ anyone!" He vomited out the names of every person he ever killed and why in a long string of remorse. He ended with "I murdered the Potters because I wanted their baby dead. A baby who grew up unloved, unwanted and yet still managed to not hate the world!" The remains of the ex-cabin closed around him as a cocoon. "I'm so sorry." The harsh whisper cut across the air.

Suddenly all Bellatrix could hear were screams. Screams of Tom, screams of countless others. She sobbed to hear such pain.

Miles away, in a small bedroom with barred windows in Surrey, Harry Potter suddenly felt curiously light and optimistic. Sure, Uncle Vernon had locked him in his room and Aunt Petunia was keeping him on starvation rations, but suddenly it dawned upon him: Life can literally only get better from this moment. It was heartening.

Back in Albania, the cocoon made of debris fell away and revealed a naked, unconscious man. He floated to the ground and magic lay him gently down. Bellatrix ran over to him and turned him over.

"My Lord! My Lord! Tom!"

His crimson eyes flew open.

To be concluded later...

*** PART TWO OF TWO

When Bellatrix had escaped from Azkaban (blame that old fool Fudge, leaving his wand poking out of his pocket during his annual inspection) she had been prepared for death and destruction - her own and others. She had not been prepared for an ex-Dark Lord to re-corporealise in front of her eyes. Nor had she been prepared for what followed.

Tom was not some vision of teenaged beauty after The Incident (as Bella mentally labelled it). He looked good for his age, albeit skinny and gaunt, but the most distinctive new feature was a pink puckered shiny scar over his heart. A scar shaped like a fork of lightning. Tom wore it like a badge of honour, refusing to wear a shirt for most of the year; he would occasionally touch it reverently and call it his "proof of life."

After a life of destruction, Tom was determined to create. Firstly, he created a new wand - wandless was all well and good, but it lacked finesse. Then with his new wand (beech and unicorn hair - surprisingly flexible) he re-built his cabin and set a series of complicated wards, enchantments and an arcane geas. With that The Sanctuary was born.

The misguided, the lost, the unwanted and those seeking a second chance all found their way to Albania, even if they didn't always know how they got there themselves. They would be greeted at the gate by a woman with heavy-lidded dark eyes and lead to a scarred, middle-aged man wearing nothing but a skirt and a broad-rimmed wizard's hat. Eccentric appearance, notwithstanding, his very gaze seemed to pierce your soul. Eventually he would smile and invite them to stay, albeit with a warning that second chances should not be taken lightly.

All some people needed was space to exist. Room to farm or build a shop. Others were strongly encouraged to reflect upon their past misdeeds and think how they might move forward. One such person was Severus Snape.

He arrived clutching a travel bag and looking hunted. Tom snorted softly when he saw him at the gates, having a very terse chat with Bella. Doubtless Dumbledore had sent him. Old meddler. Tom might have reformed, but he was still somewhat bitter over the Transfiguration teacher that vilified a scared child when he might have guided and mentored him.

"I come seeking to serve the Dark Lord," were the first words to drop from Snape's mouth.

"You will find no Dark Lord here, Severus. Only an old man who knows better now. Nor will you find servitude. Only second chances and those strong enough to take them." Tom surveyed the flabbergasted Potions Master coolly, dropping his Occulemency shields low enough to let him see exactly who he was dealing with. "You owe me no allegiance, but I do owe you an apology."

"For what, my Lord?" The idea of an apology itself seemed to startle him.

"Tom." He corrected. "Lords are for peasants and quaint ceremonies. I am sorry, Severus, for not understanding that you loved Lily Potter and dismissing it. For forcing you into Albus Dumbledore's arms. I am sorry for the pain her death caused you. But above all this, I am sorry for seeing your need for belonging and family and manipulating it mercilessly."

"I made my choices!" Snape snarled. "You do not get to claim credit!"

"Perhaps. But I certainly made it easier to make certain choices above others. However, any choices you made after that are on your own head." Tom frowned. "Teaching, Severus, really? It's plain you hate it. And children as a concept."

"Someone has to protect Potter. I owe it to the woman you killed." Snape sniped.

"How's that going for you? I am not going after the boy ever again, I'm not that stupid. So you would stay to torment the boy out of what? Love? Obsession? Habit?" Tom went to leave. "If you want to be your own man, there is a place for you here."

Tom went at sat cross-legged on his porch, watching the hustle and bustle of the growing settlement about him. Pureblood? Werewolf? Who gave a damn when there was a harvest to gather and houses to build? He sensed Severus sit down next to him.

"First there was my Father" Snape said quietly. "Drunk and controlling. Then there was you: Domineeeing and giving me a place to belong. Then there was Dumbledore - demanding allegiance and blind trust in exchange for a chance at redemption. I don't know what it is "to be my own man.""

"We need an apothecary. And a potioneer. Why not start with what you know and work your way up from there?" Tom grinned. "Besides, if you really want to keep Potter safe you should stay here and keep an eye on me."

For the first time in years, Snape smiled.

Time went forward and The Sanctuary grew with "just Tom" as its unofficial mayor. Misfits of the magical and Muggle world kept appearing and anything resembling the Statute of Secrecy went out the window. It was surprisingly harmonious once the first pub opened.

Within a year they even had a small primary school. Tom was considering what to do with any older children who manifested magic when a magically-amplified cry from the gates caught his attention.

"Tom! I need you here! Now!" Bellatrix called with a note of panic.

He ran. At the gate stood, a very scared and skinny-looking Harry Potter with his trunk in tow and a great black dog in front of him, who was busy barking and growling at Bella incessantly.

Green eyes met red.

"Well... Shit." The words slipped out of Tom's mouth.

If he really wants to live forever he'd abandon the whole 'dark lord' thing and keep his head down.

*** Idea: How do we know he /didn't/ do that?

E.g. realizes all his horcruxes are likely compromised when Harry starts actively going after them in Deathly Hallows, decides its too risky, and he'll wait harry out then come back and have another go in fifty years or so. But he knows he can't just disappear- people will hunt him down. So, after he arranges to destroy the Horcrux he accidentally left in Harry, he makes one last Horcrux for safety and then fakes his own death at the hands of his own rebounding curse.

Maybe he even shared this plan with his most loyal followers, having them fake similar falls. Isn't it weird that not only did Bellatrix Lestrange die at the hands of /Molly Weasley,/ but that in the movie Molly's killing curse caused Bella to /disintegrate?/

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
