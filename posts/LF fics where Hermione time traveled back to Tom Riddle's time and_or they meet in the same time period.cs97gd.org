#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Because I have no idea how to use the linkffn bot, here's a good one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion]]

SUMMARY: When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

  It seemed ironic that the one thing that could ruin the magical world, the defeat of Voldemort, and Hermione Granger's perfectly ordered life was a book. Time-travel fic. Tom/Hermione. DH-compliant.

  Nothing but tragedy had come from the Final Battle, not even when Harry and Hermione had been hurtled into the past. But Tom Riddle changes things, and finally, Hermione could tell that she would be seeing sunny skies again. Finished in 2006, may edit.
