I'm looking for a bit of writing advice, if anyone cares to help.

The problem is pretty general, actually, but it applies to multiple fandoms, not just Harry Potter, though it is pretty obvious in that one.

How do we handle the loopholes the author left? Specifically, the ones which should logically lead to extreme power, but, in canon, clearly /don't/.

There are several examples I could call upon, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runes]] being an old standby in fanficiton of course, but having recently reread HBP, I'm going to go with spell creation.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sectumsempra][Sectumsempra]] is a powerful dark cutting curse, with clear advantages over the more common [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Severing_Charm][Diffindo]] both in the severity of damage it inflicts and the difficulty in repairing the damage. Snape invented this spell in his sixth (or possibly seventh) year.

Think about that. A school child invented a powerful, /lethal/ spell. Snape was apparently making strides towards excellence in potions and magic while still below the age of majority. So the question arises: where are all the other people inventing spells?

Now, there seems to be three resolutions to this conundrum from a canon perspective:

1) *The easy road to power is not really so easy; there are pitfalls and perils we simply do not see in the story.* Using the example of Snape's spells, inventing a new spell is actually extremely time consuming and difficult; not anyone can do it and most people don't bother.

2) *The easy road to power is awful and costly; most sane people don't consider the advantages worthwhile.* Snape's cutting charm required costs in the form of long experimentation, likely on himself, or foul rituals, or even simply very expensive components for rituals etc which most people would balk at paying.

3)*The easy road to power is non-intuitive; most people simply would not consider following that path.* Spell invention is a very esoteric field, normal people aren't interested in pursuing it or it requires a mindset which is difficult to achieve, and is generally uncommon.

4)*Not everyone can become powerful due to some additional factor.* Snape is a special special snowflake with just the correct bloodline/magical core/angelic blessing/prophesied destiny to become strong. Everyone else can go hang.

Now, I am absolutely sure someone will skim through this post and talk about how Sectumsempra isn't that great a spell, but that really really isn't what I'm shooting for here discussion wise, there are obvious up and down sides to the spell, we are using it as only as a template for the system by which new things can be incorporated beyond canon powers.

I also completely understand that the author likely just didn't realize they were making such a loophole, or didn't consider it relevant to the story, or wouldn't have thought of the problem as being an actual problem.

I need advice on which method to favor, and how extreme to make it (though it will likely be a mix of all three anyway). Each possible solution to the problem seems to leave a pretty big hole regardless which should make the story tilt rather AU if followed through.

For example, if we assume (1), then *any* motivated person should become highly powerful, dark or light. After all, Harry isn't going to say 'that sounds too hard' if the best route to beating Voldemort is inventing a new spell.

If we assume (2), then the dark side should have disproportionate power. Even if the 'cost' is merely a personal one, rather than sacrificing virgins at the new moon or whatever, it seems likely that people already trending towards psychopathy would be more willing to cut off their own arms to replace them with [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew's_silver_hand][magical prosthetics]].

If we assume (3)... well we really can't actually. Not unless the population is very, very small. This is something I've actually got some first hand experience with: new ideas are hard to come by. On more than one occasion I have had an idea for a story, only to then read of a /very similar/ idea in another story, often times as a central plot element (it can be quite frustrating, but more often it's a boon since I am a pretty slow writer and the stories are good). Coming up with an idea no one else has had is /very rare/, though I suppose this means that if you /do/ manage to scrape one together you could get a big leg up on the competition.

If we assume (4) then most of the world wouldn't bother trying very hard and a smattering of people would rule everything. It also means the universe is weird, because exceptions to rules don't normally happen. Everything obeys the law of gravity. If our hero can just ignore gravity whenever they want to because they are 'special' then there should be /lots/ of exceptions like that occurring all the time. Even rare things aren't truly rare, just uncommon; in a large group we should see it cropping up semi regularly. Even then we should still see some people falling into a sort of middle ground, with only weaker levels of 'specialness' or variations on existing types of 'specialness'.

I have my own pet theories on why most of the Magicals in HP aren't super powerful in canon, but I would love some outside input. Many a fanfic features a protagonist reaching unfathomable heights of power by exploiting a system which was poorly defined in the canon world. But the real world (of the story) is not poorly defined; we simply don't know the definitions.


** I think that there's something important to keep in mind in these discussions, and that is that to wizards and witches, /magic may well seem mundane/.

After all, they've been around it for their entire lives. They're used to seeing their parents using magic for things like transportation and domestic activities. This is roughly equivalent, I feel, as us seeing our parents ride in cars and using everyday appliances.

Despite seeing these marvels of technology that would have jaws dropping just a few generations ago, few people feel an absolute need to understand everything there is about technology.

Why, then, should wizards and witches feel a burning drive to learn magic? Most jobs are unlikely to require a mastery of magic, so why would you spend countless hours practicing magic when you don't really need it in the end?

If you can answer that (and I have no answer to that), then you have a few more questions left, but the rest are good opportunities to world build.

(1) How do normal witches and wizards interpret these beings who are hand-and-foot way better than normal folk. Is there a religious-like worship? Are they scorned? You'd expect society to be super revolved around these few people.

(2) Political change must be frequent. If a select few are way better than the rest, than whichever faction in a conflict contains these few will win. If there's only a few key players, then it's very likely for one side to dominate (by luck alone).

(3) Why do these wizards not attempt to spread their teachings? Do they do so only to a select few apprentices? If Dumbledore told me he could turn my son into a powerhouse, why wouldn't I go with them?

How you answer the above 3 questions can be really cool worldbuilding for a fic. But the big question of "why are most wizards not like these people" is still there.

Dumbledore did decades of research and work, studied under Flamel, and collected knowledge from all over the world to be as powerful as he is. Voldemort went through decades of travel through mysterious places in the world and learned magic unknown to most of the world to gain his power.

Why should a normal wizard or witch, who got through his exams and managed to land a job good enough to sustain his family, even think of spending decades learning magic and plotting to gain power? Power comes at the cost of effort, and people are inherently lazy. The easiest solution is rarely the grandest one isn't it?

It's not that Snape is particularly awesome, he's the equivalent of the intelligent nerd in the corner coding his own Linux system. More power to him, but most people have their own goals and are happy (mostly) to use the standard operating system.

Magic in the HP world is a function of intelligence, knowledge, need and the ability to think in the right path. That is not common. And the least common part of that is *need*. Anybody can pick up a pen and start drawing, or writing or pick up a cheap computer and start coding, pick up a set of tool and start building things. The ones that actually do *and* do in a way that yields remarkable results are rare, really really rare.

And they do exist in the HP world. As another poster said: Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Riddle for easiest name recognition.

** There's an option you haven't mentioned: some people are just special.

I know a lot of the 'enlightened' members of the fandom don't like that, but it's fairly clear that it's true in canon. Look at Riddle, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, the Marauders, Snape, etc. They were all doing so much just as teens in school and even then, there are clear differences in ability between them. They are beyond just about anything the Trio and their yearmates are shown doing, the Harry Potter generation are a bunch of fucking slackers by comparison.

*** It's not the ability, but more so the motivation.

Riddle and Grindelwald wanted to change the world. Dumbledore wanted to atone for Gellert and Ariana. Even Harry wanted to at first end Voldemort and then live through the Prophecy. Snape wanted to be better than his bullies, a motivation I can sympathise with. Remus wanted to rise above his Werewolf status. Sirius wanted to change his stigma as a Black, Peter wanted to fit in, and James wanted to be better in the eye of Lily, who wanted nothing to do with him. The Twins, brought up in poverty, wanted to use every skill they had to bring their family out of poverty.

Not everyone has that motivation. Not everyone has the will to act on it. It's not the power or magic that sets an individual apart, but their will to /do/ something.

** There is another option. Magic is more than just something to be controlled. Maybe it isn't sentient per say, but it is definitely /aware/. Unbreakable Vows would not be unbreakable unless magic was aware of what constitues as a breaking of the vow.

Let us look at your example of Sectumsempra. By the sixth year of Snape's education, he was being targeted nearly exclusively by the Marauders. We can assume that it is around this time (maybe fifth year) that James saved Snape. Sectumsempra is not more lethal than any other cutter, except for the bleeding. Snape was one against four, and if magic itself responded to his need to create something to both defend himself and get revenge, then it makes sense Sectumsempra would be the logical choice.

A curse that severs all ties, that cuts through anything. It is the perfect offense against James Potter, who was skilled with Transfiguration. It was a perfect response to Black, who despised Dark Magic. The wounds from it cannot be healed except with a specific counter, similar to the bite/wounds from a werewolf.

If we assume magic is responsible for the creation of its own uses, then we can change how we see witches and Wizards. Magic, being sentient or aware enough to dictate how it allows itself to be used, would equate to Magicals /never/ mastering magic. But becoming knowledgable enough in magical use to explain it to others. This explaination also clears up issues in the DoM. Magicals have created Time Turners, yet cannot go back beyond a certain point. Magicals do not understand what is behind the locked door in the DoM, never mind "masters" of magic study it extensively. Magicals aren't allowed to know all about magic because magic itself does not allow it.

If we assume that magic is not sentient, then and only then do your solutions come into play.

** I think as with everyday life, people's apptitudes and skill levels vary wildly.

Take Lockhart as an example - playing armchair psychologist - it's fair to say he is a narcissist. Driven to seek acclaim/approval/validation. Possibly stemming from years of being told how utterly crap at everything he is (and he is, by his own admission). The only exception is memory charms. He uses that skill and parlays it into an (ill-gotten) life of public adoration.

So my own headcanon is that spell creation is an area where far fewer people have the necessary skills/talents in combination with the desire to pursue it.

** As a frame of reference, I like to think of inventing a new spell as equal to inventing a new tool. Some spells are so commonly useful that everyone has it as part of their repertoire; diffindo = knife. More complex tools or spells usually come about due to special needs within an industry; Horton-Keitch Braking Charm = ABS brake system.

Thus, you get specialized spells like Sectumsempra, which is a cutting curse that makes several bleeding cuts that reopen when charmed closed by any but the proper counter-curse = depleted uranium rifle ammo that isn't quite so depleted. That last may not be the best example, since the rounds aren't the tool, but you get the idea. [I was going to use Jem'Hadar pulse rifles that leave anti-coagulants in their targets, but not everyone here is that nerdy to get the reference].

The twins are producing or in some cases reselling disposable end-products; a new kind of silly string or specially-recorded erotic audio novels. The tools are part of the task, but it's the end-product that is original, and that they can sell and sell again.

So, spell-makers are not unlike machinists, who take the pieces of simpler technologies and grind them into shape to suit a specific purpose. Not a widely-trained skill set, but very useful, even essential, if you're in the industry.

In HP magic is like additional "layer" of reality. It is governed by its own rules that are different from those that govern "mundane layer" (physics, chemistry, biology, etc). Spells, potions, etc. they are like new technology, they are not easy to create, and many spells that are widely used in books are fairly recent creation. For example mending charm (reparo) was created in XVIII century.

Interesting example are unlocking charms. Alohomora was created in Africa and arrived in Britain in XVII century. Before then Open Sesame, and Portoberto were used, both more crude and causing damage to the opened doors. So, as you can see it's not easy to create a spell that do what you want.

Why some people create spells while in schools, while majority doesn't? Well, as with real life, some people are prodigal. And Snape is often noted and shown as one of those.

** I think it's actually a combination of 2 and 3. If you remember, Luna's mom died because she made a mistake in spell creation. So, an adult witch who was presumably both intelligent and experienced still had a non negligible risk of death. In canon we really only see evidence of Snape creating spells. The twins seem to have more potions than new spells and the Marauders original creation is an artifact we have no idea if spells are even involved. So it might just be that Snape was willing to risk death from spell creation, or maybe wasn't aware of the risks involved.

Like, why make a spell that basically acts like a sword when you have /an instant-death spell?/

Though I also like the concept of certain spells using different languages; say, Salazar Slytherin using spells that require Parselmouth.

For (3), I'm with [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]]'s coding analogy. How many people are /good/ programmers (ditto for writers, artists, whatever)? It takes time, effort, and talent. And remember, magical Britain's population is only a few thousand by WoG--maybe a million worldwide.

The stuff you said about spell creation seems good, but just because it's not said in the books doesn't make it a loophole. Coming up with explanations like this is part of what fanfiction is about. However, you seem to be equating being able to invent spells with being powerful, with no justification.

Also, there doesn't necessarily have to be an explanation for why someone is powerful. It could be that some people are just naturally more powerful than others.

And now I win at everything. The end.

I think you might be missing the point I was trying to make: in canon we don't have a reason for why the world is the way it is. There must /be/ a reason and fanfic tries to find that reason. but some people don't try to find a cause for the condition we observe, they just let the MC ascend to god mode because... idk, 'reasons'.

You do raise a valid point though, I need to add premise 4. Magical cores are an old standby in fanfic, and would be a legitimate reason why only some people get to be really strong.

Don't include any "spells of instant win". It's not going to be a great story if the author allows them to solve any problem with an invented spell. (It's pretty much the same as letting the MC ascend to god mode). Even if there is a reason for being able to create such a overpowered spell, it's unlikely to be satisfying to readers unless there is a greater than or equal cost. That doesn't seem possible with the spell you described, so maybe tone it down a bit and think about what sort of spell might be reasonable.
