I really love elsewhere fics, where the author uses the world of a story but uses it to tell their own story with original characters and plots. I am wondering if there are any good ones for Harry Potter?


** Oh and also this one, I think. Haven't read it, but looks alright. Linkffn(Starnlicht)

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Linkffn(Basilisk-born; a long journey home) kind of fit, since most of the action happened in the past. But they both eventually involve already known characters, so maybe not quite what you want.

Alexandra Quick, on the other hand, is completely made of OCs. Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I am writing one that fits your Elsewhere classification! :) I will put it on my Quotev for you! It is about the ten year time between 1981, the prologue, and 1991, the real start of Philosopher's Stone, and how the world and my main characters learned to cope and move on from things. They are completely original and random magic families I made. [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10287918/Harry-Potter-Recusancy]]
