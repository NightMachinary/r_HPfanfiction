so,,, the lack of any actual descriptions of the ancient runes class in canon leaves a lot of doors open for fanfiction writers to add their own interpretations of the subject.

in your opinion, what would be the best way for a character to use runes in a fic?

uhh, fic recs where runes are a major focus are also appreciated!


** Historically, writing has been seen as a magical act for as long as humans have been doing it. Something like it happens in the Potterverse: books of dark curses bleed and scream, the Monster Book Of Monsters tries to bite the reader, and the chap in Flourish and Blotts complains about not being able to find the book of Invisibility magic.

Potterverse magic is expressed in intent and meaning. Get enough meaning together in one spot that expresses a particular intent, and magic will start to happen, if it's done by someone with enough of a spark. Runes are good for that, since the runes themselves have meaning and intent, the languages they express have no standardised spelling so you can shade the meaning you're expressing with a word by spelling it with different runes, you can get poetic to add layers of meaning with metre and kenning and all the other tricks of the versifier's trade.

Rune-spells, if you've got the time and room to write them out in the proper form with the right paint/ink/carving tools can do anything wand or potion magic can, and sometimes are a better tool for the job than either.

They're /particularly/ good for simple, single purpose permanent enchantments on objects, such as the alu-runes muggle archaeologists keep finding on old artefacts. A simple rune-charm of good luck and good health, it's no threat to secrecy since even if most of the magic hadn't run out after all these centuries, it's so weak and subtle you'd hardly notice it working.

** I think it partially depends on how real to life you want to be.

There are some stories where its just a language class where you learn old norse (and possibly old english)

There are stories where it is a form of symbolic magic and the runic alphabets are just well suited to it because of the way it is taught ie: rune poems talking about the mysteries of each character. Typically these stories mention that there are similar sigilmantic methods with Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters. I've yet to see it but in this framework Ogam would also be viable as sigilmantic system.

And then there are stories like linkffn(Harry Potter and the runestone path) where the "runes" are completely disassociated from their real life counterparts and are just vaguely described magical symbols that mean whatever the writer wants them to.

I think its kinda obvious which way i lean, but thats just me and im no writer

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

** We never see how various magical objects are made: brooms, the pensieve, the Marauder's Map, etc, so I have runes involved in their manufacture. It's not canon, but it fits into canon.

** Runes are a written language wizards used for a long time, studying them helps you read old books if you dont have the translation. They're also sometimes used as decoration, as we see on the Hogwarts Pensieve. That's pretty much how it was in Canon, and I personally enjoy it much more then what Fanon turned it into, like if Runes were that Power why wouldn't they be mandatory when Herbology is?
