** linkffn(The Power of the Mind)

Not finished, and abandoned, but it does have these segments with variations on the crux of every book. Strays a bit close to OP!Harry, so idk if you'll want to read it.

EDIT: Nope, not that one. It's by Landstradd if you want to search it up.

  THIS HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AND IS BEING POSTED NOW. CHECK OUT MY PROFILE TO READ THE, HOPEFULLY, IMPROVED VERSION. What if instead of running to the Leaky Cauldron after blowing up Marge, Harry had elected to stay in Muggle London for the summer. How does one change make a difference? Features an Independent and Powerful Harry.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826][Survival is a Talent]] by ShanaStoryteller has a similar cadence to the OG series, set to a soulmate AU backdrop. (If soulmate AUs aren't your thing, still give this one a try - like the tag says, there's surprising lack of focus on the soulmate thing)
