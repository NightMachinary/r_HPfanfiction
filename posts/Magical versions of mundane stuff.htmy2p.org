So, the main 'theme' of HP Worldbuilding is that it's all "Like IRL stuff, but with magic!". So, Wizard's Chess is Chess with Magic, Hogwarts is just boarding school with magic, dishwasher spells are just washing up with magic, Aurors are Special Branch with magic, Wizard Radio is Radio with magic, etc.

What else would you like to see a magic version of? And what do you think the magic version would be like?


** Trees with the quality of magic are used for making wands according to pottermore, so what would happen if that magic quality wood was used to make other things like furniture, ships, doors, etc?

I've also been thinking about how a magical version of television would work. Just a regular television with special receiver, some kind of larger version of the two-way mirror Sirius gave Harry in OotP, or a cheaper sort of pensieve?

‚Ä¢Whatever made Gilderoy Lockhart's smile so damn perfect??

‚Ä¢Hair potions, like the one Hermione uses for the Yule Ball. Actually, I bet Lockhart had hair potions too.

‚Ä¢Lipsticks with color changing charms so that you always have the perfect shade for you

‚Ä¢Glitter eyeliner with shooting stars that actually move

‚Ä¢Moisturizers and sunscreens that have beautification potions in them to improve your skin

‚Ä¢Mascara that tricks people into thinking you're paying attention when you're not

Shouldn't be too difficult to create a similar parchment where instead of containing a map it contains and runs a programmable calculator. If there's a way to increase data capacity, perhaps by storing data as microscopic ink dots, you could run a full handheld computer.

- I also always thought there should be a more relaxed alternative to the Knight's bus, not meant for stranded wizard but for just those looking for comfortable travel, like tapping your wand a couple times to the ground and summon a carriage drawn by winged horses(normal ones, not Thestrals).
- As for the magical version of lawyers, I always imagined that to be a trade mostly dominated by Vampires, similarly how Goblins control banking.
- I also thought a good alternative medium for wizards to experience things would be charms that let them experience specific events while asleep, similar to the day dream charms Fred and George sold, but you know more substantial and longer, basically the ultimate VR experience, like you could adapt it for only observing like a first person movie or more interactive like a video game. We also know through Pottermore that there is magic to visit Dream(Uagadou sends its invitations through visitors into Dreams), so multiplayer isn't out of question either.

** High speed flight. Seriously, when the Firebolt came out in 93', British Airways had already been operating a routine supersonic passenger service for 17 years.

The Concorde regularly flew at 1350 mph, the SR-71 did 2000 and the X-15 had hit 4500 a quarter century before. And that's without counting the Shuttle or Apollo capsules, coming in at many miles per second.

So why does everyone think that the Firebolt's top speed of 150 mph is particularly impressive? And it takes a full ten seconds to get there! Less than 0.7g average acceleration, most fighter jets have quite a bit more than that. The F-35 for example has to have over 1g acceleration, otherwise it wouldn't be able to do vertical takeoff. A max performance Tesla hits 1.2g's when you slam down the accelerator pedal.

Seriously, give me a small team of spellcrafters, magical researchers and broomstick makers and in a year or so I'll give you a broom that could win a quartermile drag race against a Tesla, fly spirals around a SR-71 (bubble head charm recommend at high altitudes) and also be fully functional in the vacuum of space, although if you want to go to another planet I'd recommend a more comfortable flying hippie bus. Perfect 60s nostalgia for visiting the Apollo sites.

*** Alcubierre drive is complicated. How about using raw power to punch a hole into spacetime? Even if you can only create wormholes with both ends directly next to each other, if you move one end to a new location at relativistic speed (just modify Arresto Momentum for propellantless thrust) then you can reach other galaxies in just decades. Nice side effect, it makes time travel by decades instead of hours almost trivial, just send a wormhole end to Alpha Centauri and back while keeping the other end on earth and you can hop through and end up 10 years in the future. If you want a billion years into the future, perhaps a restaurant at the end of the universe, that's totally doable too. I did the math on the relativistic time dilation, if you can continously accelerate one end of a pocket wormhole at multiple g's it only takes months until it's billions of years in the future. Or you could do a close flyby of a rotating black hole, spin up a regular time turner with a few hours capacity and thanks to a quirk in Relativity you can end up millions of years in the past and see dinosaurs. And everything is two way. Plus if you want to terraform a planet just drop a few kilometer sized wormhole gates into a gas giant with nitrogen and oxygen rich atmosphere, connect them to gates in orbit around a lifeless rock, and a few years later it'll have breathable air. If you don't want to wait, just send another wormhole to the planet but on a longer route that'll make it arrive when the terraforming is done, but still almost instantaneously from earth perspective (time dilation).

Tl;dr: If you can bend spacetime however you want, wormholes on relativistic ships are way more awesome than Alcubierre.

***** With Alcubierre the speed is very high but time required for a trip is still proportional to the distance, O(d). With wormholes it's instant after it's been set up. The interesting one is a constantly accelerating ship using the acceleration for gravity, which doesn't require any spacetime manipulation at all: Travel time is O(arccosh(d+1)) which for short trips approximates O(sqrt(d)), so a trip to Jupiter takes twice as long as Mars even though it's four times the distance. But for long, interstellar journeys it approximates the absolutely astounding O(log d).

Yes, you read that right, thanks to relativistic length contraction and time dilation, travel time is /logarithmic/. If acceleration is 1g it takes four years to the nearest star but just 20 years to another galaxy, which is millions of times further away. If you built an Alcubierre that could take you to the nearest star in twenty minutes instead of four years, you'd still be better off with the normal rocket if your target was Andromeda.

Due to time dilation and the twin paradoxon you really need to bring a wormhole if you want to get back, since if you turned around and spent another 20 years flying back you'd have aged by just 40 years but earth would have aged by millions of years. Without warping or holepunching spacetime you can visit other galaxies, but not return to the here and now to tell the tale. The holepunching is just wayyyy better. Plus with a relativistic ship you could actually see the big bang with your own eyes, all you have to do is accelerate for several years until the CMB in front of you is blueshifted into the visible.
