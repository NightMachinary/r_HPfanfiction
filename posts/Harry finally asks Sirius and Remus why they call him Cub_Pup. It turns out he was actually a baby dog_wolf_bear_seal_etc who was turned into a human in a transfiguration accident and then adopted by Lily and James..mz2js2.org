#+TITLE: Harry finally asks Sirius and Remus why they call him Cub/Pup. It turns out he was actually a baby dog/wolf/bear/seal/etc who was turned into a human in a transfiguration accident and then adopted by Lily and James.

The latest discussion complaining about those nicknames got thinking about how they could be properly justified, and this was what I landed on.

I also considered Harry being a natural animagus and turning into one of those animals as a child, but that didn't seem as interesting. Though I won't complain if anyone wants to use that idea, or any other unusual justification for the nicknames that they can come up with.

*** Yeah, I feel like him being a seal has the most comedic potential. Cue Fleur or Gabrielle learning about this and referring to him as “le phoque” and Harry being confused unless he knows that that's just the French word for seal.

Edit: thinking about this a little more; maybe Harry becomes a seal animagus for the second trial and is referred to as “le meuiller phoque,” or “the best seal,” but something gets lost in translation and people think that Fleur called Harry “the best fuck” or something.

**** Imagine if Gabrielle says that just as she gets out of the lake. Now that would be awkward for Harry.

***** Uh, yeah. You could spin it that way if you took fanfic creative liberties and made Gabrielle to be at least Harry's age (I've seen folks do that in other fics). That wouldn't be as bad.

Obviously you wouldn't be able to post it here if such activities actually took place, but if it was falsely implied as a joke, I think it would be able to get by.

** Omg it would be amazing if Harry was a selkie. I only ever found one HP fic where they were used, which is really a shame.
