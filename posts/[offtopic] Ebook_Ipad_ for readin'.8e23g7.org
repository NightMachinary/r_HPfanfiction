Pretty forward i guess. I want to be able to surf, and for example read on ffn at my leisure, but im.... totally out of the loop when it comes to such devices. Would be neat if it had smthing against eye-fatigue as i read really much. Basicly im unsure when it comes to ebooks t.ex. that they allow browsing?(because they want ya to buy the ebooks duh) I would connect to my own wlan of course.

~120€ budged

pretty sorry if i aint allowed to ask this here because its not...directly on the topic of fiction but .... ya know, FOR reading fiction.

** I swear by e-Ink for reading. The screen is much more pleasant to my eyes.

On the flip side, while there is technically a web browser on my old Kindle, it's not what I'd call practical. Newer versions with higher screen resolution could be better.

*** With the new kindle paperwhites (slightly better cpu) the browser is pretty usable, especially if you turn off images and javascript. Plus you should be able to browse to fanfic sites like ao3 and download ebooks directly from there, as long as they are in mobi format. Even if they are not you should be able to use an online fanfic downloader (all that from within the kindle itself without the need of other computers).

** A tablet works well enough (although you might need a screen dimming app, depending on the device if you want to read at night). I used an old Acer Iconia Tab until it stopped working (thing was 180€ or so) and now a Huawei tablet for 260€. Not sure what tablet there is in your budget, but the fanfiction.net app runs on Android and get's the job done.

** I'd recommend the first gen iPad Mini. It's a great form factor for reading and surfing, and has a wider variety of apps than Android tablets, whose apps tend to not be optimized for the larger form factor. iBooks allows you to sideload epubs, and there are great, free comics readers if you're into that.

At least in the US, Amazon has them for $140 (114€).

** I prefer e-ink screens, they are more comfortable on the eyes, as they don't require light to function.

I myself use the [[https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura?utm_source=Kobo&utm_medium=TopNav&utm_campaign=Aura%202][Kobo Aura]] and [[http://ff2ebook.com/]] to download the stories into my e-reader.
