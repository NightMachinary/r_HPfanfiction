I've been working on a Founder's Fic trying to meld canon to actual history -- so having Godric in Anglo-Saxon Wessex/England and having to deal with 10th cent. politics, the founding of England, the wars with the Danes and the changing attitudes of the Church while also meeting Helga, Rowena and Salazar, generally on the other side of a battlefield, and then starting towards founding Hogwarts. Basically dealing with the world as it was, rather than a generic high-fantasy setting.

Anyway, though there's only 1 chapter posted as yet, I'm wanting some feedback while I continue writing, both from people familiar with the period to make sure I haven't screwed up, but mainly from those that aren't so familiar with it to tell me if I need to go back and do a lot more world building. Anything from 'This makes no sense' to detailed criticism would be great.

And if you do want a primer on the period, the previous ficlet in the series covers a bit of it.

Thanks! linkao3(Bold Gryffindor, Bravest of the Four)

  When Harry cast the patronus charm to save his past-self and his godfather, he unknowingly did something else. He tapped into a long forgotten part of his heritage AND caught the attention of the TSAB. Now, the “Three Aces” have been called in to investigate the strange magic that was recorded in Great Britain. What does the future hold for the “Golden Trio” now that they have to contend with not only the Triwizard Tournament, but being at the center of a secret investigation into what happened at the end of their third year? Oh, and there's also these strange dreams Harry's been having lately...

** I'm always a big fan of Founder's era fics. I've tried to a write a few of my own in the past. Most recently I also had the idea to try and incorporate as much real-life history as possible, but ultimately I didn't think I would do it justice since I'm not well-versed on that time period, so I ended up keeping it loose, focusing more on magical events.

Anyways, I read this. The main thing I don't really like is how clunky it is. The big hurdle I ran into when I started writing mine was the actual language. Obviously, modern english is way different than it was 1000 years ago. Of course, you can't actually have characters talking in old english because readers wouldn't be able to read it, and the whole point of a story is to be able to convey the story in a reasonable fashion.

Anyways, like I said, I found some of it to be a bit clunky. I know other written works use a similar style of writing , mixing the historical spelling of a word or name in that of modern writing, but I personally don't like it. Take this sentence for example -

"The next days were spent travelling through his Shire, rallying *Eadweard's* call of the *Fyrd* to fight to his *Ðegns* and men."

I don't know how any of those bolded words are pronounced, or even what they are. Sure, I can make reasonable guesses, might even be correct using context clues, but it's kind of jarring. I guess some people like that particular aspect of story telling, perhaps they find it more immersive, but for me, it's the opposite. I don't like having to guess as to what an author is trying to say, and I certainly don't want to have to google something mid-story. Having a glossary at the end of a chapter should be a clue that perhaps it's not the greatest way to tell a story, but I guess you as an author have to balance accuracy for readability.

Ultimately, it came off as very dry. Dull and boring, even. Almost like an appendix in a history novel, than an actual story. Like, there's a battle going on, but it's told in the most passive way possible and the various one-paragraph battles all blurred together.

I don't know, maybe I'm not the target audience, perhaps I'm nitpicking on stuff that's really doesn't matter. The content was fine, I guess. Interesting enough to read a second chapter? Probably not - I don't think there's enough intrigue there.

*** Thank you, this is exactly why I was asking for feedback.

I was worried about the language, and spent some time switching between anglicised versions and what it ended up as. Will probably switch back to the anglicised versions then. However, things like Fyrd (which was defined earlier) just don't have a translation, or not one that isn't automatically misunderstood due to the fact 'army' has a completely different set of connotations. I knew having a glossary meant it was pushing it a bit, but it was also the best way of putting in little extra snippets that a third-person-limited point-of-view wouldn't allow.

Thanks again though, and will work on it
