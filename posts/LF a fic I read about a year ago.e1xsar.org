:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking for this fic for ages. My phone died and I wasn't able to save it. It is a "Harry gets transported to AU" type of fic. Harry somehow ends up in the body of his alternate-self. In that world muggles know about magic and is in a state of war against Dumbledore who is evil, controlling the eastern half of Europe since Grindewald's death, and Tom Riddle is Harry's maternal grandfather who is also the headmaster of Hogwarts. If I can remember, the Harry in that world is an Auror who was a bit of a bastard during his Hogwarts years and got Hermione pregnant. It was a WIP back then, I hope someone can help me find it.


** This sounds familiar and ive looked in a few different places over the last day or so but just cannot find it.

Sorry m8 but i wanted to you know I at least gave it a solid try.
