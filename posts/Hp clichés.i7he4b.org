What are some things to avoid when writing hpfanfiction. What would be good examples that help in explaining this. Also what would you consider cliche and avoid it.


** My advice:

- Don't slavishly rehash canon in AU fics
- Don't bash
- Don't rename Harry unless he needs to hide his identity; and never call him Hadrian because this name has become the synonym for powerwanking asshole edgelord Harry
- Don't manufacture drama and angst
- Don't dumb down any character to force through a plot
- Don't write Daphne Greengrass as 'Ice Queen' unless she's great at cold based spells
- Don't write Hermione as an authority worshipper because she's not
- Don't let Harry outduel Voldemort in a straight fight after only a couple years (or even months) or training; even better, don't let a teenager Harry defeat Voldemort in a fair fight
- Don't let your heroes submit to that crap called marriage law, because in real world, even Nazis and Stalinists didn't dare to push through that kind of atrocity. Only the ultimate scumbag of the 20th century, the Khmer Rouge, did something similar!

**** It's a trope quite prevalent in this fandom, and it generally works like that:

- After the war, in order to grow the population, Wizengamot passes this law FORCING couples together
- The couples are assigned by the Wizengamot or the Ministry
- The couples must fuck in order to fulfill the law's requirement
- People who don't comply get send to Azkaban

Now imagine in real world, some corrupt government body forces you to fuck or be fucked by someone you don't even know or like. Or, some decrepit and disgusting shitheads with money and power will get to pick their favorites, and threaten torture and prison if their victims don't comply.

This trope was developed by shippers who couldn't otherwise put their outrageous pairings together

***** To be fair though it does have a great potential to re-start the war by forcing the characters to face that the Ministry is not going to get better on it's own even after they won the war. Maybe it is because I tend to ignore romance focused fanfics and pretty much all the ships this trope is usually used to force, but I myself saw it mostly done to get either a civil war started or to get Harry to leave Britain (generally to one or more countries that are so much better than the British magical society that it's like seeing someone go from the cave age to some futuristic utopia which, admittedly, gets old faster than you would expect)

**** It's usually a law after the war where people are forced to get married and have to have kids after a certain time because Voldemort killed so many people. It's usually a way to get a pairing together (like Draco/Hermione)

** Veela bond. Just... don't. Fleur's top of her class. A TriWizard champion. Order member. She's a goddamn war hero. To reduce her to a walking pile of hormones is just.. guh.

**** That's the thing about Harry/Fleur, it's soooo close to being ok. 14/17 is kinda creepy. Cho/Cedric is 15/17, is that so much better? Has Cho ever fought a dragon and saved Cedric's little sister? But give it 3 years and nobody cares.

The main thing is, 14-year old Harry still suffers from teaspoon syndrome.

** "Super clever" Harry who has a sudden awakening and total change of character for no good reason, and goes "listen here, Dumble-fuck, I do whatever I want, and you can't stop me 'cause I'm the Boy-Who-Lived", and apparently that is enough to make Dumbledore give in.

Also, Dumbledore or the Weasleys stealing money from Harry or the latter being friendly to him only because Dumbledore pays them to be. Forthe sake of "the greater good".

** Lord 7x Harry, Avada (killing curse) green eyes, House resorting - this is only forgivable if it's done in a super clever way, Ramping up Dursley abuse, Teenager Harry Potter being in anyway intellectually/magically skilled enough to go up against a sane Voldemort and win.

** Find a good plot. Plot is everything. There is nothing else.

Yes, you will get in this thread long lists of most horrible clichés happening in the HP fanfiction stories, but remember: the cliché is not the root of the problem, it just a symptom of bad writing and especially bad or missing plot. Authors don's bash Ron Weasley because that would be the thing, no, they bash him because they are not able or they are too lazy to write a good realistic romantic subplot. They don't write Ginny-doses-Harry-with-love-potions because they think it is a good idea, but because of the teenage moral inversion and because they think by writing something so outrageously stupid they will attract attention (they don't, because there are ten zillion stories like this hoping to attract attention by the shock value). Bashing Dumbledore is not the thing because it would be a good idea, but because they are not willing to subject Harry to the real suffering (like in the canon) and suddenly they found themselves without any dramatic conflict, so they hurriedly make Dumbledore into the main antagonist without any reason (and again the moral inversion).

Also, [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][this]] (and links from there), and especially [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDF0IuQ_Lx_vhnEC2MW2nEt4aVfBgul8l][this]] (talk by the author of probably the best TV series I have ever seen, or close to it).

*** Also, some people bash characters because they "deserve it" and other similar such nonsense.

Essentially bashing due to personal dislike.
