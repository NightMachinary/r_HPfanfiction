I've never liked some of the choices JK made with the story so I'm making my own. I've put there a plot device that enabled me to change canon in the direction I prefer. Here is the description:

Can magic and technology combined beat a villain that is successful in his endeavors? No. Consequences must be suffered, victories must be earned, and entertainment must be provided. Time travel with a twist, canon backstory but with one difference that quickly spirals into great changes. Starts in the middle of Harry's first year at Hogwarts.
