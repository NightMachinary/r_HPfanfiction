I look for finished good fanfics that split from 6th or 7th book and follow a search for Horcruxes or another way to defeat Voldemort. I don't like Rowling's Horcrux hunt where the trio stumbles upon Horcruxes like Felix was flowing through their veins.

I understand that it's hard to navigate through holes left by Rowling like time-turners, Felix, Veritaserum, Unbreakable Vow... but still.

Voldemort supposedly was exceptionally smart. So why would he act like a dumbass and put the diadem in the Room of Requirement when he has Chamber of Secrets? Ok, he thought that he was the only one who knew about it, but he'd known for a fact that no one will stumble upon the Chamber by chance.

Why wasn't he concerned for his Horcruxes at all until only Nagini remained? Let's follow his thought process: Harry Potter is the only threat for me. The only way to kill me - is to destroy all the Horcruxes. No one knows about them but Slughorn, whom I was trying recruit or kill for a at least a year and who still teaches in Hogwarts, which is now under Snape's control, i.e under my control. Maybe pay him a visit? Maybe check on Horcruxes? Ah... why bother...

And so on and on...


** Consider that creating Horcruxes caused Voldemort's body to warp and decay, and since he was mutilating his soul, his mind also likely suffered, particularly in the area of rational thought (since you would already have to be unstable to think ripping off pieces of your soul was a good idea). Combine that with his natural arrogance and overconfidence, and he didn't realize his Horcruxes were compromised until it was too late.

*** It's a popular idea in the fandom to claim that Voldemort lost some rationality which Tom Riddle possessed. Mostly I think this is motivated by people who want to write Tom Riddle romances - gotta make him marginally more resonable.

But really, there's not much evidence for this at all in the books - that Tom Riddle was more sane/rational/reasonable than Voldemort (as opposed to simply more constrained in how he acted due to his circumstances), nor that Voldemort lost sanity with each horcrux. Indeed, Dumbledore frequently comments on Voldemort's great mind. You'd think if he believed that Voldemort had lost mental capacity he'd mention it.

Tom Riddle was always a psychopath, it's just that when he was younger he couldn't show his true character publicly because he was not yet secure in his power. With great power comes great disinhibition. You can be your true self without giving a fuck.

***** I don't thing that to be the case. He may say to his followers that Dumbledore is nothing, but smart person would see the reality.

If you are in fact one of the greatest wizards of the last century - is it really arrogant of him to think of himself highly? Rowling introduces dissonance - he either exceptionally smart and capable, or he can't see beyond his nose, which he does in the seventh book.

I do not like how she handled Dumbledore's ridiculous "plan" for Harry to kill Voldemort in 6th and Horcrux-hunt in 7th. That's why I search for a good fanfic that does it better.

And all this "Voldemort suddenly became unstable and stupid" I do not buy. It is post hoc rationalization of Rowling's inability to finish the series properly.

Throughout the books Voldemort was the villain for the sake of being one. Ok, he was shown through perspective of good guys, which I see nothing wrong with, but in the end he became the embodiment of it... That is what doesn't sit well with me.

I do not reproach her for first books, because they were written with children in mind. But killings and torture aren't suitable for children, so she should've kept in mind and made last books better.

*** Diadem was infused with his soul while he was still in Hogwarts. Or maybe when he applied to a DADA position.

And overall I don't by that creating Horcruxes did anything to his mind. His mind wasn't tethered to his brain so to speak, otherwise he would've not be able to exist in his ghost/spirit form.

** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent might be something you may like. If you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist. I made a recommendation post on this a while ago so I'll just quote myself.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle â€˜aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

  Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

Seven months later they bump into a trio of teens in a London cafe and John Watson discovers that his friend was perfectly serious.

*** I don't take Dumbledore's explanation as a gospel. If V. was as arrogant as D. would like us to believe, why then he put so much effort into protecting the locket in the cave? And why he saw a threat in Harry at all?

V. is shown as one-dimensional villain and not smart to boot, and that's what I do not like in the last 1,5 books. Raising the stakes from book to book and in the end "poof" as Slughorn put it in the 6th movie.
