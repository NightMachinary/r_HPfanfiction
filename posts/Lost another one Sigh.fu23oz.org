:FlairText: What's That Fic?:slytherin::upvote::karma:
:END:
Like I've said before, I really need to just bookmark 90% of the fics I write because eventually I'll want to find it again, and at least my bookmark list would be smaller than an entire Archive.

So this time I'm looking for a fic that begins with Harry approaching Voldemort (I think in front of a full court of DEs) and asking Tom to remove power-dampening bracelets from his wrists. Moldie-shorts does, but is very curious about -why- this is a thing that is happening, so he manages to follow Harry back to Privet Dr. There he witnesses Dumbledore and the Dursleys beat Harry for leaving and having the bracelets removed to the point where it's obvious Harry will probably die. So as soon as he's alone Tom scoops him up and takes him back to... wherever they were hiding, can't remember if it's one with "Slytherin Manor" or if they go back to the Malfoys. Harry is so weak and broken that they decide to bottle-feed him his potions, and in his sleep Harry pees on Lucius (or Bella. They both get it as some point but one is while he's asleep and another he's partially awake and freaking out). Harry is quickly accepted into the fold, and they continue with the bottlefeeding to the point that he goes up to people at the dinner table so they can hold him while he feeds.

It is possibly a Severitus type story because eventually he decides that he wants Sev to be his primary caretaker, but I can't remember that part for sure - just that eventually Harry picks Sev for his daily bottle and Sev is like "me omg wow I never thought".

This -might- also be one where Harry regresses mentally and starts talking like a kid. Other elements it might include, but that might also come from other similar works:

-Rescuing Neville from Augusta and that one uncle that thought it was funny to hang him out a window (wth JK, really)

-Sirius trying to "rescue" Harry only to be convinced to give him back

-Harry & Draco friendship.

-Bad Ron and Hermione (either being paid to be his friends or being an active participant in the torture, can't remember which)

I don't remember there being a romantic pairing.

Other elements to remember:

-Would be on AO3 b/c that's basically the only place I read fic

-Will be less than 150k words (because that's what I use in my searches) but I'm almost certain it was between 10k and 40k. Heck it might be longer but I feel like it was at least 10k.

That's all I can think of... I seem to read really obscure fics cause I haven't had a lot of luck on here in the past but I figured wth, might as well try lol. If you find it, thanks! If you don't, maybe write it? Heck I might try if I can't find it eventually.

Have a blast!

** I haven't read this fic, but I have a feeling you might be better off asking over at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] purely because from my experience they're a lot less judgemental than most of the folk over here when it comes to fics that are a little...different? Good luck finding your fic though :)
