In a world Voldemort went after Longbottom family and Neville Longbottom is the boy-who-lived, Lestranges and Pettigrew go after the potters. Lily and James are briefly put under the crucatius curse but thankfully got saved just in time thanks to intervention of Sirius and Remus.

They were not without damage however, because of exposure to crucatius, Lily lost ability to bear children. After a couple failed attempts all ended with misscarriages, they decide to adopt a child in order to give harry a sibling.

They go to orphanages at London and come across Hermione who lost her parents when a drunk driver hit her parents car when she was three. After accidentally witnessing a bout of accidental magic from the young girl, they adopt her to their family.

Harry and Hermione end up growing together and end up helping Neville in his misadventures in Hogwarts.

** There's a subset of Hermione time travel/reincarnation/whatever-mcguffin-ness fics where Hermione is raised as James's sister. Probably the two most popular ones are The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie and Roundabout Destiny by Mary Royale, if that plotline interests you!

** FYI Orphanages in England wouldn't exist in the 1980s. She'd likely be raised by grandparents or relatives and barring that she would be quickly adopted likely by whatever foster family she would have been placed with.

I think a more likely narrative would be the foster parents try to rehome her after she uses accidental magic, the ministry picks up on it to keep the statute of secrecy and a magical foster family is found to take her in, the Potters.

*** Eeeeh not exactly. While the stereotypical orphanages were pretty much closed down by the 80s, group homes for children do still exist and definitely existed back then. They're different than the old style orphanages, for sure, but it's not out of the realm of possibility for Hermione to be in one - especially as many of them are specifically for children with "issues" and I'm pretty sure accidental magic would end up counting as a qualified issue to weirded out social workwrs.

**** A couple would easily adopt her almost immediately as there wouldn't be any TPR necessary (im not 100% sure how it works in the UK but it would be similar to the US I think). And she's white so there's that too.

Maybe if she is like age 5 and loses her parents and some weird magic stuff goes down then she might end up in a group home.

** I liked it, this is a nice setup of the story (certainly not worse that the reverse ones like linkffn(One World by Stellar Magic) and linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)), but the question remains what kind of plot the author builds on the top of this setup (as it was with the mentioned reverse stories).

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
