My grandmother who is a massive Harry Potter fan, just asked me a question that I felt would be great here. She asked "Does a cool confident hero take away from the reliability of Harry Potter?" So, lets discuss. Which is better? A cool confident hero, or the hero who grows into the role as we see in the actual books?


** Not really sure what you're asking. The theme of HP is that it isn't some storybook hero that takes down Voldemort, its /just Harry/.

However a lot of fanfiction doesn't want to do this, so they make Harry powerful. This is also where Hadrian comes from. Its close enough to Harry to not be disorienting, but its also the name of an emperor instead of the most mundane name JK could come up with.

You ask which is better. It's a matter of preference. The former is better I think, however when it comes to fanfiction the later is often preferable due to the nature.

** Harry Potter is pretty much a Bildungsroman. We follow Harry through his puberty and see him grow up. You see it in his decision not to buy a Firebolt in PoA, in his relationships (first gets to kiss Cho, then realises they're not good together and gets with Ginny later on) and the way he deals with traumas (in OotP he's angry, moody and angsty, in HBP he literally says he doesn't want to be down about Sirius all the time, but live life the fullest, because that's what he would have wanted).

But he doesn't grow up to be a hero, and that's a big point of the books. Harry is just Harry, but circumstances force him to do extraordinary things.

So to answer your question: in the case of HP, I'd say it's neither. Harry is so likable because he's like you and me, not a hero, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

** As phrased, the warrant of the original statement is that cool confident heroes are not reliable. I tend to prefer a Harry that is humble and has the magical ability typical of someone his age. If he has any spikes in power or above-average skills, they should come from hard work and practice instead of a flimsy deus ex machina (I'm looking at you Rowling).

Super confident Harry tends to devolve into wish fulfillment and all of the conflict is usually resolved after the first chapter or so.

** Does/Did he really "grow into the role"? - I don't see that, I only see him complain ("don't want my fame" - "don't want my money" - "want my parents back" etc.) and being lead (and kept in the dark) by Dumbledore and others (including his own friends!) and in the end? Nothing changes, people like the Malfoys walk free, Harry becomes a ministry-drone (without even having the qualifications - he's got no NEWTs - so if he loses his job he'd be out on the street, unless he starts working at WWW) and marries the groupie -.-

ps: That's why I prefer - well written - fanfiction, as that uses the universe to its full potential IMHO!

pps: No it does not take away from being able to relate to Harry - IMHO his being a damned slacker (how can you be like that if you firstly get to learn how to do real MAGIC and secondly if you have a dark lord trying to kill you?) makes him it impossible to relate to him (I myself am a bit of a slacker - though not on his level - but if someone threatened my life, then I'd learn how to defend myself as best I can and as fast as I can (in RL I'd learn my way around firearms and do martial arts and in Harry Potter I'd learn defensive and offensive magic to the best of my ability (including the so called "dark arts" as I kind of agree with Riddle "...only power..." as IMHO it's the intent behind the use of magic that determines whether you turn into a deranged dark lunatic or not!))

*** It's easy to say those things in hindsight, with the books behind us and the universe of fanfiction ready to introduce these ideas. But I have to say, the original stories were well-written and having those ideas in canon would make the books seem... Bland. Much of the fun in reading Harry Potter is living through the struggles of an average orphan boy, his sometimes jealous but incredibly loyal friend, and another incredibly smart friend as they attempt to survive the greatest evil wizard of all time. If they just trained, or if Harry magically turned into a prodigy after meeting Voldemort, I would imagine the books would be very, very boring.

**** Well, the universe was built very well and they weren't badly written, I agree (though there is a difference between "not bad" and "very well").

I don't think Hermione is so smart - sure she's not stupid, but she's no prodigy like Dumbledore (or even Voldemort himself) either (smartest witch of her generation? - I don't know, I mean we don't know how the other students are ranked and if it's not the Raveclaws who are better in class. We can speculate though and in the end she doesn't end up taking a job that requires that much skill or knowledge or power -.-)

No, he should not have turned into a "lightside Voldemort" but he should have tried his best at least, instead of only goofing around and playing quidditch most of the time -.- (that way he would have still needed help and support, but he wouldn't have been lead like that (he was like a damned dog sometimes, loyal despite being "beaten" - I mean I'd have probably hated Dumbledore as soon as I knew that being at the Dursleys was his fault and more so if he sent me back there year after year!)) and he might have surprised Voldemort (hell, he might have delayed his return in GOF if he reacted before being bound to the gravestone (I mean Pettigrew is probably not the greatest fighter, so it wouldn't be that unreasonable for Harry to get the drop on him and Voldemorts new body was not finished, so destroying it should not have been hard either!))
