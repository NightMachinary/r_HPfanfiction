** Lots of fanfic authors confuse good writing with pretentious writing. They forget that some of the most accomplished writers are usually praised for their natural flowing prose and pacing, often accomplished through quite basic vocabulary. Instead fanfic authors who want to aim high rely on some kind of gimmick and hefty use of a thesaurus. This is not meant as a slight against ambition! It's normal to experiment like that, that's why they are all amateur writers.

IMHO some of the most consistently "good writing" comes from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]]. I could probably pull out one or two other fics, but usually with some kind of caveat ("pacing issues", "inconsistent characterization", etc...).

** Northumbrian. Easily the best world building and smooth writing. Gets you involved very easily and beautiful description of the English Countryside with the 'propah' British phrases and words. I have often called him the JK Rowling of fanficiton since he also sticks to canon. Had this been a professional attempt, and a proper editor would have smoothed out the crinks, his works could easily have been the much needed sequel to HP that we all wanted rather then the Cursed Child debacle.

I would recommend reading his Now and Forever first just to get a hang of his calibre, it's just pure nostalgia and will make you remember your whole Harry Potter journey.

I like this fic, though I'd categorize it as a 'slice of life' story. It's from a muggle neighbor's point of view. Gets a bit over-wordy at times, but it's great for rainy days when you want some phrasing you can savor and contemplate.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.

** linkffn(The Half-blood Romantic) is a recent favourite. I read too many fanfics and rarely come across a conversation that flows so smoothly. The author weaves their entire story around the exchanges between the two main characters and not even a single paragraph reads out of place or tedious. The reader feels intimately aware of how the dynamics between those two people develop and how they feel. I wish I could write half as good as them.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** The Secret Language of Plants

I just finished the final instalment today and honestly it's lovely. It just flows and handles multiple POVs very well.

Although my favourite part about it is how it started small and expanded so far.

Percy is my fave here too. Although he's not really in it until the third(?)

Idk how to do the link thing

"If the series' length is a bit off-putting (it would be for me), know that there is an opt-out option at the end of Dandelions. Meaning you can stop reading there and get decent closure."

"“Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.” What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms."

****** It's tricky. I feel like I came across at least a dozen Harry-uses-his-knowledge-of-muggle-science-and-genre-savviness-to-defeat-Voldemort fics, before HPMoR, and many, many genius-Harry-is-oh-so-special-and-snarky fics, but all of them tend to suffer at least as badly as HPMoR in terms of style, I suspect just by the very nature of what they are and who writes them.

If you mean other fics written under the premise of being a tract for evangelising the world, there are many but they tend to sink quickly and be written, again, at least as badly as HPMoR, and again I suspect it is the nature of the beast. Unless you have a following already, I don't think this sort of fic tends to take off.

Or do you mean explorations of magical systems, ‘For want of a nail' fics, or some other aspect of it (what ‘premise' interests you?). Start a thread on that aspect, and I'm sure you'll get plenty of suggestions.

******** Hmm, HPMoR Harry is a ‘rationalist' by the specific rules and ideas of EY and Less Wrong: I think if you wanted a fic with a Harry following those rules, it would need to be written by someone from the Less Wrong community, and most of them seem to love HPMoR...

Ones with a more rational Harry (one who isn't a realistic 11-year-old emotionally damaged by an abusive upbringing) tend to be crack fics or written by the sort of people who slip into the same Very Smart patterns. I read one interesting fic with a child prodigy Harry who was still emotionally damaged, which I think mostly succeeded as well as it did by being entirely from Petunia's POV as she raised him ambivalently, taking pride in him (and in how she was raising him not to trust Dumbledore because she hated him) without ever loving him. No magic, though, as I recall.

You might have more luck looking for fics which focus on Hermione and make her more rational (less of a child...) as she explores magical theory. I'm sure you could find a lot of Hermione Explores Magical Theory stories, and I've certain many of them portray her as analysing things rationally. Hermione is a natural choice, because her upbringing lends itself to her thinking like this.

Anyway, think about what it is you really want in a fic and start a thread! I'm sure you'll get some bites.

** Nobody else has mentioned it, so I'll just leave this one here: Linkffn(The Firebird Trilogy)
