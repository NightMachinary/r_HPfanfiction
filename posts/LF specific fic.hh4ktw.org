:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago. Where Harry (and gang) has secretly taken over a room atop the Gryffindor tower. Then doing 4th year shortly before 3rd task they save moody from the trunk (probably have Dobby fetch it) then they summon pomfrey to heal him (again Dobby. Or perhaps floo) without alerting the rest of the staff.

Someone know the fic I'm remembering?
