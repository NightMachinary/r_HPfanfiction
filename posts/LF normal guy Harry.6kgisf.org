I'm searching for stories that feature Harry who is not famous or BWL; maybe, Neville is BWL, or there is no prophecy or even no Voldemort. I really want to read stories where Harry does normal everyday stuff, maybe has some new adventures and new goals in life that don't necessarily revolve around fighting Voldemort. I'm looking for good interactions between characters and Harry who is somewhat in-character, so not superpowerful or over-abused, but more like witty and compassionate. I'm not much into romance and would prefer no slash.

Edit: Just Another Orphan linkffn(10511318) would be to some extent an example of what I'm looking for

Your recommendations don't have to have everything I described above, but I think you get an approximate idea of what I'm looking for.


** Rogue's Bet - Linkffn(12240216) its mostly about friendship but also includes a bet between harry and ron concerning two girls they want to be with.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU

*** I'm 10 chapters in and it seems interesting, but also for now it looks like the biggest point would be to have Harry/Tonks in the end.

Anyway, thank you very much!
