Witch's employ devils and demons all the time. Lily was the greatest witch of her generation for a reason.

When she preformed the ritual he had come face to face with Lilith, the first succubus.

Over the years she had formed a true connection and lily had accumulated favors for assisting her. Her final favor?

"Raise my son."

Harry is raised by a succubus. When Hagrid shows up to take Harry to the Dursleys Lilith refuses and confronts Dumbledore about it.

"Harry isn't going there." Lilith said.

"But the protection." Albus says.

Lilith opens a portal to hell and throws Dumbledore through it only for him to come out a few seconds later shaking and white as a sheet. "I think Harry will be fine with me." Lilith says, looking at her clawed hand with Harry in her other arm.


** Years later when Harry attends Hogwarts, he stumbles across Fluffy who turns out to be Cerberus from back home. The three headed dog recognizes him right away, immediately coating him in dog slobber despite Ron and Hermione's bewilderment

*** "Hey there big guy." Harry Potter the half demon wizard said to the middle head of the large dog, scratching it behind the ear. "Whatcha guarding down there?"

A bark and a growl sounded from the dog and Harry understood perfectly.

"A Philosopher's Stone!" Harry said alarmed. "Fuck sake you'd think humans would learn from all that shit four thousand years ago with those two Alchemists that a Philosopher's Stone is not a good thing."

Fluffy gave a bark moving his paw from the trap door.

"Yeah, I better go take care of it. Maybe the boss down stairs will give me a reward." Harry said as he with a grin. He then dropped down the hole, large bat like wings extending from his back as a stream of fire erupted from his hands hitting the magic plant below.

That was just something that I thought of. I hope someone does something with the prompt.

** I would read the hell out of this. A similar thing happens in linkffn(A Deal Made in Good Faith by sakurademonalchemist) I probably butchered the authors name, but close enough. Just be warned, it's not finished, and is a Harry Potter/Supernatural crossover.

  An accident while cooking leads to unexpected results. Meet Helen Crowley, the adopted daughter to the King of the Crossroads...and the world's first Mage Rider. This isn't your typical witch. There is a catch to her powers. She has to collect the soul of the man who made her an orphan to begin with, or she'll take his place. Can this snarky girl beat the deadline? FEM HP

** And then Harry never returns to Hogwarts because Lilith is a possessive bitch who isn't for letting him out of her sight. Voldemort steals the philosophers stone and returns to take over the wizarding world.

The end.

**** What interest does an immortal demon have in teaching magic to children? None at all, I would think. In fact, whose to say she can even do magic in order to teach it? I'm sure she would have her own abilities but I doubt they'd be the same as wizards.

And the contract is to raise Harry. Nothing about getting him a wizarding education. Lilith would absolutely keep him in Hell as her human pet.

******* She's not the queen of succubus for being deceitful. If you say raise my kid shes gotta turn that boy into the ideal man...then probably send a lesser succubus after him but before that he'll live as if lily Potter didn't die.

Plus she'd probably have a code "no one under 21 gets their soul eaten." Or more accurately not give two shits about what albus says.

The more traditional view of demons in general is that they're highly deceitful and twist their bargains to mean things totally different from what the words say.

lolwhat? The immortal, ancient Queen of Succubae is a paragon of modern American morality? What...?

So he called the Ministry, says "sorry, have had a major demon move into the school, I'm shutting the place down" and sends all the kids home, because what possible reason would he have for just shrugging and saying "well I asked her to go home and she said no, so I guess I better let her teach history".

** Well, lilith was not the first succubus. She was a demon made from the same clay as Adam or as his first wife in jewish and rabbinic folklore and also said to be a night crawler and apparently killed new mothers and babies. Her offsprings with adam or samael were the succubi. So, technically she was the progenitor of succubi and incubi.
