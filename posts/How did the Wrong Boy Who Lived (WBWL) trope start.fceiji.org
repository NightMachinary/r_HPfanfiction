I see that it's one of the most common tropes in HP fanfiction both in crossovers and normal fanfiction. What was the first wrong boy who lived fanfiction and how did it all start?

*** It does apply, but wouldn't it be more accurate to say it comes from the story of "The Man In The Iron mask"? In this one he is actually his twin while on Montecristo he wasn't (as far as i remember).

**** I'm guessing you haven't read the book. While there are twins and one gets to be king while the other is in prison, otherwise there's not much similarity. The Count of Monte Cristo is a lot closer

*** Really, this is the basis of a lot of stories, not just WBWL stories. Most of the evil Dumbledore stories (which some but not all WBWL stories are) use this idea of ‚Äúmain character gets his justified revenge on wrongdoers‚Äù.

I think WBWL started because it gives the author built-in reasons for why Harry is mistreated. Harry is passed over for his brother (usually by accident, sometimes on purpose) and the wrongdoing is neglect or mistreatment (often the Dursley's).

*** That's an interesting observation, and not one I'd really have thought of. I think I tend to think of the secrecy aspect of Monte Cristo to be important there - where no one knows who the Comte is. But I can see how it could have been an inspiration!

Too bad most WBWL fics don't manage to have anywhere near the justification for it happening as the Comte did, though.

*** There is actually one where a character named Dantes (clearly based on the Count of Monte Cristo) is a thing ( Harry takes the Dantes name as a symbolic thing ) and Harry turns Ginny into a dog (I think for trying to seduce him or something?), and there's a whole period of something happening in a courtroom I completely forget. It was a very cranky!Harry fic.

**** It's funny - thinking about taking the story from the Comte de Monte Cristo and applying it to Harry (with the required changes to make it fit in universe) makes me think of it being super edgy, like the description of the fic you give - and yet the original is amazing.

Maybe it's because Azkaban Harry fics seem to have him as still a child or without making as much sense, or that I'm just more lenient to old french novels that have their copious meandering thoughts/asides.

***** Probably a bit of both. :)

It's also likely because it works better in a historical, swashbuckler-esque cultural context. Back then, it was noble and fitting and acting upon one's responsibilities and all that. Nowadays, the idea of a betrayed man returning to revenge himself on those who wronged him is just a bit petulant. And I've never read a fic with that model that puts the effort in to make the modern cultural context fit.

** I don't think it's actually the first WBWL fic, but the Sacrifices Arc series came out in 2005 and is at least one of the oldest and most influential WBWL fics, and has all sorts of tropes that are common now that were novel at the time. linkffn(2580283)

*** I agree with you that it is the most influential WBWL fic and most likely responsible for many other stories in a similar vein.

But from what I remember I think it was published even earlier than 2005, bc I first read the earliest chapters of Saving Connor in 2002/2003 right before OOTP came out. Around that same time [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] deleted quite a few HP stories for having mature content and a lot authors took their stories down in protest. IIRC the author of Saving Connor also decided to rewrite the first few chapters of Saving Connor, which is how we get a publishing date of 2005.

**** I have the same memory so I think there's a grain of truth there. Also, just from a perspective of how the fandom evolved, it had to be 2003 or later because the publication of Order of the a Phoenix (and the prophecy) is what gave birth to the trope.

***** IIRC there were speculations about a prophecy before OOTP came out, I think one of the reasons why Saving Connor was rewritten was to make it more canon-compliant with OOTP.

Most people guessed about Snape and Lily way before OOTP as well.

****** There was definitely speculation since the first book but definitely since book three, though I don't recall the fandom deeply exploring it until later. (This is like decades ago, though, so my memory is a bit rusty.)

I just did some digging and it looks like chapter 9 of Saving Connor may have been legit posted in/around Sept 2005 (based off of the author's LJ - [[https://lightningwave.livejournal.com/2005/09/24/][first entry]]). Nothing concrete, but the author was posting about the outline and progress at that time and responding to chapter 9 reviews. Fanlore is also saying 2005.

I also don't think it was 2002 cuz I vividly remember what apartment I was reading it in when it was first getting published, so that would have been anytime between May 2003 - August 2006. ü§£

** Most of the WBWL fics I have read were written well after OotP was published. All these have a tendency to bash Dumbledore, James and Lily, and either have Slytherin!Harry mentored by Father!Snape or Ravenclaw!Harry trained by Founders/Merlin/God who is amazing at Quidditch, gets 20 O.W.L.S. at O's, saves the school repeatedly and still gets ignored by everybody, other than a few close allies/minions.

Most of these are written in a manner which shows righteous teenage rebellion against abusive, neglectful parents. Feels like they're written by 12 year olds who didn't get hugged enough as a kid.

Some have James/Lily mindfucked by GreaterGood!Dumbles, which is, quite frankly, hilariously dumb. Harry has the potential to surpass Merlin, so I'll obliviate his parents and send him to his abusive Aunt so she can kill him before he becomes better than me. Harry comes to Hogwarts smacks everyone on their arse, kills Dumbledore and Voldemort with the same spell, restores his parents memories and lives happily ever after. One of the few ways of writing Alive!Potters while bashing Dumbledore.

A fair few have a decent James/Lily who raise both kids well, but an over-interfering Dumbles who is obsessed with figuring out the real kid of the prophecy. Sigh.

Most of these stories feature arsehole!Sirius and Remus, or supportive!Sirius and Remus driven away by the Potters, or both of the men dead.

Honestly, the amount of plot holes, extremely OOC behaviour, PowerfulIndependentLord-y!Harry solo-ing his way through everyone makes these stories quite shit.

This trope is not limited to HP either. PJatO has a fair few new Zeus/Poseidon!kid showing up, stealing everybody and driving Percy away. Just another example of RL people taking out their frustration on flawed canon characters by glorifying/god-moding their favourite hero.

Phew!
