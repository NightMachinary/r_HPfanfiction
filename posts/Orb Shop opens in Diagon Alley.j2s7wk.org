/Special to the Prophet, Diagon Alley/

/Whether they be glittering green, deep chocolate or brilliant sapphire, the demand for Orbs is on the rise. It seems like everyone these days is augmenting their ocular orifices, and Oglethorpe's Amazing Orbs has just announced their grand opening to answer Wizarding Britain's increasing demand. Glamours, charms, special glasses and lenses and even full eye replacements are being offered in this one-of-a-kind establishment. Harcourt Oglethorpe, the proprietor, has this to say about his unique services./

/"I'm just offering a service that I know the people are asking for. After everyone saw the quality, care and workmanship I put in to Harry Potter's brilliant emerald green orbs, the demand was only natural."/

/This reporter is eager to see how this service measures up - is it just another fad led by the Boy-Who-Lived, or will it endure like Sleekeazy's?/


** Ok, I'm not going to lie, I /literally/ just tabbed away from an outline I was drafting about a character who was interested in magic to alter biology. Sure, it's more of a biopunk/lovecraftian horror kind of thing than a crack/humor one, but the idea of cosmetic eye enhancements ("orbs") is just too funny not to include.

Thank you for the idea, OP.

*** For biopunk/body horror inspiration, I'd also recommend eXistenZ, a film from 1999 with some interesting/icky ideas in it.

** This made me so angry j looked down with my sapphire hued orbs...as they slowly turned a deadly shade of red.

"Would you like to repeat that little man" I say as it spread my plump lips wide revealing two bloody fangs.
