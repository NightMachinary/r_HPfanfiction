I'm looking for storys where Snape sees Harry during the sorting and immediately knows something wrong (the way he was treated at the Dursley's) and he becomes a father /father figure to harry.

Slashes dont matter and the house Harry is in dosen't matter.


** Linkffn(6413108) is one of my faves. It is not quite what you asked for but I think it plays out similarly?

Bonus: Healer!Harry, if you like that.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Harry is 11 years old and looking forward to attending Hogwarts. Why, then, does he miss the Welcoming Feast? Would you like to listen to Nobody Cared? The very lovely ElegantButler has spent a great deal of time turning each chapter of Nobody Cared into a sound file. You can download the chapters, HERE.

  The one where Harry makes a friend at Madame Maulkin's and doesn't end up hating Slytherin before he's even sorted. Slytherin AU ft. Anxious!Harry and Mentor!Snape(Update August 24, 2020! I am in the middle of editing this story! The plot will remain the same, but I am changing some dialogue that I felt didn't flow when I reread it this last week and finetuning some details to keep the story cohesive. The end goal is to finalize this story so I can finally (finally!) get to updating the sequel. It's really only the first 10 chapters that I thought needed better editing, so hopefully come late September, I'll be able to post a new chapter) (Second update Sept 27! I'm at ch16 of edits/rewrites, so I am still working on this!)

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

It isn't until Snape finds him that the truth comes out about The Boy Who Lived  freaks sleep on the floor, freaks stay in cupboard, freaks don't get to have friends.' His Aunt and Uncle's words filled his head as sobs finally overtook his small frame. This is where he belonged, on the dusty floor all alone. He shouldn't be near other people; nobody wants to be near a freak.That night Harry cried himself to sleep as panic and sobs wreaked havoc on his too-small body. He paid no mind to the cold or the aches in bones. When he woke up the next morning he refused to move. This was his place now, and this is where he would stay.
