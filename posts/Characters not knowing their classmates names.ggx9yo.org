I read it over and over again in fanfic where characters in the same year group who have been in the same classes for years don't know each other's names. I just read one where Harry is re-sorted into Slytherin in 5th year and he doesn't know Tracy Davis's name. Come on, their year group is tiny and even if Harry may not know her first name, he would know her last name is Davis because the teachers would say “Miss Davis” in class. Am I missing something?


** It is not unreasonable that he wouldn't know all the names during the first and second year but I do agree that it is pushing it slightly to not know the names by fifth year, at least for the Slytherins. Ravenclaws would be way more belivable since they don't seem to be sharing any classes with them or at the very least no classes where it is everyone from Ravenclaw. But I would at the same time not say that it is impossible, I know that I have forgotten the names of the people in my year many times and haven't remembered them until weeks later.

** I think that's often to show the disconnect between Slytherin & Gryffindor, personally. I don't know about the specific cases you're referring to, but when I read about Harry not knowing someone from Slytherin, I think it's usually shorthand for "Harry didn't care to know them because he thinks all Slytherins are trash".

That being said, yeah-- His lack of knowledge can be a bit excessive at times. You're right that it would make sense for him to at least know last name/have a vague opinion of who they are from class.

** You're completely right, Harry's year is forty-something so he really doesn't have any excuse to not know anyone's name. I didn't know many people's names in my year, but that's because we never shared any classes and my year was more than a hundred and I hang out with either older or younger students for the most part, so I have reasons. Everyone in his year was even presented during the Sorting Ceremony.
