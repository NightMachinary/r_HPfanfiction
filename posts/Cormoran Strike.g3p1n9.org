Recently finished the latest entry in JKR's Cormoran Strike series and I was curious about this subreddit's opinion of the books.

I quite enjoyed the novels, and it seems to me that Rowling is enjoying writing them far more than contributing to the HP universe.\\
The mystery plots have all been very entertaining, tho not as engaging as HP, at moments they are a lot of fun and they just show what a master JKR is at writing a suspenseful story.

The reason I'm interested in what you guys think is the fact that the main character himself is pretty much adult Harry. And this similarity is what I genuinely liked the most in the novels. At moments it really made me feel like I was reading a new HP novel.


** I still haven't finished the 4th book, but I really enjoyed the first three. You can always rely on JKR to spin a great mystery, and as much as I love HP, she definitely grew as a writer since her early books. It's definitely true that she seems to be more interested in her adult books then extended HP universe such as Fantastic Beasts movies, but whatever brings her that paycheck.

It's always amusing to me how drastically different her general world outlook is in HP vs. non-HP books, the Strike series and especially Casual Vacancy, which I think is her best up to date. Where HP is full of hope, she seems to be very pessimistic and cynical about humanity in everything else. It's also funny to read opinions that JKR is only capable of writing PG-13 violence and fairytale abuse for that reason. Go read Career of Evil and then we'll talk.

I don't think, however, that Harry has much in common with Cormoran. If anything, he's more similar to Robin.

** They're good books. The uneven relationship between Strike, Robin and her hubby is carefully written and masterly tension for all parties. But to be honest, I can't see any similarity between Strike and Harry. I would personally see him as a somewhat-less-paranoid Alastor Moody.

** I've read all of them and I definitely enjoy them. I don't know that I'd agree that Cormoran is a Harry analogue as he's way more of a hot mess than Harry ever was, but they do both have that drive to do what's right.

I haven't seen the TV show based on the series yet, but I'm for sure looking forward to the next book.

** I've read and enjoyed them! I also thought that Cormor√°n was adult Harry. I thought about that a lot and tried to see if I could place the other characters, but did not succeed. Robin could kind of be Ginny-they both have a sort of hero worship mixed with their own brand of badassery going on.

Did you watch the BBC interpretations of the books? Pretty spot on. They didn't skip many details and I enjoyed them quite a bit as well.

*** I live in Sydney and only just catching up on the tv adaptions. Has anyone noticed that in the book his right leg is amputated but in the series, it's his left?
