I adore it but I can't find anyone else reading it and it's so intricate and dense and brilliantly written and I just wondered if other people were as excited to see how the whole October 31st thing is going to play out because I am!

Have you any hopes on what you would like to see in the story down the line? Id love more Nizar in Founders Time stories and how all about him being Protectoris.


** I'm reading it, though I'm waiting for this segment to finish before digging in. It's a great series!

** I can't read WIPs so I'm waiting until the latest installment is complete before reading it.

But it's a great series. I especially loved the (multiple) heart wrenching twist(s) at the end of The Second Wizarding War.

** I started it bc a friend recommended it to me, I liked the style and the plot was unique but I wasn't too onboard with the pairing...so I stopped before anything started. I might try to continue reading but I'm not sure.

*** Fair ðŸ˜Š. I'm not totally taken with the pairing either but the amount of plot and history and other things balances it out for me anyway.

**** I've ignored pairings in lieu of a great story before so if you say it's worth it, I will definitely continue reading it! Thanks

***** Of reccommend you give it a go ðŸ˜Š. And skip the bits you don't want to read and if you don't like it sure don't read it ðŸ˜….

But it's worth it. I think so anyway ðŸ˜€

** I haven't read the unfinished parts. The rest has been awesome. I keep on thinking I should read it again. The teachers are actually teaching and making themselves useful and Nizar is awesome. The pairings in the story are good (no disturbing age differences) and actually, the part with Minerva McGonagall is excellent in how unexpected it was.

I love how much research went to the whole thing. I don't get to nerdgasm often when I read a story.
