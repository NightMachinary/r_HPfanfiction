I've seen this a couple times but I want some good fics where Harry disguises himself and uses Voldemorts tactics of fear to wage war on the Death Eaters taking them out one by one in ambushes. This usually leads to Death Eater morale plummeting and Voldemort getting really pissed off. Any pairings for Harry are fine but no slash. It can be time travel fics, dimension travel, AU, I dont care. I'm pretty sure the only title I remember where they do this is Delenda Est. Thanks!


** I remember this linkffn(the weapon revised) fitting the criteria.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
