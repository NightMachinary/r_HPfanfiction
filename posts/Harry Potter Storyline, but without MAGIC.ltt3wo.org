I went to a residential school at the age of 11 for 7 years, in which students are sorted to 4 houses and compete with other houses for the House Cup. #navodaya

So is there any fanfic which uses the cannon storyline, but without MAGIC.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is exactly what you are looking for. The kids here are however a lot more dangerous, and Year 7 is very very different

*** Also, it's a prequel to a multi-crossover series including Stargate, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, DC Comics, The Secret World of Alex Mack, and various others. Being a prequel, though, it stands alone quite well.
