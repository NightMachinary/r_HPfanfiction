I remember reading a passage in a Fic that having Draco sneaking into the Gryffindor tower(?) and transforming Harry into a Female. I would like to know, if Dracos attempt to desperate Harry backfires and instead the Blond gets attracted to his Victim.

​

As for AU (it can happen in Canon) i would like Business or Political Fics. Like Harry is leading his Families/Fathers Business or is running a Political position and Draco wants or needs to make a Deal with her. Here, however i want Harry to be of cunning and tempting personality.

Maybe Draco wants to make a Deal that gives him more advantages, but it will turn that Harry gets them either equal or she will have the advantages.

But its not necessary, that both have their own Business, but instead are possible partners of the same. But the conditions that Harry is the dominant one should stay, atleast when they are alone.

Its ok, if they have sex, but its should be special and not much regular. Draco might have feelings for Harry, but they arent reciprocrated by her and for her Malfoy is just a Deal partner. Maybe Harry will join Draco to "ask" for the one or other favour and teases him.

If they have sex, it would be good if she is the dominant part as Draco would be only a Dominant in business but sub in Bed persona, but you can cut this, if it limits the amount of fics.

​

If there is no chance of such "Dom!cunning!tempting!Harry, i would accept Hermione or Ginny being in that role instead.
