** His Angel did it, his patronus eventually developed into a person, but I don't remember if it was solid or not.

The Little Veela That Could had a person Patronus but it was Gabrielle who was casting it.

** MoR is the only fic I've ever read where any patronus is a person. A solid patronus is much more common, and without specific information I would be hard-pressed to provide any - I've read it so often that I don't even consider it that special of an ability anymore, definitely not enough to make specific fics noteworthy just for that.
