*** But why? The secret is the location of their house, which is kept by Pettigrew. Because even if you want to argue about wording (the Potters live in...), at that point Harry is still living there and such a technicality only applies after Harry was removed from there, which should either still be impossible due to the Fidelius OR Hagrid, Dumbledore and co knew, but that would mean that they knew the secret keeper.

**** If the secret is “The Potters live in [whatever cottage] in Godric's Hollow”, and then there's only one Potter left alive, then maybe invalid secrets can't be valid targets for a Fidelius?

**** I like the theory saying that the secret was something specific like "The Potter /family/ is living at Godric's Hollow". With James and Lily dead, there isn't a Potter family anymore, only Harry.

With this theory, people like Narcissa Malfoy or Andromeda Tonk could suddenly remember the location of Grimmault Place after the end of the war because, once the Order is disbanded, Grimmault Place is not "the Headquarter of the Order of the Phoenix" anymore, so the Fidelius just "end".

** Is it possible that the secret broke because it was invalidated? Let's say the secret was "The Potters live at ****". James and Lily are killed, so they do not LIVE anymore. Harry get's taken from the ruins and placed at Petunia's, so he's now living at the Dursleys' place. There are just no Potters left living at the cottage the secret was hiding...

**** Not necessarily, if the secret was that the *Potters* lived... than since there is only one Potter currently living there then it wouldn't be the Potter*s* anymore, but instead *the Potter* (baby).

The fidelius charm as a whole has many holes in it, my advice is to try making your own interpretation if you decide to write something involving it and otherwise not think too much about it.

**** It depends whether Order members had been told the secret. If Dumbledore, Hagrid and Sirius had been told the secret before, Dumblefore would have known he'd be able to send Hagrid to collect the baby and Sirius being there to hand Harry over before taking off to find Peter. I also wouldn't discount the possibility that Dumbledore as the Order leader had been given the secret in writing, just like Harry was given the Grimmauld place one, for emergencies, if the whole order had not been told when the Fidelius was cast, and he used the paper to let Hargid in to the secret for the whole purpose of collecting baby Harry. And James would have made sure Sirius was told as soon as the Fidelius was cast.

** There are strange things about the Fidelius.

Since Pettigrew didn't tell Dumbledore where the Potters lived (otherwise Dumbledore would have known Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper, not Sirius), how did Dumbledore know, and how was he able to tell Hagrid where to go fetch Harry? How did Dumbledore even know Voldemort had attacked the Potters?

The only explanation I can think of is that the Secret Keeper can break the Fidelius altogether so that everyone who knew the secret before suddenly become aware of it again, and that's what Pettigrew did. But why did he do it? If Voldemort had killed the Potter and Sirius, leaving the Fidelius intact would have made it possible for Pettigrew to continue quite normally.

**** I've seen some fics where they seem to think that the Secret /has/ to be revealed via a written note, which I always thought was dumb because Dumbledore likely just wrote the note for Harry since he wouldn't be there when Harry was take from the Dursleys. After thinking about it for a while, though, it's honestly the smartest way to reveal it. You don't want to say it out loud in case of eavesdroppers, and the note can be easily destroyed after the reveal.

*********** So I did a little Googling. The term "trick or treat" is entirely American. The Irish, Scottish, and English each had long traditions similar trick or treat. It lost popularity in the Isles during the 1800s because of misbehavior and vandalism. A similar thing happened with Christmas, too. Trick or treating was reintroduced via American television in the 80s and only got popular in the 90s.

** I believe the difference between what happened with number 12 Grimwauld Place and the Potters is this. In the case of Grimwauld Place, Dumbledore cast the spell on the house. For the Potter's, he Petter cast the spell on the people. I remember someone saying that Voldemort could look in through their living room window and not see them. When the Potter's where slain, the subject of the spell was destroyed. Only the secret keeper for Grimwauld Place was destroyed.
