*** Death of the Author. I don't care if Stalin and Mao had a sleepover to write my favorite book. If the book is good, then it's good.

Whether you think financially supporting those authors by buying the book is a different question. To get extremely political, I go with every Catholic who still gives the Catholic Church money is willingly supporting child molestation. I am forced to follow that same standard myself even if I really like the book, so I would say it is immoral.

**** I kinda disagree there. You're not giving them money /for/ molesting children/being a ranting xenophobe/whatever. You're giving them the money they earned by writing this book, or, in the Church's case, the money you think they earn by doing God's work. If the recipient of that money uses it to support their wicked activities rather than fuel those activities for which you commend them, the blame's on them, not you.

In the meantime, good work should be recompensed whatever the author's other crimes/objectionable values/etc., much like, to pick an utterly random example, a gardener who did 100 pounds' worth of gardening for you still deserves his 100 pounds even if you /know/ with 90 percent certainty he's going to be losing them because of his gambling problem.

Starting to decide not to pay people for their work because you object to the way they're likely to spend that pay is the slipperiest slope that ever slipped and gets you mentality of the sort Charles Dickens spent most of his career denouncing.

***** Of course you are not intentionally providing them the funds for the act. However, there are still moral objections one might personally have. I don't go to Chick-fil-a because I know my money would go to anti-gay groups for example.

This reminds me of the mechanic thing. I don't care if mechanic cheats on his wife as long as he provides the service I bought, but that's because I don't particularly find lying to be in the same category as molestation or depriving someone of human rights. It's a grey area that I haven't full explored therefore I don't extend my mere provisional beliefs to the point of judgement of others.

A boss isn't supporting murder if his subordinates but a gun with their paycheck. But if the boss knows that this is a distinct possibility, or even a certainty, he has a right to no longer provide them funds or fire them in this case.

I think I see what you're saying better, though I'm not sure I agree. And regardless, I still think Lovecraft isn't a good example. 'far as I know he never actually went out and committed hate crimes or anything, he just got upset at foreigners in letters and newspaper articles. You may or may not find it morally reprehensible but I think just /writing/ about your arguably-wicked opinions (mostly to an audience of other people who share them) should be in the same category as "cheating on your wife", not "molesting children".

**** That's not what "Death of the Author" means, but whatever.

"Death of the Author" was a concept for literary analysis. At the time of its invention, the more or less usual way to analyze a text was heavily tied into analysing the state of mind of the author, and their intentions.

"Death of the Author" is the antithesis to that, stating that it doesn't matter what the author thought when writing something, as it matters what is received.

It is but a framework to look at the text, not a fucking way of life.

***** Forgive me, I seemed to have confused the idea of the author's intent being separated from their works with the idea that the book stands on its own merit regardless of who wrote it even if it was a monkey on a typewriter. The two ideas share very similar ground in my mind. Thank you for the correction.

****** Regardless of that, the text is still a bigoted, hypocritical mess.

Even with "Death of the Author", the narrative seemingly condones cruel genocide by burning people alive, while morally judging the Weasleys for standing in Harry's way.

While their actions of course were not pure, it pales in comparison to Harry's abhorrent behavior. The Muggles that are killed are, by and large, innocent victims, and yet Harry is the good guy.

I didn't like it.

******* It's been a decent amount of time since I've read it, but there are indeeds segments of the story that can be considered bigoted. Mein Kampf contains bigoted text. A history book on Nazi Germany will contain bigoted text as well. I do not speak for the author in any way, but I am against assuming that the views of the characters within the story represent the views of the author even ignoring my position against assumptions. If I recall, he even said as much in an author's note on the topic of Harry's views on religion. Could it be that was merely an excuse? Possibly, but I do not know this author personally.

As a side note, I definitely did not read the story with Harry as a good guy. He was the protagonist. He was morally grey and then he crept into morally dark areas. J.K. Rowling likelu doesn't support children going into war, but she had her characters do it for example.

*** Because people love it. In my experience, reader's love a good power wank. I love one too. That doesn't make it a good story though. It's enjoyability and quality are independent. I think the reason it is constantly brought up is because they get upset with how the author basically says "It's my damn story, it'll be how I want it to be." And people don't like injustice. It's frustrates them that there is something wrong, and that they can't do anything about it.

My biggest issue with the author of "For the Love of Magic" was the way the author left author's notes. They are almost always useless regardless of the author. If you are explaining a detail of the story, then you should be able to explain it inside the story. If you are saying how grateful you are, then I hope it's two sentences max with it only occuring maybe twice. But hey, it's not my story.
