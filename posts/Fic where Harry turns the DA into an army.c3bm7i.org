:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember the fic a little - there were different squads, the whole school was in on it, there was one squad called ThinkTank I think, and one called Harry's Angels maybe? And they fought the death eaters and everything.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis]]) Possibly this one, I think it has a squad like theme to it but I'm not sure on that part it's been a while since I've read it. It definitely has the army part though.

Either way it's a more unique concept for a story so I would recommend at least giving it a try.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
