I'm struggling to write situations where a Slytherin who is cunning would use that skill for something other than personal gain. The word carries negative connotations as it is, so what are some ways cunning can be altruistic? Before anyone mentions Snape using cunning to fool Voldemort, I've always chalked that up to nerve, natural talent at occlumency, and the fact that he's probably dead inside. Cleverness, maybe not so much.

Any canon examples? Maybe when Draco lied to Bellatrix, and pretended the puffy faced wizard in his sitting room /wasn't/ Harry? (which again, could also be attributed to nerve.)

One example from fiction that comes to mind is Emma by Jane Austen. It's been a long time so maybe I'm not remembering correctly, but Emma tries to cleverly pair two characters together, convinced they are a good match. However iirc she does this partially for her /own/ amusement as well, so maybe that's not exactly a good example of morally used cunning.


** Off the top of my head,

- Harry was very cunning when he manipulated Lucius into freeing Dobby.
- +Dumbledore was very cunning when he misled Voldemort into thinking that Snape was the master of the Elder Wand.+ (See reply below by [[/u/AntonBrakhage]] .)
- Hermione was very cunning when she organised the DA and made everyone agree to a magical secrecy contract without anyone realising it.

**** You're welcome! More precisely, you need to remember that Gryffindors can be just as cunning as Slytherins, and are more likely to do it for good. :P

Another one I forgot:

- Hermione was very cunning when she tricked Umbridge into going to the Forbidden Forest, where she was accosted by centaurs.

*** I don't think Dumbledore actually meant for Voldemort to think that. I don't think he'd go to all that trouble to get Snape in Voldemort's good graces just to set him up to die, and he h ad no way of knowing Draco and then Harry would become the wand's true master. I think its more likely that he actually meant for Snape to be the master, so he'd have a loyal agent with a powerful weapon perfectly placed to assassinate Voldemort if Harry couldn't pull it off/didn't come back after Voldemort AKd him. Obviously if that was the plan, it didn't work.

**** Good point! I think that, more generally, the goal was to make Voldemort trust Snape without reservation. He succeeded in that; this allowed Snape to become the headmaster of Hogwarts, and protect---however well he could---the children there.

** Well, I would simply redefine what is moral to get to place you want to go. It's not like selfishness has to be morally wrong if you don't want it to be.

But that aside, Webster's defines it as the following:

/n/

- skill employed in a shrewd or sly manner, as in deceiving; craftiness; guile.
- adeptness in performance; dexterity: /The weaver's hand lost its cunning./

/adj/

- showing or made with ingenuity.
- artfully subtle or shrewd; crafty; sly.
- charmingly cute or appealing: /a cunning little baby./
- Archaic. skillful; expert.

So unless you want to employ one of the alternate definitions, if you rate the "deceiving" aspect as immoral in absolute terms, you're never going to get a morally right use of cunning. If that /isn't/ the sticking point and context matters, ("deceiving, but for a Greater Good"), then any example you deem sufficiently altruistic or of overriding importance will suffice.

Another example for acceptable use of cunning for you, then (I agree with the ones listed, Dobby, Elder Wand, DA, if you agree the context is a Greater Good -- which by its very, subjective nature, of course, is always debatable), might be Harry getting the memory from Slughorn. He exploits Slughorn's fondness for Lily, employing emotional manipulation and his pre-knowledge that Slughorn won't remember the conversation.

The fact that you don't find many examples in Slytherin is more because we're never really shown any at all, morally right or otherwise. The best I can offer there is Draco and the midnight duel in PS, but I doubt that qualifies as "right" given what you wrote.

*** Thanks for adding clarity with the definition. You're right that I should have been more precise about what is considered "moral." The problem of course is that morality and what is 'right' can be subjective, so I will leave that up to your own interpretation.

And good call with the Slughorn memory, I forgot how surprisingly manipulative that was for Harry's character. Maybe Felix (or whoever made the potion) gives the drinker more cunning.

** Some general examples from real life where being cunning is a morally positive trait include:

Lawyers - Their moral alignment is typically dependent on who they work for, but there are plenty of lawyers who do good work for good causes but need to be crafty to get the best outcomes for their clients.

Politicians - Even the legendary rare species known as the 'good politician' has to be cunning in order to work the legislative deals that advance their constituents' causes, not to mention running a campaign in the first place.

Generals & Spies - Military strategists and intelligence agents need to be cunning in order to protect their country.

Sports - Cunning strategies are needed to bring the team to glorious victory.

Psychiatrist - You need to be kind of crafty to get people to willingly deal with their trauma.

Programmers - Need to be cunning to get their code to produce something workable they can present to their boss despite it being a hot mess under the hood.

Teachers - Have you ever considered what it takes to get a herd of small children to behave?

** I think a solid example from fiction would be Ozymandias from the Watchmen. Pulled off an elaborate plan to unite the world.

** I can't think of any example from canon, but concerning the situation you try to write, does your Slytherin must really not gain anything from it, or could he have so gains besides helping someone?

As an example. Let's say the Slytherin has a friendly relation with Neville and learn about his mismatched wand, and "borrow" it until Neville's grandmother is forced to buy him another one. Despite the humiliation he just suffered, in the long term Neville is better off, and the Slytherin can later use the situation for his advantage ("You said my friend and/or boyfriend was a Squibb but look at it yourself.", "Draco you always mocked Neville but didn't he just beat you in a duel" . . .).

Or, let's say the Slytherin is angry against a specific Ravenclaw for a reason, and this Ravenclaw is among the ones bullying Luna. Would helping Luna to get back at the girl work for you?

Basically, do you need your Slytherin to do something selfless, or just be a bit less of an asshole than the Canon Slytherins?

** John Constantine from Hellblazer uses cunning this way on many occasions. Though he often uses it for himself as well. In the “All His Engines” graphic novel he uses cunning to save the soul of his friend's daughter.
