While re-reading Prisoner of Azkaban I was thinking, do you think that deep down subconsciously somewhere she remembered a bit of the prophecy, or was she just lucky in her guess that year?


** Ooh. Plot bunny.

From PoV of Hermione, of course. At the start of PoA, she completely buys into divination.

Then, every single one of Trelawney's death predictions came true. Only Hermione using the time turner kept Harry alive. That's why Hermione kept getting more and more stressed - she had to go back in time and save her best friend's life on an almost twice weekly basis all year.

That's also why she stayed in Divination as long as she did. Had to have foreknowledge of when/how Harry would die. When she dropped the class, she stopped believing in Trelawney's prophecies and they stopped coming true.

Could be amusing if a crack fic.

*** Sybil Trelawney may not be the world's best seer but she is without a doubt a high-class assassin, and her prices reflect that. Professionally she is best known for the Voldemort Contract and her uncanny ability for incredibly natural-seeming deaths. While her gimmick of publicly announcing her victims via fake prophecy may seem foolish at first it was born from the necessity of having to pose a seer for a particular job. Her family reputation did the rest.

One further distinction and a sign of how strong her reputation in the business is is the fact that she can and does insist on pre-payment and doesn't give refund on failure to complete a contract. A client can be assured that she she did the very best possible and her failure only proves that a contract is impossible to fulfil.

Which is how she built up a sizeable nest egg through the Potter Contracts. Where many a colleague has perished or had to leave and seek other employment to pay the bills due to failure to fulfil a contract on the Potter boy and the excessive cost of attempts made, Sybil Trelawney's business flourishes and the clients even sign off her expenses claims without blinking. Expenses claims that she can justify easily by pointing at the world-best supporting staff she has accumulated at her base of operations.

Now Sybil Trelawney has found herself an apprentice. An apprentice who already has proven her mettle by thwarting the world's best assassins.

** She has the curse of Cassandra: she makes accurate predictions, but no one believes them.

*** Like the whole “whoever stands up dies first at a table of 13” thing in PoA. Ron had Scabbers, so the table was already at 13 when Dumbledore stood up. Dumbledore was also the first person at that table to die.

**** That prediction actually repeated in Deathly Hallows, when the Order met after the Battle of the Seven Potters, Remus was the first to get up to look for Moody.

**** But the counterexample is at the Yule Ball. With 4 champions, their dates, and 5 judges (or 4 plus Percy), there were 13 people at the High Table, but it was Dumbledore who rose first to start the dance, not Cedric.

** I think yes. I like that a fair amount of the random-ass predictions made in Divination tend to come true, whether they're the ones Harry or Ron pull out of their asses while reading tea leaves or some of Trelawney's ramblings.

  A prank in Professor Trelawney's class leads to Ron being hailed as a seer. But nobody could predict how that would change Harry's fate. AU, starts 3rd year. Powerful!Harry. Adventure/Humor.
