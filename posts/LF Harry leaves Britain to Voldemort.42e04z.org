Hey guys,

I am once again lookig for certain fanfictions (obviously!) ;)

This time I'd love some fanfictions were Harry just gives up on Britain because they simply don't deserve his fighing for them because of everything they've done to him, from unpunished bullying at Hogwarts (Malfoy, Snape, Slytherin's and other students - Heir of Slytherin, GOF ("Potter stinks!"), at the DA (How was that guy called who constantly challenged Harry's authority in in DA-Meetings?) etc.) to slandering in the media (by the Ministry no less) and allowing things like stashing him at the Dursleys and constantly keeping him in the dark etc. etc.

I want a jaded Harry who either just slips away and lets them fight it out or even publicly announces that he's had enough (note: Bonus points if he does not return, even if his friends come to beg him on their knees!)

As always: No slash (not my cup of tea) and only very very very good Harry/Ginny stories (don't like the pairing because I simply don't buy it and because I think they have less chemistry together than Harry would have with the Creevy-Brothers!)

ps: Can be mixed with Azkaban stories (wrongly accused Harry doesn't want to fight after being released!)

While Harry has many righteous reasons not to give a fuck about Britain, a guy that questions him once or twice isn't a valid one, imo.

Anyway. I've read many stories like that and they're all very cringe inducing so I don't remember most of their names, other than Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia.

I don't think it's cringe worthy if a human being doesn't give two fucks about a society that has brought him (more or less) nothing but pain and suffering!

**** I don't mean that the decision is cringeworthy, but that the stories are. They usually intensify everything wrong with wizards and bash everyone. And then Harry arrives at America or some private island that his family apparently owns, and the American healers remove the Horcrux from his head with no problem, and Harry becomes a Mary Sue that suddenly learns all that amazing magic that British wizards don't know about for some reason, and it's all oh so boring.

***** Well, is it so out of the question that the damned horcrux influenced him/hampered his learning (after all: That damned locket influenced the entire trio despite it not literally being in their heads!)?

Same for Americans (who have the native Americans there, too) knowing magic the Brits either don't or don't practise for a variety of reasons (I mean some muggles - pilgrim fathers! - left Britain for the US because of religion, so is it out of the question that some magicals left for similar reasons (believe about magic use)?)?

Still, you are not wrong, I can't stomach Super-Harry everyday either (but sometimes I am in the mood for that!)

Yes. If that were true he'd not excel in certain areas (e.g. defence/patronus), he'd just be shit across the board.

** *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), bashes everyone except the protagonists and very few others. The story is quite dark featuring Slytherin Harry/Ginny.

As for why Harry and Ginny have no chemistry together, is it because of the movies?

*** Not only the movies, it's how the books characterize Ginny (up until Harry gets in a relationship with her):

- Fangirl
- awkward around Harry ("squeak" and the elbow in the butter!)
- has many boyfriends (some in an attempt to make Harry jealous if I remember correctly) NOTE: I don't hate women who have had many men (I am not that much of an asshole to dislike women for something men are praised for!), but using jealousy etc. as a "weapon"? Disgusting!
- no real interests (other than quidditch) that we know of!
- we know nothing of her personality really (what are her plans for the future? what does she think of muggles? what classes does she like best? etc. etc.)
- then there's the fact that she's nothing like Harry's previous love interest (Cho Chang) and the fact that she kind of looks like Harry's mother Lily (kind of disturbing IMHO!)
- etc. (I had whole list of reasons...but I don't have that on hand anymore -.-)
- she's not the most supportive of Harry either IMHO (which is something he needs and sometimes he even needs a good ass kicking to get things done (that's why I love pairing him with "the bookworm" as Hermione provides all that and they both temper each others worst impulses - she checks his jumping headlong into things and gets him to study while he checks her excessive learning and total trust in authority figures (trust most of them do not deserve!))

**** I see that your negative opinion of her comes mostly from first three books.

As for your other points, they are simply not true.

- For example, she taking other boyfriends to make Harry notice was Hermione's idea.

- No real interests? Well, what other interests did Ron have beside Quidditch? What other interests did Hermione have beside reading books?

- Not knowing her personality? You haven't been really paying attention to books 5-7. This post greatly dissects both Ginny's strengths and weaknesses: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/41m776/resurrecting_ginny_weasley/]]

- As for Ginny looking like Lily, don't you think Snape would throw a fit first? Just because they are both read heads doesn't mean they will look like each other. You wouldn't say Emma Stone looks like Karen Gillan?

- As for not supportive of him? Do you forget who brought Harry out of his Christmas hell in OoTP, or how she reacted to Harry using sectumsempra against Draco in HBP vs Hermione?

***** Hermione:

- creature rights
- magic as a whole (theories behind it - it's alwas noted that she does well in tests, but Harry's practical is almost as good as her's and better than her's in defence! - arithmancy, runes etc.)
- she probably also reads for pure pleasure (fictional stuff, though we don't see that in the books)

Ron (note: I hate having to defend him):

- chess
- quidditch tactics (not only playing but he's deeper into it than Harry is!)
- his family (being an overprotective older brother -.-)
- the twins joke-shop

Sure Ginny is not entirely out of the blue, but it's not a great fit (you could argue the same for Harry and Hermione, but Hermione at least doesn't have a temper and she knows how to compromise!)...Rowling could have easily built up another character with the effort put into "one big happy Weasley family" (I mean I do like the idea of Harry and Hermione, but I'd also have been ok with all of the trio finding partners later in live or maybe even not at all (this: you find your true love in school always rubbed me the wrong way, especially if its so close to "home" (remember: Harry only sees Hogwarts and the Burrow as HOME)...has something of incest (not that I am strictly against - if it's among consenting adults and protection is used/a baby is not the goal then I have no problem at all with it, frankly I don't care!)...)

** If i recall correctly, in this fic he originally leaves Britain for a better education, but once this happens, he realizes Voldemort is pretty weak (in the context of the story) but he very, very rarely even deals with Voldemort or Britain, sadly the series is un finished (2 fics complete and 1 abandoned).
