  “Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore.

  “How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.

  “It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply.

Chapter 26 of /HBP/. When magic is done, something is left behind that the skilled can read/understand.

*** A friendly reminder: it's a limited 3rd person PoV from perspective of a kid who was abused at childhood. This scene is about a dying man talking to a kid that he plans to send for death/sacrifice at the end of horcrux hunt.

I don't think Dumbledore's words to such a narrator holds any value.

** As Professor Dumbledore puts in in /Half-Blood Prince/, "Magic... especially /dark/ magic... leaves traces". A skilled Aurologist like Dumbledore could probably have determined that Voldemort had used an Unforgivable on Harry that night, and which one was an easy guess.

Moreover, the Killing Curse /was/ Voldemort's trademark spell. It would have been surprising that he'd use anything /but/ his quintessential weapon when trying to off the Child of Prophecy.

If you consider that info as canon (but it was revealed through the video games, so not everyone does), the wand motion for the Killing Curse is also a lightning-bolt shape, making the connection with Harry's scar obvious.

** Doesn't Voldemort confirm it in the graveyard?

** linkffn(12760426) Lily's protection would have destroyed all of Voldemort's Horcruxes had he used the Killing Curse, and Voldemort was sadistic enough to use a blood-boiling curse, which ended up /melting/ him, according to Snape.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** And, seeing as how the Ministry is able to detect the use of underage magic, it would make sense to me that they could have some sort of a trace on Adava Kedava.
