The Peggy Sue trope (or, died and woke up in the past) is pretty common in the Harry Potter fandom. If you have been reading fanfiction for a long time, you probably stumbled on at least two. Some are very famous, like Nightmares of Future Past and Sisyphus. But I don't get the ones where the trope has no narrative purpose.

One thing is when the author wants to tell a story that explores this type of dynamics, but sometimes is just... there? Like a sort of tool to a fix-it fic, or an excuse to make the character act OOC or give them different motivations instead of just write them in that way in that original timeline anyway as a canon divergence. Don't know if I'm making myself clear.

I'm just curious not exactly the reason why it's so popular but why some people try to insert the trope even in fics where it wouldn't be needed for the plot to work.


** Your question seems to come in two parts - why do people use Peggy Sue Trope, and why do people use it instead of just AUing a story?

For the first, I'd imagine it's either Affection or Catharsis, pretty much. Might be some variety here and there, but I'd say it's probably those two for the most part.

The Peggy Sue trope is usually used in time-travel fix-it fics by writers wanting to make something/someone 'better' or to 'make everything okay' again.

In the first, a lot of people look at the characters and are dissatisfied with what and/or who they are (the whole 'Harry is a moron!' thing, for example). The Peggy Sue trope lets them have that character learn to be better, while still maintaining the old character they dislike.

In the second, they simply want to 'change the ending', so to speak and keep characters alive who died or give better lives to those who had less than stellar lives in canon (usually Harry/Snape having better parents, and Remus having less of a shit time with the werewolf thing).

Thus, the writer helps the characters they have affection for and gets catharsis when things turn out better.

As to why those people might use the Peggy Sue trope rather than AU-ing the world, it kind of means less if they're just better without any work. If someone believes Harry can be a genius or Snape can be less of a dick, just making them have always been better doesn't prove their point, just their imagination. It's basically the narrative version of 'show your working' from maths classes. :D

Also, if them getting better isn't the main plot and their characters were always better, that means they have to come up with a different story. :D

Like most things, the trope is often... not the most adroitly used, which is why most of those fics come off the way they do, but the intention is well enough.

In this I'll have to disagree... here you not only have a character that knows everything that is going to happen so they already are aware of their mistakes and don't actually have to /learn/ anything, but also an author that won't need to think of situations, backgrounds and details that would make their character different from canon. The "show your working" here comes off as more "I looked at the answers at the end of the textbook".

I mean... yes and no. You do have a point in that knowing the outcome isn't really conducive to learning from an event, but it is conducive to changing said event. Snape knows that if he calls Lily a mudblood, that'll be the final nail in the coffin of his friendship with her. So, he also knows that if he changes that, he might be able to keep or improve that friendship. That consequence is what he'd then learn from.

It also relies on the traveller knowing that what they did is a mistake. Generally speaking, everything a person does is what they think to be the best option at the time, so it's not guaranteed that they'd know they fucked up without seeing the consequence.

#+end_quote

And well, yeah. The appeal isn't creating whole new situations that change a character, but 'changing canon' to create a better character. It's essentially trying to prove that Rowling fucked up by 'treating a character the way she did' and showing that they could've turned out better if she'd written something slightly differently.

For the record, this isn't my logic, just my understanding of the logic often used by Peggy Sue writers. Intellectual empathy is something of a hobby of mine. :)

Meh, still better than when the MC believes he has to "maintain" the timeline so everything happens exactly the same way than in canon even though MC is supposed to be sooooo much stronger.

**** I differ.

You talk about "maintain the timeline" and "everything happens the same way" as if they were 2 different things. One doesn't happen because of the other. The why is what's important here.

In my story I have a married Ron going to first year, and of course he wants things unchanged. THe readers might think "hurry save Sirius".... or Cedric.... or Fred... or Horrcruxes. Ron in this case is "Man, I got back here. I love my future, and it was very difficult to get. Anything I change means I won't get that future". So yes, he would be more in character trying to return to his time, and changing as little as he can in the meantime.

If you say "everything happens as in canon" as an annoying thing that makes fics feel the same and kind of boring. I agree. You shouldn't write the same thing or else what's the point. At the moment I am running close to canon, trying to hold readers interest with small but important changes here and there as well as lots of characterization and inner thoughts of Ron. But I'm on the verge of pulling out the point of no return, the point where things can't be kept the same anymore.

And yeah, I consider that better than one-week-fix-it-all-noone-dies-nothing-bad-happens-all-pairings-are-together-at-once things

**** This is why I like the subversion of this, where the MC is trying to do everything they possibly can to change the future, it's just the laws of causality and the universe itself fighting against the changes being made; either by trying to resist said changes as hard as possible, or by having things go catastrophically bad for the MC.

I think it's also a missed opportunity to explore everything that time travel implies.

**** Well, as my flair says... I don't like to negate canon... but I also want things to go different. So I do Time Travels a lot. There are 2 things I stay away from... 1 are simple fix-its that feel more like wish fulfillment than anything else... and 2 stories where the characters goes back and returns and nothing really happens. The Time Travel needs to either alter the future once/if the character returns to his time... or at least alter the timeline he left behind.

Look at what I'm currently writing for example:

1. Ron back to first year. Tries to return and tries to keep things unchanged while he discovers how to do so... but things come exploding in his face. Why? because little things do change stuff... and it is not that easy to fix everything in one week.
2. Rose and Hugo going back to sixt year with the clear intention of changing time.
3. James, Al, Lily, Rose and Hugo as kids.... going back as an accident to first year (yeah, up until here it reads like tons of other stories). But, 1... Dumbledore has no idea how to return them, as of now... and 2... the Ministry is totally aware of something going on because its records now think HGRH are married at 11/10 years old.
4. I'm starting one where fourth year HGRH go to the future instead of the past.
5. I have a curious one planned for Harry traveling to fourth year
6. And another where trio plus Neville travel to the first year and things go weird pretty soon
7. I have an old one I need to reupload at some point of Neville traveling to fifth year... and the future altered almost as once.

So yeah pretty cool concepts I hope... but also lots of things to write. SO all early WIPs

** Time travel adds a different dynamic to character choices - the knowledge of the future - or, depending on the version, just the past experiences - can produce strong reactions. That's pretty obvious... even if, as you mention, it shouldn't be /required/.

I think it's a mix of people liking time travel, it being a nice shortcut, and having ideas that work better with a character driven by memories of a potential future that make a lot of people use it peripherally in fics.

** I'm assuming that the author tried to make the characters unique and explore different dynamics but... failed. It happens- an author could start writing a fic with the intent of making it unique and amazing but lose steam as the story progresses and turning it into another canon rehash.

Also, as you've said, the genre is highly popular- I like it a lot myself (but only time travel to other eras like marauders era or Grindelwald era or something.) and that might motivate authors to include it into their fics.

Those at least don't need to rehash the 7 years we already saw hundreds of times, But This Time, Harry Is Different! So they must add something interesting. Any you recommend?
