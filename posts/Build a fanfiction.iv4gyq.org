Its often easy to write the first chapter or so of a story but it gets hard to flesh out the plot bunny a lot more. So have your readers suggest a tooic for the next chapter and then pick the most interesting or popular one. You're story may end up wild and crazy and conoletely unpredictable which would be fun to read, especially if as a reader you didn't look at the comment suggestions.

*** this would probably work best for an experienced writer who is looking for something fun to do in their spare time or as a side project. A challenge every chapter to keep it all together. The chaoter suggestions i imagined would be an event that the author can build uo to and incorporate somehow. It would be an interesting read because tge entire story wouldn't follow tge same plot line of events that 90% do.

**** That's what I was going to say too - an interesting idea for as specific challenge in and of itself. It's something I would do, since I live for prompt-based writing as a way to procrastinate from my one massive project. You could have the author provide the story summary (with their personal ground rules), then the next comment is the next chapter/scene/driving action. Repeat until set number of comments/chapter ideas is reached, then the author posts the results? Maybe?

** Harry finds a mentor for magic before Hogwarts... unfortunately it is an obliviated squib who knows almost nothing of actual magic and decided to fill the void with new-age shit, old pagan religion and traditions and lots of pseudoscience crap... poor Harry.
