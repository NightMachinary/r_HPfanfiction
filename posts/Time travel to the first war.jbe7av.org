Are there any fics where Harry time travels to the first war? Not Marauders time but more like 20 year old marauders and lily. If possible with them interacting with him and his identity known.


** linkffn(Wind Shear) has him travel to that era, but IIRC he doesn't reveal himself (with his actual identity) to the Marauders or Lily.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
