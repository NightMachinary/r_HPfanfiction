Reading the latest chapter of Tsu Doh Nimh's "The Unsuspecting Side of the Force" has made me crave more fic where authors take advantage of how OP the Resurrection Stone is. The only fic I know of that really focuses on it is esama's "Whispers in Corners" where Harry pretends to be a medium. I was wondering if there was anything similar to it or if there was other fic that has Harry use it in ways that go beyond just talking to the dead people he personally likes.

  Everything started with a stumble - his new life in a new world as well as his surprisingly successful career as a medium.

** Yeah I've always thought that the resurrection stone without any gimmicky drawbacks would be disgustingly strong. Insider information on practically anything.

Assuming the ghosts are cooperative. Or maybe even if they're not, maybe the Elder Wand can affect them.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
