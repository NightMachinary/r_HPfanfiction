With Harry involved in a Crime Case and gets attracted to a Female Criminal (or apparently suspect (all clues lead to her or whatever)) and eventually (or even a couple of times) sleeps with her (whether he is married with Ginny or not doesnt matter, but i would prefer the former one. There can be that Hermione finds out about his "adventures" and haveing a debate with him.

Alternatively, the same as above but with Hermione gets attracted (whether in straight or Lesbian/bi way doesnt matter). Or maybe even Ginny as an Inspector or the AU way and Harry gets attracted to her as a Criminal/suspect.


** *The*, and I do mean *the* Noir HP fic is linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble). Now, it does not meet the requirements/preferences you have up there, but it is literally the only true noir piece of Harry Potter Fanfiction I can think of. Nothing else comes close.

*** There's a few other Harry/Daphne stories that all follow along the same lines of "The Big Sleep". This was probably the 4th or 5th I've seen doing it, and I will say it does it the best, but while it's extremely well written, the plot itself is decidedly average.

**** Hmm, I don't really recall more than the first chapter of Unatoned to be a play off of /The Big Sleep/, but I haven't read it in a while and it was before I really knew anything about /The Big Sleep/.

Man, I really need to read the novel version of it. I've seen the Bogart movie, and read the original, pulp magazine version. But not the novel.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

** One or two of Zeitgeist84's fics have that sort of feeling - criminal underworld, bleak atmosphere, Harry and co investigating crimes - although the plot is not like in your request. it's either /The King of Limbs/ or /Midnight Blues/, I don't remember exactly. Probably /The King of Limbs/ given its listed genres on FFN.

  "After the war, I thought it would be easy. Work with the Aurors, get married, have children. Buy a big house, play Quidditch with the kids---be a family man. But, well, you know how it goes. Terrorism. Drugs. MI-7. England. And of course, here I am, stuck in the middle of it. Some things never change, I guess." Post-DH, EWE. HP/HG

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
