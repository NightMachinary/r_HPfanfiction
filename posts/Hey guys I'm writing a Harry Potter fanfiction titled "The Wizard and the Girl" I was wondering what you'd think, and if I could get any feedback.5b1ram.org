** A quick summary, It's the story of a young girl named Julia Alumn. A muggle and an orphan at West Hill orphanage in London. On a particularly nasty day, she's saved from a magical creature by a mysterious man who calls himself the Professor. He proceeds to adopt her and take her on a journey through the magical world, exploring its secrets and the origins of the Professor himself.

*** Sounds like the magical version of Dr Who. I like the summary, it promises a lot of adventures so I'd read it.
