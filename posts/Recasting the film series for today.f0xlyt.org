I've recently watched this video on youtube where this guy recast the characters based on current actors. He made some interesting choices, some of which I agree with and some of them not so much.

What I want to know is if they were to reboot the film series who would you want playing which character and why?

Heres the link to the video if any one wants to watch it: [[https://youtu.be/_6EdLwjBZPc]]

  suggested that Samuel L. Jackson be Alastor Moody. Now I can't get his voice shouting "Constant Vigilance, Motherf*ckers!" out of my head

Now I can't get it out of /my/ head. Thanks for that...

** I disagree with him suggesting American actors for some of the roles (i.e. Adam Driver as Snape). It would be incredibly offputting. One of the charms of the original was its almost completely UK/Irish cast imo.

But now all I can think of is the fact that David Tennant is old enough to play actual Moody and not Barty Crouch Jr. And what role Martin Freeman could play (he's in everything nowadays). He would make a nice Lupin but he's a little old if we're casting the Mauraders based on their book ages. Fun thought exercise. Hugh Skinner and Emily Beecham would make a great James & Lily and they're the right age for it (35).

**** Now I want an entire Weasley spinoff series starring Martin Freeman as Arthur. It'd be hilarious.

*** Definitely agree on the first point, Americans would really ruin the immersion for me.

I don't think Martin Freeman's too old though. It would make sense for a werewolf to look older than his actual age, the transformations are bound to age a person.

**** I don't think Martin Freeman by himself or with a 40 year old plus marauders cast like in the original would look too old, but I was picturing Robert Pattinson as Sirius (he's 33, so only a year or too off from Sirius's canon age in PoA) and it would be so strange to have a 15 year age difference between them since they'd share screentime.

** I find this question to be very hard to answer, mostly because the original character were so well-chosen (albeit not always well portrayed). Like you, I found myself agreeing with almost all of the cast in the video...

** I didn't watch the 10+ minute video that could appear as 10 lines of text, but Tom Holland could play James. He's the right age.

*** Tom Holland is somewhere around 23 - 25 (i don't know exactly) but he was blursed with baby face and i think that watermelons a bit too ripe for the taking. maybe in a decade or so.

**** James died age 21. And Tom Holland looks the age of an average 21 year old

*** I think Hugh Skinner would be a better option, partly because Holland is too big a celebrity for such a bit part and looks too young. Skinner's also built like a Quidditch chaser (skinny af) and would add a comedic element to James. He would make him seem like a Marauder. Here's a picture of him with messy hair: [[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fc4942342-ddfb-11e8-b968-1adbb9782acb.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0]]

***** I know, but like Tom Holland he sometimes plays younger characters. I just think he has more of a "James" vibe than Tom Holland. I've seen most of Holland's films outside of the MCU and he has no real range.

If you really want to have an early 20 year old, Asa Butterfield would be better imo.

** I don't care which actor becomes which character but let me say, you would not find a more worthy actor for playing 'Albus Dumbledore' character than Amitabh Bachchan. If you don't know who he is, he is a legendary actor in Bollywood in India.

*** I know he's almost 80, but he somehow still looks too young to play Dumbledore? I don't think he has the right personality either. I've watched him in both Pink and Piku and he's kinda typecast as a cranky or neurotic man with secret emotions. Reminds me more of Alan Rickman than someone I'd consider for Dumbledore.
