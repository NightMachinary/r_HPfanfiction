:END:
James (or maybe Sirius?) sees a statue of Harry in the future. That's all I'm remembering. Might have been a one shot? I think it was pretty melancholy. Obviously I know it's a long shot! Thank you to anyone who remembers!!!


** This has some similarities to Crossing Lines. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][I don't remember anyone seeing statues, but the Marauders do find out (a) that Peter's a war hero and (b) that Harry becomes the boy who lived.]]
