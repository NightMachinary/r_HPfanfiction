This is a rant actually, but I get so frustrated when I read an amazing and creative synopsis, then I open the story and it's poorly written with a lot of unnecessary out of character behaviours and terrible writing (contradictions and incoherent situations, over the top cliche dialogues, many grammar and punctuation mistakes, etc.) I sometimes write my own version of it because I just can't stop thinking about this wasted plot, but I don't post it because it would be sheer plagiarism.

Am I the only one? How do you cope with this tragedy? Lol

**** I used to be in a Skype group with five or six friends and we were all fanfic authors... except I was never able to get around to my story ideas because I'd ended up becoming the designated editor for the others, who would all spend hours upon hours going on and on about their own stories, but the second I brought up a story idea of my own they'd all be suddenly busy or AFK. I wrote the summaries for all of their fics. I made them readable, too. But when I'd finally said "I'm taking a week break to focus on my own ideas," they called me a selfish, horrible friend and kicked me. NONE of their stories have updated since, and in fact only one of them still logs in to his account anymore.

So that's likely where good summaries come from when the stories themselves are shit. Other editors like me who just try too hard to be helpful, and end up reamed.

******* I hope you find the right inspiration. You certainly will make good stories, given public reaction to your former friends' fanfictions when they lost your help. It's a bummer that it took you so long to start writing again, but hey, at least they got what they deserved.

I've read an advice once that might work for you: establish incredibly low goals. For example, make your goal to write 200 words everyday. 200 words isn't much when it comes to a whole fanfiction, but taking the time to write everyday, even if it's so little, eventually gives you inspiration and makes you eager to produce more. Then, do the same after you finish a chapter or two to edit them. At worst you will take some time but will finish the editing. At best, it will make you eager to continue the story, because the plot is entertaining.

**** Editing is a massively important part of writing that people forget! The big "myth" that was sold early on about Harry Potter, that Rowling had it all come to her, fully realized and perfect, in a single moment of epiphany, is crap. Reading the series it's very obvious that that's not how it worked, or stuff wouldn't have dramatically changed between books like it did.

Assuming the general outline of the story came to her all at once, there were definitely chunks of stories, or subplots, or even characters that were part of the original idea that didn't make it.

One of the reasons Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author and current main author inspiration is because he's honest about how heavily his books are edited and about the fact that he's had to scrap scenes he adored because they didn't fit with the direction the narrative went. His books go through many rounds of editing before publication, and in some cases change very dramatically. He's even put the first draft of the first book of the Stormlight Archive out so people can appreciate how different a published novel is from its original iteration with editing and rewriting.

​

Could you give me some examples, please? I think I read that she had the whole idea from the beginning, but that was a long time ago.

​

In fact, what I read the most now is that it wasn't that simple. A lot of information she wanted to include about Voldemort in the Chamber of Secrets was transferred to Prince Half Blood because the editor thought it was too much information.

​

One of the interesting facts is how she had to rewrite Goblet of Fire when she was halfway through the book to remove a character named Mafalda who just didn't fit and she wasn't even sure what the tasks would be like until she had to plan Goblet of Fire.

​

But I think it's some details and things like no one says "Death Eater" until the fourth book, but that could have been mentioned in the second book when Lucius appeared (as one of the reasons why the Weasleys don't like Lucius). Is there more like that?

If it's a popular or "cute" slash pairing it'll get a ton of kudos. There's stuff on there when I sort by Kudos that are genuinely awful cliched writing with bad grammar and spelling yet it'll have thousands of kudos. The ones with decent spelling are often weak on plot, where any plot is just excuse building about how they're actually gay. Stereotypical fanon character building is the rule there to justify this.

What I was talking about was a person who was telling me about mistakes I made in regards to canonical events, despite me telling everyone in my a/n at the beginning of the fic, that some things would not remain the same, while most would remain unchanged.

For example, they told me that I was wrong, that Bellatrix had indeed been present at the battle of yhe Astronomy tower.

That's only half correct. In the film, Bella replaced Amycus Carrow, at the top of the tower. I can understand, that people might get confused, beacause those terrible films contradicted the books quite a bit.

If there is something I would love to get if I ever post a fanfiction is good criticism. It gives me insight. Besides, I also find it very hard to sound natural in my writing because English isn't my first language, so I would appreaciate if people helped me improve that.

** Ah yes, the great idea, terrible execution.

​

Would it be plagiarism though? Taking someones concept and writing your own story is not plagiarism, nearly every story in existence (and not just fanfiction) is borrowing ideas and themes from stories that came before. Besides it's fanfiction... the idea of fanfiction authors complaining about others 'stealing' their ideas is so funny, it makes me cry. For fucks sake, coming up with a core plot idea is the EASY part. That's why there's so many fics with great ideas and horrible executions. Besides, not even patent law protects an IDEA, it protects how you make that idea actually HAPPEN.

Well depending on what you are actually changing. Taking the premise and writing a better story shouldn't be wrong. I suppose if you are just copy pasting the chapter and then editing behavior/contradictions/incoherence that might be a step too far. But considering how badly done some ideas are, I doubt you could keep doing that for more then a chapter or two before the plot starts veering apart by sheer necessity.

** Heyyyyy. Why does this remind me of something, Sword Art Online. In all seriousness, there's three routes that this can take.

1. I decide I like the premise and steal it. For the record, this goes for unfinished books that seem like they will never be finished as well. We're already writing fanfiction and skirting copyright law, so it's honestly not any worse to me, so long as you don't try to take credit for someone else's work (ie. reposting).

2. If I decide I'm too lazy to write it (or simply don't want to), I look for other books like it. AO3 has tags and FFN has Google (which also works for AO3 if there's no tags). This option is also normally done for books I enjoy. I have a tendency to bulk read tropes. For the record the read a really good version has backfired before. I once read a really interesting non-porn A/B/O mechanics book in The King's Avatar fandom and it's only ever been matched by a writing prompt on the same fandom... you'd think I'd have learned by now.

3. If it was truly terrible to the point I don't want to see anything else like it, I'll read a book from a select list of my absolute favourites.

** Plot is not copyrightable, even in commercial work, nor is theme, so if you want to write your own version of the story, you're absolutely free to do so. (And in fact, I've never seen a large fandom that didn't have multiple riffs on usually half a dozen popular stories.) What's copyrightable is the exact text, and obvious direct rewording of it, and the "specific expression" of the ideas. It would probably be a nice gesture to include an "inspired by" in your notes, but legally and even morally, you don't even have to do that.

One peculiar thing I noticed on this topic is that I've honestly lost count of the amount of fics that have an amazing idea, somewhat cliche but readable buildup, and suddenly just burn everything by shoehorning in a relationship that has no precedent or reason for it like 3/4ths of the way through the fic, and it proceeds to take over the plot.

** Unfortunately, that's just the way it is. It's always easier to have a cool singular idea than the execution to develop it well over a longer period of time - or to have the other good ideas that spin off from that premise.

Fanfiction is also a little more unique in having the rest of the world created in many works - so all that's needed is that original idea/premise, and people can get going. And, of course, a ton of amateur writers, which doesn't help with a lot of the more base level mistakes you're noticing (w/out an editor).

I would say that there's no reason you can't take someone's basic plot/premise idea and refine it further - if you wanted to post it, I'm sure most fanfic authors would be delighted that you enjoyed the idea enough to do so if you asked. But even if not, it'd take a pretty specific take for me to consider that plagiarism.

It's like some people said below about how much first drafts differ from final drafts. By the time you're done with it, it might not even bear that much resemblance to the original idea.

I guess the real kicker would be how common the badly written conceit is. If it's a spin on a trope, I don't think there's anything wrong with working through that idea yourself...that'd be like saying no one else could write a magical boarding school story because that's JKR's thing. Ridiculous. (And she didn't even invent the genre, but that's beside the point.) As long as you change details and make the story unique, it's no longer plagiarism at that point.

If, however, the badly written conceit is an original high-level concept...that's a harder judgement call.

I've paid for books with brilliant summaries that turned out to be unreadable, at least by me, because of poor writing. And that's with editors and big name publishers, fanfic writers rarely have that much support. I also remind myself that it's very subjective too. I've read, or at least started, stories that from my point of view were just shit an absolute waste of someone's time to have written. But, they had fans. Many fans who seemed sincere. I understand your rant though. It is such a let down, the perfect summary of awesome paired with the shittiest execution. To handle it, I remind myself it's free, it's subjective, and it's a human being on the other end of the story who loved the fandom enough to write a story and was brave enough to share it. So I bite my tongue, keep my opinion to myself and spend a lot of time searching key words in the hope I find a similar story that's well written to scrub the disappointment from my heart 🤷‍♀️❤️

** Yeah, I feel ya. I read on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I usually sort by reviews. It's not perfect but I find that long fics + lots of reviews with an interesting summary = pretty good fanfic.

*** Fanfiction.net has weird filters. I don't know how to use them, so sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I mostly scroll down and when I find an interesting synopsis, I check for these things.

** It wouldn't be plagiarism, honestly. There are many tropes. And your fic would just be based on it.

** Worse, when the synopsis sounds good but has three spelling mistakes. Grammarly exists for a reason. Sometimes I get the feeling some authors don't even read back what they've written.

Some things that will make me drop a story are: constant misusing their, there, they're. Lower case I in the middle of a sentence. Interchanging then and than. Qualifiers on the word unique. Describing the same character with the same description more than once. Seriously, I die a little bit every time I read these.

*** 'well, that's unique.'

'how so, my boy?'

'Uniquely unique, Headmaster.'

And I think many a writer just dictates their story on the phone and doesn't let it simmer in the editing cauldron before clicking on 'publish'.

** Idea is easy. Execution is difficult and key. In my head, I divide fanfiction as such:

A story with an idea that is standard fare but well written and with a high artistic quality is a story where you think 'wow, the author should publish their own work', or 'wow, I've never seen this trope in such a light'. Those kind of fanfiction stories become the kind that everyone recommends to people new to fanfiction; a sort of 'core' of the fanfiction base.

A story with an amazing idea but mediocre writing goes into the Favorites folder as well. Mediocre writing means a few spelling mistakes here and there, wooden dialogue, a few placing issues, stuff like that. Basically you can see that a layman without much fiction writing experience has really tried to write a story and poured their heart out. Often, you even see improvements along the way with the author gaining experience. Sometimes, those kinds of stories define a new trope or fanfiction sub genre.

Of course there are stories that are well written and have amazing ideas. Those become instant classics in the fanbase, or the hidden gems where your heart sings like a golden bell when you find them.

Anything with less-then-mediocre writing quality I sort out at least by end of first chapter. Any author who doesn't polish their first chapter to their best of their ability wont produce better quality later on, and reading something badly written feels like pulling teeth. The few times I pushed on I regretted it - most often, the interesting idea sinks because of further bad plot choices.

Of course, there are the stories with at least mediocre writing, a interesting synopsis, but the plot is uninspired (never 'weird' - I love weird, when believable). Think 'divergence Story, but author reiterates Canon with only detail variations until 4th year'. Those break my heart even more than straight up bad writing, because i'd love to get to the interesting bits but the 200k words in-between the beginning and the interesting parts are killing the story.

TBH, I've been getting more discerning towards that last sort of story after a few years of reading fanfiction - after 20 times, reading 'Canon but a little bit different' feels like waiting at the DMV for 2 hours. I don't want to feel that way when I read fanfiction.

** Do you know of how many stories are out there with my favourite tropes and they seem so similar, but aren't because the writer has a different take on those tropes? Unless you copied and pasted from the original story and put it into your work, then it isn't plagiarism.

I do this all the time with my fanfiction or even original work. I see somebody writing about the marauders and are disappointed with character portrayals, so I write my own version of the story with a similar plot, but make it different.

*** I didn't know that. I've seen fanfics on good reads and I thought that was a platform only for original stories. Maybe this is where these paid stories are posted. I will definitely check this out.

**** No, I think that's just people inputting stories so that they can track the stories. Similar to how the chaps and chapettes at TVTropes get a kick out adding stories on there, as well.
