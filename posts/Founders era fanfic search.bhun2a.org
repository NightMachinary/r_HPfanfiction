There was a fanfic i read a while back about harry traveling to the founders he stays and makes a Hogwarts house and Hogsmede the London Magical center not diagon alley. Any help finding this would be great.


** Sounds like this: linkffn(11863248) Apparently it is a rewrite although it just seems to have made the chapters a decent length. I recently read the original version on fictionhunt but it seems it has been removed from there recently as well. Ignore the 2016 published date too, i believe the repost began sometime last month so its updating weekly or slightly more often.

  When Harry wishes himself to Hogwarts for his Sorting, he ends up at the first Sorting ever. Due to a prank, which he plays on Dumbledore, he greatly changes history for the whole magical world. Completely AU! Time travel! My favourite among my stories.
