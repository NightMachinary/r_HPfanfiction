:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much about this fic and some of the details may be confused with other fanfics. Sorry!

It can't remember if it was a time travel story or if Harry was just really smart but, the scene I remember is him going to Gringotts and “ defeating” Tom through right of conquest. Harry lays claim to the Slytherin lordship due to right of conquest and some how strips Tom of his magic? Or maybe life force? I don't remember specifics, but this leads to Tom sucking out magic from his followers via the dark mark. This drains the magical cores of his followers and slowly kills his followers and eventually Voldemort himself. I remember the Daily Prophet claiming it to be an unknown disease or something.

In the end, all of the death eaters (beside Severus?) die and Harry defeats Voldemort without lifting a finger.

I've been looking for this fic for a while, so if any of you have any ideas that would be fantastic!

Thanks! :)
