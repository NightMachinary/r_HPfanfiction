I'm talking situations like when she tries to do her power play and have him use the blood quill, he basically says f that and leaves.


** I read one fic where Harry actually figures out Fudge is trying to railroad him and manages to convince the Minister he was hoodwinked by Dumbledore. As a result he gets himself in a position where he can cleverly blunt many of Umbridge's less-than-well-thought-out initiatives. I forget the name of it, though.

But I do believe as a result he manages to either get the blood quill confiscated or banned.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I believe that that occurs in the Dangerverse series; Harry refuses to write with the blood quill, Umbridge responds by taking him to Dumbledore and demanding that Harry be expelled.\\
Dumbledore responds by hinting at a secret passage in his office, which Harry uses to give Umbridge the slip, before proceeding to hide within Hogwarts and prank her non-stop.

**** Funnily enough, neither. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Dangerverse][The TvTropes page is here]], and the book that covers [[https://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Facing_Danger/index/][year 5 with Umbridge is here]].

Be warned, it's /thoroughly/ diverged from canon.
