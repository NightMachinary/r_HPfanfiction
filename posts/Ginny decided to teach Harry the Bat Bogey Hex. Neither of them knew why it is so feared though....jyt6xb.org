Consider that the Bat Bogey Hex is unlike other spells. With normal spells, when you double the power input, the output power doubles also (Input and output power are directly proportional). But what if the Bat Bogey Hex is one of a few curses that are far more dangerous than that? What if the output power is logarithmic (every double in input power equals a increase in output power by an order of magnitude)? Or perhaps proportional to the input power squared (output power equals the input power times itself)? This is just a little idea that could result in Harry or Ginny completely over powering the spell and causing their victim (Draco, random DE, Voldemort) to be completely destroyed, etc. Perhaps you could expand this trait to other seemingly simple, mostly harmless spells? Eat Slugs results in your head exploding with slugs, incarcerous becomes a human leper shredder, etc? Could be an interesting concept to use in a story with an advanced magic system. I think I've seen a similar concept in a couple of fics before.


** That would be really hard to write consistently and without over or underpowering the characters. But yes, it would be great. You write you have read fanfics with a magical system, do you have recommendations?

*** I agree that consistency would be key. Sometimes overpowering a character is not so bad, as long as you maintain reason and logic. I was considering this idea for a crack/humour fic rather than a serious story. I cant think of any good magic system fics off the top of my head. Most runic fics are generally quite good. Runic Animagi perhaps? Or Steel Wings? Both are fairly good fics but as I remember they explore the magic system less and the nuanced/mysterious magical abilities more so.

** Ah, I see an opportunity to talk about [[https://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]].

The aforementioned bat-bogey hex ends up increasing the size of the bats to the point that the victim's noses explode.

Bluebell flames, the spell that makes fire that doesn't burn things? Yeah, tell that to the hundreds of acromantula corpses.

The magic system in this fic is defined as spells having three categories.

1. Takes a fixed amount of power to cause a fixed effect. Such as Lumos or Petrificus Totalus
2. Takes a variable amount of power to cause a fixed effect, depending on the circumstances. Using Wingardiam Leviosa on a boulder vs a feather, one needs more power than the other, but the same effect happens.
3. Takes a variable amount of power to cause a variable effect. The variable effect is normally how strong the spell is. Examples include Expelliarmus (see Snape vs Lockhart,) and Expecto Patronum.

** Not many people know that but the bat-bogey hex uses the snot within your nasal cavities to form its bats. Which can get very tedious for the victim if they have a cold or other affliction causing a constantly dripping nose. But the real horror starts when the victim runs out of bogeys and snot before the spell has run its course. Few are willing to describe the experience afterwards but observers agree that agonised screams are usually involved.

** Remus' Wadiwasi in book3 is a good candidate. You can even science it up by saying it's a propulsion spell with an antifriction component. The second part could remove air resistance and whatnot and make the spell more... bullet-like.

The batbogey hex uses the target's on bogeys as the target of the transformation. Bogeys are really just mucus. There's so much mucus in the human body. Your sinuses produce it. Your digestive tract uses it as a lining. It's frankly a lot.

Imagine if the Slugs hex uses the mucus in the stomach as the target. And then you overpower it and it consumes even the stomach lining. Yeah, your victim is going to wish they were dead. Stomach Acid without the lining /burns/.
