Is there any threat, etiehr already in fiction, or an original threat, which can cause even Voldemort to go, 'OK, yeah unless we join with the Order, everyone dies.' I am thinking Doom Eternal's demon invasion. Anything else?


** Any strong enough threat from an external enemy could force a temporary alliance.

I've read one fanfic in which Voldemort and Dumbledore's factions ally due to a shadowy muggle organization attacking the wizarding world. It was only a serious threat because the organization had developed technology to form magic-negation fields and they had amassed enough intelligence to figure out where many of the civilian wizarding population centres were located.

In a different fic, Grindelwald broke out of Nurmengard and rallied his forces to attack Britain, thus forcing Voldemort, Dumbledore and the Ministry to all work together.

But what I'd /really/ love to see is the two faction putting aside their squabbles to deal with an alien invasion that threatens to wipe out humanity as a whole, à la [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ToTheStars][To The Stars]].

The fic has some great plot ideas and interesting worldbuilding, but it also has some seriously weird and squicky sections. Also, the author abandoned it before the plot was resolved, so I don't generally recommend it.

** You'd need a threat not just big enough to put the war on hold, but to force them to ally to survive.

Keep in mind that this is similar to something like... "Threat so terrible that literal Nazis team up with Jews, dark-skinned people, etc. with all parties willingly going for it"

There have been so many atrocities at this point...

​

Probably:

1. Alien invasion (see for example Turtledove's Worldwar)
2. SoS collapses in a scenario that leads immediately to attempted magical genocide
3. An apocalypse happens (particularly large supervolcanic eruption, dinosaur-killer meteorite impact, thermonuclear MAD, etc.)

** There was one fic where the war didn't stop, it swapped to a cold war. Apparently the Ravenclaws were bored one day and did some math. Magical Britain couldn't survive if so many more magicals died. So it developed into a cold war style fight.

If anyone knows the name of this fic, please say something. I've been wanting to re-read it for a while.

** I don't think cancelling the war necessarily means joining the order. Something like a goblin rebellion or the violent fall of the statue of secrecy would probably take priority over the war but neither Voldemort or dumbledore would agree on how to handle the situation prohibiting them from truly joining.

** There's a one-shot story where the Oblivation fails after a death eater attack and slowly the truth about magic comes out, and the fact that they have been erasing memories and killing people.

It's less Voldemort joining the order and more everyone joining Voldemort since the true threat is the Muggles. It reads more like a writing exercise than a story, but I really like the idea behind it.

** I feel like I've read one where Grindelwald broke out and Dumbledore and Voldy decided to form an alliance to oppose him, but I have no idea what it was. I do remember it was very unfinished.

That said, I don't think the Order would join with Voldemort while he had control over the Ministry and everything in book 7. Even if there was a greater threat, the present one was already so bad that they couldn't help prop him up and consolidate his rule. The threat would have to have progressed a long way already.

The reverse would not be true, though; I think Voldemort might agree to help the Order while Wizarding Britain is still free, even if it meant delaying his plans.

******* Yeah, that is true. But, lets suppose the Second Wizarding War takes place in the 2010s, not the 1990s. A group of wizards would likely be abducted, including possibly several Death Eaters.This, along with Alien Terror attacks across the globe, would shatter the statute of secrecy. Why would wizards not want to assist in the open now? I even imagine that, when XCOM is beaten, the Death Eaters and the Order become two of the factions XCOM must deal with during WOTC.

******** That is another scenario to discuss. The wizarding world would have a lot more trouble against this enemy. The aliens are a lot more powerful magically while the magical world has the versatility advantage. The aliens have a mind control attack that even their weakest can use that would likely take control of all but the strongest willed wizards and witches. The magical world has the ability to erect barriers of immense power. It would be a really interesting match up to be sure.

I also remember some fic where during the final battle a ton of dementors (?) attacked everyone, so DEs and Order where forced together, but I think there was just a few chapters posted.

** One story had an element like this, but it was more of a subplot of the story than the actual focus of the war.

During the war the dementors had overpopulated and become out of control. They were kissing tons of magicals and muggles - threatening wizard extinction in the country and almost exposing their existence to the muggles.

This led to a truce between the sides so the dementors could be brought under control. If I recall properly, the only way to control the dementors was to feed them, so tons of Azkaban prisoners who had life sentences or about to die were used to feed them.

It was sort of crazy from what I remember. Don't think I finished reading the whole story.

It's not yet complete, but there's an ancient all powerful godlike figure called The King who I think is going to be the big bad over Voldemort. Contains a lot of bashing, and the writer is clearly not a native English speaker, but it explores magic pretty well and is quite fun to read.
