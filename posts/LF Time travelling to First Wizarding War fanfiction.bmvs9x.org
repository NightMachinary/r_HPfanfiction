Seriously, I can't find something new and good everytime I look for something like that.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

8 year old Harry Potter makes a wish and accidentally sends a bit of karma back in time. This allows Regulus to survive the cave and become the Black Phantom.

*** This one was surprisingly really good.

The name etc feel misleading to me tho...

--------------

Harry Potter isn't really in this fic, the MC is Regulus Black whom a godlike being chose to save so as to provide Harry Potter a better life... (much of the fic takes place before Harry is born, and Regulus nor anybody else do *not* know he was saved to help Harry).

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  For all of his life Harry has fought for his freedom and for vengeance, he has been an eternal beacon shining through the oncoming darkness. It was not enough however, the darkness has overwhelmed the world and Voldemort has seemingly won. There were two things Voldemort was not ready for though, Harry's sheer determination and will to win, and the brilliance of Albus Dumbledore.
