** I've never read it myself, but try searching on FF for Harry/Draco, "marriage law" in summary. I think the one you are referring to is a popular one (it certainly sounds familiar, at least).

** Is it perhaps Ministry Interference? It sounds very similar, although Lucius and Narcissa don't get married to other people.

  The war is over. Voldemort is dead and the ministry passes a marriage law. Many people are unhappy about it but mostly the pure-bloods. Harry, Draco and the gang are in Hogwarts for their last year of schooling. *Note to all readers inside!*
