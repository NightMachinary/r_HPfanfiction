It's just a power trip and it's predictable and boring for no good reason, the canon (even extended) it's saying much at all about the pureblood/noble families of the hpverse and this kind of fanfics always follow the same pattern:

Manipulative!Dumbledore Grey!Harry, Harry/Multi, Published 2008, Updated 2012

- Harry is the lord of noble magical house

- Harry is going to Gringotts doing a blood test to claim his title/inheritance

- Harry is using a special ring linked to his hereditary seat at the wizengamot

- Harry gets into one or many marriage contracts

- Harry is playing the Game of Thrones

- Harry gets a private room at Hogwarts and/or a Manor

Did I forget something?

Odd thought that came as I was typing this: basically OP Harry should be written like an episode of 24. Yeah Jack Bauer probably could save the day in a quarter of the time of people just shut up and listened, that's why the increasingly ridiculous obstacles exist. Make Harry OP? Make the Ministry/Death Eaters/antagonist hamstring all his efforts politically, where magic can't help him, etc, etc. Basically if there is no tension or are no stakes, an author needs to step up and fix that shit.

A lightsaber is not the same as the Death Star, but just like a Hobbit with a magic ring and 8 companions is not the same that the freaking Dark Lord and his armies, or a lucky kid and a powerfull wizard with decades of experience.\\
The idea is that, in all these stories, the hero is not the "equal" of the bad guy, but someone fighting against impossible odds. So if you power up the hero, you have to power up the antagonist in such a way that the hero would still be completely destroyed in a direct confrontation.

******** I personally really like to see a character struggle, to wonder "How will he win?", or even "Will he win?" (the success of GoT shows that a lot of people seem to like it).

I believe that the plot armor should not be too obvious, because it tends to take the reader out of a story (how can I feel any tension if I already know that some Deus Ex Machina or just the plot armor will make the hero wins no matter how dire his situation is).

​

But that doesn't mean that people can't write a Super Harry, I would just prefer to see him in a story adapted to him. The plot of Harry Potter is obviously wrote with a young hero in mind. Harry often struggle in the books, and is conscient of his impuissance. He knows the innocence of Sirius but can't protect him from the Ministry, forced to let him leave, just like he can't stop his participation in the Tournament, or truly deal with Umbridge. At the same time, he is at the mercy of more powerfull people acting to protect him or not : Voldemort, Snape, Dumbledore . . .\\
In fact, if I had to use a Chess Analogy, I believe Harry (as Luke, as Froddo . . .) are the kings. They are vital for victory, but at the same time one of the weakest pieces, and they need to be protected by the other pieces. At the same time, people like Dumbledore are not pieces, they are the players.

I really dislike it when a story change Harry to make him "powerfull", yet keeping the plot from canon:\\
I don't want a OP Harry reacting react to any new situation by using some nobility power and throwing Galleons. I want him to treat, and be treated by Albus as an equal, to create a powerbase, recruit, plot a little. I don't want him to finish all his sentences to Dumbledore by Old Man or call Voldemort Moldyshort. I want him to go meet Albus for a tea and be treated either as an equal or something close to by him. Where they would just discuss, staying completely polite and try to find each other plot, to discern their intentions.\\
Same thing, Fudge should not be afraid of the pseudo political power of a 12 years old kid because of some stupid century years old alliance. He should be afraid that only the respect of social conventions stop Harry from transorming him in a puddle of goo, and that this respect would quickly disapear if he doesn't stop his bullsh*t right now.

But this is just what I wish when I read a super Harry fic I guess (that and the end of the "idiot ball" of course).

** Canon Harry has a severe lack of agency in the books (particularly Books 4 through 6) based on Dumbledore's planning/bad decisions and various idiotic and evil adults in positions of power. The "Lord Potter" trope is a quick and easy way in fanfic to turn this on it's head and give Harry total agency against everyone who is stupid or has wronged him.

I read one Harry Potter Star Wars cross over where Harry found 3 super rare unique crystals that are famous and valuable and made them for his lightsaber. My personal view of wand core and wood combinations is that each persons magic is different, more or less volatile, manifests slightly differently, etc, and the wand choosing the wizard thing is which wand fits a person best. The elder wand is the only super wand and we get told that it is exceedingly old and made by death apparently. I feel like people see “Voldemort's brother wand is special and the elder wand is special” and that makes it so that there must be more super wands that don't exist only because of the material.

Also, when Ollivander says something like "powerfull wand" or "good for Transfiguration", he is judging the wizard buying it. He doesn't say "this wand is powerfull because she gives a +X bonus in stats" but "Considering this wand temperament, the fact that it chose you means that you are powerfull, or at least have the potential to become powerful".

The simple idea of the "OP Wand" just doesn't fit in Harry Potter. It reduces all the MC achievements (he is not powerfull, just lucky to have a powerfull weapon), break the whole plot of the Hallows ("An invincible Wand? No thanks I already got that covered") and how the hell do you justify Ollivander, or even worse some crook in Knocturn Alley to not only have it, but to sell it to a kid.

I would enjoy if more people had them though. Maybe even a sign that someone will be more capable in more abstract/less direct Magic's. Make it so that a persons magic has an effect on what kind of magic they're best at and likely subsequently that they enjoy because they find it coming naturally to them so they can advance further. As long as its not like one fic I remember and likely others where this family has always been good at this type of magic so we have arranged marriages to combine these. Even though pureblood families are intermarried.

** It's a pretty quick way to make Harry not the wet noodle he is in cannon.

Cannon Harry let people walk all over him in the grand scheme of things. A lot of shit needed to get done, and literally none of it was done. Harry wins the day because of literal plot armor.

Making FF Harry have political power and money at least lets the ball roll.

** You have read some shit fics man. I have never read any with those tropes.

I'm really good at sniffing out edgy fics written by angsty teens just by reading the summaries.

** It's an easy power boost (in the political arena), being something more than an ordinary citizen (chosen one or not) gives Harry power he'd otherwise wouldn't attain for DECADES (he'd have to "play the game" for years, become head-auror etc. to have equal power to a member of nobility!)...it also makes it possible for him to work against other powerful players without being super-sneaky and constantly fighting to avoid discovery etc. etc.

ps: I once liked this trope, but now I only read truly good ones and I still cringe whenever they call Harry "Lord Potter" -.-
