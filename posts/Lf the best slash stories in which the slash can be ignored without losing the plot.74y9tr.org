** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

An incredibly long retelling of all 7 books. It's got WBWL and Slytherin!Harry, but it's so much more than that. Fascinating magic, extremely detailed world building, and an expansive cast of original characters. It's Harry/Draco, but in the grand scheme of things, that's only a tiny tiny part of this much larger story.

** Whether I'm reading het or slash, I like stories that focus on character develop and relationships, so I can't think of any finished stories off the top of my head to recommend, but I would say look for Wolfstar stories. Depending on the story, Remus and Sirius can be pretty important characters, even if it's set during Harry's time at Hogwarts. I think you'd be more likely to find a relationship that doesn't make you as uncomfortable as much if Remus and Sirius are involved while the story focuses on Harry. Their relationship would be present, but likely not at the forefront of the story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9406877/1/Teeth][Teeth]] by hathanhate is an Avengers x HP crossover. I haven't finished reading it and it's an unfinished story. So far there's no romance or crossover yet (chapt 19), just a whole lot of plot, but I heard it does eventually contain slash with Harry being part of the pairing.

As for my comment about finding a story that doesn't make you uncomfortable, I'm not trying to call you a homophobe. Thanks to how and where we were raised, we all have misgivings and misperceptions about other people, even if our logical brains have no problem with a certain minority group. I didn't even realize I had some of those feelings until I started reading HP slash. I felt slightly uncomfortable at first, then became more accepting. Now it feels completely normal. So, not trying to offend, just how I interpreted what you wrote.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

**** I've found a few more you might be able to get in to but ofc no guarantees. it also depends what pairing you're comfortable reading (and sorry about the clear trend yikes)

October linkffn(10311215) [[/spoiler][currently the pairing is tom/lily]]

linkao3(6177703; 7331278; 7040089; 8691067)

I'm a queer man(boy?) and I've never had any issue with the fact that many writers for m/m fiction are women. If the relationship is treated respectfully, which in any decent/good work a relationship will and should be, then it's rarely unrealistic nor an issue. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Why_I_Write_Slash_(essay_by_Ivy_Blossom][There are many legitimate reasons]]) women write and enjoy slash fiction, not only because many are gay themselves, lots of heterosexual women enjoy slash too. It certainly doesn't make slash fiction worse in some way. If anything the need to truly develop a relationship between the characters that many slash stories carry improves it for me. I do read fics with main het pairings, but so often the author doesn't feel they have to justify this that the relationship then falls flat and doesn't read realistically (not to say all do this, it's just way more common with het fics).

I hope you can find a way to enjoy it because there are lots of brilliant fanfics that feature slash pairings in some way that have brilliant ideas, plots, and characterisations.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  The war is over but Harry does not know how to move on. Harry deals with Tom Riddle inside his head. His godson is dead. Malfoy gets bitten by a werewolf and awaits his death sentence. Ron and Hermione are concerned with Harry's apathy to live. And Death is constantly amused by it all, offering Harry a choice to rewrite parts of his life. He returns back to the past as a war veteran and is determined to prevent a pointless war. But nothing is what it seems. Older, Harry is confronted with the follies of his mentors, the motivations of the Dark Lord, and eventually travels back in time far more than he had bargained for. A story about Death, the Hallows and the War.Warnings: Dub-con, mind manipulation, and heavy inferences on depression/PTSD throughout the series. Also, partial time traveling and mentions of WW2

Wow, really? Really? And you know this how? Have you talked to many gay dudes about that? Have you read many slash fics yourself without bringing your hetero assumptions and prejudices to the table? There are so many offensive assumptions in here that I don't have the patience to unpack them all.

Also, I'm curious to know what you think the obvious and unstated difference is between fics written by women, queer or straight, and fics written by gay men. I mean, except for the pure porn content of places like Nifty, which is the opposite of what the poster is asking for.

Also, by this logic, fics written by women that contain straight men would also be unacceptable to you. Because you're implying that women don't know how to write men if they're so very unable to create a decent characterization based on an already existing canon of male characters who just happen, in their stories, to be gay.

Let the poster get recommendations and check them out for himself without making blanket statements about a whole range of stories, most of which you've never read and clearly have a bias against. He's not being thrown off the deep end into ff.net to fend for himself; presumably the recs he'll be getting will weed out fics written by total amateurs and kids writing for their friends.

** Twist of Fate, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/]]).

Features a semi-brotherly (possessive) relationship, WWII, spies, Grindelwald, etc. You can ignore the actual slash and come out none the wiser; having read it a while ago, I occasionally forget that it actually /is/ slash.

edit:

/Maybe/ Death of Today? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]]). There's a lot of dark arts, magical inventions, unspeakables doing unspeakable things, plot twists, etc., and I guess the slash can be avoided., especially early on.

** Someone else mentioned stuff by copperbadge and I just wanted to second that and specifically mention linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) it's a Harry/Sirius fic and whilst that is definitely given quite a bit of focus, the main plot of the fic is the younger Sirius who has travelled to the future acclimatising to the future and Harry looking for ways to defeat Voldemort. Remus is also a main character in this fic too and is written so well when it comes to him trying to occupy this strange friend/guardian role with both Harry and Sirius with the backdrop of the war and his relationship with Tonks. It's just a very good fic tbh.

I also want to recommend two fics by LullabyKnell who is probably my favourite Harry Potter fanfiction author at this point. The first is linkao3(5986366) and this is also a time travel fic with a Harry/Regulus pairing, I think this one might a good one to ease you into reading slash though because even though it's listed as slash, we're nearly 100,000 words into the fic and nothing even vaguely romantic has happened yet. LullabyKnell tends to go heavy on character develop and interaction as opposed to plot so the main focus of the fic is Harry's interaction with Lily and James tbh but the plot is still definitely solidly there and it's just really nicely written. linkao3(because he strayed across the path by LullabyKnell) is another one which might be good for you to read as it's only going to be a pre-slash fic, meaning the author has stated Harry's going to have a crush on Cedric but that's as far as it's going to go. The fic is basically an AU of third year which is going to change Harry's interactions and relationships with Sirius, Remus and Cedric, it's only got a couple of chapters so far but it's very good.

Edit: linked the wrong copperbadge fic whoops.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** This is a fic I generally recommend a lot for being interesting and the slash is only implied near the end although in a few places it's mentioned that particular characters are gay. This one is definitely 'ultra light slash' I'd say.

** By "slash", do you genuinely just mean books with gay protagonists or gay people having relationships?
