Hi there! I'm really excited to start posting part 4 in a series I've been working on since late 2019. I post on both AO3 and FF, so I have the links handy for whichever site you prefer if you're interested:

Summary: Voldemort has slipped through the cracks yet again. While the Wizarding World celebrates his apparent death, a dark winter looms ahead. Blood is on Harry's hands. Draco is in Azkaban. Narcissa is stuck watching Voldemort carry on with a new face. With nothing left to lose, Voldemort is more focused than ever on claiming what he believes is rightfully his.

Although this is part 4 in a series, I don't think new readers would have trouble jumping in. Obviously with half a million words leading up to it, a brief suspension of disbelief would come in handy. This is a post-OOTP AU that disregards horcruxes and deathly hallows. It also lightly incorporates Norse mythology.

For things like ships and whatnot, AO3 has all that listed so you can see if it's your cup of tea. Thanks for humouring me :)
