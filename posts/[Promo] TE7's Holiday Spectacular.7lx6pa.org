So about two months ago I posted on here saying I would write a Christmas themed chapter for any one of my completed fics and left it open to public voting to see just what would be the most popular choice. And the winner was-----I have no idea I didn't bother tallying the votes.

Instead I thought to myself, well, TE7, you have two months. Why not just write all four of them?!

So I did!

Today, probably about ten minutes after this post goes live, I will post the first one, for Letters! Linkffn(6535391). Then tomorrow I will post the second for The Quidditch World Cup! linkffn(6862426)

Then I'm taking a break but on New Years Eve I will post the one for The Pureblood Princess! linkffn(6943436) and then on New Years Day I will cap it off with Vitam Paramus! linkffn(9444529)

That's right we're looking at 40,000 words of new fanfiction! Of sappy holiday scenes and goodness to celebrate the holiday and the New Year!

But wait? 40,000 seems like an odd number doesn't it? It doesn't have say, the same ring as 50,000? Well you could't be more right about that! So in addition to all of this the next chapter of Limpieza De Sangre will go live at some point on December 26th to make it a nice even 50,000 words of new fanfiction! linkffn(11752324)

So I hope whoever reads them enjoys. Thank you for your continued support and a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all!

*EDIT* Well, LDS 23 is done and ready to go but a ff.net issue is preventing me from uploading any documents. I'll keep trying periodically and see if it lets me. But it's not looking good for the posting today (12-26) if i can't upload it!


** You are writing more of Limpieza de Sangre?

I FUCKING LOVE YOU OP!

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
