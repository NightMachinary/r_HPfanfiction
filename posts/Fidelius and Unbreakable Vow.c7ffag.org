I was wondering something about the Fidelius Charm, I know that there is a theory pretty often used in fanfic that say that the Fidelius is based on the trust gave to the secret keeper (which would explain why the Potters had seemingly no other protection than it ), but in your opinion : ● Is this theory true ? Or can wizards add other protections over the Fidelius (Grimault seemed to have at least something to block apparitions since the Trio had to apparate in front of the house, and not directly inside ) ● Would asking the secret keeper to make an Unbreakable Vow to never willingly reveal the secret work ? And would it count as a protection for the Spell.

I know the Potters would never have accepted to do it in canon , just wondering if it was technically possible .


** That depends by what you mean by "based on" the trust in the Secret Keeper; I definitely think that you couldn't cast it with someone you didn't trust as the Secret Keeper, but I don't see how that would preclude adding other protections on top of the Fidelius anyway, in case the Secret Keeper died. (There's no reason to think the Potters had no other protections, it's just that any other protections that you could realistically cast on a house without the neighborhood noticing are trivial for Voldemort to power through once the Fidelius is down.)

I don't think you could cast a Fidelius with the intention of securing the trustworthiness of the Secret Keeper through an Unbreakable Vow; I think the trust has to be more /sincere/ than that for the spell to work. But if you thought of it /afterwards/, sure, I see no reason why that wouldn't work. Mind you, it wouldn't necessarily be a very good idea, since breaking the Vow would mean killing the Secret Keeper would mean endangering your Fidelius.

** My theory is that the core principle behind the fidelius is indeed the trust you have in the person you confide the secret to.

​

- Which means that it is impossible to demand an unbreakable vow since that would prove you don't really trust that person unconditionally anyway.
- You can always add other magic on top of it later, sure. Just as long as the trust is never broken or compromised in any way. So the secret keeper must have unconditional access to the house at all times, because any attempt to stop him from entering or leaving as he pleases would violate the trust needed for the fidelius to keep working.

Nothing I said is confirmed to be canon, but it fits and it makes sense to me.

*** I like this theory, and to be fair we only know 2 things from Fidelius in Canon :

- The person who don't know the Secret can't even see what is hidden, and only the secret keeper /can/ reveal the Secret (can be by writting or by voice).
- At the Death of the Secret Keeper, every person who previously knew the Secret become a Secret Keeper (making the Secret a lot less defended).

​

On another note, I wonder what happen to people who knew about the place before the Fidelius. For example, did the Black Sisters forgot about Grimault, forgot it's location, or where just unable to make the link between the place and the Order of the Phoenix?

And also, can a Fidelius be taken down and recast right after (forget about Snape, I surprised the Order even though about trusting Mundigus Fetcher)?

** The Fidelius Charm works just as plot requires it to work. Bill Weasley was Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage in the 7th book and he lived there, so there wasn't any reason for the Potters to choose anyone other than themselves as the Secret Keepers. But they did because the plot required them to so that they could be betrayed.

**** So what? The Potters couldn't borrow or rent a cottage? They couldn't have used the Longbottoms' house while the Longbottoms'used theirs?

***** Perhaps they could. Or perhaps, the charm being such am obscure magic, that little shortcut was undiscovered. Because remember, Fidelus isn't something widely known and was underutilised. Longbottoms didn't use it, for example.

******** We weren't /meant/ to be anything. When you say a character is intelligent, you show that by having them make intelligent decisions when it matters. Not by just telling us they're intelligent. But let's agree to disagree anyway.

********* Yes, and Lily's smarts was proven when she found an obscure charm handful people even knew about and cast it successfully. It was proven when she somehow saved Harry's life. That she didn't think of a workaround to a charm does not invalidate her intelligence.

Moreso, Bill and Fleur were much, much less of a target than Potters were. So it stand to reason they would be more open to experimenting with the spell, especially considering it falls right into Bill's expertise. You can't truly expect a twenty-one year old woman under a lot of pressure to make all the right decisions and even go beyond that.

** Fidelius as usual and then peter takes unbreakable vow with sirius to never reveal secret to others.

** The The way I see it if the unbreakable vow works like in canon doing this would leave a huge vulnerability

If the secret keeper betrays the subjects of the charm then the person to whom they were betrayed becomes a secret keeper themselves (as breaking the vow killed the original secret keeper) and can now tell their friends/followers where to look as well instead of being restricted to a solitary raid

** I don't think the Fidelius charm means you can't add other wards on top of it (as long as they don't prevent the Secret Keeper from entering). However, it's not really going to do much to stop someone like Voldemort -- at best, it will delay him.

Making someone take an Unbreakable Vow kind of implies that you don't trust the person otherwise -- would the Fidelius really take hold then?
