I have always felt that the triwizard tournament shown in the books is a bit underwhelming. The tasks could have been a lot more interesting, not even speaking about the horrible viewer experience.

So I was wondering if any of you could recommend me some good fics containing this. It doesn't have to be centered around the tournament (although I would prefer this), as long as it contains it. I don't really care how close the story is to canon. Bonus points if it contains romance.


** In my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]["Patron"]], there are four tasks, all with an elemental theme, and all viewer-friendly - and not more dangerous than a professional Quidditch match. At least not before the sabotage.

Also, between the four tasks, contests and tournaments for the studnets who were not chosen as champions are held - Quidditch, Duelling Tournament and a Curse-Breaker competition.

The Tournament stretches over chapters 3 to 10 of the story.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
