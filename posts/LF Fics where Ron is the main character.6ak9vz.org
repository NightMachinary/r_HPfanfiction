I've read a couple, but there aren't that many I can find. I don't mean Ron gets parts but someone else is obviously the main. I mean Ron is without a doubt why the story is being told.

Bashing, slash, crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no harems, smut/romance-centric plots, genderbending, mpreg or Weasleycest. Thanks!


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]])

I believe that he is the main character in this story. I have heard good things about it, but never read it myself.

Hope this is close to what you are looking for.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** What are the couple that you've read already OP? I also would like to read some.

I remember a rather old fic (like back when the books were still being written) about Ron getting to go to an international chess championship in his Hogwarts years. Does anyone else remember that one? I'll try to find it.

  COMPLETE. Ron Weasley makes up his schoolwork, and actually thinks for a change. Snape gets some Christmas presents he doesn't expect. The old game is over, but a new one is just beginning. Please read and review. And thanks to you all!

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

  Butchered unicorns in London's alleys, witches and wizards vanishing throughout Britain, and murmurs of a rising Dark Lord! With all of this, Senior Auror Ron Weasley can't believe Harry thought it a grand time to take a desk job. He'd always known the bloke was barmy, but embracing bureaucracy? ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
