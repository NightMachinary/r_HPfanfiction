I'm rereading Marauderlover7's Innocent series and loving the characterization. Does anyone know of other fics with friendly/good Draco who gets along with Ron? Preferably completed.


** linkffn(On a Train, Switching Tracks) has Draco and Ron being allies and while it is kind of cracky it is still very good

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

** Draco and Ron are both Slytherins and friendly-ish with each other in /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/. The story is massively AU and, unfortunately, abandoned though. linkffn(3766574)

**** Definitely one of my favorite fanfictions of all time, the world building is incredible and the story is progressed a good amount before it was actually abandoned. There was a thread on here where people guessed at how the story would end and it gives some measure of closure. You can try to find it after you catch up with the story to avoid being spoiled or just message me for the thread link if you can't find it.
