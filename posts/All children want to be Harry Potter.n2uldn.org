Harry should have known that something strange would always happen during Halloween.

This time, it was not a mountain troll or a fugitive from Azkaban that scared him that day, but a group of children with a curious scar on their forehead and huge glasses on small faces.

'' I am Harry Potter '' said a boy proudly '' and as I have told all these imposters, I am the real and only one savior of the wizarding world, so you must choose another fantasy, sir ''.

'' Is that so? '' Asked Harry as confused as he has never been '' and why would you choose to dress up as m- er, I mean, like /him/? ''

"And why not ?!" shouted a girl, offended " he is the most powerful wizard in the world! And he killed the meanest wizard of all! ''

'' They say he was so bad that he lost his nose '' someone conspired in the background '' maybe Harry Potter pulled his nose out with the legendary Gryffindor sword ''

Harry snorted a laugh.

'' Yeah, maybe ''

"So you will?" Asked the first boy.

'' I beg you pardon?''

'' Take off your fantasy? It is not even realistic. Sir, no offense, but your scar is not as incredible as they say the original is. ''

Harry swore under his breath.

''My scar is incredible! ''

The children denied it with pity.

"It's ugly, actually."

'' And it's thin ''

"And it doesn't cover your entire forehead!"

Harry tried to hide his scar with his hair.

''Oh, I see. So should I, er, take the costume off? ''

''Definitely!''

''Yea!''

"Totally yes!"

"Do it right now!"

'' Eh, you see... I can't, sorry. I put advanced magic into it. ''

'' Oooh '' the children groaned with sadness, and another one added '' at least the real Harry won't see such disrespect for his beautiful scar ''

'' Ya, he would hate it '' agreed Harry.

** Imagine James and Albus trying to dress up as vampires or werewolfes and people telling them: "Your costumes are pretty good. But Harry Potter isn't a werewolf/vampire."

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
