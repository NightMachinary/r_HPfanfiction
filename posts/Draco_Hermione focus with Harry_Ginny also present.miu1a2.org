:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a Draco/Hermione fic a while ago and don't remember much except one scene:

Hermione and Harry are very close (like brother/sister) and one day Harry is building a crib in the garage or shed and Hermione comes over and she helps him but mostly they just talk. Draco comes to the house and he ends up talking with Ginny. They have a conversation basically about Harry and Hermione's relationship and Ginny explains to Draco that they are like brother and sister and that Hermione provides something for Harry that Ginny will never be able to because they've been through so much together. It's a really small moment in a chaptered fic, but it was really beautifully written.


** could it be the alkahest? I think there's a ginny/draco convo like that, but I don't remember anything about a crib. if it's not that, I bet someone on [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] would know.

  The Marriage Law, once enacted, has the power to destroy Hermione's perfectly normal life. Luckily, she and Ron are already planning to obey the horrific law together as a team... Until a Malfoy-shaped wrench gets thrown into the works. Dramione.
