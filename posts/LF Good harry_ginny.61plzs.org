** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): They are not your canon Harry/Ginny, but their relationship is really cute.

--------------

For more conventional H/G fics, I like those:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650): Despite my issue with its plot, I still like this story enough to recommend it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): This is the ONLY completed fic in which Ginny traveled back in time alone. She finished her primary objective easily, but had to fit in the new reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867): Year 6 from Ginny's POV, very well written. This is the story that got me interested in HP fanfictions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry never went to Hogwarts. After the War, he hired Ginny to accompany him on some adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Short, but a fun romp.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4291790/1/Polyjuice-Memory-Charms-and-More][Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More]], linkffn(4291790): Nice collections of H/G erotic scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009. Best canon-compliant H/G fic IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Light-hearted Harry/Multi romance, Ginny played a very important role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]], linkffn(11815544): Great postwar crime story. Written by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]. Very popular on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395): Slytherin Ginny, excellent characterization, great Year 7 actions.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/search.php?action=tens][Look on siye]], it's a H/G shipping website that is still active, founded before OOtP came out. It contains practically all of the good Harry / Ginny stories.

** What exactly are you looking for with H/G? It's a fairly broad genre actually. From what I read, it can be roughly broken down into the following categories, which overlap a lot:

- Canon compliant post battle fics that just cover what their lives would have been like after the war, but H/G are strong together and perhaps the story is a bit of fluff. (covers Harry in Auror training, Ginny's final year of school and quidditch career, through them getting married and having kids)

The best examples are Northumbrian (who sticks to mostly sticks to canon and barely has any angst between H/G) and little0bird (who starts it angsty with Harry really depressed but quickly makes it slice of life)

- AU fics where Harry never met Ginny at Hogwarts (he never went, for example) and/or they never dated in school

pottermum and Brennus are among the more prolific or well-known authors

- book rewrites where the author makes Harry more independent in HBP or DH and pairs him with Ginny much earlier than in canon, often completely removing Dean from the story.

Taking Control might be the most popular but there are dozens.

- Time travel. Some have just Harry going back, some just Ginny, some both.

Backwards with a Purpose is the most popular and one of the better ones.

- canon divergence post war. This genre is where the books happen but the time between the end of the war and the epilogue is written in a way that Rowling would likely say is not canon compliant. Specifically, this is where Harry and Ginny either never get back together or break up. They tend to be very angsty. If you don't like reading either character with other people, even if they wind up together at the end, this genre is not for you.

Ghost of You and Inner Demons are both quite angsty and some might argue Ginny is OOC, but I highly recommend both.

- Adventure stories. These are basically stories where Harry and Ginny get together but it really isn't about their relationship but an adventure or mystery.

- Soul Bond. I'm not a fan of this genre in general. They seem to remove any possible conflict by having the soul bond and have them fall hopelessly in love so quick, sometimes way too young too.

Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of the Soul Bond was pretty good, though.

  Although Harry and Ginny both survived the war, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night.

**** I am torn about this one. Its a WIP and I'm reading as new chapters come out and overall, it's engaging and enjoyable. But I feel like Harry is a bit too manipulative, even though the author clearly intends for us to root for him. Dean is shown as a pretty rotten boyfriend and person but the author hasn't effectively communicated why Ginny would still be with him. Canon Ginny at this point in her life would not waste time on someone like that.

There are random smutty scenes that are meant to show Harry as a normal 16 year old boy but they just feel unnecessary. And weird too in certain situations.

Overall, my problem is that Harry does not seem any more worthy of Ginny than Dean. I like Harry in this, he seems like a good guy. But he is still doing shady things. He only started liking her because she got very attractive, same as Dean. He and Ron are now actively working to make Dean look bad and break them up so Harry can swoop in. This is quite manipulative of him.

Having said all that, I like this fic. I find it engaging and I'm eager to see what happens next.
