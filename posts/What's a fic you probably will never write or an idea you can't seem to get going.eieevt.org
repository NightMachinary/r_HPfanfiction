One of mine is a crossover with The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina in which Harry would've been taken by Lilith after Dumbledore left him at the Dursleys' doorstep. I planned for this story but I can never seem to get it going.

It would've started with a story on how God came to be, one of the first Men to bend magic to his will, becoming a priest/teacher indoctrinating students of magic into a cult which their belief and magic would be harvested upon their death by use of a contract-like prayer, he then would use that power to make himself immortal and transcend humanity. Satan would've been a student of his and found out the truth, made his own faction with the same methods and then began their war, some students ran away from their factions and hid from the war and would love to become the natural witches and wizards of the world, God's magicians would become his angels and Satan's would twist into demons from foul magics in attempts to gain power to win the war. Both sides were at a stale mate and delved into the magic of the soul and created their own realms into which they would take those of their thinking into them gaining power from each one.

Satan later on tricked and enslaved some natural wizard children giving them extended life and 'powerful magic' and they would become the Churches of Night.

Now how would Harry come to this? Simple, Satan craved more soldiers to use in his war, the difference in magics developed by the Natural faction is fundamentally different from either Church. Harry is seen as a Saviour of Wizarding Britain and Satan would use that influence leading the sheep to feed from his hand. God's faction, though magical themselves lead public witchhunts in the past and therefore were deemed undesirable by the Natural faction as a whole.

The difference between magic: Satan's and God's magic stem from the centuries of contracts from their students, the contract itself gave the students longevity and large magics were under the constraint of their faction leader, any simple magic they did would come from themselves, such as a small curse of hex, while any large magic must be either in conjunction with other magic users or the power borrowed from the faction leaders, most of their magic are offensive in nature due to the Everlasting War, God's angels bound demons outside of the Earthly Plane and to counter Satan's bound witches did the same to the Angel's but both could be brought back temporarily through summonings.

Naturals magic works with conjunction to the world, and sometimes against it, though civil wars within their factions often broke out they used their time to develop magics in any which way they could, experimenting with the whimsical, the dark, the light, in anything. It was this magic that Satan craved and it was this Magic that the Boy-Who-Lived could bring him


** There are a few I've kicked around that I will probably never write out.

1. After the final battle, Harry goes to see Dumbledore's portrait and let him know that the war is over. As Harry is about to leave, however, Dumbledore reveals that he set up a trap in his office prior to his death so that whoever won would be sort of absorbed into the castle's defenses as Dumbledore felt that both Harry and Voldemort were too dangerous to be free. As the trap is sprung Harry vows vengeance on Dumbledore before disintegrating in a burst of magic, Dr. Manhattan style. Then, several decades later, a new Dark Lord threatens Hogwarts and when the headmaster asks for suggestions Dumbledore's portrait suggests summoning Harry, who is not happy to be brought back.
2. A crossover with Marvel set in OotP. Harry is injured during the running fight with the Death Eaters and stumbles into a storage lab where the Unspeakables have stashed a Venom symbiote that winds up bonded with Harry.
3. A crossover with Skyrim set in GoF. During the first task, Viktor manages to kill his dragon rather than just blinding it, but the dragon kills him too. With no way of removing the dead dragon they leave it there for Harry's attempt for the egg. During the attempt he touches the dead dragon and absorbs its soul, showing him to be Dragonborn. When the soul is absorbed he has a flashback to seeing a dragon word in the Chamber of Secrets, and when he comes back to himself he and the mother dragon have a stare-down until she growls out "Dovahkiin" and hands him the golden egg. As he's leaving the arena he's mobbed by everyone demanding to know what just happened, and in his frustration he Shouts at them and sends them flying. The story from there follows Harry as he tries to find the other two words of the Shout and the dragonsouls to power them.
4. A story set in GoF where Luna shows Ginny a piece of parchment her father sent her that turns out to be an old pretend marriage certificate that the girls used to play "Marry Harry" with. They laugh about it and Ginny sticks it in her bag, but later someone - Barty Crouch, Malfoy, Snape, I dunno - winds up throwing it into the Goblet. During the naming of the champions, the fourth piece of parchment comes out and names Harry and Ginevra Potter as contestants, and because the Goblet has the power to create magically binding contracts, nobody's sure if they're actually married or not. Arthur and Molly take it in stride and Arthur gives Harry some advice on how to be a good husband, which leads to him growing more mature and he and Ginny growing closer.
5. Another crossover with Elder Scrolls where the first chapter is Harry following Sirius through the Veil in OotP, only the Veil is actually an Oblivion Gate. Each chapter after that shows Harry returning from one of the Daedric realms with whichever Daedric artifact belongs to that particular Prince and using it to fight Voldemort. (The idea of a giggling Harry smacking the Death Eaters around with the Wabbajack has always been one of my favorites.)
6. Another Marvel crossover where Civil War and OotP are on the same timeline. When Cap and his crew arrive in Wakanda they are told by T'Challa that they're not the only refugees he's harboring. They're introduced to Harry who has run away from England after being told the prophecy. While they're hiding out he and Wanda Maximoff grow closer and he eventually comes to be seen as part of the team. So when a group from magical Britain show up to plead for Harry to come back and help them fight, Cap and the others come along.
7. A time-travel fic set in GoF. Harry is an Unspeakable working in his lab when an experiment with time in the lab next to his explodes and sends his mind back to the past. An annoyed Harry heads back to the Department of Mysteries without bothering to try and fix anything, just intending to disappear back into his research. So when he's summoned to Hogwarts by the Goblet he's less than impressed and continuously amazes everyone with his impressive command of magic and his complete failure to give a shit about who he pisses off.

Those are all the ones I can think of. I've tried writing some of them before but they never seem to gain any traction.

All of them. I have a lot of fic ideas but even though I'm a decent writer I'm really bad at connecting scenes together. Like I have a basic idea for a fic and I have all of these moments I want to include but actually starting it and getting to those monents and connecting it all together is what messes me up.

** I've got fic ideas for days:

A devil may cry crossover where 5 year old Harry gets new neighbours Kyrie and Nero. (Nico sleeps in the van on the front porch.) Because they are expecting business in London...

Mars Wars:\\
Harry and Hermione start their own wizarding world with blackjack and hookers. They combine science and magic to create a wizarding community on mars mostly for muggleborns but also for scientists and basically everybody who is into human progress and development. They keep it a secret from the normal wizarding world and the muggle world for a long time but eventually truth will out because of the decline in muggleborn population. Political shenanigans ensue.

I'm currently working on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13456084/1/Pinkie-Pie-goes-to-Hogwarts][Pinkie Pie goes to Hogwarts]] but it's hard. I just can't get into that delicious writing zone. Can't concentrate.

** OC/SI Muggleborn that thinks they ONLY had a time loop to their tenth birthday. Then McGonagal shows up during spring break. Finally, it sinks in they are muggleborn during the Harry Potter series. ohshit.jpg They want to help, but not paint a target on their back, so they only interfere by sending two letters printed from a typewritter to people in authority: Amelia Bones and Saul Croaker/Broderick Bode. And one to Xenophilius Lovegood.

I'd love to see the chaos this brings. You have the I AM LORD VOLDEMORT = TOM MARVALO RIDDLE + backstory truth bomb in the quibbler leaving the death eaters and blood purists in shock, you have the DMLE running around putting out fires, tracking down more leads, and doing other misc things in tandem with the Department of Mysteries. And then the reaction of the public. Lucius Malfoy getting re investigated and arrested. Fudge getting caught up in it. Umbridge being found out to be linked to Death Eater activities. Well, it would be nice to see everyone actually doing their jobs.

The POV would be jumping around A LOT. From DMLE to Unspeakable, to the MC, to Xeno. Sprinkle in our MC trying to avoid the golden trio. Because too much plot happens around them.

​

Bonus points if the MC qualifies for the prophecy in a convoluted way.

** I never finish anything so I guess any of my ideas would count. However, I've really only ever had two fanfic ideas.

The first is more... sensible. I call it Granddad Dudley (on my computer, for some reason I posted it online by another title). The basic idea is that Dudley and his wife have a daughter (unintentionally) later in life, who then has a one night stand with a descendant of Mundungus (son? grandson? don't remember which I went with). This becomes Violet, who turns out to be a witch. Except, of course, it's the future and maybe it's cooler to be a muggle...

(If this sounds familiar you may have accidentally found what I started writing since I put that on Fanfic.net ages back... I haven't written any more, though. Ah, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10987173/1/Violet-Elizabeth][found all 2000 words.]])

The other is... well, what if Delphini... exploited Albus' attraction to her and obliviated him? What if she was pregnant? Will it be Voldemort Round Three!? The reason why this goes no-where is probably because it's a terrible idea, but it's been stuck in my head ever since I first read the Cursed Child.

** A Harry/Lily fic which involves accidental time travel, lots of alcohol and an awkward morning after where Harry has a mental breakdown because he had just died at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange at the end of HBP and is now stuck in 1977. And has just met his mother.

I feel like you could write a fic with that pairing WITHOUT making it about incest at all since Lily would have no attachment to Harry whatsoever (other than maybe liking his looks) while Harry has exactly 1 memory of her courtesy of the dementors. Avoid natural procreation by implying adoption and you can make that pairing work without any incest kink.

Diverging at the end of HBP would be interesting because it would make Harry believe Snape a traitor on top of Lily's dislike for him AND also not trust Dumbledore, who was just very violently proven incapable (Malfoy was a death eater on his watch, Snape a traitor under his nose, the Horcrux a fake).

*** It's this weird situation where it is and isnt incest at the same time. On one hand, she is still genetically Lilly Evans, the woman that gave birth to him. On the other hand, from every other standpoint other than biological, she is not only not his mother, but from the second he interacts with her, she is a different person, as Harry's mother obviously never interacted with her own son before she even married James.

You know what, now I really wanna find a Harry/Lilly pairing that isnt just incest smut.

Which is my motivation behind the plot bunny. There is nothing even remotely similar.

By dropping him into Spring 1977, you avoid the relationship with James (they were not together at that point), have her antagonistic towards Snape and roughly the same age as Harry from the HBP finale (it would work out to her being 4 months older). You also block Harry from almost any other point of contact because the Marauders won't like the boy who got between James and his crush. And other than that, Harry basically knows no one from that time. He has not met Andromeda Tonks by that point and there is absolutely no link to the Weasleys of the 70s.

** Gosh, I started writing my fics so many months ago, but real life work and problems majorly got in the way. It's essentially an alternate take on Grindelwald's rise to power and war. He is the MC, and he is an anti-hero rather than straight up proto-Voldemort. More of a sincerely well intended revolutionary that grows increasingly ruthless as he ages. Most of the characters are OCs, and the worldbuilding is highly detailed, though more fantasy than HP canon. (No magical cores either, my dudes). I really should get back into it, I wanna start posting it.

​

Another idea I haven't started working on is a DH divergence when Voldemort visits Nurmengard. It essentially builds on all the canon and lore established by the fic I mentioned above. Unlike the Grindelwald Voldie finds in canon, this one is still quite healthy and eager to get back fighting the good fight. He managed to achieve some control over the wards, it is after all his own creation, but not enough to actually break them open. He does however manages to restrain Voldie and uses the power surge to severely injure him and make a run for it. He quickly takes back the Elder Wand and then returns to the Continent to regain his strengths and eventually resume contact with his old supporters, or their descendants more like. An injured Voldie returns to England, and a very awkward situation eventually ensues where he and his Death Eaters are forced to call a truce with Harry and the Order and join hands against Grindelwald. I have lots of ideas about the dynamic between Voldemort and Harry, while trying to keep both as canon as possible. Them two teaming up and having a 2 on 1 duel against Grindelwald is one of the most clear images I have from that possible fic ATM.

** 1. A Lovecraftian take on the series, with a shoggoth in the Chamber of Secrets, magic that is horrifying, and a running question if Voldemort is real and made a pact with Yig or just an avatar of Nyarlathotep.
2. An AU set in 1100 AD, in an openly magical world. Harry arrives at a Hogwarts in which the houses are regional: Gryffindor is largely Anglo-Saxon, though Dane and now Normans are showing up; Ravenclaw are Scottish; Slytherin are Irish, including Norse-Gael; and Hufflepuff are Cymry and Cornish. He learns later that his mother was Cymry and his father was actually Romano-Briton, and he actually has gwaed y , and is descendent of dragons. Never have been sure of the overarching plot of this idea, though Ron would be a descendent of King Arthur and Hermione the daughter of a Breton steward to a Norman noble.
3. Another open magic AU but in the Golden Age of Piracy. Voldemort rules Britain as Lord-Protector Thomas Riddle III, and many live in exile. Harry was raised in Kingston, befriends Ron (an expat merchant's son) and Hermione (daughter to the governor's physician) and ends up saving Hermione and Governor Malfoy's son from a notorious pirate, the Troll. Ends up a cabin boy to escape notice, learning from the ship's ‘wizarding-mates' about magic. Ends up having a run in with the infamous pirate known as The Grim, captain of the Hippogriff, only to discover the captain, Sirius Black is his godfather and thus he ends up dragged into a world of piracy and rebellion as the Brethren of the Phoenix seek to establish a pirate republic in the Caribbean.
4. Battle School AU in which magical knights that hunt monsters and beasts are trained at Hogwarts. Sort of Witcher and Demon Slayer mix, conceptually, plus fighting academy concepts. This one is also the most likely to actually be written.

Bunch more too tbh, like a SW/HP fusion and a Bloodborne/HP fusion, but those are actually outlined at least.

** Mine is a story where the first war starts later and Lily started to date Snape, but with the movement taking up steam later and her never really being head over heel in love with him, it just felt fine and save to date her best friend, things start to change when Snape starts to plan their marriage and life together without really asking for her opinion and a meeting with old friends she lost contact with over her dating him and James Potter being hired at her place of work to take over her job once she is married. First, she is afraid that he would ask her out again, but he doesn't. She wants to know why and he tells her that he is no longer interested because she isn't like the girl he knew from school, only looking the same, but without fire and a backbone.

This made her reflect on her life and she starts to realize that she does have less in common with Snape than she thought and less in love than she tried to convince herself, she then is emancipating herself from him and rediscover herself and what she wants. And realizing that he is gaslighting her and controlling, like after an argument doing what he wants and then claim that Lily is difficult and that they talked about it and agreed to do it his way. Lily is going to join the resistance and Order again, even knowing that Snape is consociating with the other side, breaking up with him and starting anew on her own when he tries to pressure her back in. The story would end not with James and Lily dating, but they openly flirting and James saying something like she should be careful and that she becomes more and more like a girl he knew from school and had a huge crush on and could one day feel tempted to ask her out. And she answers that maybe when she feels like such a person again she would like to say yes than, but first wants to get to know that girl first herself again.

​

I don't think I will ever write it, because I don't enjoy writing Snape and I would have to do a lot of research about gaslighting and that kind of abuse.
