Looking for Harry and Viktor squaring off in a seeker battle. Also looking for a story that features Harry playing professional quidditch.


** Sorry Ive lurked for so long and dont know how to use FF bot. This one is decent as well as another by the same author but slighly less focused on quidditch but really interesting take on pro quidditch.

*** I wonder what [[/u/rpeh]] would think if I decided to write a 100kish word story that focused almost entirely on quidditch from school through professional level.

Meh he'd probably compare me to his favorite politician, Chris Grayling.

**** I'm surprised that [[/u/TE7]] didn't point out he wrote a story with not one, not two but *three* seeker battles between Harry and Viktor Krum - Letters. I believe it's still his favourite story. linkffn(6535391)

** I have a story that I'm currently publishing in which the next chapter features Harry vs Viktor in the Quidditch World Cup. The only problem is that I haven't written the chapter yet. Also, much of what I've already published doesn't feature Harry playing Quidditch, but instead focuses on a growing Harry/Hermione relationship. Not sure if that floats your boat or not.
