Are there any fics where Harry is OP/godlike, but all that magical power is useless in regards to the conflic of the story? Like the confict is polical or social or a romance fic or something else I cant think of? Hope by Jeconais is a good example: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]]

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I feel like linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) counts. It's fem!Harry, and she's Death. But due to the way she perceives the world, the way others perceive her, and possibly the consequences of her OP power, her power isn't useless, but it definitely doesn't solve everything. It actually tends to create problems of its own.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** In 'Sunset over Britan' by Bobmin Harry is super-duper OP in the beginning, but because of "really-lame-plot-contrivance" can't use his powers to defeat Voldemort until Voldemort is equally as powerful.

Not really a ringing endorsement for the story, because the setup could have been much better, yet it offers an interesting and rare situation in which Harry has to establish his own sphere of influence sorta in parallel to Voldemort without directly engaging him (and later on waiting for the right opportunity) - if I remember correctly.
