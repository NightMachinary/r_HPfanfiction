I've only seen a few Harry Potter fanfics set in the broader HP universe, and without focus on the main cast of characters as we have in the book series. There's the countless Harry-travels-the-world and Peggy Sue fics, but I'm particularly interested in OC storylines, characters, and focuses while still set in the HP universe.

For instance, I love the Alexandra Quick series linkffn(3964606). There's other ones I've read, though I can't remember them at this very moment.


** You know, for a moment I though, 'why does this guy want a story about Harry Potter and the European Union?'. Then I put it together, meant more like Star Wars EU. Anyway...there are a few I can think of:

linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is an OC during the canon story who mainly stays out of the limelight in Hogwarts.

linkffn(The Wandsmiths) focuses mainly an OC child of Ollivander, with some interesting wandlore involved.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  (Formerly titled The Ollivanders) Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming abundantly clear that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (I say which chapters are my best at the start of Chapter 1.)

** linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas; A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - Starnlicht is a period piece, so really it's exploring a different time than a different place. A Long Journey Home is about Jasmine (fem!Harry) Potter being tossed back into Ancient Egypt and living her way back to the present while trying to stay out of the way of history.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** I've heard good things about The Ollivander Children and its sequel, The Ollivanders at War. They focus on Ollivander's grand-niece Calliope, who after leaving Hogwarts went to study in Boston, but when Ollivander is taken by Death Eaters during the war she returns to England.

Canon characters make guest appearances from time to time, especially the Order of the Phoenix, with Tonks getting the most prominence as Calliope's friend from Hogwarts, but the focus is mainly on Calliope, her brother Linus and her Muggle friend Mark from Boston.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

It's mostly a documentary of the international politics after Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles.

There's a lot of original places and things, such as the muggle-phobic Galiver Consortium, a group of hidden islands, the different American magical centers (not MACUSA, it's a little old), the Israeli, Saudi Arabian and South Korean magical governments, Koschei's hidden island, and the martian crater with ancient fossils.

There's also a lot of original plot, including trouble from Westboro, Al-Qaida, Syrdan, North Korea, Voldemort, Rasputin and the Harold-Green pharmaceutical corporation.

There's a pretty interesting plotline involving Hermione in the second half after Harry loses importance.

There's also a lot of things flying around - Bentleys, carpets, nukes, DeLoreans, spaceships.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
