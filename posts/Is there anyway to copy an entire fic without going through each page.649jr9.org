** [[http://ficsave.xyz/]]

That might be what you are looking for.

You can paste the URL and download them in three formats: ePub, MOBI, and Text.

Hopefully that helps, I know the feeling of bad fem harry names. Especially Harriet, like how unimaginative can you be.

** This is funny because back when I first discovered Fan Fiction years ago, I sometimes copied fics, and then substituted all names in it (via your exact method) with names of me and my friends just for laughs.

I also completely agree that there are a ton of Fem!Harry stories that have terrible name choices. Of course, the same could be said about quite a few OC fics, or fics where Harry has to choose a new name for anonymity reasons or whatever. Then again, one persons name they hate is another persons favorite. To each their own.

I was going to recommend ficsave.xyz but someone beat me to it. I use it for all my needs, and its great for quickly getting fics on a kindle. That said, it does have the downside that it cant pull fics off a lot of the smaller or more niche sites. That said, ive yet to run across anything that can.

** I have fanficfare, and do it while converting in Calibre, which has some decent options.

I tried replacing all the furbait(cub, den, pride, pack) in the Dangerverse, in order to make it more readable. Didn't help after a point. I also usually replace words like moldyshorts, prongslet etc if they occur too often in an otherwise decent fic.

** I would be really ( I mean /really, really/) upset if I found out someone had done that with one of my stories in order to rename one of my characters.

It's hard to express how offensive I find the idea. Stories take months - sometimes years - to write. Names are chosen to fit what the writer wants to say. If you don't like a writer's choice of name(s), there's almost certainly going to be a whole lot of other things they do that you don't like either. Just find something else to read.

** The Grabmybooks.com browser extension will grab pages and even let you do some editing before you save as ebook. Though it does not have built-in search/replace (it's just a text-editing window).

It's also really good for niche sites the other downloaders don't support. And password-protected sites.
