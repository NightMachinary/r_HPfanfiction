What happens to magical governments when muggle borders change?

What happens when magical countries are at war?

Do micronations like Luxemburg have a magical government capable of enforcing secrecy if the entire magical population is barely larger than a small town?

What happens if a magical government becomes unable to enforce secrecy?

When does the ICW do something?

Looking for any fics that adress these issues.


** LinkFFN(Wolf Lord)

​

So my story, there is lots of this going on in the background that the MC just isn't super read into right now.

​

To answer the questions, here is the headcannon I am working off of.

​

1:The Statute is everything to the magical world. It is also an incredibly European construct. Thus, prior to WW2 the borders of Europe were roughly the world borders when the Statute was enacted. Outside Europe, colonization was accompanied by a brutal war against local magical cultures to force them to conform to the Statute. In some places it was more of a stalemate, negotiations, assassinations, poisons, no luck. In others it was a brutal destruction of the local culture. Anything to maintain the Statute.

​

War between mages is rare. The forces the drive people to war, scarcity, resources, political power, don't have as much of an effect in a world were people can conjure shit, expand spaces, etc. Even then, go ham so long as it doesn't upset the Statute. Upset the Statute and a task force of ICW war wizards shows up on your doorstep and you are in for a bad time.

​

Then comes Grindelwald. He throws everything into chaos and nearly breaks the Statute. Most European nations are fully involved in the war, the USSR is an uneasy place were the commie work with muggleborns so magic is an arm of Stalin's power, and even the US has mages involved alongside.

​

Battle were this comes together are places like the Battle of the Bulge were Grindelwald had a weather ritual going to protect Nazi armor from air attack until a British team broke it up.

​

At the end of the war Dumbledore finally "defeats" the guy with the deathstick, though was it defeat or seduction and betrayal? with the follow-up duel involving Dumbledore with the deathstick who nows.

​

But Dumbledore now has all the power, but is against the Statute still. Unfortunately for him he doesn't get the Supreme ICW slot right away. Instead all those places that had to be violently Statuted, yeah they are trying to throw that off. So the US, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and the other countries that aren't total spent by the war send forces to restore it. Do to the need for manpower the US cuts a deal with Werewolves and lycanthropes from around the globe do horrible things in places like the Congo and Vietnam to ensure the Statute survives.

As this is happening, the fact nuclear weapons is pretty much the anti-magic comes out. Muggle heads of government and the ICW come to a series of agreements. Magical Borders will match Muggle borders and the local magical governments will provide magical security of nuclear facilities to ensure weapons aren't stolen by a dissatisfied mage, a USSR magical agent, etc.

At the same time, China and its revolution happen and all contact is lost with the magical community there. The fate is still unknown.

​

Fast forward to the 1970s, Voldemort happens and Dumbledore is head of the ICW. He spends tons of capital preventing an intervention army from deploying. Ultimately he fails and the only thing that prevents their involvement is Oct 31 1981 and the fall of Voldemort.

​

Move to 1993 when the story starts.

​

The world is at peace. The fate of mages in the fallen USSR is only just being learned and efforts to properly establish the communities is ongoing. Fortunately the knowledge of magic was kept need to know to a select few to ensure the ICW didn't destroy the Union before it really got going. Failsafe involving nukes do weird things right? Of course, was Chernobyl an accident or an attack?

​

Dumbledore is out and the US finally has there guy in power at the ICW, he is much more active at ensuring the Statute than Dumbeldore and has already given the order for two separate suppression forces to act.

In the countries involved in the 1950/1960s Suppression, werewolves and others enjoy a bit more freedom and concession, but the best is the US. There are still restrictions, rules, registrations, and god save the feral werewolf that doesn't abide by these rules carefully.

​

In Europe, the recovery is still ongoing, especially in Britain which was nearly broken by the war with Voldemort since Tommy isn't trying to rule but is lashing out against everyone until he can ensure is total control and security against fear, pain, and suffering like he endured as a child in WW2 britain and precieved muggleborn in Magical Britain. His horocrux induced paranoia and other issues isn't helping.

​

Should he return, it is expected the ICW will deploy enforce and tear down Britain to bring it more in line with the current magical construct vs what it currently enjoys. Canadian wizards are getting tired of security Britain's nuke arsenal after all.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
