I'm not from a particularly rich background so I knew very little about the mysterious Public Schools of Britain until I actually started to look things up. One thing I did notice is that a lot of them actually start at 13 rather than 11, which ties in nicely for the romance writers who want to skip over the younger years and head straight to teenagers and onwards. I just thought this might be a useful fact for people on here.

I've also had a lot of fun looking up the weird slang and traditions of places like Eton and Harrow, and have spent a bit of time having fun coming up with my own for my AU Hogwarts. It's been a relaxing way to familiarise myself with my writing and notes without plunging straight back into writing after months away (it's been a rough year).

Does anyone have favourite headcanons, traditions or slang for Hogwarts from either their own minds or fics you have read?

Sooo much sex. Like, you have this enormous castle, hundreds of hormonal teenagers with nothing to do after hours and less than 15 adults. It would be surprising if even half of the upper years sleep alone in their beds. That is also the origin of the "the pumpkin juice is spiked with contraceptives" theory.

*** Alternatively, one of the enchantments on the castle is a contraceptive charm/ward.

** The ones that start at 13 often have a prep school attached meaning they don't really start at 13 but in fact much earlier. The prep school takes the students until they're 13.

*** I mean, that could easily be worked into an AU too. Purebloods would get a 2 year head start! I mainly posted because I'd noticed a number of writers recently choosing to start at 13 so they can get into romance subplots sooner, but then feeling the need to defend themselves in their Author's Notes shortly afterwards. I thought such writers would like to know this if they didn't already :)

**** If you wanted to give them a headstart then most prep schools start at eight, giving them a five year headstart, the equivalent time from first year to OWLs for perspective.

Stories where for some reason people start at 13 or even older at Hogwarts are one of my pet peeves. It seems to me that it is never completely thought out and should change quite a bit more than authors imagine.

Does Harry start Hogwarts in 1993? So did Voldemort try to steal the Stone in 1991? Was the school closed in 1992 because of a Basilisk? Or is just everyone born 2 years earlier? That wouldn't work, because then Voldemort is also born 2 years earlier relative to Harry.

Maybe it's only Harry who's born two years earlier? So no Hermione, Ron, etc for the first two years? But how would that work? James and Lily would have had him while in school, right? That's strange... so no Godrics Hollow. Did Voldemort try to murder Harry in Hogwarts? Or was he with his grandparents at the time? In actuality if James and Lily both had to stay in school until they were 19, they probably would have had a child later, which means Harry was maybe born in 1982 and starts Hogwarts at 13 in 1995? So is Harry a first year now when the tournament happens?

Not to mention that Hogwarts is pretty central to Magical Britain. Everyone being 2 years more mature at Hogwarts should have wide repercussions on history. What if Tom Riddle freaked out at the age of 12 and set the orphanage on fire and died in the process? I can't imagine the story of the Marauders, Lily and Snape to play out the same if they are all a bit more mature. James would probably start "getting his act together" much earlier in their school life. Would Snape still join the Death Eaters if he wasn't antagonized so much?

** Not headcanon, but I did learn about it from someone who is a Brit and is on this sub: the school that starts at 11/13 /can/ be called a “high school”, except most people don't call it that.

Headcanons ... yeah, contraceptives in the food and/or pumpkin juice. The wizards (and witches) may be bass-ackwards in some ways, but there's no doubt that they would have a way to address the unwanted pregnancy problem way earlier than Muggles and this is something that likely would shape their culture.

Wtf, so these are essentially private schools but are called public schools? Is there a reason for that apart from the blatant doublespeak?

*** "They were called "public" because they were open to the public - that is, anyone who could pay." (From Wikipedia)

They predate state-funded education in England, and were open to anyone (so long as they were male and came from money), as opposed to religious schools or similar. Hence, they were public.

*** It's tradition! :p but seriously though, the term public school predates the current terminology. It came about in the eighteenth century when certain grammar schools were considered of such high quality that parents sought to send their children there despite not living locally. Hence, these schools were open to the public in general and not just the local area.
