and I am not talking about crappy stories.

I am talking about stories that could have been up there with the best but fell down when you were expecting them to explode in awesomeness?

Masterful world building, faithful characterization or believable reason it for character developing differently (AUs and single point of divergence), Engaging and unique premise, author expert level prose... Still... The execution let you down...

Sort of like Legend of Korra and Star Wars prequels... Some people say they are bad, but far from it. Characters are great and themes and settings are too. It's just the execution which wasn't as clean as we were expecting (Though being fair, LoK execution was still way better than the prequels)

Come on, throw away your frustrations about that fic that could have been IT for it, but, for one reason or another it stayed behind with a bunch of others.


** I think it was The Accidental Animagus. It starts with Harry turning into a cat and running away from the Dursley's and he then gets found and adopted by the Grangers. It was going well until Harry and Hermione started playing politics in first year and was such a change i wasn't expecting or enjoying.

** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived.

It was in the running for being one of my all-time favorites, but for the fact that it was abandoned. I was very invested in it and read a couple hundred thousand words in a handful of nights.

Involved magic system, complex characters, realistic motivations, and a driven, hard working, non-Gary Stu Harry. I was convinced it was going to be something great, but then it just ended abruptly and I felt very disappointed.

** Three black birds. A WBWL fic with non evil parents.\\
But as it goes on it gets clearer and clearer that it's never leaving the stations of canon. Then the author posts the plot summary which is basically "canon plot happens, married with kids epilogue"

It's certainly not the only fic with this issue, so many stories with great characters and ideas that nonetheless somehow manage to follow canon almost exactly.

** Cassandra Claire's stuff. She had thousands of upvotes, reviews, and fans. A lot of cool quotes that were plagarised. Every cliche was used that she could find. All the characters mingled into each other to the point where they all had sass in spades. I guess when your stories have 20k words per chapter you need all the cliches and everything possible to flesh them out.

I do notice that her Mortal Instruments has Ginny cast as Clary and Draco as Jace and that she CC has red hair (although the last point may be pushing it a bit).

*** Wanted to write just that. Care to elaborate on what exactly did let you down?

For me, I think it's the fact that almost the entire story is about Harry growing to become his own person, and growing out of his sacrificial nature (his saving-people thing), only for him to go and fight Voldemort before he was ready, which resulted in him sacrificing himself to save Fleur, where there was no real need to do that! It's supposed to parallel Lily's sacrifice but it doesn't really work, because she couldn't escape while Harry decided to fight right there and then. FFS, the story was even showing him growing more and more disconnected from his peers.

** I don't want to look for the name, but there was one where Harry's consciousness was sent back in time and merged with Lockhart some time before 2nd year. The base premise was entirely unique and fascinating. There were moments where Lockhart or Harry would show up more in their actions and thoughts, but for the most part, after a couple months of being merged they'd become one new personality that blended together parts of both people. The new Lockhart was super laid back, but loved the spotlight, and now had Harry's skills to back things up, plus Harry's wit and Lockharts charm. Basically everything Lockhart wishes he was and pretended to be.

Then it rapidly devolved into super super creepy pedophile red flags. I won't go into too much detail, but it included GildeHarry taking a very serious interest in his younger self developing a physical relationship with Hermione and the Lockhart part of his mind remarking occasionally that the age of consent in magical Britain was 11. So yeah. That was it for that fic.

***** Prince of Slytherin does not bash its characters. For Lily, her reasons for and methods of sending Harry to the Dursleys and cutting off contact w/ him are actually pretty sound and justified. ^{⟨spoilers for the first several chapters of Year 2⟩} Harry's abuse by the hands of the Dursleys is caused by something artificial that she could not possibly have predicted the existence of. For James, ^{⟨spoilers for the end of Year 1⟩} there's a prophecy in play affecting his behavior---while it shouldn't and doesn't excuse his poor treatment of Harry, his utter panic is understandable . Really the biggest misstep as parents James and Lily make is, in my view, ^{⟨spoilers for the end of Year 3⟩} not explaining to Mrs Figg enough about the situation so that she knows James and Lily are not typical wizarding parents sending away a squib child in that they would be (and indeed do become) horrified to learn that their child was being abused . Both James and Lily are well-written and nuanced characters, as is Jim (the wrong-"Boy Who Lived"). Especially in Year 2, Jim in particular shines as a character, which afaict is pretty much unheard of in wBWL-dom, but Lily and James get their times to shine too Year 2 onwards.

***** It kind of depends on what you consider character bashing: while James' actions have an actual motivation, rather than him just being a dick for the hell of it, he's still does awful things constantly, he's completely inept at basically everything he does, the narrative obviously doesn't want us to sympathise with him (he's had a pretty fucked up life in a lot of ways, and the story doesn't seem to've noticed), and it expects us to enjoy watching his fall from grace. For my money, that's a textbook bashing fic, but ymmv.

***** Prince of Slytherin started as being atrociously bashy. Harry names his owl Nemesis in the original draft. However the author realized it was bad and rewrote much of the worst excesses.

It's a decent read. A little up it's own ass at times with how clever it is, but nowhere near MOR's level. And it does legitimately have some interesting ideas. The author does a good job of explaining the why's of a lot of weird inconsistencies in the wizarding world, as well as amping up the stations of canon in interesting ways. I think the third book was the weakest so far, but it's shaping up decently in book 4.

James and Lily are...weird. As the other commenter mentioned, James dislikes Harry for somewhat legitimate reasons, though his character still comes of as unlikable. Lily started out as being kind of relatable, but some recent plot revelations have made me despise the character utterly. But that's purely due to my own morality bias, not due to anything objectively hateful about the character. I think the most bashy thing the author really does is thumb their nose at some things that happened in canon, with an exaggerated wink at the fourth wall saying "Wouldn't that be ridiculous!". Which is annoying to me, but some people like that kind of humor.

It started off being one of my favourite fics. Cute and warm and funny, etc. I don't have any knowledge of fantasy fiction but any mention of those type of books was easily skipped. However, after a while the number of OCs just got bigger and bigger, I couldn't keep track of them all and because there were so many OCs, Harry barely seemed to spend any time with his friends. I stopped reading it in the end because it just didn't seem like the same story as it was to start with.

** I don't recall the name, but there was a fic in which Harry and Hermione find some sort of clue in the Godric's Hollow graveyard. It led them to some ancient ruin that they had to delve through by solving a whole bunch of difficult magical/magical/scientific puzzles, leading down into deeper and more ancient ruins that were somehow also more technologically advanced. It was such a build, only for them to end up finding a switch that lets them turn off magic worldwide, leaving them to die deep underground from lack of air/food/water. Voldemort dissolves without magic to keep him together, and all his Horcruxes fail, and overall Team Good take advantage of the lack of magic to beat the helpless-without-their-magic Death Eaters. Then, a while later, an interstellar dragon teleports into the chamber with the switch, "fixes" the machine the switch shut off, and leaves.

It was such a depressing anticlimax, especially the last bit that trivialized everything everybody went through.

I know it's recommended a lot and a lot of people like it so yay! But I just found it... Annoying? Harry was just irritating, like you've been told you have magic why the hell are you complaining so much!

I get annoyed anyway when I read scientific things for fun. Because often times they are... Technically correct but not really true. And that's what a lot of what Harry says it's all just...not really right... But all science in media annoys me.

Maybe it gets better, I don't know, I'll be honest I didn't get too far into it before getting fustrated and bored. I thought it was going to be a bit of a laugh but it wasn't. It wasn't funny or witty or smart it was just Harry being an asshole for no reason which annoyed me.

*** It doesn't get better. As the story went on you realized it's just an entirely different story with the characters having names from HP universe just to attract readers. There's a "twist" in attempting to justify why Harry is like that, but that still doesn't account for the rest of the cast being unnecessarily asshole & smug and have conveniently variable level of common sense so the plot works. It's one thing to read the average writer (ie, non genius) trying to portray a genius character or a genius writer using their biased childhood reference as a model for the people in general, this fic deliberately went out their way to be condescending for no reason.

I had high hopes because I thought it will be an exploration of the canon magical system by a Muggle-educated curious Harry, but noo, it's just complain, ass-pull, OOC moments, rinse and repeat. Ironically the Harry is A Dragon and That's Okay actually managed to bring more logics and exploration of the magical system, to /all/ characters, without the pretentious rambling, while keeping things fluffy AF. Wand for Skitter explicitly brings an adult from a cynical & dark universe to a slightly darker HP universe, yet still manages to be /fun/, the pretentiousness and OOC is there, but it's not bunch of ass-pull, and there's still an exploration of the magical world with actual consequences.

It's needlessly wordy, so many things that I feel don't affect the storyline happen and not to mention that it's been supposedly abandoned, that I just can't focus on it.

  and Star Wars prequels
#+end_quote

I don't know about other people, but the sequels really made me appreciate the prequels more. Even though the prequels had their issues they had the common decency to tell an original story instead of just rehashing the original trilogy with less likeable characters.

Anyway, that was quite off-topic. Back to Harry Potter fanfiction. There was a fic I really liked- it was long, completed, and had great character development. Hermione was a math genius and that tied in nicely with Arithmancy. Everything was going great until the fifth year. Umbridge had one of the worst cases of plot armor I've ever seen. By the time I stopped reading the fic she was about to whip one of the Weasley twins in the middle of the Great Hall in front of everyone- teachers included. Utterly ridiculous. To think that people like McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout would stand idly by and watch a student get tortured. And the author's only explanation was- "BuT sHe'S fRiEnDs WiTh ThE mInIsTeR". So no one ever did anything to try and stop her. It was a real pity because it was a great fic up to the fifth year. And now for the life of me, I can't remember anything else besides Umbridge's plot armor.

Another example is a Tonks time-travel story. During the fight in the Department of Mysteries, she fell in one of the grandfather clocks and was sent a year back. So she decides to help Harry and joins Hogwarts as a student. Only to let Harry walk back in the trap a year later... It honestly felt like the author had wasted everyone's time- theirs writing it and ours reading it. What is the bloody point of writing a time-travel fic if everything happens exactly the same way? Honestly, the only difference was that Tonks was at Hogwarts and befriended Harry and Hermione.

*** The Prequels were not great, but they had enough room for you to interpret stuff and bend canon enough to make them really interesting. The deleted scenes (Anakin meeting Padmé's parents, Dooku trying to sway Padmé on Geonosis) were pretty interesting as well. And Clone Wars did a really great job fleshing the characters out.

The sequels on the other hand, 7 was bland but had the same potential, with the new super weapon being the only really bad plot point. But 8 and 9 had none of that potential and were utterly shit.

**** I see it like this.

The prequels had few errors, just handful of them, but they were big and glaring. If you fixed them, all the cool characters, worldbuilding and themes were there to make a great trilogy. Let's say stuff like "Make Maul live after first movie", "Keep Anakin with the jedis instead of flying back to naboo"... "Make episode 1 more about Obiwan and less Anakin"

The sequels had their few glaring errors as well, but also plenty of small ones. The small ones might have been the easy one to fix... A quote here and there, fix captain phasma or this and that character moment. The big ones were abstract and not as obvious to fix as the prequels one. You get "Get a new plot for episode VII" or "do the subverting style of VIII or the cliche tropey one of IX.... But for gods sake not both at the same time!"

******* Larry Correia's /The Grimnoir Chronicles/

It's a trilogy, plus a few short stories. Alt history meets diesel-punk meets science fiction with a dash of urban fantasy. Action packed, with superb fight scenes, and colorful characters. This is the book series that made me love reading again, when I was in college.

Picture this:

It's 1932.

For the last eighty years, there has been magic. One out of every hundred Americans has magic, and one out of every thousand is called an Active, who has control over their magic. Magicals can manipulate fire and ice and electricity. Some have super strength and some can teleport and some can manipulate their mass.

Some things are familiar to our world's timeline, while others are quite different. While America suffers through the Depression, Japan is led by a warlord known only as the Chairman.

Under the cover of darkness, the richest man in the world approaches a mysterious wizard known by many names--Grim Reaper, Plague Bringer, and Pale Horse. The richest man in the world makes a deal with the Pale Horse: In exchange for an undisclosed favor, the Pale Horse will kill someone the man wants dead.

As this is going on, a man named Jake Sullivan has the Power to manipulate gravity. He's a private investigator, a war hero, and an ex-con. Under a deal with J. Edgar Hoover, Sullivan helps the Feds catch renegade Actives who use their power to kill. One mission goes bad, and Sullivan finds himself beaten by a team of Actives, wearing strange rings, who claim they're protecting other Magicals. Humiliated and chastised by Hoover, Sullivan wants answers. And he's done working for the feds.

Meanwhile back on the ranch, or at least on a dairy farm in California, a farmer named Travelin' Joe Vierra tries to train his adopted "granddaughter" Faye how to use her magic, the power of Teleportation, or Traveling as they call it, safely. One day, a car drives up, four men get out, and their leader, a one-eyed man, guns him down. Travelin' Joe manages to give Faye a small bag before he dies. Inside the bag is part of a piece of a Tesla weapon and a ring, along with a piece of paper with names and an address.
