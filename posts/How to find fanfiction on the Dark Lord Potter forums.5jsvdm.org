** No. There is the library (broken into categories) which contain a link to the fic, a summary, the suggester's thoughts, and then reviews and discussions of the fics by site members. It is /NOT/ a fanfiction hosting site like AO3 and FFN.

*** It's worth noting that they do actually have a hosting site called Patronus Charm, but it's not really used. Also, Scryer is theirs, which is super easy to use and find new fics with. Other than that, if you click the actual library link (not the library list), you will see the individual subforums like humor, romance, dark arts, etc.

** I found it frustrating to use.

Your supposed to rate threads you like in the library so as to get recommendations to read. But everytime I tried to do that it would say "This thread is closed".
