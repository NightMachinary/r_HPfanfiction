  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** I like the relationship between Regulus and Sirius in the "Different Path" series by Moonybird and dtill359 on Ao3.

It's a Snape/Lily fic, but after the first few chapters, their relationship is mostly background. The Marauders grow up a lot in this series, and that includes Sirius working on his relationship with Regulus (who's a major character).

  In 1979, Regulus Black goes to destroy a Horcrux, expecting to die in the attempt. But luck and Kreacher's ingenuity keep him alive...which leaves Regulus trying to negotiate switching sides in the middle of a war without getting killed. He hadn't planned past the cave. It's a good thing that both sides can find a use for a spy---isn't it?
