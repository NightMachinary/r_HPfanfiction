Hey, I'm looking for fics similar to Wind Shear which feature a war-torn Harry who has found himself in an AU. The longer the better and if possible not slash or multi.


** A one-shot I fell in love with a good while ago: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting The Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]]. All I'll say is, yikes.

** I haven't read /Wind Shear/ so I don't know, but /Strange Reflections/ linkffn(12307886) might work for you. 8th year fic where Canon Harry develops a drinking problem to cope with his nightmares of Death Eater concentration camps (think Joseph Mengele). AU Harry, careless and self-centered, pops in and immediately starts complaining that everyone here is so sad and solemn and they don't just give him things for free like his old reality.

One moment in particular, AU Harry throws a prank grenade. Canon Harry reacts like it's a real grenade. And they're both like, "what the fuck is wrong with you?!"

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

***** Hmm, I would argue that /I'm Still Here/ had some significant problems that get in the way of being truly fantastic, pacing foremost among them. That fic took (iirc) over 100k words to get through the first four days.

******* So do I, some of my favorites are longer than atlas shrugged, I'm talking about the pace not just the word count. Cause at the rate of about 100k words per four days of in-story progression we'd end up with a story around 9 million words long just to cover a single year. That's more than eight times the length of the entire Harry potter series.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
