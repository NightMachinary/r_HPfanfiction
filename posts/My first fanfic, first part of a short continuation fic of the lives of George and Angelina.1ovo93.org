** Wow that was really, really good. I'm looking forward to chapter 5. I really appreciate how you captured the bitterness of living after the final battle and I think you've nailed George. The appiration bit rustled my jimmies as I'm sure was the intention. Well played indeed. MOAR!!

*** Wow thank you. You have no idea how much that means. I have quite a bit more of it written, I just thought Id upload a bit of it before I continued to see if it was even worth it. Its the first thing Ive written since I was a kid so I was really winging it. And Ive been obsessively rereading what i have written and noticing a bajillion typos and things i want to tweak. But anyway, thank you, you just made my day.
