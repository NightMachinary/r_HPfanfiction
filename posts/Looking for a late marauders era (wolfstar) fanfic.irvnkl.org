Does anyone know good late Marauders era (like last year of Hogwarts and after?) fanfic and maybe with wolfstar (and jilly)?

Thank you.


** It's worth asking in HP Slashfic, if you haven't already. They tend to have more fics to fulfil slash prompts.

I don't have any recs for you myself, I don't really read Marauders era fics. My apologies. :)

**** 'Harry-era' stuff, mostly. When he's at Hogwarts, when he's raising his kids. Occasional Marauders or Founders era time-travel, but mostly stuff set during Harry's lifetime. Not necessarily starring him, just stuff set in that period of time.

Regarding content and pairings, pretty much anything that isn't pure smut or obnoxiously Dark/Gory. If it interests me, I'll read it, and I can find something interesting in most things regardless of tropes or writing quality.

You?

***** Well im quite new to Reading fanfiction and i have been reading some 2nd gen and a bit of marauders and right now I am reading a story where Harry has an older brother. It's all on wattpat and I have been trying to move away from that (I have been pretty lucky quality wise I think).

For content I would probably say it's a little more mature than the og series but not much (prob pg-13 (if I had to give it a movie rating lol)) and ships, I love wolfstar, scorbus, and mostly cannon ships.\\
(Sorry if my English is bad it's not my first language)

****** Your English isn't bad at all. I've heard and read far worse from my fellow English people, I promise. :D

First of all, welcome. You've got plenty more things to see outside of Wattpad. Do you want some tips on how to find fics? There's a lot of different ways (sub-searches, bots, other sites, other subreddits, etc) and I don't wanna just throw a page of suggestions at you if you don't want them. :)

And those're fun pairings. A good Wolfstar fic can be very interesting, if it's done right. It's also probably the most popular 'background ship' I've ever seen - lots of fics have it just offhandedly mentioned or referred to once or twice and never really focused on.

******* I'd love to know how to find fics because I really have trouble with that.

******** Cool. Well, sorry for throwing so much information at you at once, but here you go. :)

First, you're definitely likely to find good fics here on this subreddit - the requests, the 'what's that fic', and the 'what are you reading' posts will be your best sources here.

You can also post directly with your own requests, or do a sub-search for past requests (check the reddit search bar, type in what you want, click the little box that limits your search to this sub, and you'll get every post made on that topic).

I'd also suggest you check out the lists on the Dark Lord Potter forums. They've got some very high standards there and the fics tend to be of relatively high quality.

If you're on a computer, I'd recommend you check out the sidebar here on the subreddit for lists of some more subreddits and websites to check.

There are some pairing-specific subreddits like [[/r/haphne][r/haphne]] and [[/r/harryandfleur][r/harryandfleur]] and so on that might give you fics that match your interests more specifically. Websites like Ashwinder and SIYE are dedicated to specific pairings and will also help you find stuff matching your interests.

The Subreddit list is just there on the sidebar, but the website lists are here - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/]]

And also here - [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives]]

You might've noticed that we have a bot here that pops up whenever someone links a fic. There's a HP Fanfic Recommender tool that looks through all the fics the bot links to and puts them in one list to check out.

That's here - [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/]]

There's also a bot that helps find fics that are similar to ones you've read. If you copy the link from your fic and paste it in the search bar, it'll give you a list of fics that tend to be recommended in the same posts as your copied fic.

That is here - [[https://fanfictionbot.github.io/recs/index.html]]

And finally, there's the Dark Lord Potter Forum's Scryer tool. It's a searchbot with some specific filters.

That's here - [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]
