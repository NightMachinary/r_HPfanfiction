**** I really don't like this relationship generally. Snape is a great character to have great redemption story (which JKR failed to do properly, in my opinion) and all Lilly/Snape botched the opportunity. See the recent thread on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ikivoy/what_you_would_like_to_see_in_a_draco_redemption/g3lwrs2/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][the redemption]].

OK, there is one exception, “Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here” linkffn(6622580), but I don't think it is what you are looking for (although, I think it is one of the candidates for the title of the best fanfiction of all times), but it is actually /sui generis/ redemption story as well.

Edit: Your comments in the other thread emphasised showing and recognising the full measure of their fault. You don't feel any of the existing fics did a decent job of this?

****** For full redemption I need:

1. Something to redeem. I don't believe the break-up between Lily and Severus was just about him calling her once a mudblood. And I don't think the sin which screwed up his whole life was delivering one piece of information to Tom Riddle without understanding the consequences. If you want to write hundred thousand words about redemption from this, then don't bother me with it, because I think Severus needs more slap on his face for enjoying feeling sorry for himself more than any redemption. And I don't think that the membership in the terrorist organization is just about drinking tea and discussing your own superiority. Get the real, thought-through, believable, but disgusting story. Get Severus to some raid torturing and killing, or make him develop special more deadly poison, make him into Mengele-like character testing his poisons on real humans, something. (and it shouldn't be all he did, but I am still returning to that rape of Petunia ... something really traumatic had to happen to her to make her into such caricature of human being we have in PS ... and BTW, her story is the redemption story worthy of writing). See also these [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i9h9at/the_character_of_hp_magic/g1flpsp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][two]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iduokw/dark_wizards_patronus/g2biamt/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][threads]] on the nature of Dark Magic. Dark Magic is not just the same magic done with the black wand.

2. He must own his sin (sorry, for the Christian jargon, but that's the context I mostly think about the guilt and redemption), and he must confess it fully (not some like allusions, “I was not very nice.”, be specific). Yes, it is a struggle to get there, but yes, that's what the story is about. And nothing about his circumstances, his parents, etc. making him doing it. Remember, the most profound lesson from whole heptalogy is that it is our choices who decide who we truly are, not our original circumstances.

3. He must ask for forgiveness all those whom he hurt. There was that sitcom in America around the year 2000 (correction: it was “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Name_Is_Earl][My Name is Earl]]” and it started in 2005), where the main character goes around and in each episode he asks somebody for forgiveness of something bad he did to them when he was a teenager. If you know the name of the show please share. It was a lot of fun, but after couple of episodes it unfortunately started to be a bit repetitive. I don't think it has to be exactly like that, but if he truly believes what he did was wrong, he should at least go and ask for forgiveness Harry (or all those Muggles he tortured in the step 1, or Petunia?).

4. He must accept forgiveness for himself. If he is still bitter and suicidal in the end as he was in the beginning, then he still haven't finished his redemption arc.

******* Oh, I don't have any problem with Christian terminology :D.

The Peace Not Promised is... Mixed, by your criteria. They certainly are not all fulfilled, but progress is being made. Notably, he has been able, over time, to find a measure of forgiveness for James Potter, and for his father Tobias, which I consider to be an important step toward being able to admit his own fault. He does not go into graphic detail about most of his past crimes, but when baring his soul to Lily, he confesses to many murders at Voldemort's behest, to having hired prostitutes with money gained from far worse deeds than the prostitution, and to Dumbledore he admits having murdered his own parents in his first life. Now, at the time, he claims to feel no remorse for his patricide. Yet their relationship does begin to thaw, slightly, throughout the story, and he is able at least to let go of the hatred. And he unmistakably finds more peace within himself as time passes and he lets go of old bitterness.

With Lily he is much more open, freely acknowledging his faults and how he has wronged her, and doing anything he can for her.

So he is not a completely redeemed and changed man by the current chapter, and probably not by the end of the story. But the process is in motion.

******** It is perfectly OK to leave the story while he is still on his way to achieve the end of the redemption. Many great stories end exactly in the point when the main character just decides to set out for the journey (that would be somewhere between points 2 and 3 in my list above) knowing that all work is still ahead of him/her. It is only necessary to make it clear that he has not arrived yet.

Is “The Peace Not Promised” linkffn(12369512)? I haven't read that yet, I may try.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

********** OK, sixteen chapters down and I cannot take it anymore. Author in some “How to write a great novel” read that solutions for the hero should not be easy, but it should take time, so he took time. That's completely boring eleven chapters of nothing just to make LiLy and Snape talking. We all knew it will happen, there was no way the story could exist without it happening, but author wasted eleven chapters on nothing to get there. I hate when characters in story start to behave like idiots just to keep authors poor plot together. Suddenly, after talking to Snape how love is the most important strength he has and everything, Dumbledore for no good reasons whatsoever wipes out whole relationship between Snape and Lily just to make another fifteen chapters of nothing, before finally Snape will give her the memory back (I presume, because I have already deleted the EPub from my drive). I just cannot take it anymore. Of course, the author with his overinflated ego is persuaded that his writing is the most beautiful and important thing in the world, but I have other things to do with my life than to waste it with his non-sweet nothing.

Having said, yes, I agree that at least the redemption arc seems to be started rather decently. So far.

*********** The reasoning was that if anyone with even minor Legilimency talent snooped in Lily's mind, they would find out about Severus' future knowledge, which would paint a huge target on both Severus and Lily. And yes, he will eventually give it back when the time is right. They get targeted anyway and Voldemort sees enough in his mind to assume that he's a seer. Severus has hated keeping it from her anyway and wants to come clean, and figures there's no additional danger any more after that.

I didn't find it boring myself, but if you did, ok. Everyone's tastes are different.

************* Well, it's actually a whole lot shorter than The Peace Not Promised :D. But if you felt like PnP was dragging, you might like that.

It's one where /both/ Lily and Severus came back from the points where they died, but for Lily that's just a few years. And unlike PnP, neither has any idea initially of what's going on. Much more angst, more emphasis on Severus' Occlumency having psychological side effects, altogether a rougher ride, but really excellent prose quality and flow.
