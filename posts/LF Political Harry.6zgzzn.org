looking for Political centric fiction where Harry is a major politician for pairings anything is good except (Harry/Ginny)-(Harry/Hermione)


** This: linkffn(7539141). Yes, it's a zombie/apocolypse fic, but it also does a fantastic job of creating a believable political atmosphere. Backstabbing, deal-making, libel, this has everything you want in a political thriller.

**** If you like this, I recommend you read World War Z (The book, movie didn't do it justice), if you'd like another one. The story is told as a report about the zombie apocalypse after it occurred by the U.N.

** There are a lot. Literally any fic where Harry claims his seat on the Wizengamot, or any fic where he is left the title of Lord Black by Sirius or inherits the title of Lord Potter from his parents.

E.g.:

Linkffn(A Marauder's Plan)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Return of Heritage)

Linkffn(Resurgence)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Peverell Legacy)

Are just a few.
