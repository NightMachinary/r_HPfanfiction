An ultra pragmatist, pretty much "The Wizard Killer" who would just do what's necessary in order to win. None of this EXPELLIARMUS he's trying to kill me and I only won because of Elder Wand Ex Machina crap. Killing Umbridge to save the large numbers of Muggleborn, getting access to weapons on the Black Market using Imperio and blowing up Malfoy Manor when he knows the Death Eaters are inside using a Rocket Launcher or something? Perfectly logical.

Harry's first action is to hurl a bottle of whiskey at a Death Eater, then set him on fire. As a distraction. While Harry doesn't use dark spells, light spells can be just as deadly.

*** i've seen lots of fics where it's basically said that "light or dark spells don't matter, you could heat tea with a blood boiling curse, or you can blind someone with an overpowered lumos"

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
