I'm looking for fics that, if you changed the names of the characters and the spells, would never be noticeable as a Harry Potter fanfic. I've been rereading Wastelands of Time and it got me curious how many more like that there are. The fic can be anything, it just has to feel like HP in name only.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and its continuation [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][Changes in a Time of War]] seem to be what you're looking for. It's basically Harry Potter not wanting to have anything to do with anything in the HP world. Word of warning, it's all over the top with vampires and demons, blood magic, leather clothes, and everything possible to make themselves as edgy as they could. You have been warned.

** linkffn(5904185) Emperor, even the names are barely used, like This has a Harry who goes by the name of Francis White, was raised by his parents without contact with the magical world, attended a muggle boarding school while praising his wandless magic which barely has anything to do with the Harry Potter magic system, and most of the fic is how he spend his years after the school serving in the Military while having the goal of becoming the Emperor of Europe.

Surprisingly its still a pretty good story, but its almost entirely an original story to the point that it's barely a fanfic.

** Alexandra Quick series definitely, it uses the HP magic system, but the plot and characters, and much of the world building is completely unique. And it's really good. The Pureblood Pretense and Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus are both extremely AU, but they also somewhat follow the stations of canon to an extent, so not sure if they are quite what you are looking for, but are both good.

***** It's definitely an excellent read. The narration is so natural and done in such way that it *feels* canon. I found the writing style and the character development similar to Rowling's. It could perfectly be a next gen fic, except for, you know, no having the descendants of the main characters in the story. It just feels like the HP universe a few years in the future, and in America. And the fact that there are 4 books (yes, entire books) already helps with the immersion. The series is planned to have 7 books, just like its canon counterpart, and the author has already confirmed that he has the next couple of books very roughly drafted already, so that's a promise that the series has not been abandoned. I had heard the series was quite good in other recommendations, but I put it off for a long time. When I finally deigned to read it, I went in expecting nothing, and boy, I was thoroughly surprised. Do give it a chance.

Haven't heard of the Pureblood Pretense, but Alexandra Quick has been on my list for awhile and I've never quite been in the mood to start it. Good to know from you and FYI that it's worth pushing through. :)

And I'd say Lily and ABS is probably a bit too close to canon to be what I want - it's more a bizarre HP fic than a not-HP fic, IMO. YMMV and all that though. Maybe I'll change my mind after a reread. :)

** linkffn(Voldemort's last spell) fits that perfectly. The main character is Harry who, after being hit with Avada on that Halloween, was transported back in time. Very, very long ago (120000 years ago). To the times when people still lived in tribes. He grows up in one such tribe and then leaves for another because people start noticing that he lives a very long life. And so he wanders the world, immortal. He is the first magical in the world and his green-eyed children are taking after him.

As you stated, this work is HP only because of Harry's name. It's very interesting.

*** So, kinda like A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh, except for the female Harry part?

***** Oh, then you should definitely read it. The fact that he... she's a female is irrelevant in this story. It's the actual story and narration what catches you. Definitely worth checking out. Don't let the female!Harry tag detract you from an amazing story.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

I mean I love it, but I can't deny if it wasnt in a HP setting the story would be much better.

Imagine if the mc got memories of a future the viewers dont know about.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

*** Huh. Playing off the eerily accurate divination predictions of his, huh? That looks interesting! Not so sure about the first chapter, but it's not enough to switch me off a pretty interesting premise. Thanks for the rec!

I can't really comment on either of your latter two statements given that I haven't read it yet, but if I get to it before this comment gets archived, I'll probably necro-post a response here. :)
