I'm looking for healer!Harry fics, but I'm specifically interested in one's where he's very interested in healing from a young age; I've seen a couple post-hogwarts ones and that's not what I'm looking for. Ideally complete or 100k+ but if it's being regularly updated shorter is OK too.

Bonus points if he's a pacifist, if he becomes known as the person to go to for no-questions-asked healing, or he also manages to get involved with dark magic or voldemort.
