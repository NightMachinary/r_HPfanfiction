Anyone know any fan fiction that has a si reincarnating as peter pettigrew? and like hes secretly a bad-ass but keeps up the cowardly facade, infiltrating the death eaters trying to destabilizes his forces and no one knows hes actually on their side and all that? i think it'd be a awesome read.

*** Self-Insert, where the writer writes him/herself in the story.

**** Well, for me it's more like where there's an OC who comes from or has memories of 'our' modern earth, and specifically whatever setting they go into. Self insert is normally not literal.

***** An OC is an Original Character, tho. That's a whole different thing.

From TV Tropes: *As the name implies, a *Self-Insert Fic* is one where the author has made a simulacrum of themselves, commonly called an avatar, in the story's world as a key character (usually The Protagonist, but any other role that's vital to the story qualifies). If the author has any sense of subtlety, the resulting character won't share their name or alias, but it's still easy to tell who that "new character" is.*

*An *Original Character* is, in the simplest terms, a new character created in a Fan Fic or other work that does not come from an existing copyright work. Any and all Characterization Tropes can apply, along with employing any and all tropes in general. The only real distinction between original and regular characters is that the former are synthesized specifically to unofficially integrate with the canon for the purposes of the story. The vast majority of fanfiction makes use of these, ranging in importance from being background extras to stealing the spotlight of the canonical characters.*

****** All SI's are OCs though, but not all OCs are SI's. I'd say an OC with meta knowledge should count as an SI.

** We need more SI's in general, luckily they seem to be getting more popular so hopefully one day we'll have one like this.

** I have never seen any SI of Peter Pettigrew. The closest I've found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614626/1/Half-Blood-Emperor][Half-Blood Emperor]] and that's a SI of Severus Snape.

And about the type of MC that you want, I recommend you read everything that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10208099/Sir-Lucifer-Morningstar][Sir Lucifer Morningstar]] writes, a pity that he has not written anything about Harry Potter. Anyway, all his SI are great.

*** really? i thought it was alright, bit angsty but not half bad. at-least it wasn't the power trip/power fantasy you usually find in most si nowadays, its hard to find any good ones that aren't abandoned.

  One day, Christopher died and woke up as everyone's favorite character-Peter Pettigrew. "Don't suppose there's a return policy on this kind of thing? 'Cause...I think I want a refund." With Christopher as Peter, how much will change? Semi-SI(Self Insert)/OC. Marauders-Era. undecided pairing, slash, m/m, m/f, bi, multi-shippings
