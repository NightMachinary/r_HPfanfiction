Hey folks. Coming up on another cancer treatment phase and need some fics to read on my kindle while in the hospital to pass the time and serve as a distraction. Sooooo....

Interested to see what folks have for OC (aka Original character) romance partners to Harry but with the caviat that the romance must take place or begin to take place at Hogwarts or another Wizarding school. And no I am not talking about "Daphne" style characters who are blank slates, but literal OC's in the sense that the character itself is not part of canon (or at least well known canon). Nor am I talking about gender bending characters to create a "new" character as I dont consider that OC.

Those are basically the only restrictions. Note: I don't mind suggestions that blur that restriction some if a good enough fic but its not what I am after so the fic better be damn good lol.

Multiple partners involved? Fine. Harry in Slytherin? Fine. Smut/NSFW stuff? Fine (Although good plot first please). Entirely new world built? Fine. Not remotely following Canon? Double fine.

You get the picture.

I just kinda want to see how folks incorporate OC's into the school environment with Harry.

Note: I would prefer more mature oriented fics (both in the style of writing and plot). But any suggestions will do. Thanks all!


** linkffn(2920229) doesn't just have the best romance in a Harry/OC fic I've read, it's one of the best in fanfiction I've read period. It's massively divergent after OOTP though and it's heavy on action and romance.

The first 30-40 chapters were written over a decade ago, from there on it's been written over the past two years. The writing is never truly awful IMO but it gets significantly better as the chapters go on.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, & Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Harry/OC (Being revised)

*** Thanks. Mine is a maintenance treatment to limit growth as I am considered long-term terminal (No cure). But im a research patient so hopefully they can figure out a cure with time using data they get from me and others like me. In the mean time, I can distract myself with my love of all things HP and creative activities :p

Hope you are doing well in your situation. <3

*** Thanks, ill take a look. This looks like it also satsifies another request I have made a few times which is a believable Harry/Teacher relationship story (although in my mind Tonks was likely the teacher) set starting or post Goblet of Fire.

*** Preferably I wanted the romance "at or associated with school" (at least initially). Hence, while the romance partner could technically be a teacher or staff member rather than a student, they would still need to be at the same school in some fashion as Harry.

Not sure how the one you linked operates but it implies the romantic partner would be seperated from Harry if Harry was at school.

**** Yes, I know it is the borderline case, and it mostly depends on what you hope for. If you want happy dancing in broom cupboards, then truly it isn't there. However, she eventually turns out in Hogwarts at least for some short time.
