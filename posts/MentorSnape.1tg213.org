Looking for any fics which focus on the teacher/mentor aspect of Snape's character - particularly any where he teaches Harry or helps Harry in the fight against Voldemort.

(PS: bless this subreddit and all in it, you've made returning to this fandom so much easier!)


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/][To Shape and Change]] by Blueowl; 232,270 words.

- The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] books (7) by Lightning on the Wave; 3KK words. This one has the most realistic (not even just to canon, but as a human being) depictions of Snape. There is a nice narration going on, for example, on why is he so crude to others even when he's on the “good side”. At least some of the stupid mistakes that he makes are consistent (imo) with his portrayed personality. *Warning* --- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1so5rg/looking_for_fics_that_talk_about_house_elves_or/cdzx3qw][read the review first.]]

** This is set in an AU universe before book 6 was released, but [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] might fit your description. Apologies if you've already heard of it, but I found it pretty amazing. It is a novel length fic.

*** This was the fic I was going to recommend. Snape's characterization is EXCELLENT here. There's not a lot of action, so to speak but it is an excellent character piece. It's my favorite Severitus story by far.

** I quite enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5961224/1/Mythic-Alliance][Mythic Alliance]]:

  They say there's no such thing as a magical Animagus. They're wrong. Harry Potter, Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy join together in an alliance no one, especially Voldemort, is expecting. Severus/Harry mentor, Harry/Draco friends. No slash.
