** Harry Potter doesn't have a magic system - it just has magic. It can't possibly weaken the plot because Rowling built the world, and subsequently the magic, around the plot, to /enable/ the plot. If anything, the plot weakens the magic, as we see barely anything that could give the magic of HP and its many schools of thought more depth.

*** I agree. I kind of like fanfiction because so many people have different thoughts on the magic system and rewrite it in their work. Has Rowling ever delved into how the magic system actually works?
