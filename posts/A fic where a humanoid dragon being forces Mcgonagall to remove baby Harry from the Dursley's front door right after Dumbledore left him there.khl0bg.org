I remember that the humanoid dragon being put his claws in Mcgonagall's chest and forced her to remove Harry form there. Then when Dumbledore watched her memories (through pensieve or legimency, don't remember witch ) the claw marks appeared on Dumbledore's chest, like he had been hurt too through the memory.

I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it was an Elder Scrolls crossover and the being was Akatosh.


** It sounds wicked
