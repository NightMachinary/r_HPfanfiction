and the Freed house elves led by Dobby open a shop in Diagon ally hiring out their service to perpetuate the idea.With the them selling their services to the parents of Mugglesborns, Squibs and magical parents that need someone to watch their child for them,ect.

With the people behind it going out of there way to have children,squibs,ect visibly accompanied by well cared for smartly dressed house elves that strick a massive contrast when stood next to the abused house Elfs owned by people like Malfoy.(maybe have a law passed saying that house Elfs can't be hidden in public when in service to a person and when asked they must announce who they are in service to. So people like Malfoy are pretty much shamed into treating their house Elfs better even if they don't free them)

Maybe have Dumbledore be in on it and assign each hogwarts student a Elf over the summer.(the house Elfs would not be bound to the students so none of the people like malfoy could abuse them or try and keep them and the Elfs would be able to defend them selfs).

I like the Idea of Dobby starting a house elf trend where the better a house Elfs Hat and socks are the higher their status.


** “Dunno why anyone needs house elves,” Harry remarked after Hermione stormed out of the Gryffindor common room, SPEW badges gripped tightly in her fist. “The Weasleys don't and there's nine of them.”

Neville shrugged. “Gran's never needed one. She's always told me that a well educated witch is her own first and last resort.”

“Sounds about right,” Harry agreed and thought nothing more of it until he unfolded the Daily Prophet the next morning.

/HOUSE ELVES INDICATOR OF AN ILL-EDUCATED WIZARD!/

/An editorial written by Atir Reteeks./

/My fellow witches and wizards, I posed a question to myself this misty Monday morning, contemplating the purpose of the house elf in a wizard's home. After much consideration, I came to the conclusion the presence of a house elf was an indication of how magically powerful said wizard was. That is to say --- not at all!/

/Envision, if you will, the great and powerful Albus Dumbledore ordering a house elf to clean up a spilled cup of tea. Can you see it in your mind's eye? I confess that I cannot. Instead, I picture a casual wave of his hand as he vanishes the mess. Why would he bother to ask a house elf to do something that he could do himself, quicker and more easily? This leads me to beg the question.../

Harry realised that his mouth was hanging open. He swallowed his half-eaten bite of toast and elbowed Hermione.

“What?” She glanced over at the paper then snatched it from him, frantically mouthing each word as she read the article. “This... this could change everything.”

The bench scraped as she stood, clutching the paper to her chest, and hurried from the room. Ron watched her leave with wide eyes.

“Ey, Hermione, you haven't even eaten your bacon!”

“I think you can have it, Ron,” Harry said, nudging Hermione's plate closer to him. He pushed his glasses up his nose and looked around for another copy of the paper, hoping to read the Quidditch section.

Perhaps Hermione's dream of freeing the house elves wasn't that far off, if the papers could paint people like the Malfoys as weak. He just wondered how much of a coincidence it was that Atir Reteeks had voiced the very same opinion he'd shared with Neville just the day before.

*** If so, then it's a piece of canon that is very underused. Just like many other pieces of HP lore, which can be both accidental and on purpose. I, personally, love the HP books mostly for the fandom, because Rowling left so many little nooks and crannies to explore. Plot holes? You bet I will pull some Wonderland-grade plot out of that hole!

*** Unlike with us mere mortals, where doing everything ourselves requires knowledge of the subject matter and hours of work, a good wizard can flick a wrist and the kitchen utensils will do all the cooking, the clothes will immediately be clean, a plough will move itself through fields, papers will sort themselves into alphabetical order, things will fly to us from where they are, fireplaces will catch fire, etc. All at the same time.

***** Well Dumbledore is that kind of person.

He apparently adores nice socks but does not conjure as much as he wants. Or something...

On another note, I assume scale affects magic. Andromeda Tonks is said to be able to get things moving and sorted properly with socks folding themselves neatly, etc as said by Tonks in book 5, but something on the scale of Hogwarts is probably Grand sorcery to do all at once. Maybe room by room flicking the wand.

The average wizard won't need to worry about such a scale as they only occupy a single room at a time when indoors. The only issue might be magical dirt and creatures as was the case at Grimmauld's place.

****** Which is why such a thing would probably be accomplished in one of two ways:

1. A permanent piece of magic is included into the magics of the castle to do the periodical chores like cleaning and cooking, while the irregular needs are attended to on case by case basis.
2. The students' pride is played upon, where Dumbledore and elves are available, but asking the Headmaster or an elf is an admission of weakness. As a result, beyond the first year hardly anyone does it.

[[/u/SnowingSilently]]

As for the Malfoy question: obviously the elves are guests at Hogwarts enjoying Dumbledore's hospitality after Hogwarts' superior education caused a mass unemployment amongst them. At least here they can sometimes help a first year or Argus Filch the Caretaker, as not to feel quite so useless.

**** "I could but you know what, I don't want to and because I'm rich I don't need to either."

What people arguing that wizards could do everything on their own always forget is that having servants, once it stops being a necessity, very much becomes a status symbol.

Were I try to write a HP story aimed at adult readers one distinction between the wanna-be rich and the actual rich people would be that the truly rich hire /human/ servants, that they are willing to hire wizards to do the jobs lesser people use house elves for.

Of course I also would include at least one squib who gets away with pretending to be a wizard by acting/being so rich they never /need/ to cast any spell by their own hand.

** Feeding bigotry doesn't work. the people who create bigotry know it's stupid, but they profit from it and thus have a vested interest in perpetuating it. This is because bigotry never exists for its own sake - its existence serves someone's interests. This tactic works against the blind masses, but not against those who actually perpetuate bigotry.

This would be worked against severely by those in power. There would be counters published, defamations of people's characters, rallies and marches organized by someone in power against this notion.

You can't beat bigotry by trying to manipulate it in your favor. You can only beat it by educating the blind masses into seeing masses and tearing down the institutions and people who enable it.

The enablers are never easily beat like this post implies. They know every dirty trick, every slick tactic and technique to achieve their own ends. They are slippery, hardy and resistant like cockroaches.

** Okay, this is a bit confusing, but I want to try to throw my headcanon into the ring since it's relevant. I always saw house elves as these legitimately powerful faerie creatures that loves housework, so wizards give them housework to do. So both parties are protected, they have an incredibly powerful binding contract. Of the legal, unbreakable vow, goblet of Fire, kind. I've never really liked the house elf bonding thing, because it raises questions about how a race evolved that can't lived without wizards. But the terms of the contract are freedom when given clothes, and protecting the family, no action against the family, what have you. But clothes are kind of a cop-out, see clothes are passed between master and elf all the time, so all one party has to do is acknowledge that they're free now. This also explains why house elves aren't nude all the time, as what they wear are clothes! So Dobby is abused from birth by the Malfoys and they don't tell him that he can be free whenever he wants. So he thinks that he has to be given clothes to do it, which is why Harry's trick works even though Lucius didn't intend to give Dobby clothes, because Dobby thought he had received clothes in the proper fashion. I think this gives a lot of context to the use of house elves without making the Wizarding world entirely evil, and additionally gives Lucius Malfoy the villainy I'd expect from someone who gave a Horcruxes to an eleven-year-old. Additionally, it makes house elves not a necessity, but instead a kind of having additional servants kind of situation. This allows for house elves to have different roles and skills that indicate their lives.
