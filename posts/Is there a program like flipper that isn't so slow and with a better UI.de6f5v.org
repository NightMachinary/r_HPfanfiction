The UI isn't that bad, but it was hard to understand when I started using it. But it freezes a lot and, occasionally, repeats errors when I haven't clicked on anything.


** Assuming you are talking about the program that [[/u/rocketguy2]] mentioned, I don't think there is anything else that extensive.

Your best bet is probably to report issues/request features or improvements on the github. Or contact the dev via mail/discord.

*** Thanks. I'll try that. For all I know, though, it could just be my laptop. I'll have to clean it up a bit and try again.

*** You've earned this upvote for making me laugh. It was just so out of place and I somehow missed it when replying to the other two commenters yesterday.

** Can you record a video of you using it? It's hard to estimate what you mean by slow. And record the errors too. And I am not entirely sure what you mean by freezes

anyway, flipper has a support discord here: [[https://discord.gg/AdDvX5H]]

Also, I will freely admit UI is confusing to start using it but it's designed to give power search first and foremost and there are both tutorials and videos.

*** I actually went back to it about a week ago. I realised it was the fact that my 'temp' files folder was overflowing. I tried it again and it's ok. I did manage to figure out the UI eventually as well. Thanks for the link!
