Hello! I'm looking for a piece that was several volumes long, but simply can't remember the name of it. The main character was an OC, who lived in North America/Canada until her guardian died and she was taken back to Hogwarts with Dumbledore. Even though she is a year younger, the OC is in Harry's year. She makes the golden trio a quartet. I can remember random plot details such as she and Hermione get kidnapped for a bit, OC falls in love with a Hufflepuff student, and is later revealed to the characters as Harry's sister, though it is shown in the opening chapter. I'm not sure which website I read it on, but considering my regular browsing is on fan fiction, this group might be my best bet!
