** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), was published before DH came out. It is still highly enjoyable, popular, and unique.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], linkffn(4152700), was finished in March 2008. Still a highly emotional, timeless one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362), was written in Oct 2008. This premise has still not been picked up by anyone else.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(2818538), was finished in Nov 2006. People even thought it was a leaked copy of DH, and it predicted Harry as a Horcrux and Snape as a good guy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]], linkffn(3186836), is another fic finished before DH came out. I enjoyed it a lot.

** Well, there's linkffn(The Book of Morgan Le Fay by LavenderBrown): A pre - HBP sixth year story from Ron's perspective with a strong Ron/Hermione element. I think it holds up since the writing is solid, the characters are in character, and the mystery is worthy of the Potter novels themselves. My main problems with it are Hermione getting a makeover and the length -- it has the never ending novel vibe of book 5. Otherwise it is a solid read.

I also have a soft spot for linkffn(The Scarlet Raven by Amberdulen) since it has fun costume antics and the view of the political situation in book 5 from outside the school. It also is refreshing these days to read a Percy/Penelope ship since practically everyone puts him with their own version of Audrey these days. It's short and does need to be read with the novel in mind, but it is fairly entertaining.

Last, there's linkffn(I'd Kill You If You Weren't Already Dead by Backroads). Like those mentioned before, it is pre-HBP, but since Voldemort has been defeated when the story took place it can focus on grief and character development for our leads, Ron and Percy. It is funny but also thoughtful. I especially like the details about the afterlife and the characterization of Binns, the Bloody Baron, and Peeves.

** While it is not a well-known fic, I do believe that “Happy Birthday, Mr. Dark Lord” ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/after_the_rain/HBMDL01a.html]]) is good and does stand the test of time. It is also written in 2004, so it is quite old.

It may not be quite as old, being last updated in 2008 so only 9 years ago, but I do believe that “End Of the Line” (linkffn(3673824)) withstood the test of time too.

** linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) - It's bookended by some very well-abused tropes; Harry framed and sent to Azkaban and later his being a Merlin-level powerhouse; but that's not what the story is about and it doesn't mischaracterize his friends later on. I still have cause to recommend it here occasionally, and I do so without apology.

** I'm going to try to limit myself to fics 10+ years older.

Also I'm going to sound like a broken record but linkffn(After the End) continues to be one of my favorites. I still read it every other year or so, just enough time for me to forget some of the plot points. A lot of people might not pick it up because of the lack of a summary (it's been rehosted onto FFN from Sugar Quill) but I would say to give it a try.

The tiny summary it's been given is

/"It's the summer after seventh year, and Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and the rest of the wizarding world must learn to live without fear. This story was written prior to the release of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."/

I also like linkffn(Becoming Neville by Jedi Rita; Stars Fall by Lady Altair)

Becoming Neville has a slash version on LiveJournal, easily googled.

It was published before HBP, so there's a lot that doesn't quite line up with canon, but it is still very well-written

** I would say... linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux) is definitely one. As is The Black Comedy. (not linking because its the most linked thing on this subreddit, and google gives you the first chapter as one of the top five anyway). While they have tropes, and issues, they are both extremely funny, and have fantastic moments.

**** I placed this here, because while yes, it was published in 2014, it is still considered an "old guard fic" by many. it is a Staple of most any rec list, and has been since it was published. A Black Comedy, is slightly older, but in this world of Fanfiction, anything that is not published and completed within six months is commonly labelled as "old", or at the very least, "Not new."

The post asked for "old fics with staying power". Via my personal definition, this is one fic that no matter the age, will always be relevant even though it won't be canon. Via that definition, my post was extremely valid.
