Now he had to deal with an entire class full of students traumatized by the sight of one of their own lying dead on the floor, even if only technically. Worst of all was what he swore was the look of peaceful acceptance on the fake corpse's face, if only because it hinted to a whole mess of problems he knew all too well, but was frankly not properly equipped to help with.


** Hmmm... I've had an idea on boggarts, but it's a bit janky.

Younger boggarts would tap into petty fears and insecurities, like, say, Lavender seeing herself as being fat (if that's one of her fears), or irrational fears like spiders, mummies, et cetera.

Older boggarts or those saturated with magic, e.g. in Hogwarts, would tap into victims' /traumas/ -- such as Molly seeing everyone she loved dead on the floor, or Voldemort seeing his own dead body.

** Boggarts seem to be a normal thing in the wizarding world and thus they are part of the curriculum. Better face them while your fears are silly childish fears than when they are result of a trauma like Molly (as a matter of fact Remus does prevent students that have a fear that might traumatize the rest of the class to get near it). Besides successfully defeating your fear in front of a crowd is empowering.

So I don't really get this stupid theory that popped up lately that Remus did something wrong.

*** Some people like to complain about Hogwarts and feel that the school is not "safe", which is an understandable opinion considering all the things that happen in this school. Even if it's one I don't share, mainly because most of the problem were special circumstance, and the "improvement" proposed by these people tend to suck the magic out of the school.

​

Concerning the Boggart's class, I'll admit I also have some doubts about it. To repeat what I said into a previous discussion, facing the Boggart in front of an audience help since it "weakens" the Boggart (not to mention your point about the experience being empowering), but at the same time, children are little shit and I would not be surprised that some of them use the knowledge gained during this class to "prank" (or bully) one of their classmate.

Also, even if what I'll say is really nitpicking, I want to point that Remus didn't really "prepare" this lesson, in the sense that he had no idea what the students worst fear would be. Sure he stopped Harry to face the boggart because he thought it would be Voldemort, but that's Harry Potter, everyone in Britain (or even the world) know his story. What would he have done if Neville's boggart was Bellatrix Lestrange, if Ron's was the body of his sister, or if Hermione's was a basilisk? No to mention the usual abused child, like Theodore Nott who often see his father as a boggart in fanfics.

​

PS: Stupid question, but do you think that a Basilisk Boggart could petrify people with his gaze? I doubt it could kill, but the Dementor boggart have similar (though weakened) ability to a real one, so I was wondering if the same would be true with a Basilisk.

**** To build on this, what if one of the students was dealing with depression, and their worst fear was their mental state getting so bad that they commit suicide because of it?

**** My headcanon is that a Boggart in Basilisk form would Petrify with its gaze, playing on the fact that it's a weakened version of the real thing. Kinda like how a Boggart with the appearance of a Dementor can still invoke the happiness-draining effect and force a reliving of bad memories, but probably couldn't Kiss anyone.

**** The Dementor-boggart has psychological effects. Harry realizes both during his Patronus lessons and in the maze that what he sees is not an actual Dementor and he gets back to his senses. The impact of the basilisk is physical (you either get petrified or die or you don't). I don't think the boggart can replicate that.

***** A boggart could exert a psychological pressure on a student to make him or her /think/ she was paralyzed. It could cause all the muscles to seize up or simply activate the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems simultaneously, like when you're dreaming. When you dream you are paralyzed so that you don't act out your dreams. It's normal and healthy, but it is an existing natural state within humans that the bogart basilisk could exploit.

**** I'd imagine his response to any serious and major fear would be what he did with Harry- step in before people could really figure out what's happening and take care of the issue himself. Certainly, I'd say he was fortunate there wasn't any serious fears in that particular class, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect that he had zero plan for any of the more serious ones, even if the plan was simply to step in and redirect the boggart. Furthermore, I think there's some more things at play than most people think- take, for example, how the class arrived to the boggart in the first place. They passed by Snape. I don't imagine this is unintentional on his part, to be honest. Human beings are things greatly affected by recency bias. Sure, Neville could have been more afraid, rationally, of Bellatrix Lestrange, or things regarding his parents, but he also mere moments ago ran up against the most intimidating teacher in the castle. His mind would probably be more focused on Snape and his fear of him than more theoretical and esoteric fears. Also, Lupin asked right before he opened the boggart, just to be sure. Lupin essentially mentally primed the class to focus on the more immediate, childish fears by making sure the first one was Snape and that it was dealt with smoothly. Someone like Hermione might be reminded of her fears of more petty, Academic things in that moment than the Basilisk or the Troll that almost killed her, and they'd all see a fear be dealt with smoothly and this be in the right mindset to deal with theirs. It's not the worst planned lesson in the world.

As for more emotional boggarts or ones which imply abuse, suicidal thoughts, and other serious things, well, I'd imagine finding out early because of a boggart might be something that could be used to help the student in the unlikely situation it comes up. It's not an ideal scenario, but I'd imagine it's possibly better than never finding out until it's too late.

*** Because child abuse is a thing. Not all kids have silly childish fears. Yeah he might do that with harry who might fear voldemort but how is he supposed to know that little Sally's fear is her father beating her mother. Or that little tim is terrified of the local priest who tried to exorcise the demon out of him after seeing him do accidental magic. Yeah have it part of the curriculum especially if they are common in the wizarding world. Dont have them do it in front of all there classmates when you have no idea what will come out of it. And have a qualified counselor there when they do it so they have someone to talk to.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.
