** Don't like, don't read I think is probably the rule people need to follow the most.

If you're reading something and something happens that bothers you, use the back button. Don't flame the author, don't go complain about it on social media, don't report the fic to try and get it taken down.

If someone is using AO3 and didn't use appropriate mandatory tags, then you can report the fic for that.

Otherwise, be polite to people and don't cause arguments on purpose. Behind every screen name is a person.

*** I't's the sunk cost fallacy. I've read 30 chapters, and must continue, even though I don't like this anymore. Therefore, I will write a comment saying I don't like this anymore, sinking EVEN MORE time into something I'm not enjoying.

Edit: Whoever downvoted me, I'm not saying I do this, I'm saying that's the logic of people who do it.

*** Why do people get mad that Ron and Ginny aren't horrible people in fics?

**** A lot of people dislike them. I mean, I do not care for Ron, and I can understand why people don't. I mean, Ron is an insecure, immature brat, who can be and sometimes is a bad friend, even if he comes through in the end.

But the Ginny bashing I will never understand. What did she ever do to anybody?

****** Agreed, the movies made Ron look worse.

Also agree that while it's easier to make Ron look bad in fics because hes done things that weren't good but doing the same to Ginny makes no sense! She was either silently out of Harry's way, or calling people out on their shit or coming up with some good ideas. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

******* Some of what Ginny says and does, when you look at it from not-Harry's perspective is...kind of not great.

She deliberately crashes into the podium where Zacharius Smith has been commentating from and maybe seriously injures him. Now granted, Smith was being snide during the whole match but lest we forget, for most of the early books the commentator was Lee Jordan who was heavily biased in Gryffindor's favour and nobody ever felt the need to assault him.

She also hexes Smith on the train at the beginning of HBP and gets rewarded for it. Rewarding her is on Slughorn but it doesn't exactly paint a great picture of Ginny.

Some of her comments or reactions come off as really weirdly jealous. They could be passed off as jokes or as teenagers not being incredibly mature but given how close to the end of the books they occur, it's hard to say that she'll grow up because we never see that happen.

I'm not discounting that she does come up with good ideas and have some great lines, I'm just pointing out that there are things that Ginny says or does which people might not like her for.

******* Yep. Although, I'm curious if people are going back and cringing at certain things that they do to justify their reasoning?

** Don't flame a story. All it does, is make the author miserable. In fact, do not engage in any sort of abusive behaviour. Like mentioned above, behind every screen name is a person.

** If you read a story, leave a comment. It's just polite and only takes two seconds to write "Good Fic!". It's a little work from you that really means a lot to an author especially on works with less notes.

Just don't be negative. Constructive criticism when framed well is good but don't be a dick for the sake of being a dick. You're crushing someone for a hobby and thats just cruel.
