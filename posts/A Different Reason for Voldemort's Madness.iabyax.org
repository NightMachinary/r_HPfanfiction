The teenaged Tom Riddle we see in canon is calm, composed, and charismatic, hiding his darkness from all but the most perceptive. Despite being a seemingly Muggle-born orphan, he's able to not only survive but thrive in Slytherin, gathering followers from old, powerful families. Fast forward to his second attempt at the Defense post, and he's already allowing his inhumanity to show and not nearly as controlled in his manner. By the time of the books, he's gone full (lack-of-)mustache-twirling cartoon villainy and megalomania.

Most people that address this decline in mental stability seem to attribute it to his loss of humanity from making Horcruxes, with some putting it down to dark magic in general or to spending a decade as a disembodied wraith. Another possibility occurred to me, however:

Tom Marvolo Riddle spilled the blood of his own kin.

By the morality of many cultures, particularly in the ancient world, kinslaying was one of the most heinous of crimes. In at least some interpretations, the Furies of Greco-Roman myth would punish transgressors in a variety of ways /including madness/. What if, in the Potterverse, those myths hold at least some truth, and the killing of family invokes a curse of madness? Maybe further crimes of sufficient severity (such as drinking unicorn blood) worsen the curse?


** I don't see that explanation appear that often if fics, but I always thought Voldemort never "truly" changed. He always was that caricaturesque villain we see in canon, but was forced to wear a mask at school in order to not lose his follower, or be sent to Azkaban.

Once he became a Dark Lord, charm and diplomacy became useless to his plans, so he just discarded them (though I always liked the way he interacted with his followers, as if he was putting a show for them).

** That might be reason but I think the most important reason for his decline in humanity might be due to the causes surrounding his birth. Love as Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn have noted is the most powerful and unpredictable magic which can various effects. Voldemort lineage has already been attributed to close inter marriages which have lead to mental and physical defects in later generations prior to Voldemort's lineage. His birth was the final trigger as love from his mother was artificially coerced with a muggle nonetheless. As a result, the adverse effects of obsessive love may have lead him becoming a monster from the time he was born.

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that Voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his non-ability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- *but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.*

  J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union. [1]

******* yes but plenty of people do grow from experinces messed up

also tom grew up in an orphanage where might makes right so he used his magical abilities to be at the top of the food chain and then he went to hogwarts and got sorted into slytherin as someone who would have belived to have been a muggle born so once again he had to showcase his might.

everyone reacts differently from trauma and abusive childhoods while toms birth is tragic I would wager the abusive orphanage shaped his mindset and then being throw into slytherin reinforced it

******* He's a sociopath. He isn't like a lot of other kids. Being devoid of a loving family and friends only made it worse. He's the extreme example and Harry, growing up in a loveless household as well, turns out more mentally stable but you can still see how it shaped his personality and worldview.

*** I never really liked that reasoning. It feels like an easy way out to explain Voldemort's craziness, I guess? Which is why I like stories that put more effort into trying to explain the descent into madness.

**** Well perhaps if Tom Riddle raised him then he might be different but then again the psychopathic tendencies present within Salazar Slytherin's descendants would have manifested at some point if not combine it with his fear of death, his desire to be detached from his humanity leading him to having no relationships of any healthy kind. Mostly relationships with Voldemort were parasitic of a kind...also combine that with his unusual circumstances surrounding his birth then yeah he was evil incarnate... I mean imagine a guy who has gone their entire life without getting laid... he's as rotten as it gets..

****** Ah I see well a person like Voldemort is not some character whose mind u can study he's for all intent and purposes evil. Dumbledore has noted “Voldemort has moved beyond usual evil”. A more interesting character study would be a complex villain like Gellert Grindelwald with his layers of complexity on top of each other...

he doesnt have any decline in mental stability tho.

  "Yes, I think so," said Dumbledore. "Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, *his brain and his magical powers remain intact.* It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.

  The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes. . . . He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. .

  “Nice costume, mister!”

  He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and ran away . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand . . . One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .
