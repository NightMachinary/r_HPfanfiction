I've seen a lot of fics where Harry finds himself going to school with Tom Riddle. In most of these, Tom isn't really /good/ but he is redeemable. Or, he is evil, but Harry is dark too and they starts making out. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind those docs (okay, I love them) but I would really like something where the charectorization of Tom is closer to canon and Harry does not align with him. They don't have to actively fight each other but Harry can't join him.

I don't care about pairings, bashing, etc.


** There's a Harry/Bellatrix where he travels to when she was young and sane and riddle is on the rise [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

** In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11270490][you belong to me (i belong to you)]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Child_OTKW/pseuds/Child_OTKW][Child_OTKW]]) Riddle is horrible and Harry absolutely hates his guts. It's not finished yet but it is highly unlikely Riddle will get any kind of redeeming qualities.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

**** Hey, I've actually read this one before! I completely forgot about it. Thanks, though, I don't think I ever finished it -- I think I'll revisit it.
