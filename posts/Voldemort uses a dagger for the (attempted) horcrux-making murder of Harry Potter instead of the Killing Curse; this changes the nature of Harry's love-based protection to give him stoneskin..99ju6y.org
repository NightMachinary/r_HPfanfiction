I dunno, I don't have any ideas for writing it myself yet. It'd probably work best with Dursleys who try and fail to be bash-worthy abusers or something. A Harry who's invulnerable to petty physical maladies, whether it's falling over or falling out of a tree or being whacked with a frying pan. Maybe a scene where the Bludger Dobby enchants just bounces right off him.


** That makes no sense logically to me. Clearly if Voldemort tried to kill Harry with a dagger, then it would give Harry Dagger-based protection.

** I saw a fic once where Harry was invincible because he had the same protections that make a horcrux nearly indestructible, but I can't remember the title.

#+begin_quote
  At seven, Harry stumbles out of the car crash that killed his uncle despite the fact he should be dead. It is at this moment that he discovers that, unless a very specific weapon is used, he cannot suffer injury, he cannot feel pain, and he cannot die. Harry proceeds to abuse the hell out of this. A lot. Black comedy, dark, some bloody scenes, Harry/Ginny eventually

** This would be funny.

It's a bit far fetched as even after being cursed Harry hasn't got any magical resistance but it would be funny.
