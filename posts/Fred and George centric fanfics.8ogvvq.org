I've been missing the twins lately, so I'm wondering whether there are any fanfics about them?

I've read Crossing Lines and loved it (I don't know how to link it sorry). Are there any similar fanfics like this?

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano might be something you'll be interested in.

Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasley's so this fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

****** Perhaps because Percy is easier to write for as readers tend to know of his personality and circumstances as well as his relationships with the others compared to Bill and Charlie.

When you think about it, other than Ron and Ginny, the others arent written about as much

********* - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This features Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey creating their own Underground Railroad to help smuggle muggleborns out of Britain.

- I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. These are my most favorites.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916711/1/Accidental-Switch][Accidental Switch]] by Myra109 is a bit over on the dark side of the spectrum and is very graphic at times. Not the best writing in the world, but the story itself is different. Basically, potion mishap with Percy and Fred switching bodies. It focuses on the Twins relationship with Percy. linkffn(11916711) Status: Complete
