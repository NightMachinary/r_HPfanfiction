I'm trying to find a fanfic where Harry ends up in Azkaban (preferably where he is actually guilty, not just framed) and ends up having a relationship with Sirius. I don't just mean like romantic or sexual either (although it's not like I'd turn those down) just where they talk and stuff. even if they don't really get along at first. I also like lengthy fics, but I know it's already a pretty tall order so it doesn't really matter. any suggestions would be much appreciated ðŸ˜Š

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
