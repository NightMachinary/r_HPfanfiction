*** I think it's because it's a very superficial skim of longer fanfics, at least by my reading - I've read 20/21 of them and I don't ship more than half the ships mentioned.

That said, I also don't think Harry Crow is terrible. I don't think robst-type stories deserve the hate they get around here. They're enjoyable to some people. When I want a long fic with guaranteed little to no egregious failures in spelling/grammar and decent-ish plot, I'll go Crow or HPMOR (sometimes also Heir of Corvus, if I can find a copy sneaking around.)

I'm cool with the fact that I don't agree with the majority of people around here, I just think that sometimes the hate gets a little excessive. Not that you're being excessive, OP, just reminded me of some people who are ;)

**** The problem I have with robst is that his stories are blander than white bread. If robst's stories where a sandwich they would be a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_sandwich][Toast Sandwich]].

The bad guys are stupid and easily beaten, the good guys (Harry/Hermione/et al) are super powered and morally unimpeachable.

It's a good thing that his stories aren't tagged as romance because they don't /have/ romance in them. Two characters just suddenly being together, does not a romantic fic make.

I've never read a story of his that ever felt satisfying. If you were to map out the rising and falling drama in a robst story, the only thing with a flatter line would be a corpse.

The worst part about it all is that his stories are not only technically well written, often have really interesting premises. A Harry that was raised by warrior goblins could be so awesome, but now it's just meh. It's honestly a shame.

***** First off, thanks for articulating that. I'm about to head off to bed after a sleep-deprived exam day so I'm not at my finest.

And I think this is what I sometimes (not always) like about robst's stories. When I want a long, plain fic to keep me vaguely entertained (or not bored, if that is clearer) without offending my sensibilities by reading like it was written by someone who flunked out of Grade 4 English, that's what I'll read. (My emphasis on spelling is just personal taste. My suspension of disbelief goes from 100 to 0 the first time I see something like Pavarti, Hermoine, McGongall, Dursely, you get the idea.)

His stories have just enough aptitude - technically, as you said, and with some decent plot ideas - to keep me entertained. I agree that it's a shame that they didn't come out better, but I think the lack of tension and defined plot rise/falls doesn't quite justify the level of outright hatred and disdain around here, which was effectively my point.

Yeah, I have to agree with that. Some of his stories do have interesting premises, so you do start to read ... and then there's no actual conflict because suddenly the good guys are so perfect and can't be inconvenienced by anything so everything just goes their way.

So his ... whatever, is good, but then you get to the part when the whatever is supposed to become an actual story with conflict and head meets desk.

And that's just darned sad because the ability to actually include conflict in his stories isn't some sort of magical ability he hasn't, everyone can add conflict to their works, so it's just him being either that blind or that stubborn and something that could have been good suffering for it.

Harry Crow suffers from the same issues that the Denarian Renegade suffers from. HPMOR suffers from better than thou syndrome which if we are being honest, can apply to sooo many fics. Im also fine with not being of the same opinion as everyone else. But it also is really confusing to me as to why the opposing opinion exists.

No offense, but you're delusional. Maybe if Denarian spent all its time senselessly bashing characters with the main holier than Jesus main pairing proclaiming the superiority in all aspects of life of the Goblin Nation, then yeah, you'd be right.

******* I think that we are using different senses of the word bashing. when I use it I'm referring to the author setting up the story in such a way that a character, Dumbledore for example, will be holding the idiot ball and doing stupid or horrendously out of character things like love potioning and obliviating all of Hogwarts because Harry got sorted into Slytherin or something like that. From what I remember of Denarian, it was closer to Harry being a condescending asshole because he's a one-dimensional condescending asshole.

In terms of the best Dark Harry fic, I think I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] the most because it does a really good job of portraying that slippery slope into fiendfyring children sort of thing. Any suggestoins for other ones?

Possibly. My definition of bashing is whenever a character is treated as if they are less than another character. In my mind, the characters are all speaking with the author's voice so hearing Harry call Dumbledore a useless old goat is bashing him. If that makes sense?.. either way, I like that we can have this conversation without either of us hating the other...lol

I think there's a big difference between bashing from the author's perspective, and a character bashing another. In Denarian, the character Harry "bashes" basically all of the other characters - but it's mostly just Harry being an asshole, as his character is. The other characters aren't /written/ to be awful one-dimensional characters who exist only to be bashed. In fact, from what I remember some of the other characters, including Dumbledore were pretty damn well written in the Denarian series.

*** While I'm not sure I'd pick that as the best fan fiction story around, I will say that anything that gets people reading fan fiction is probably a good thing. Harry Crow was the second story I read, after HPMOR. My tastes have changed slightly in the not quite 2 years I've been reading.

I suspect that anyone who starts off their fan fiction journey with Harry Crow, or any other particular story, even something widely acclaimed on here (e.g. The Santi's HP & the Boy Who Lived, A Long Journey Home, etc.) will see their tastes change noticeably if they spend enough time in the fandom.

** Had low expectations for the list coming in, but I actually came out with a couple of new additions to my holiday reading list, :D. Thanks for the link, OP.

Was happy that the Unbroken universe made it to the list. It's one of the few fics I actually re-read from time to time.

*** Is it sad that I've read almost all of those fics?

If Buzzfeed got to them the same way I did, they set ff.net's search to >100k (or >60k) and then pulled random ones.

** They have 11 fics I started and couldn't get through on that list, and then Life and Times.

I'm conflicted as to whether to check out the rest or nope out.

** aww c'mon now. i think anything that gets people reading fanfiction is great, and you have to admit - this is a huge world to get into. i know i haven't even scratched the surface, and i consider myself an old hat at this point. it can be intimidating and a turn off. /Isolation/ and /We Learned the Sea/ are fics I find myself re-reading to this day. luckie1 might be my favorite dramione author, honestly. i don't have much of an opinion about the others - I don't read harmony or much drarry. In the New York Magazine article - [[http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/fanfiction-guide.html]["It's a fanmade world"]] - /The Shoebox Project/ is listed as the must read Harry Potter fic, where I couldn't force myself to struggle through the first half.

i wish there was a better way to collectively somehow create a fanon - something that holds a bit more authority and is a bit more cohesive, which is almost the complete opposite of fannish works in general. it's frustrating! a couple weeks ago, a friend (almost 40, lawyer) hit me up on twitter and asked me about HPMOR, because it was the last thing Aaron Swartz was talking about on reddit before he died, and this was discussed in the new yorker or the economist or something, and he knew i read fanfiction. It was difficult to discuss something so complicated and with so much feeling and history & so many sources, without any of them being...i don't know. weighted.

would it help, to have something like the [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Main_Page][fanlore]] wiki be more heavily promoted, edited, supported? will buzzfeed stop making shitty clickbait if there is an acknowledged authoritative fannish wiki? i don't know, but we gotta do something, otherwise we'll be sitting here complaining about buzzfeed articles until the cows come home.

It's an appealing thought, but I don't know how you'd ever get fanfic writers and readers to agree on what constitutes the "classics" or the core works. Anecdotally speaking, I'm still surprised by the fact that I hadn't even heard of the majority of this subreddit's most often recced fics, and I've been in HP fandom for 10 years.

The fandom's just too vast for any kind of central authority to be representative. HP consists of a variety of separate fiefdoms that speak slightly different languages but all originate from the same source, though it's common for fans to migrate across borders.

And that's without getting into the whole question of quality vs. popularity, two things that rarely coincide...

**** yeah, a centralized authoritative source is not in the spirit of fannish work in general, as i said, it still makes me wish for something more weighted, but i guess i do that already. a story better be the best thing i've ever read if i'm going to go through cached websites or live journal - but i'll accept ao3 recs without question because ao3 is a weighted source in my mind.
