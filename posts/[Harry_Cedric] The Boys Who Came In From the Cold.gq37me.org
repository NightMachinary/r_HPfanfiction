Harry and Cedric are my all-time favorite HP pairing. This fic takes place in Harry's third year and I've made some fundamental changes to the canon for the sake of the story I want to tell (Peter is the true "Prisoner of Azkaban" --- Ron consequently has a new pet!).

Thanks for reading. Feel free to share any thoughts!
