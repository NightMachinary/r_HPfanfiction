Given that the entrance to Ravenclaw is a question and it is the house for kids who value knowledge and intelligence, does anyone else assume that there's at least one student every couple of years who likes to argue with the door?


** Now I have a vivid image of Luna lovegood sitting outside of the door for hours telling the door the answer it wants and then telling it thank you but that answer is actually wrong and the door says it's right and keeps getting more frustrated that some little first year with no shoes is trying to tell them how to do their job.

** Yeah, sure Luna would be one, but I assume she wouldn't be alone. What if, she starts arguing with the door, another student shows up and disagrees with both her and the door, so now it's a three way argument. Soon a crowd of Ravenclaws are gathered, somebody brought popcorn...

OR if the door somehow scales its questions with student year, a fifth year shows up and tells Luna off for monopolizing the door and starts a totally new argument with it.

** I like to headcanon that talking to the door at all means you fail. There's a secret door that goes right in, and Luna is the only one who was quiet, observant, and smart enough to find it. The rest of Ravenclaw is nothing but academic pretention.

*** I don't agree. The trait you are describing seems more akin to cunning or craftiness to me, but isn't Ravenclaw the house of the clever and the knowledge-seeking? It would be strange (at least to me) for the entrance to the house rooms to require traits that aren't the ones that describe the house.

** Logically there are multiple answers to each riddle. I assume that as long as you can defend your answer you're golden. The people who don't get it are people who say answers that the door can't defend without defending said answers themselves. Students likely debate with the door daily.
