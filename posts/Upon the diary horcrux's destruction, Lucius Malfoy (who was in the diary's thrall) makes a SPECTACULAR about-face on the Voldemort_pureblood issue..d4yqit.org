** "Enthralled into a cause of brute force and simpleminded bigotry? Riddle, you are about to learn how a /real/ Slytherin takes his vengeance."

Had I the time to write it, I'd go for the story of how a rich, cunning political wizard would address a threat he knew was coming. Maybe not to the point of the surviving Death Eaters volley-firing Killing Curses across the Little Hangleton graveyard - he /knows/ there are horcruxes after all - but by that time a whole bunch of stuff that Lucius publicly opposed but privately paid bribes for has taken the established Death Eater power base and what hasn't been subverted has been crushed.

And there'd be no sudden public epiphany: political u-turns are highly damaging. He'd be shifting the Overton Window of British Wizarding politics while repositioning himself further left until his own considerably moderated views represent the acceptable limit of the extreme right and then arranging law enforcement in persecuting the /shit/ out of everyone to the right of him.

And when he's /certain/ Voldemort is permanently gone, then the post-mortem smear campaign starts. "The Life and Lies Of The False Lord Voldemort" doesn't just make it quite clear the man was a fraud to dwarf Gilderoy Lockhart, it proves that the cause he espoused was complete horseshit into the bargain.

Draco is encouraged to look among the halfbloods with wealthy muggle relatives - preferably with connections to the peerage - for friends and a possible bride. He can then be positioned as the much more moderate alternative to his father, and the Malfoys remain firmly in the seat of British Wizarding power.

Esprit d'escalier edit: once he figures out who Tom Marvolo Riddle is to Voldemort, he's going to get on Slughorn's case. A /lot/ harder than Dumbledore did, and with plenty of carrot to go with the stick.

The kid is 12.

While the prompt is interesting, most of your bonus points seem off to me because if you want to see Lucius make an abrupt about-face, you would expect him to do it in his slimy, Slytherin way. Except for the one where he seduces a 12 year old. That one is just creepy.

As for the main content, you could use Draco as a lense to see/show what his father is doing without directly covering Lucius.

**** From the context of the comment ("poor Narcissa") I assumed he was talking about Lucius propositioning Harry, not trying to pawn off his offspring.

The latter is still creepy, but several orders of magnitude less creepy.

â€‹

Arranged Marriages is not that exotic of an idea if you take some of the more fannon 'wizarding world culture' notions, and if you want to go down that route magic can be easily used as a solution to the same gender problem. Lucius can easily be portrayed as a character who really doesn't care about his offsprings opinion of a proposed arranged marriage, (or for that matter, sexual preference or opinion on being magically gender bent or having ones preferences magically altered).

I suspect I'd nope out of most fics that try to do this, but I would at least give it a chance if it was written well enough. Any fic that tries to do a serious relationship between a 12 year old and an adult and/or falls into grooming territory is going to be an instant nope/close for me. I don't care how well it is written. (You have magic, you can age shift / time travel / whatever if you want to do these relationships, you don't need to go there).

***** I'm not a fan of Lucius/Harry slash either; the idea of Malfoy proposing to Harry is meant to be an absurd punchline, not a serious premise.\\
When I wrote it, I was visualising stuff 'Lucius proposes to Harry, who promptly runs away screaming', or 'Lucius proposes (etc) and is promptly hexed by Narcissa' or '...and is promptly yelled at by Ginny because she saw Harry first'.

****** It has nothing to do with the pairing. Replace Lucius with McGonagall and you get the same reaction.

I think this is a case of setting something early in the series without changing character expectations. Ginny isn't even a suitor for Harry at this point

Hell, I like Harry/Tonks pairings, but I think they are cannotically six years apart. Not a major problem later, but if someone wrote anything framed with a 12 year old Harry and a 18 year old Nymphadora.... Ugh. You are still at the "you'll get it when you are older" stage.

Anyway, for the effect you are looking for, you would do much better to have Lucius try to 'give' Draco to Harry. Lucius is totally the type to sell off his firstborn for political gain. And at this point, Harry/Draco are much more established characters with a established relationship. One that would sent Harry running screaming.

Plus, you could get the comedic effect of Lucius waving away all Harry's concerns with a "magic can fix that"

** Since the idea on the other subthread won't die, here is a quick attempt at that.

--------------

"Perhaps I should leave" a voice cut through the darkness. "Let you explain the situation to him before I make my presence known".

Harry groggily came to. His eyes were closed, but he recognized where he was. The hospital wing. That means they out, doesn't it?

"If you are truly serious about your change of heart, you will have to make it known to those you would support" said an elder voice. Dumbledore, Harry realized. "Harry here is at the center of it, and deserves to know what is going on".

"As you say, Albus" said the voice. A smooth, silky voice. Wait. Harry recognized that voice.

Harry's eyes shot open. Standing in front of his bed was Headmaster Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy.

"Ahh, I see he is awake" said Dumbledore. "And with quite a story to tell, unless I miss my guess"

Dumbledore's eyes were atwinkle, as if Harry would share his story without additional prompting.

"Professor, what is /he/ doing here?" Harry spat. Or at least he tried to. Apparently whatever healing he had received impaired his motor function.

"Careful Harry, the healing potions will impede you for a while" said Dumbledore. "As for Mr. Malfoy, he came to me shortly after you emerged from the Chamber with quite the incredible story. I think you should hear him out."

Dumbledore arched his eyebrow at Lucius. Lucius, however, seemed content to sit and stare. Eventually, Dumbledore shrugged, and turned back to Harry.

"Mr. Malfoy claims that when he was younger, he began following a Tom Riddle. He would later receive a diary that put him under a sort of trance. He has been in a fog ever since, observing but not fully controlling his actions. He says the fog was lifted shortly before coming to me. He wishes to help destroy Tom Riddle" explained Dumbledore.

"Riddle.. but that is..." Harry muttered.

"Indeed" said Dumbledore.

"But don't you hate muggleborns? Why would you go against.. him?" questioned Harry, he was very confused.

"Riddle" Lucius said, somehow imbuing the word with malice "enthralled me. I do agree with him politically, but that is unforgivable." Lucius paused, looking for an explanation." The Malfoys are no thralls. I suspect Riddle realized I would have objected to his plans".

Harry choked at a comeback. Lucius gained an amused expression at Harry's (lack of) restraint.

"Oh it is true I have no love for Muggleborns. However, there are much more effective ways of instituting change. The ministry is... susceptible to influence. Why would I want to tear it down?" continued Malfoy. "He enthralled me. He used me to attack a school where my own son was attending." He paused. "I want his head."

Harry glanced at Dumbledore, unsure of how to put this. "But sir, can we trust him? I mean he..." Harry trailed off. Thankfully, Dumbledore stepped in.

"Young Harry has a point Lucius. You have claimed innocence before, with the Imperius curse at the end of the last war. Why would we trust you after your involvement in this new plot?" rescued Dumbledore.

Lucius nodded, as if he had anticipated the question. "I was under the thrall when those claims were made, but I do recall them. They are fake, as you must know Dumbledore, many death eaters got off on that excuse." He paused.

After a long minute, he continued. "Well I can give you the information I know. My resources are vast, and you can decide if you trust me enough to use them toward other goals." His gaze turned to Harry. "There are, of course, more traditional methods".

"Traditional... sir?" asked Harry. He didn't like the way Lucius was looking at him. He felt like a piece of meat.

Lucius took a knee at Harry's bedside. "Lord Potter, House Malfoy is in your debt. When you have need of us, you have but call." Lucius held it for a second, then he returned to his feet.

"Of course, there is the other traditional method we can consider." Lucius turned to Dumbledore, expecting him to fill in Harry. However, this time it was Dumbledore's turn to simply stare silently.

Sighing, Lucius continued "Traditionally, a new alliance like this would be sealed with a marriage. Ideally, both lords would have children of marrying age. However, since you have no offspring yet, that poses a bit of a problem". Lucius reared himself up. "However, I luckily have an offspring in the same year as you. If you wish, we can proceed with a traditional commitment".

Harry somehow managed the feat of falling over while laying on his back.

"Dra..Draco?" Harry exclaimed. "But we hate each other!"

"Ahh, that is unfortunate" intoned Lucius. "However, not terribly uncommon in arranged marriages. It shouldn't be a major problem. Should you two not grow to like each other, there are potions that can take care of that. We wouldn't want a marriage signifying our alliance to be spoilt." A look once again came over Lucius, and Harry realized he was thinking over what Harry, being muggle raised, would know. "They are quite illegal to use on someone unsuspecting. We don't want people rewriting peoples feelings without their knowledge. But in a consensual relationship, they are quite allowable".

"But he is a guy!" complained Harry. He wasn't quite sure if he liked girls yet, but he certainly wanted the opportunity to find out.

"Oh, that problem is easier" said Lucius. "Changing preference is as simple as a weekend with your Mediwitch. I'd imagine it is far less painful than your current healing".

Lucius did not seem to be understanding Harry's concerns at all.

"What? No, I don't want to change who I am" answered Harry. That is the end of it! Soon this madness would be over and Dumbledore will explain to him what is going on.

Lucius, however, took it the entire wrong way.

"Hmm. Well, I suppose Draco is still young enough for the sex change ritual. It works best before puberty, but he is not past the point of no return yet." Lucius continued, as if he was talking about a spell to change the weather.

/Wizards can do that??/ Harry thought. Lucius had completely missed the point of his concerns. He was about to shut the idea down entirely, when Lucius continued.

"Your second child would have to carry the Malfoy name, and every even child after that." Malfoy continued on after that, but Harry was unable to listen. An image of a very pregnant Draco had been carved into his mind, and he wanted to puke.

Suddenly Harry broke in. "Professor, what is this mean?" Harry asked.

Dumbledore's eyes just twinkled. "Well Harry, an alliance between you and Malfoy would do much to keep these crazy events from happening to you in the future." Dumbledore took on a contemplative look. "And it would do wonders for house unity."

That was it. It was too much for Harry. He took up off the Hospital bed (with a sheet wrapped around him, because he had apparently been stripped while healing) and ran for the exit of the Hospital wing.

/OUT. I HAVE TO GET OUT. Back to where it all makes sense./

--------------

Draco Malfoy was having a good day. His father was in the castle. Soon, they would have a more sensible headmaster installed into Hogwarts who would help his father's view of the world come to fruition.

Suddenly, one Harry Potter appeared in front of him in the coordinator. He was clad only in a bedsheet. Malfoy's brain took a second to process, but then a grin spread across his face. Oh this was too good. Perhaps Potter would get expelled after this?

"Well well well, what do we have here" Draco started to say, but then Harry did something he didn't expect.

Harry pointed his hand at him, and then he let out a scream.

"AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" the scream got dimmer as Potter ran off in the opposite direction.

â€‹

Draco was confused. Normally, he would appreciate Potter running from him, but he had pointed at Malfoy as if his hair had become a Gorgons. Draco wondered what it meant. Then he shrugged. Whatever Potters problems were, they couldn't have anything to do with him. He would eventually find them out, and then his encounter would be ammunition he could use against Potter.

Draco continued down the corridor looking for his father. This was a good day!

As I mentioned before, I think Lucius is totally the the type to sell his only child into a marriage for a political alliance.
