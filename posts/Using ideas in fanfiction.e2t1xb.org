What are your thoughts on expanding on, and basing, a fic around an already established story, whether abandoned or old, and giving credit to the author? Is it generally frowned upon even with credit(rightly deserved)? I only ask because it is sometimes hard to get into contact with authors for permission. I do realize that fanfic is absolutely a work of art, so plagiarism is terrible. But what are everyone else's thoughts?


** I've always wondered about those who would get upset about this. Is fanfic of fanfic somehow worse or even different from 'pure' fanfic? We're all playing in someone else's universe. Anyone who says that only they get to play in their version of it seems to me to be living in a state of extreme hypocrisy and/or denial.

Besides, I don't think ideas are things that can be stolen to start with. Ideas are cheap and plentiful. It's what you do with them that matters.

***** It's not its rarity that makes me disagree. For instance, I do think that intellectual property laws should not decide which corporations or entities hold control over which fictional universes. Hell, if you remove IP enforcement, frenchise continuations written by ghostwriters or just different writers (e.g. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Thorne][Cursed Child,]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_books][significant chunk of SW content]]) start looking more like fanfiction rather canon.

It's just that 1) there isn't a simple answer that can be deduced from such a notion, especially not one that can be described in one small paragraph; 2) some sense of ownership of the idea should still be preserved, otherwise people in general would be discouraged from spending efforts on coming up with noteworthy original ideas and encouraged to steal such ideas from others.

****** I think ownership should last for a few decades

enough for the creator to make money from, long enough so billon dollar companies cant just wait for a book that is exploding in popularity to hit public domain before cashing in

** There's absolutely nothing stopping you from making a fic of a fic, or taking inspiration from someone else's idea.

That said, politeness demands you at least try to ask permission, and in any case you should link the source in an AN or in your synopsis.

** I would try to get in contact with the writer first to get permission. If you can't get a hold of them, write it then credit them in the notes? You can always take it down if they contact you and are unhappy.\\
Personally I wouldn't mind (either as writer or reader), and have read fics based on others, or sequels to others or alternate endings and I think you may have gotten the gist at this point....
