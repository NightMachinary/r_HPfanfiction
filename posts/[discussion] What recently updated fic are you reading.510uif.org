Is it updated regularly, or are updates few and far between?


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]])

I have a few ones in my list that have been updated more recently, but they're either in other fandoms or I haven't start reading them.

This fic updates every 2 weeks (sometimes a few days late, but nothing really boring).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** I must say, I do like the idea of two antagonists Peggy Sues. And the story has been able to avoid the usual issues of the harem fics so far (I don't like harem fics, usually. Structure reasons).

I hope, however, that the antagonists will be competent enough. It doesn't feel like a bashfic so far, so i'm not too worried about it, but you never know...

Not a prefect fic by any mean (I don't like it's magic and magical theory that much, for instance), but I've been enjoying it immensely so far. Maybe even more than it deserves.

** I am currently LOVING [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][Put Your Curse in Reverse]] by Frombluetored. It's the second in a series of CC compliant fics. It's all canon pairings with Albus/Scorpius but even that is CC compliant with how she did it.

These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend it! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  It was on the tip of Pansy's tongue to tell Weasley to beat it, that she was not so far fallen that she'd shag the likes of him, but, then, she began to think seriously about what sleeping with Weasley would mean. Soon enough, he would sober up, come to his senses, realize what he had done, and then... Pansy grinned in anticipation for what he would promise for her silence.

  They were happy. They were whole. They should have known it was too good to be true. It began with a murder of one, and it culminated in the rise of one of the most notorious serial killers to walk the streets of England since Jack the Ripper was at large. To think, though, that it all began with a bitter heart, a bottle of bourbon, and a very, very sharp knife. [Murder Mystery]

** After checking my email:

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Game by Concept101) updates weekly, and I've been finding quite enjoyable.

linkffn(Divided and Entwined) also updates once a week, and is good as well (I think the author lurks her as well)

linkffn(For the Love of Magic by Noodlehammer) has a lot of interesting ideas, but Harry is a bit Gary Stuish. I'm a sucker for weird ideas though...

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) updates every two weeks.

Lastly: linkffn(Stay Standing by Windschild8178) just updated, but it's very sporadic.

I'm a bit spoiled by the amount of regularly updating fics I'm reading right now. One of the fics I just caught up on is finishing up a 3 month hiatus too...

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

** Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469)

The writing style blows me away. It's like each word is weighed and carefully considered. Every sentence a piece of a perfect puzzle. It's indescribable how amazing it is.

Or maybe I'm just in love with the story and seeing everything through rose coloured lenses...

The author updates quite frequently, if it's on that particular story however... Though he/she did update it twice in August so here's hoping for more regularity.

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.

** Grow Young With Me - You know that one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540175/1/A-Mishap-and-an-Opportunity][A Mishap and an Opportunity]] - A time travely sequel to an independent-metamorph-Harry-and-Tonks fic; I like the Pettigrew in this one (he's not particularly "ratty" or "obviously evil" as in the others...), but it kinda overdoes it with the pranks imo...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12055716/1/Give-Them-Triumph-Now][Give Them Triumph Now]] - Another "Marauders' era" time travel fic, but with only Hermione as the "non-contemporary" character. A really good one too, by the looks of it.

  In 1991, a single Hogwarts acceptance letter sat on Minerva McGonagall's desk with no address. Harry Potter, Location Unknown. Five years later, he is finally found. But he's not what the world had hoped for. Eventual SS/HP, D/s relationship, warnings inside.
