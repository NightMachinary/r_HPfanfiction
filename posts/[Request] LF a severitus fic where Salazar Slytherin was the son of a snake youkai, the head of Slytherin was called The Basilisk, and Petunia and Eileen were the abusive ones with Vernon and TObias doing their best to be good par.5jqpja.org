I started reading this story at work (I'm a Security Guard, 80% of my job is "Stay awake") but they blocked the site I was reading on due to another guard using it for chatting on the forums. I don't remember what it was called, and I'd really like to be able to finish reading it on my days off, as I was really enjoying it.

P.S. Feel Free to just recommend your favourite Severitus fics. I've been hooked since Digging For The Bones.
