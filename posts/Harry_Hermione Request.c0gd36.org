Hi all, I've noticed a trend in the fic I've been reading where all the Harry/Hermione fics I've come across have what is almost super Hermione. Half the time it's like Harry doesn't have any brains or power of his own and that Hermione is perfect or has faults that aren't really faults at all. Is this something that anyone else has noticed or am I alone in this?

I actually now shy away from this pairing because I haven't read a Harry/Hermione fic where I liked how Harry was portrayed.

Thoughts? Recs?


** linkffn(Favorite Things) is a light comedy romance.

linkffn(Error of Soul) is sadly abandoned but the execution of the tired old boring soul bond cliche is done very well + one of better Umbridge in fanficition.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  Wars leave scars. Harry and Hermione indulge their torrid affair in secret, as broken people do, although Harry's feelings for her slowly grow to bewilder them both. While Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny struggle to adapt to post-war life, they soon realize even Voldemort's death doesn't translate to a perfect world, as old bonds are tested to extremes.

** I agree. Hermione definitely had her flaws in canon. She wasn't some sort of super genius. I mean try comparing her to canon Snape and she comes up short. She was jealous a few times in canon. She had no tact. She was a bit narrow-minded.

I actually have nothing against this pairing. I actually think Ginny, Luna, and Hermione could have each conceivably gotten with Harry had circumstances been different. But for it to work would require changes to Hermione, and a more assertive Harry.
