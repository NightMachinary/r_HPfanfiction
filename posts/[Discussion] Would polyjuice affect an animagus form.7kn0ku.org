** I'm assuming your animagus and patronus form is defined by your inner self or soul, so a polyjuice shouldn't be able to change that.

*** Are they confirmed to be the same form? Because Dumbledore being able to transform into a Phoenix would be dope.

**** They /can/ be the same form, but they're not always. Patronuses can change by very strong feelings for someone.

Snape likely wouldn't turn into a doe. I doubt Harry would turn into a stag, or Tonks a wolf.

***** That makes sense. Is there a single animagus who has cast the patronus charm before?

****** McGonagall and James Potter both have the same Patronus and animagus form.

** We know that it affects people's physical traits. All seven Harry's needed glasses. To me, that seems to be the limit: it copies everything non-magical and physical. None of them ever mentioned having scars that hurt, so it seems to be unaffected by anything magical.

I imagine that would apply for other magical properties too, like for instance animagus forms.

Magically, Hermitrix and Rorry would still be Hermione and Ron in any way but appearance and physical condition.

*** What would happen if a potion brewed with hair taken off a person in their Animagus form was drunk by someone else also in their Animagus form at the time.

**** Following the same reasoning, it would be the same as taking the hair of any old animal, since an animagus is physically an animal in every way - and in some magical ways too, considering their immunity to lycanthropy.

EDIT: I suppose it might work if they are the same species, and probably wear off normally - or cause something similar to furry-Hermione if they transform back to human before the effects wear out.

Considering the low number of (registered) animagi, I suppose this wasn't taken into consideration when the potion was invented.

***** Yes, but they're also magically the person, aren't they? The Marauder's Map tags them, for one thing.

And even if it /is/ just the same as taking a hair off an animal, this brings up another question: would it work for a transformed Animagus to take a Polyjuice Potion brewed with animal hair from the same species as their Animagus form?

****** I added an edit. In short, same species may be okay, but transforming back to human before the potion wears out is probably a bad idea.

** really up to the writer. if a writer says yes it opens up a nice tree of possibilities.

imagine for instance if the polyjuice timer was on pause while the form it affects is not present. that would give you 1 hour in polyjuice form divided up however you like. 3 minutes here, 20 there, etc...

** I doubt it. If so, Voldemort would have included it his plans at some point. After all, why send Wormtail out to do his dirty work when he could just take polyjuice to turn himself into Wormtail, and then turn into Scabbers after that?

But hey, whichever way you want to write your story.

*** I think Voldemort is to proud to ever even consider turning himself into a lowly animal like snake. We know that even when he was talking about possessing animals when he had no body he preferred snakes.

**** Good point. Even though turning into a rat would allow you to be really sneaky, it also leaves you pretty vulnerable to predators. But then again, there's a lot of animals that eat snakes, too, so...

Although I suppose the difference there is that when Voldemort was possessing snakes, he hadn't yet returned to his physical form, and I don't think he really cared what happened to his vessel after he'd used it to his own ends.

But tbh, I don't think he would have ever considered using polyjuice on anyone, regardless of whether they were an animagus or not. Not only was having his own body back extremely important to him, I also think he would have considered any other body, human or animal, to be inferior to his own.
