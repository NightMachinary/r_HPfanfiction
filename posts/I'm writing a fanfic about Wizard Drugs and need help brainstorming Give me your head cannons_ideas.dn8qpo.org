** - Something that works like weed
- maybe apart from potions there are a few magical plants you can smoke/eat and work like lsd or so
- maybe a potion that enhances your ability to stay awake to get work done
- maybe some potions that enhance your mind. You can memorize stuff better and do well in school but you get a super headache afterwards.
- a potion that makes you super calm but you also are very apathetic to all things around you
- let him deal with dreamless sleep potion but you get addicted to it

Shit, a super headache, is that all? I would be downing these like candy. Already suffer monster migraines, I might as well get something out of it!

** There are things they use to help them studying similar to Ritalin, Ron and Harry tried to buy something called Baruffio's Brain Elixir from a sixth year, but Hermione destroyed it, Ron also mentioned that powdered dragon claw is supposed to give your brain a boost and strongly increase cunning for a few hours.

I assume that the blood of various magical creatures also works as drugs, from Canon we know Unicorn blood and its healing effect with horrible side effects and we know Re'em blood which gives the drinker increased strength, and for all we know one of the twelve uses of dragon blood could also be as a drug.

Its not really a drug, but cheering charms could probably also be used similarly to them, with the risk of addiction being real.

My personal headcanon is that Wizards dont really use muggle drugs, since they barely work because of wizards resistance to Poisons, and that they need to involve some magic to be truly affected, so a couple glasses whiskey wouldn't be enough to get them drunk, but fire whiskey would.

** Sandman's sand: gives the user the ability to completely control their dreams. Frequent use can cause chronic drowsiness and could possibly lead to a coma.

Black Henbane: produces hallucinations and, interestingly enough, [[https://www.livescience.com/40828-why-witches-ride-broomsticks.html][is probably the reason people associate witches with brooms]]. Henbane is highly toxic and must be taken carefully.

** Cheering charms. A single "hit" is harmless - similar to how chocolate and exercise can elevate your mood. But, at 5 to 7 hits, it can cause significant euphoria.

Arresto momentum. When applied inside the ears (or nostrils? Lol), you can achieve a floaty sensation. Works better while walking.

Neutral amortentia. A love potion not linked to person mixed with a bit of firewhiskey. Slows down perception and motor skills. Causes euphoria and frequent bouts of "oh my gah. I love you." spontaneous Sobbing or giggling fits occur as the concoction wears off.

The Drunk Lion. A student favorite. A result of Lily Evans' attempt to brew veritaserum. Perfect drink for truth or dares and making your crush/friend/significant other confess their true feelings for you.

Draught of Peace. Harmless and useful for anxiety attacks and calming agitation. High doses can cause complete detachment from one's experiences/surrounding/thoughts.

** Jesus, I NEED this fic. It's so hard to find good drug addicted (or even potion prodigy) Harry honestly. I'm interested that you're planning to have him sell them too, though - it's very like him to self-destruct, and to be private and secretive, but it seems out of character for him to intentionally expose others to something that's likely harmful. Although drugs/having with an addiction is known to alter normal behavior so I suppose that might make sense. And it would definitely increase his chances of getting caught, if that's a goal of your fic? Idk I'm very curious what your thoughts are!

As far as ideas for drugs Harry would actually use, I think you've actually pretty well covered what he would look for: happiness/cheering potions for stress and anxiety, which might lead to using the harder stuff you mentioned if he builds up a sort of tolerance. I especially like [[/u/Lord-Potter-Black]]'s suggestions of Sandman's sand, for general nightmares or for self-medicating his connection to Voldemort. That one in particular I think he would abuse to dangerous lengths. Another possibility is trying to get /into/ Voldemort's head to obtain information instead of/as well as trying to lock him out, depending on where you would want to take that.

There was one fic I read a while ago that's still one of my favorites, I'm not sure if you've read it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/Fizz][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou features a Harry addicted to cheering potion with unfortunate consequences and sounds pretty similar to what you're thinking.

Do you have an outline or ultimate goal for the fic, or specific scenes you're wanting to include? That could help narrow down or inspire different ideas for what drugs Harry would be wanting to use or sell and what side effects or complications might come about.

*** If you need a fic to hold you over until OP posts their fic, might I suggest linkffn(8551180) ? In the first story, Harry has an interest in chemistry and often samples his own drugs. He's also a rather sociopathic scientist with extremely stunted social skills. Fun fic tho

** Pain potions probably have a similar affect to opioids.

Polyjuice is also one. It's probably one of the worst considering that fact the a semi competent potioneer can make it with the right supplies. I'd be like porn where one person looks like a movie star except it would be a prostitute who physically is that person.

There's also shit like the cheering charm which sounds fine but is really pretty fucked when you think about it.

** Using a pickle bit of Herbology, if you add a rare moon stone into a sleeping potion, it becomes a purple-ish colour and if you reject sleep in around about 10 min of taking the potion you get as high as a kite.

Think of the ludes scene in The Wolf of Wall Street. Yes that one with the Lambo.

** I think a lot of people, when thinking about wizarding drugs, kinda jump to and focus on potions a bit too much. There is the Cheering Charm, I can imagine there are plenty of spells and charms that illicit the necessary effects on the castor (or you can invent one) that may be used by those who can't afford to buy potions/don't know how. Maybe they're better in effect than potions and are obviously cheaper.

Maybe consider those?

** So magic drugs would be able to have some seriously crazy effects. There are potions that affect the brain in extremely complicated ways, seemingly with very few side effects (take veritaserum, for instance - how does the potion's magic even begin to understand what truth is? not to mention how to entice only it? and how to force the user to answer? all this in a tasteless, odorless, colorless form?). I took the liberty of making up a few.

The Third Eye - a drug that opens someone's "inner eye" forcefully, regardless of otherwise manifested sight. They don't usually speak prophecies, as those seem to be dictated by magic itself, but it can happen (it usually favors a proper seer though). Users become completely trapped in their own mind, seeing possibilities and events playing out with no clear correlation. Withdrawal symptoms include extreme paranoia and panic. It is made by heavily enchanting a centaur's eye.

Hawkeye potion - A substance that sharpens your senses to an incredibly high degree, making you able to hear and see everything to its fullest extent, coupled with a pain reliever so you don't feel the sensory overload. See every pore on someone's face a mile away when you focus on it. Repeated use causes damage to your nerves similar to the cruciatus curse. Withdrawal symptoms are significant worsening of the natural senses beyond their initial state.

Mindscaper Charm - a spell that forcefully descends the user into a pensieve-like trance state. They can recall and experience all they remember. Withdrawal symptoms are worsening of natural memory, as well as short-term memory loss.

Repeated use of the Rennervate Spell shortly before falling asleep - can make you stay awake for nights and days on end, all while never feeling a bit tired. The effects of tiredness, apart from the feeling, still happen. Withdrawal symptoms are long-lasting insomnia which is resistant to sleeping potions.

Sands of Time - if you snort a line of this, time distorts in one of two directions for your mind. Either it moves faster, or it moves slower. The strength depends on how much you took. It doesn't have withdrawal effects, but repeated use makes it so your body starts feeling the accumulated time by aging faster/slower.

Casting a confundus on something consumable - has an effect similar to alcohol, but without making the person sleepy or poisoning them. You just become more and more "drunk" until you're too dumb to eat/drink more.
