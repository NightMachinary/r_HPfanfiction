Does anyone know of a HP ff where Harry is battling Voldie but just as he kills him he is sent back in time?

There is a specific one I'm looking for, though. Harry wakes up as this ghost and is looking down at his unconscious body after killing V. Then he wakes up in hospital wing with shards of Philosopher's Stone in his hands. Finally, he and Shape have a good relationship, Harry has Death and Dark marks, he unlocks his magic via potion and blackmail from Shape, cursed to not be able to say V's name, and self harms.

I hope that was specific enough.


** I will be that one unhelpful comment saying that I have read it but I don't remember the name. Good day
