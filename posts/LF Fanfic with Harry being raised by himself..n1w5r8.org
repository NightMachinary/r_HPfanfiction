Hi I am looking for a fanfiction that has Harry basically raising himself and discovering by himself about his family, his lordships, his estate and vaults. By discovering by himself I mean that I don't want Sirius Black or any other to tell him what he should know or discover by himself. Bonus if Harry is living alone.

Ps : Thanks to JennaSayquah, I must amend my criteria because of my lack of intelligence when I wrote them. When I say that I don't want any one to tell him I mean a professor, an student of Hogwarts or parent of a student of Hogwarts. Gringotts and the goblins are of course excluded and are permitted to inform him. A total stranger is also welcomed to inform him.


** I don't know if this is what you meant.. Linkao3(Beyond the Breaking Point by FalconLux ) Has an Harry Potter raised by another time travelling Harry.

  Certain that he'd been about to die, Harry is mystified to find himself alive and healthy, and somehow in 1981. Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

** Linkao3(Step Back in Time by black_blade ) is great series but it focuses more on the older harry and the changed timeline than the younger harry. MasterOfDeath! Harry

Linkao3(Heru Levant and the Journey Home by HeruKane ) is ok ig. The concept is hood enough. Here too, young harry is a little too young and older harry is extremely superpowered. Like Invincible! Harry

** The hard part of your request is that you want nobody else to tell him anything. Whether it's the goblins, an OC, or whatever, in nearly every case it's a PERSON who gives Harry the initial information. Heck, even in canon Hagrid starts it all by telling him about his parents. I don't really think you'll find many stories that have that have him learning entirely on his own. Unless he's mute, he's going to be talking to others and learning from them.

Stories that come close to your request:

- Harry Potter and the Hidden Kingdom by QuibbleMeThis (unfinished). Harry learns everything from a trunk left in his vault, and comes as close to living on his own as possible while still living with the Dursleys. linkffn(12534241)
- The Cry of Freedom Series by Ian Hycrest (in progress). Harry finds a trunk from his parents in the Dursleys' attic, containing journals and a secret hideout. First story linkffn(13315643)
- This one is another loophole: his older self gives him a diary. Diary of Time by joemjackson linkffn(12624339) (The writing is rough but it's a good story.)

Other stories that have some elements of your request:

- Tale of a Tail by birdwoman95. Harry lives on his own but gets initial info from goblins and a healer. linkffn(11651617)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/887097][Harry Potter and the Consequences of a Trip to the Library in Pjrimary School series]] by TheWizzard (in progress). First story linkao3(12915570)
- Harry Potter and the Way of Things by RavenBlackWillow (in progress) linkffn(13805266)
- Elementary Calculations by kcourtkat (unfinished) linkffn(4226870)
- Harry Potter and the Duke's New Clothes by TigerShark (unfinished but story outline included) linkao3(1515578)
- Harry's Enemies List by Beepkeeper. Another with rough writing but a good story. linkffn(12770074)

I'm going to stop here because this is already going to have a wall of botlinks.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.
