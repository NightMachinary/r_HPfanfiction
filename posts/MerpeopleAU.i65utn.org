So I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole this morning and am wondering if anyone knows of any HP fics with this premise

Am cool with all pairings


** This isn't totally about just merpeople, but the main character is half mermaid half human. There are 2 other books after this one and is connected to another universe this author created.

**** Very true. I think it'll be safe to start with skinny dipping though and go from there.

** There's a REALLY good fic called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13124008/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gemini-Curse][Harry Potter and the Gemini Curse]]

It's a HP x Marvel crossover, but not super Marvel-y, just has some of the characters but it all takes place in the HP universe.

Anyway they have cool ideas about Merpeople and also Druids and overall just a REALLY good fic.

I've been trying to get more people to read it because I honestly think it's a hidden gem.

Please tell me if you decide to read this!

**** Canon.

Some people are just incapable of looking over to a neighbouring fandom and stealing the most sensible ideas.
