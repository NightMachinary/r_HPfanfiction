** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Very different Slytherin Harry. He gets sorted there because his greatest ambition is to survive after he died and respawns multiple times already. He stays a good guy, even saving hundreds of lives, although he uses some rather ruthless methods Dumbledore wouldn't approve of in the final battle to kill all the Death Eaters.

Since his main priority is to survive he really isn't happy with his sorting into the house filled with enemies.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

Similarly, I'd just like more "Harry has a pet snek (or is a snel animagus), nothing else too major" fics.

The vast majority of snek-fics end up as lemony slashes with Snape, Voldemort, or Draco, with not enough focus on the snek.

The few that don't tend to end up being Slytherin-House political dramas, and of the only three I know of that escaped that, one was */amazing/* but was abandoned right before the sorting (it had a couple hundred thousand words of his childhood first), and one is either abandoned or updating really damn slowly...

All curses are Dark magic and Harry knows plenty of other spells to subdue a threatening wizard. He used one all the time against Voldemort. Going out of your way to torture someone or use a spell 'for enemies' when you've known stunning and disarmimg spells for years means you have a dark side.

But Harry deliberately tortures Carrow, using an Unforgivable curse, prompted only by Carrow disrespecting McGonagall (spitting in her face). He doesn't stun Carrow to get him out of the way - he intentionally tortures him /with the darkest torture curse we know of/. Say what you will about heat of battle or retribution, that was frankly unnecessary.

I think the whole point of Rowling including that moment was to demonstrate how it becomes easy to justify using what you'd otherwise consider "Unforgivable" when it's war. Just like Harry using the Imperius curse to break into Gringott's. Those are not supposed to be admirable actions, they are supposed to make us wonder about the dubious morality our protagonists slip into. Maybe it doesn't make Harry dark, but it also isn't excusable.

********* Flip it around. He is humble. Because he knows he is better then everyone else. Always has been at anything he set his mind too. But being arrogant never served him from getting mentally abused by the Durseleys. But instead being humble allowed him to reach his goal of going to school and ditching the jackasses behind. And by presenting this front to everyone, he manipulates them to how he wants to be perceived. At the end same time he isn't evil. He just has a goal of never being put in a position at being at someone elses mercy. He wants freedom but at the same time he has sympathy for everyone who is in the same situation that he himself found himself in. So the best way to do this is to be a leader and try to make sure others don't experience what he has. He needs to have a core motivation and ethos that fits Slytherin without going into standard tropes. He won't risk his neck to save some gryiffindor. That wouldn't help the greater good he wants to do. At the same time he isn't studying because he enjoys it. But is studying because he was 1 goal. The flip side is the hat wanted to put him in Hufflepuff because of this also. That would be a background type that would work without going into standard herp a derp dark spell tropes in my opinion.

A source of conflict aside from Voldemort is Dumbledore getting a reminder of young Harry being just like Grindelwald in some of his aspects, and Riddle in others. Or at least what Dumbledore interprets as it. But at the same time Dumbledore is not a schemer. He is just an old man who runs a school. Want to see his students succeed and not make the same mistakes he made over the decades. He knows he can't save everyone. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try.

To further expound when I was 10, one thing I absolutely despised was having my privacy invaded. Still do to this day 30 years later. Its possible for someone that young to set a goal if he is self aware. Or another example. I had a neighbor, who from the time he got his pilot license at the age of 11 wanted to become and Air Force pilot. He set his goal to do this. Made the Air Force academy, became an f22 pilot and is a Lt Col. in the airforce now. The point is that being that young it is possible to have mental goals that you set for yourself if you want to do something bad enough.

The only thing you would have to avoid is having it get too political at the start. He has a core notion of what he wants. But is young and doesn't understand how to reach that goal except with some instinctional reactions he has to manipulating people to do what he wants them too.

I'm not. In the context of magic, Dark means using Dark magic aka curses, poisons, etc. Not harming non DE's and bullies. That can be achieved without curses and poisons. It's why the "Dark, but not evil" descriptor exists.

Not Dark =/= good person

** I remember reading a fic where Shorting Hat decides to actually short the kids into places they belong to instead of obeying where they want to go. Hermonie and Harry go to Slytherin, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle go to Hufflepuff, Draco goes to Griffindor...A fic where Shorting Hat actually shorts people for their personality traits.
