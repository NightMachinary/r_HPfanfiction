** Why would she be called out for her behavior about Scabbers? It's a miracle he wasn't killed be an owl by that point. Ron never keeps him in a cage, he's just allowed out where ever he wants to be, why can't Hermione's cat be?

And while callous, she wasn't deriding the rabbit. But I agree someone should've said something to her about it.

Edit: because you guys are too lazy to actually read this discussion before just downvoting this, I feel I have to say that I agree Hermione is rude. The problem is Ron HAD NO PROOF.

*** Disclaimer, I like Hermione as a character, but I do have issues with some of her actions. A big thing with Hermione is that she should have apologized for Scabbers as Crookshanks was out to get him. Now Ron admittedly should have put him in a cage, but Hermione was rude about it and prevention went both ways. Scabbers being a murderer does not excuse her lack of consideration as she had no knowledge of it. She did something similar near the end of HBP with the potions book.

**** I do agree. I like Hermione, but her canon characteristics are annoying. The problem is there was no way to know what 'killed' Scabbers. Ron went straight for Hermione and the cat.

******* Not to mention, some of theblager types of toad are preditors, and have been known to eat small mammals. Trevor could have easily have eaten him as well, should he get a bit bigger

Ron keeps Scabbers either in his dormitory, where he had been safe for two years, or else in his robe pocket. That's not nearly the degree of free range that Crookshanks gets.

*** She brought the cat into the boys room even after she knew he tries to eat her friends pet. That is a huge no-go.

******* Indeed given how strongly Ron reacts to animals trying to eat his rat we would have heard about it if it happened.

Nice how you call common sense reaching for straws. Says a lot about you
