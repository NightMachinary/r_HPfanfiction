:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Years ago, I remember reading a fan fiction on AO3 (I think) where the plot was, more or less, as follows:

- The world is a non-magical world pressed up against the magical one.
- Hermione is a scientist/researcher trying to understand parallel worlds.
- Bella was her friend and fellow researcher before Bellatrix from canon took over her body and ensured that she was locked up in a psych ward.
- Hermione's friend or neighbour is Tom Riddle whom she starts to fall for.
- During sex with good-Tom, Voldemort from canon inhabits his body and terrifies Hermione.

I cannot, for the life of me, remember the name of this fanfic and no matter how I search for it, I can't find it. Does anyone know the title of it, or if it's even still around?


** For anyone else looking, it's linkao3(849413).

OP, I absolutely loved this fic. Thanks for introducing it to me!

  Sometimes, spying your your rather attractive neighbor can be a good thing. In Hermione's case, it has lead to a new friendship, helped her come out of her shell, and has even helped her get her first date in years. But there is more to Tom Riddle than meets the eye, and Hermione isn't sure if she likes it.
