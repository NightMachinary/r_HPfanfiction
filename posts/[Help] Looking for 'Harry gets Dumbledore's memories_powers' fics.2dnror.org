I'm looking for *completed* fics where Dumbledore transfers his memories and or powers to Harry at the end of HBP or at some other time. Already read /The One He Feared/ by Taure and /In Light of Silver Memories/ by Taliath. Preferably following canon to an extend. Thnx!

  An Alternate Universe seventh year story picking up immediately after HBP. Dumbledore leaves Harry an interesting legacy. A bit of humour, some action, even a bit of angst and romance. Includes my guesses for DH some were close!.

**** Unfortunately it isn't, but enough of the plot points are wrapped up that it's acceptable.
