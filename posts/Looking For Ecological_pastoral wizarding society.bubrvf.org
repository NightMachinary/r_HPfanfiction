Wizards seem to live a lifestyle which is rather closer to nature than modern Western society. Their main recreational pursuits take place outdoors, they tend to live in remote rural areas, they lack industrial scale production and do not need things like fuel, electricity, roads, etc. They enjoy growing plants and rearing creatures.

With all that in mind, I am looking for fics in which wizarding society is depicted with an ecological/pastoral aspect, or fics with ecological/environmentalist themes.

To be clear, fics in which wizarding society is depicted as "backwards" are not what I'm looking for (pet peeve alert).


** As an example of what I'm looking for, see chapters 13 & 14 of my own fic Victoria Potter (summer between first and second year):

  The Muggle world felt wrong.

  Hogwarts was filled with nooks and crannies, hidden alcoves and spiral staircases, but everything was neatly rectangular at Number Four, Privet Drive. The anemic electric lights were a pale imitation of a flickering, crackling fire, and the front garden was little more than a patch of grass, not a single blade out of place, its perimeter brimming with meticulously arranged flowerbeds. Just like everything else in the Muggle world, there was nothing wild there, nothing truly alive.

  Claustrophobia was setting in, and Victoria found herself longing for wide, open spaces---forests and valleys and sprawling castles perched atop tall cliffs. Little Whinging's park offered some respite, but even that felt cramped, the busy road never out of sight. She was therefore jumping at every chance to leave the house, accompanying Petunia on trips to the bank, post office or the shops.

  When they weren't out and about, she was put to work in the garden, weeding, watering and planting new flowers. It was awfully dull compared to herbology---the Muggle plants didn't even fight back when you pruned them---but under Victoria's magical touch the garden had blossomed to become the envy of the neighbourhood. As word spread, Petunia's friends began visiting for afternoon tea with increasing regularity.

  "Never seen roses that colour before," they would say, "bright purple! A new breed, is it?" Or: "Tulips in July! Well I never!" No doubt Petunia suspected that Victoria was doing something unnatural, but she seemed content to feign ignorance so long as the garden continued to draw admiring comments from the members of the Little Whinging Garden Association.

  For her part, Victoria hadn't intended to use herbology---it had just slipped out, an instinct that was difficult to control. She wasn't even sure if she could tell the difference, now, between magical and non-magical handling of plants. Was stamping on the soil to summon worms magic, or was that something Muggles did too?

*** Man, everytime I read your work I'm struck that very few authors, you and Newcomb as exceptions, manage to capture a whimsical feeling to HP magic. Well done dude!

** I can't recommend a story but I do remember thinking that what we see in HP1-7 is just a small fraction of what's really out there coz everything was seen through Harry's eyes. There could be many isolated groups of non-Hogwarts & non-Ministry affiliated witches and wizards who never really bother themselves with the rest of society. I mean if I had magic, that's what I would do.

** There used to be a story of somebody hiding from Deatheaters at a magical farm. Description of the magical argiculture etc. But I cannot find it. Perhaps somewhere in Ireland? Either Seamus family or somebody's surprising (Goyle?). Does it make sense to somebody?

** I really enjoyed reading about the way that this author's OC, Theophanny Knapp, lived: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374]]

The story is split between her POV and Snape's POV.
