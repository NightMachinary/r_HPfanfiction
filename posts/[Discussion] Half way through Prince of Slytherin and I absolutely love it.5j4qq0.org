** I also discovered it recently and very much enjoyed it; it's nice that it's a currently updating fic with a decent chance of actually being finished, though I expect it'll be a long time before that's the case.

Without giving any spoilers, I will say that as the story goes on, the author is doing an excellent job of fleshing out the HP universe, including cultures outside of Magical Britain and those have been some of my favorite parts so far. I've been impressed with how the author manages to explain away some of the deficiencies in the original story line by creating new, believable forms of magic.

I've seen some discussion on the subreddit about whether the story actually provides believable reasons for using those tropes. People appear to have strong opinions on both sides about that, so you might see some people disagreeing with your claim (though personally, I agree with you) :)

You've hit one of the two big reasons why I love the fic.

The world building is ridiculous. There are constant references to the wizarding world outside of Europe, as well as different types of magic (that all realistically fit into what we know about the nature of magic). Meanwhile, the culture of Wizarding Britain is also expounded upon.

I also like how in-depth the author goes into the magic system (different types of spells, the origin of magic itself, non-spell-based cultures, magical "talents" (occulmency, legimency, parsletongue, etc.), divination and prophecies).

** Is there some place to talk about this story? I have a lot of theories about what could come, and the DLP thread is kinda dead/inactive.

** You know i got turned off by the bad!tropes he was playing way too straight at the start, although i appreciated certain scenes like acting all badass against Snape in the first lesson got called out. Still it is hard to imagine 11-year-old Harry Potter acting all Logical, Rational and a little Aloof. Sorry, but HPMOR soured me on that premise and it really asked me to suspend my disbelief a lot to enjoy that story

Still i did take a peak and just skimmed through the chapters here and there and what little i caught of competent! Lockhart I approve. Still, it is increadibly long and wordy at 500k words and it has just barely started on the third year. For reference, the main series is about a million words total and the first 2 books are about 160k combined, so really, i think the author has too much to say

*** They actually address his mental thought process in the story. It goes from call outs on some words he says and how he talks to actually giving it a reason for being the way it is.

**** Different strokes for different folks.

In your eyes, it may be one of the best, but in another person's, it could be the worst. I personally couldn't get into it. It's the same with Stealing Witches and Dodging Prison -- just couldn't get into the story long enough to be hooked.
