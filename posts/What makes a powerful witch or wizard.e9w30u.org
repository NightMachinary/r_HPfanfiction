JK Rowling wrote a whimsical magical system, not a logically consistent or rigorous one. What do you think are the blockers to becoming a Merlin/Dumbledore/Voldemort level of wizard? Either your most canon compliant theory, your favorite fanfic fanon, or your personal headcanon.

Does it just come down to incantation memorization, wand movement muscle memory, and list of known spells? Are magical cores a thing? Is there a level of will power inherent in casting magic that increases the power of spells? Is creativity and quick thinking the most important way to win a duel? Knowledge of obscure and hidden curses?

I'm interested in what you think fits with canon and what you enjoy in fanfiction. Whether those are the same or not.


** You have to read the theory and get the practical with ease but also take it further and be able to apply it to different things and understand why you can do that.

Basically if you combine Harry's understanding and instincts, Hermione's knowledge, and apply Harry's natural ease with defensive/offensive/protective spells to all subjects you get Dumbledore.

To me that describes a smart/skilled wizard, not a strong one. When I think of a strong wizard I think more of "A /diffindo/ can cut through solid Diamond/a mountain/something ridiculous like that".

I'm not sure if the concept of strength can be applied properly.

Voldemort could've been naturally gifted, or have a way of thinking which allowed him to understand magic easily, maybe even being in a difficult situation as a child might have played a role (becoming strong with magic as a defensive strategy as a child). Of course, to be a wizard on par with Voldemort or Dumbledore, being a natural genius isn't enough. Both of them were extremely driven and hard working as well.

Lets take Wingardium as an example. A first year has trouble levitating a feather, while a trainee adult can levitate greater things, and a dumbledore-level one could potentially levitate hundreds of kilos (to say something)

That comes from knowledge of the spell then and your own magic. I get that. I don't get the mechanics of it, I guess.

Edit: Now that I think of it, the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the MoM shows us than people on their level don't really need formal spells anymore (except for the unforgivables), they just know how to make whatever effect they wish.

****** It's not a great comparison because he is unique, but the best example of a “powerful” wizard is Credence. He hasn't been trained with a wand but still is able to exert powerful magic in FBCoG. Young Tom Riddle is another example, where his natural skills over his wandless magic at such a young age shows his strength. This natural ability is what I think of as “power”, natural strong magic, that probably comes from controlled but extreme emotions.

Dumbledore's magic always seemed more “great”, as is Voldemort's, definitely powerful but with the most advanced understanding I think this helps them exert extreme power.

He didn't rise to the top of his class. He did somewhat better than Hermione in one subject, losing out in every other. In that subject---DADA---nerve and quick thinking have everything to do with it. It doesn't matter how good you are at the Boggart-Banishing Spell (Riddikulus), unless you /also/ have the presence of mind under pressure to identify the boggart /and/ the nerve to come up with a joke on the fly and cast the spell. Boggarts, incidentally, were tested in both 3rd year and OWLs. Ditto the Partonus Charm against a dementor. (Also, if you look at the dialogue from the OWL exam, Harry may have been the only one offered "bonus points" for the Patronus Charm in the first place.)

Did you even read the second half of that sentence before cutting it? I know it was a long one, but please do take another look. Facing a boggart, you have to remember that it's actually a boggart and think of something funny before you can even begin to cast a banishing spell; facing a dementor, you need to access the very feelings the dementor is suppressing before you can even cast the Patronus.

Combat-related magic doesn't come to Harry any more easily than to Hermione (since the post was specifically comparing the two of them), but he is better suited at applying it in the middle of actual combat, as a result of his personality and athletic talents.

Hermione believes in the rational and logical and believes herself to be that way. Harry runs on instinct and emotion. The former has the theory down, but struggles to understand that magic doesn't work that way. It's why she denies the very existence of Hallows.

Hermione doesn't /forget/ the Patronous charm requires a very happy memory. That's selling her very short.

Harry and Hermione practiced the same spells in book 4 and 5. Harry could cast them better than she could. Hermione herself says so. You should probably take her word for it.

Combat =/= defense. Once again, you are conflating dueling (which includes transfiguration) and simply casting a DADA spell. If athleticism and personality was the most important thing in casting defensive spells, Ron would've been top of the class with Harry

** Emotion seems to be a key factor in magic, as well as content/desire/want.

You have to want to kill someone, you have to desire/want to torture someone in order for it to work.

In my mind, Accidental Magic is just Wandless Magic, not practiced by. Many accidental magic moments seem to happen while having a very strong emotion like happiness, anger or fear.

And, kids can't handle their emotions like adults can, so their accidental magic unleashes because of it.

If you can control your emotions, or use them in just the right way, you could potentially become as great and powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort.

I think that might be why something like the Patronus is such a difficult spell to master, you often use it while you are feeling fear, or desperation, emotions that doesn't come easily.

Harry was able to use Lumos, when Dementors came into Privet Drive, Harry was able to use Patronus when he was surrounded by Dementors and thought of Ron and Hermione. Emotion is a very important factor, I feel.

Of course, this is just my thoughts on what magic is, I could be very wrong on the matter, that's just my own thoughts on it.

**** Given that nonverbal/wandless spells exist, I'm wondering if any spells at all truly /need/ their verbal, somatic, and material components (incantation/wand movement/wand), to borrow D&D terms. I've always suspected that the combination of theory + V/S/M components was a shorthand for bottling and codifying intent.

Like, the levitation spell for example:

- The Theory: this combination of words and wand movements cause things to float
- The words: Wingardium Leviosa
- The wand motion: Swish and flick.

So, if a wizard says "Wingardium Levios" and swish-and-flicks their wand at a target, the one and only thing they're *intending* to do is make the object levitate, with the full expectation/faith that it will, in fact, levitate when they do this.

A powerful wizard, then, might be someone who takes these pre-packaged spells, is able to distort them on the fly, and is able to execute them and his will with the same level of expectation that it will work. That is, if Dumbledore can cast spell A, he can cast spell modified-A that he created on the fly, and because he expects it to work just as well as A, /it does./

Like, a baby /could/ transfigure you into a pile of gold, if they knew what gold was or could conceive of you spontaneously becoming a pile of gold. But a child knows that people don't normally turn into gold, so they don't believe it will work, and so it doesn't. Spells are just promises that something does work to placebo wizards into being able to do it. And then you get wizards who are a little bit "mad," like Dumbledore, and don't have as strong grasp on reality as, say, a scientist, and they can do so much more than the average wizard.

***** My take on this is that the spell itself (those verbal, somatic, and verbal components, or really everything codified in the spell) aren't really necessary if you know enough about the theory. I mean that, with high enough a knowledge of magic and it's rules, they become unnecessary.

For some spells, however, such as the unforgivables, or the patronus, the threshold is simply too high, and nobody can realistically reproduce the effects without a formalized spell. Some special circumstances seem to make it possible, for instance when Molly deals with Bellatrix, but in this case it's really a one off thing, and it's very rare. Almost negligeable although it does exist.

It would mean that, when you reach high enough a level of proficiency with a spell, you can learn to forgo some of the requirements (or components) and even likely tweek it in all sorts of ways to alter its behaviour. For instance, when casting the shield charm, instead of a magical barrier, you could conjure an actual, physical shield, as Voldemort does when battling Dumbledore in the MoM if memory serves.

In that case, non verbal casting, or the degree of liberty you have to modify the spell, and other such things would be but a step in the true mastery of the field of magic the spell represents, true mastery being to forgo the spell entirely and simply make the thing happen.

It's kinda like martial arts, if I may make such an analogy. You learn a technique, you become more and more proficient with it, but a master has understood the principle upon which the technique is built so thoroughly they don't need the technique anymore. They're just moving right and it works. Although in martial arts it might not work as well.

The fact that she accurately guessed his emotional state and deduced that the spell didn't work because it was /wrong for the spell/, not that he was weak (which is what Voldemort would tell her), tells me that emotion is important for most spells. It is simply unusual with the /specific/ emotion it requires (Pure cruelty, with no reason behind it), when most other spells would work with "You killed my godfather! I want you to feel pain!", instead of "PAINHURTPAIN"

** Ignoring the various magical objects that give people a boost, I would say it probably just comes down to hard work and effort. The main thing Dumbledore and Voldemort have in common is they both worked their asses off in their fields.

A big difference, in my opinion, is that in the beginning, Dumbledore and Voldemort when they were young, fought with everything they had to make themselves better, stronger. Harry fought to live. Harry wasn't trying to become the best, he wasn't trying to change the world, and so he may be one of the most famous wizards, but he's certainly not one of the most powerful.

Does it mean delving into deep dark magic and curses for Voldemort and studying alchemy and the nature of transfiguration for Dumbledore? Is it just learning and practicing more spells or is there more to it?

What makes a spell difficult to learn is another good question. Is it just pronunciation and wand movements? I'm thinking about how much Harry had to practice the summoning charm in fourth year. Was that practice mostly about getting the movement down consistently or is there something else to it?

**** There's more to it than practicing and just learning spells I think. I would almost put Snape in that category with Merlin/Dumbles/Voldy. Snape was a prodigy he created at least 7 spells on his own. Forget the difficulty in just learning spells other people made, to actually make your own spell is just on a completely other level. Not only that some people can cast wandless and nonverbally.

I think I read somewhere the wand is just a tool to help focus, so people who can cast wandless have through (Hardwork, natural skill, luck, etc) more focus and understanding than wizards who can't cast wandless. Wandless and nonverbal casting aren't necessarily born abilities normal wizards could do them if they learn how. It's not like parseltongue where you have to be born with it to do it. So, in my mind, there has to be this higher level of understanding that the great wizards have achieved through work, effort, etc.

***** Spell creation is a wonderful can of worms to look into. I think the only fic I have personally read that really went into it was the Arithmancer. I'd like to think that in canon, Arithmancy didn't include the basics of spell creation, and that Snape was able to do somthing that most people don't ever set their hand to. We know that Luna's mother died experiementing with spells, so it's not a simple formula to be followed.

I just posted my own theory that magic is like art, and wand movements and incantations are like instructions on how to create the specific art piece desired. Spell creation then requires the talent to make the piece of art without instructions, to shape magic to perform a desired outcome, and then to craft the tools and instructions to make its recreation and replication by yourself and others easier.

I enjoy fics describing the wand as a tool to help focus magical energy and I think focus makes for a good indicatior of a powerful witch or wizard.

** I guess I didn't post my own favorite view.

I like to imagine that magic can be described like a piece of clay and a spell as the desired finished product from that clay. Seeing the spell performed or reading what it is supposed to do is like seeing the finished piece and knowing what you are trying to create. The incantation is like a set of instructions to help shape the magic into the desired spell. The wand itself is like a tool for manipulating the clay. The wand movement is the way the tool can be used to shape the clay. Magic is like an art, and just knowing what the steps are to create a clay bowl doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to succeed. Having the tools, examples, and instructions at your disposal certainly make everything easier, but it still takes practice to be able to consistantly make a decent piece.

Wordless magic like taught in sixth year is like trying to make the same bowl without the instructions beside you. Something that is more difficult, but not impossible, especially after you have made the same bowl a thousand times.

Wandless casting is like making the bowl without tools. Without a spinning wheel or other potters tools, you can still create pottery pieces, though they might not be as refined as one made with the tools. Even then there are some things that are just to difficult to make without the tools, and as such are spells that just can't be cast wandlessly.

A powerful witch or wizard is one that understands magic, they understand the feel of it, the way it is shaped into a spell, they understand the techniques that "make the potttery" without needing to review instructions. If there is something they want to do, they can wave their wand in a generic gesture with no incantation, and, for example, a comfortable armchair appears. This is like an artist sitting down to their pottery wheel and making whatever they want. They know how to manipulate the clay, they know what they want to have happen, and they have the skills to make it happen. No need for instructions.

I like this analogy, or any other one that uses some type of artistic talent because they explain why practice is important, and why memorization of incantations and wand movements is imporant in learning, but how there is more to magic than that. Like practicing scales on a piano, turning beetles into buttons isn't particularly desirable on its own, but as a fundemental aspect of learning how to make music/transigure something, it lays the groundwork for the future.

*** I think what's important is that the clay is NOT finite. JKR specifically didn't introduce some sort of mystical energy that is used - everyone has the same amount of power, which is infinite. Wizards are able to channel that power, and the amount grows through their education, and probably afterward, depending on what they do. So someone who coasts through Hogwarts only casting the bare minimum will be weaker magically than someone who spent days and sleepless nights becoming comfortable with every spell they learned. They transfigure things and back again, again and again, until it becomes ingrained - they use the levitation charm at every opportunity, and so on. Their magic becomes used to that amount and they slowly become stronger because of it.

** I'd say it's a combination of three things, which all have examples in canon.

The first is Skill. Sort of like muscle memory, a spell becomes easier to cast the more you do it. Eventually, just like physical tasks, your body (though in this case magic or mind) adapts it into instant memory and you can cast it without having to think about it, at which point you begin to get better - the edge of your /diffindo/ sharpens, your /accio/ becomes stronger, you can focus on specific parts of the spell and alter it (spin an object in the air rather than levitating it), and you most likely gain the ability to maintain multiple instances of the same spell, because less single-focus concentration is needed.

The second is Knowledge. Voldemort and Dumbledore are incredibly smart individuals, and show a lot of variety in their magic. A fight becomes easier and deadlier if you know a hundred ways to knock someone out, rather than one, and knowledge boosts creativity enormously.

The third is Emotion. Emotions make magic stronger, and cause focus-less magic in children. We see many examples where emotions make spells stronger, such as when Ron, who couldn't levitate a feather in the morning levitated a troll's club in the evening. Or when Harry conjures a Patronus that keeps a hundred Dementors away from his godfather when he had difficulties creating one using a faux-dementor. A few spells even require the right emotion to cast, like the unforgivables (Domination, Cruelty and Hatred) or the Patronus (Love).

I'm of the firm belief that a "power level" makes the magic system worthless, as a more "powerful" person would be naturally superior to anyone else, regardless of their knowledge and skill, which just isn't true in canon.

** The biggest thing in my opinion is will, the will and drive to assert yourself over others, to be great, to keep others safe, etc... Having strong convictions for what you're doing. Magic isn't inherently good or evil neither is it sentient so it doesn't decide which strong will are good or deserve power.

How well you understand magic, intelligence, and creativity are also important but without a strong will behind them they carry less impact and that is what separates good wizards from great wizards.

I believe that through understanding and practice spells become easier to cast and your creativity and ability to think on your feet probably play a huge role on how duels go but without a strong will magic lacks oomf

You could also go the way of magical cores, but not the stupid shit where it's predetermined how powerful you are and boom Harry was born with this huge core so Dumbledore has to bind his magic or some garbage. But similar to a muscle as you work at it you can perform better for longer. Then it would be paired with something like magical control that allows you to more efficiently utilize magic that is built by knowledge and understanding of magic and spells. So even if you had a huge core but shit understanding it would be meaningless because you'd be wasting huge amounts of magic.

1st you have to learn how to cast the spell, once learned people seems to cut corners. But to get that kind of mastery you still ha e to first learn.

2nd you need to learn belief in yourself, if reading make you feel confident then do more of that. If feeling you deserve to be powerful, because of your family then do that more. Basically belief and improvement upon that leads to more powerful magic.

3rd after doing the first two you will be fairly powerful, but to be truly legendary. You have to really question how to get more powerful yourself. Is it casting faster? Is it stronger spells. At this stage you need to focus on your magic, curses, elemental magic. Focus is the 3rd and final way to get amazing.

** Simply luck of the draw, not just anyone can become the next Merlin by studying hard and practicing for a long time. Don't get me wrong, if you dedicated your life to any task you would get very far and be extremely accomplished but some people are just born with the capabilities to be great at something. Being born with the ability to become the next Merlin doesn't mean you will and it would take hard work and commitment but no matter how much you study tge person born with the capability to become Merlin started with a natural talent and foot in the door to succeed in the area.

It's like a quidditch star, Harry and Hermione both came to Hogwarts having never flown a broom before. Harry got on the broom and some could say he was born to fly, he naturally took to the skies and was incredibly talented. Practice made talent into skill and he was the best seeker Hogwarts had seen. Hermione was not, she didn't take to a broom at all and no amount of practice could ever get her to the point of being a legendary quidditch player. She could go far and do well for herself but she wasn't born with the talent that put her a foot in the door like Harry was.

Contrarily Hermione had an amazing ability to read and memorise books that Harry could never hope to gain which made her an incredible academic. Harry could study all his life but he just wouldn't be able to do as well as Hermione could.

They say talent will only get you so far but if you practice, that talent will give you a head start. Harry had talent on a broom, Hermione had talent in books, Dumbledore had talent in magic. All three practiced and became great.

Some are born with a talent that allows them to be great and that includes being born a powerful wizard. You could be like Dumbledore or Merlin and study to be a legendary sorcerer. You could use your talent to hurt others like Voldemort and be remembered as a dark lord who did no good. You could be like Harry who wanted to be normal so bad he didn't develop his talent for magic as much as he could have and settle for being just as average as everyone else in the end, with a little extra kick in a few spells mind you.

** Well I think Jk had made a some what combination of soft and hard magic system. It is leaning towards soft. So I believe a powerful wizard or witch is one who has a strong will power and comprehension of magic/life.

magic is has a spell for mostly anything and it comes down to knowing the spell,practice and dedication. But her work also has that vague power of love and stuff. Basically the what limits characters is knowledge (knowing the spell) but also emotional growth (patronus charm, or prior incantantem is battle of will)

There is no canon limit to spellcasting other than inborn talent, comprehension and willpower. Other than fundamental rules like you can't make people fall in love or no true resurrection, there's no magic core or mana pool to limit spell casting In short infinite casting. What tires people is the running or physical exertion (considering no one is seen exercising people have low stamina) as well as the mental strain or focus one needs to do something. Like the patronus or crucio they can only work when the presence of mind is focused on it fully.

In a way, both obsessive nature of Tom, Albus, Severus worked in their favour. Harry and Neville gets to do amazing things only when they fully commits to it. Hermione might, but she tend to freeze to doubt and fail in pressure while her academic obsession allows her to master and use any spell in a relaxed state. (I.e. Devils snare, or panicking amidst the battle on the other hand she can enchant a purse weave enchantments and stuff). So knowledge on how to do something and fully comprehending what it entails plus mental focus or fortitude to pull it off is what makes a wizard powerful. Tom is powerful because he understands power and darkness of the human heart but Harry is also powerful in a way he understands sacrifice more than anyone.

From what little we get to see, how good a particular magical is at a particular kind of magic is closely intertwined with their personality and non-magical traits. One of the most annoying things about "magical core" mechanics is how much they /impoverish/ magic.

We see Lockhart, a wizard obsessed with how others perceive him and not much else, cast powerful Memory Charms but fail at all other magic. We see Harry, whose stubborn personality---and wearing his proverbial emotions on his sleeve---lets him defeat Voldemort in a contest of will and cast a powerful Patronus in the face of a dementor, while making him pathologically incapable of taking good advice and crippling his Occlumency. We see Neville, whose rapid improvement during OotP came /before/ he got the new wand: it came from practice and a supportive learning environment that helped him gain the confidence needed to impose his will on reality. Sadism gives Bellatrix a powerful Cruciatus, yet also makes her use it when more productive means of interrogation might have been more effective. Generally, we see that the most powerful wizards we know of also had the greatest ambitions (Slytherin-style or Gryffindor-style)---and I think that with magic, it's a two-way street.

What we don't see is magicals who are unintelligent and lacking in strength of will yet capable of powerful magic. Nor do we see near-squibs who are smart and wilful.

Magical power is determined primarily by the size of the magical core --- a larger core has greater reserves and a wizard with a large magical core would be able to expend more magic required for high level spells without reaching magical exhaustion.

Magical control refers to channeling magic in efficient and refined ways. It can be developed and requires greater mental concentration, willpower, and precision. Magical control is necessary for nonverbal and wandless magic.

** according to the books, the wand, which is why I denounce book 7, she made all this allusion to certain people being more powerful, and then said nope, just luck of the wand (I know I'm simplifying, but it still makes me angry thinking about it).

I'd say there was plenty of buildup with Ollivander's monologues + Neville and Ron's difficulty/handicap with the wrong wands.

​

edit: I'm with you on denouncing book 7 though. We didn't need Harry Potter Goes Camping.

*** It's intersting to me that the only time in the entirety of Harry Potter that the Elder Wand is shown as being specially powerful is in its use to repair the Holly wand. Dumbledore beat Grindlewald, Draco disarmed Dumbledore, Harry beat Draco. Nothing really shows the wand as being unbeatable. If it weren't for the evidence of repairing the Holly wand I'd argue that it is canon that the Elder Wand isn't more powerful than any other wand.

I really like the fics that describe how every wand has preferences, the types of magic that it enjoys or that Ollivander describes it as suited for. I feel like wands with their limited semi-sentience perform just a little better at their preferred magic, and that the Elder Wand is either one that performs a little better at the weilders preferred magic, or at combat magic, a wand that is suited to killing.

** I think of how powerful one can get as body types (endomorphic, ect). You can get to any level with enough dedication and training like casting more powerful spells, however it its easier for some people as they have won the genetic lottery that allows them to become a Truly powerful person with much less effort. This is how not everyone is a Dumbledore, they have not got the genes to get to those hights without unbelievable,Arnold Schwarzenegger in the gym types of determination which most people don't have.
