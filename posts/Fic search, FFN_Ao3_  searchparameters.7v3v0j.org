So,- a bit history to understand where im coming from. Im almost only reading on ffn because i somehow cant/dont like the layout/style of Ao3, but as i understand .... im missing out quite a bit as i have realized lately. Im on a really heavy Harmony (Harry/Hermione) spree since several months,- and have worked my way down through several search pages on ffn, filtered by harry/hermione pairing - all age cutoffs and sorted by favourites.

Here is where the problems start to get nasty, im 16 pages in into the sorting - so thats around the 2k-1,5k favourites treshold - and i still find the occasional gem but almost only badly written (but good idea/intentions) fics.

The overall search output for my parameters is over 32k....

And then i just put some searchwords into google and started to find fics that are not posted on ffn for reasons i dont understand and are only on Ao3... so i guess i have to start there too?

And thats where we get back to my point for this post.

- Are there extern search sides/methods that span the different platforms ?
- Is it a general rule that you "miss out" if you dont like the layout of one of the other forums and only stick to one?
- Whats the general difference between them?
- Are there more platforms/forums?
- Tips and Tricks for searchparameters for the different sites?

And since where' already here... and as i said im on a Harmony trip and cant get off....

Show me some of the more recent harmony fics that i couldn't have yet discovered because of my search system? (Im aware of HP and the Lady Thief) or general good ones that are not listed on ffn but on Ao3 for that Pairing?

Also... this is meant to spark some discussion pertaining all that could be helpful to others too!


** I personally disliked the white background of ao3 until I found out that I can change it with themes after opening an account, so you might want to look into that

** You certainly miss out if you sort by favourites.

** Hah, I've been on the same binge (honestly, I've become unable to read anything that isn't Harmony or at least where the romance isn't emphasized), and I too need to get into Ao3. Wish they had a dedicated app, as I much prefer reading FF on the app via my phone. Easier to lay down and read after a trying day. I haven't yet read that Harmony fic you mentioned, so thanks for that!

** - Livejournal is a site you're probably missing out on. It's incredibly hard to search, especially if the community doesn't use tags. I made a list of HPHG related sites last year. Some of them may not be updated anymore, but you can look for some old fics.

- Portkey is another site. It went down last year. Luckily, there's an archive for it. I think you can search by title and author?

** For FFN you can use my app:

or Scryer: [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

to make searches otherwise impossible on the site.
