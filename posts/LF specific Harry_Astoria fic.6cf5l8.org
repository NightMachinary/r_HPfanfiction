I'm racking my brain trying to remember this fic. It involves Harry and Daphne's daughter Astoria travelling back in time and trying to force her parents together, only to fall in love with Harry herself.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

*** Astoria Lily Potter travelled back in time to set her parents up. She is heterochromic, meaning that she has both a blue and a green eye.

/Lily Astoria/ Potter takes after her father in the way that she too has eyes that are just. like. her. mothers.

  When Lily returns home to find her mother and father dead, she finds a forbidden, taboo spell that allows her to fix everything. But in doing so, she soon realizes that she stumbled onto something much more dangerous than a simple Dark Lord. Spiritual sequel of Heterochromic *Rated for swearing*
