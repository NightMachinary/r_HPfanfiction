** Remember hit count also depends on how many chapters your story has. If a story has multiple chapters, then every time the same user logs in to view a new chapter, that counts as another separate hit. So stories with more chapters tend to have many more hits.

I don't look at hits at all much because of this. [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] is a bit better in some ways, because you can track how many viewers you've had in addition to hits.

I judge how well my stories are doing on Ao3 more by number of subscriptions, bookmarks, and, to a lesser degree, kudos.

** I closed my Ao3 account, but the best I had on a smutty one shot was about 2000. the best on a multichapter was about 900 (after about 3 years). Smut seems to do very well and the numbers bear absolutely no relation to quality.

*** That's very true, the highest viewed are usual ones with a million pairings and tons of smut - neither of which are really my thing.

*** That's because people specifically look for the smut tag. That said, my fic has the smut tag, but I'm making them wait, with some limes smattered in between.

** The best metric for popularity is the number of Favorites (on FFN). Reviews can be negative, and its number is related to the number of chapters. Follows has the same issue. Once a reader favors your story, it generally means that person likes it.

** Tbh I find that it's more accurate to judge by the ratio of hits to kudos on ao3.

If the fic has a 10 to 1 ratio of hits to kudos or better, I'll usually click on it and give it a try.

** I'm far from a top-tier author but on fanfiction.net, my most read story has roughly a million page views for a 17-chapter story. My collection of one-shots has about 400k page views for 18 installments. My shortest story has just under a review per word and 30k views. Most of my stories have 30k or more views.

** For my stories:

Pureblood Princess averaged around 15000 a chapter in the ten days or so after a chapter was published.

Vitam Paramus was usually around 6-8k.

Quidditch World Cup was around 5k

LdS was about 3k and then spiked to around 9k at chapter 20 or so and stayed around that through the conclusion.

It's sequel is around 2k a chapter now in the early stages.

I wrote another fic too but the name is escaping me so I can't check it on my profile to see where it's at.

** Of the 24 fics I've posted to AO3 (all oneshots, across multiple fandoms), only 2 have over 1000 hits, and none have over 2000. But as others have said, hits really have no relationship to quality - there are fics I love with 500 hits, and fics I hate with 50000.

** A 'good' hit count is whatever amount of hits you get. There is no good or bad, only comparing yourself to others which will drive you crazy.

**** It's hard not to be! I have to actively not pay attention to other author's clicks and faves and such and just focus on my own. I was talking to my husband the other day about my current WIP and how my latest chapter hadn't really gotten any reviews and I was a bit bummed about it. But, at the same time I realized that I was being ridiculous. I write and share my work because I enjoy doing so, not because I'm hell bent on beating author XYZ on hits and faves.

** When I am looking for specific things (pairings, certain POVs, whatever) rather than just sifting through recommendations (something I do by following [[/u/FanFictionBot][u/FanFictionBot]]), I always sort by favorites (FFN) or amount of Kudos (AO3) the story has. It does get a bit skewed with older stories, but it's the best metric there is.

Basically, I wouldn't give a shit if a fanfic has 1 hit or 1k, I'd only look at the favorite counter.
