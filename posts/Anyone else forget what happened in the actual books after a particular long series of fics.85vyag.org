I found myself trying to recall certain portions of Goblet of Fire and in my head I've read so many AU 4th year and on fics this last month, that I was actually imprinting some of those into it.

Does anyone else find themselves blending Fic into Novel?

Also, if I take more than a day between readings when I pick up a new fic, I am always mixing up origin stories and have to backtrack, read the summary and chapter one, and then progress back into chapter 12 (or w/e) afterwards.

I think after 16 years of reading and writing fanfiction, my head is starting to explode haha


** I have easily read, without exaggeration, 100+ times as many words of fanfiction as there are words in HP. So yes, recalling if a detail is canon or fanon can be quite the challenge.

**** I fuckin hate that idea "I cant change anything or it might ruin the timeline" There are a million reasons its a shit piece of reasoning but only 2 i can thing of that it is ok.

1 is that you have knowledge of the future, the more you change the less you know. But you are there to change things so get the big shit out of the way asap and CHANGE things!

2 is that you might be afraid to change peoples relationships or people might not be born but if you think about it (and yeah its just scifi anyway but still) no one would be born the same after time traveling, random chance would change any children born after traveling back.

But even without all of that being an issue we want to read about things being different, not things being the same.

** My last full reread had been around 2013, and I've read a lot since then and collaboratively written quite a bit as well. One of the things I noticed myself (and my current co-writer) do is accidentally bring in things from fics or collaborations that were upgraded to 'headcanon accepted' but even more so, I find myself running through the books frequently to make sure I'm remembering my canon facts correctly and they're not fic distorted or distorted in some other way. A really odd one ended up being Cygnus Black's birth date, which we would have sworn up and down was the same as Orion's but according to the BFT, isn't. I finally remembered the fic it came from.

Our current work is following the Book 5 timeline (for now) and I've been doing a readlong and realising how much I've been impacted by fics and the films by how much is different than I thought. There's been a few random things, for example, fics seem to have a No Muggles Allowed In Magical Spaces but then re-reading to find that one is treated at St. Mungo's at the beginning of HBP. Some are just headcanons neither approved nor disproved in canon that have just snuck in after reading a few fics with them in but it is also really jarring to actually have one directly contradicted in canon and realise I'd remembered it wrong.
