I know I read it a long time ago but I can't remember which fic it was. It was mentioned I think during Quidditch World Cup. I'm not sure if it was important to the plot though. I'd also take fics with similar ideas. Thanks in advance.

Bulgarian Minister's bodyguard is a werewolf and Remus gets roped into assisting with translation duties. Does actually have some plot relevance later on.
