Before I start writing this, I want opinions on stuff. Like should I place Daphne in Gryffindor? Should Petry Baelish stir up a conflict in Westeros before Voldemort returns power to help his cause? And most of all, how does one do wizard warfare?

** Right, I don't know much about game of thrones so here's how I imagine wide-scale magic warfare in Harry Potter. Liberal use of Anti-Disapparition Jinxes and anti-portkey measures to restrict movement across the area of battle. Wizards fight in groups of 3 and 5 and are spread apart for the most part. No close bunched up formations for a lucky blasting curse to tear up. These groups fight one another across wide battlefields. 4-5 groups might try and take a town or control a bridge. Where wizards gather together for large-scale assaults usually involves points of interest (something like the ministry or hogwarts for example). Grindewald and Dumbledore are terrifying because as one man each, they can both tear through groups of soldiers with ease.

*** Yeah I'm planning on limiting apparation (especially during the WOFK). Only ones who would be able to apparate would be the High Lords of Westeros and of course the Five Kings.
