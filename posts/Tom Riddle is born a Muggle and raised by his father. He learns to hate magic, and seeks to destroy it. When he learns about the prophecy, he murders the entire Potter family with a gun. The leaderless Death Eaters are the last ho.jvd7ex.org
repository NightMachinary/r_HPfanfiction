** I feel like the idea needs some refinement.

Who created the death eaters and why? Riddle is a friendless murder hobo with no goals beyond 'kill everyone' so it probably wasn't him. Who woke up one morning and thought 'I'll create a secret group of all the most inbred upper class twits and call them the death eaters'?

Also why is this incarnation of the death eaters the last hope for the wizarding world? Is everyone more qualified already dead or is Riddle the Destroyer just weak to money?

*** Tom Riddle's actions might seem to prove their point, and in any case, it's a bigger issue than blood purity when such a threat exists. There can be a plot where people wonder if the Death Eaters' ideology is really any better than Riddle's.

** This might be interesting - a muggle terrorists taking out Wizards. A bit like Amazon's The Boys TV series.

However, for this to work I think following questions need answers:

- What's his motivation for hating Magic and wizards?
- How does he even know about magic?
- How is he able to access Magical World? Most wizarding locations are pretty well hidden
- How can he have technology/weapons to overcome Magic? Simple shield charm will repel any muggle weaponry, not to mention Muggle repelling wards, un-plottable, inaccessible locations, memory charms, magic is simply too powerful for a Muggle to take on.
- Who are Death Eaters? Without Voldemort it is unlikely they would ever exist.
- How come The Ministry, Aurors, Hit Wizards haven't found Tom and his followers already and either killed them or just wiped their minds clean?
- Did he shoot them in their sleep? It is likely Lily and James can do enough wandless magic to disarm him.

For this to be believable - either Tom and Muggles need to be extremely OP (the usual Muggle superiority wank) or wizards need to be a lot weaker than in canon (problematic as well), OR be creative as hell to pull this off.
