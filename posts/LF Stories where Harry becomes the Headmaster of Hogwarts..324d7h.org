I have read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1/Calculation][Calculation]],and I liked the concept of it, but I'm looking for stories where Harry is offered the job years later after the seventh book. Maybe he comes back and realizes nothing has changed including the hate and bigotry between houses. What he would do to truly make Hogwarts the best school of wizardry in Great Britain.


** /The Conspiracy of Blood/ features this, but it's not the focus of the story. Still an awesome read though.

** Angry Harry and the Seven features Harry as Headmaster rather late in the story, but I don't remember it actually spending much time on that point. On mobile so no link.

** I hesitate a little to post this because Harry only becomes Headmaster at the end, but there is a fair bit of focus on Hogwarts and its curriculum in the story. Set about 50 years after the end of the war:

*** Well, it /is/ a good one, I think it can handled being recommended twice. ;)

Such a damn tearjerker though.

*** A slightly boring story, where Harry's life isn't in danger?
