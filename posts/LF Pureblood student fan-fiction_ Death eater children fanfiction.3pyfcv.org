Read an OP fic, where OP was the child of one of the death eaters and it was a very interesting read. Looking for more fics like that.

I'd like to point out that Pureblood children's are not the same thing as Death Eater children. This one here is very much a Pureblood one.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]
