Here is a link : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655313/1/]]

In it, Harry is hated by the entire school the same way he is hated by the Dursleys. They completely misunderstand him, and many of them feel entitled to things from him. When Harry says no, he doesn't want to do that, they make his life hell. They bully him, AND snitch on him, telling the teachers. The teachers side with the children, and give Harry punishments. Harry tries to escape and start at another school but Dumbledore drags him back.

Could you reccomend something like that? Thank you.


** I love that story! I think that linkffn(the trischool tournament) definitely has that same vibe.

  One shot, AU of GOF. Here's the story I wish I had found when I read GoF or GoF fanfiction. New, harder tasks. Observant!Smart!Harry. On the outs with Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts in general. No pairings.
