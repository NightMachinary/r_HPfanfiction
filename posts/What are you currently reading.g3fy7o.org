Just curious what fanfic everyone is currently reading. Maybe it can get people talking, or find a fic that they haven't read yet.


** The most recent Harry fics that I've read are the latest chapter of linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar), plus a reread of linkffn(Grow Young With Me).

But I've also been reading a bit in other fandoms, like linkffn(Ashes of the Past) and linkao3(Spellbound by lilafly).

The summary for Grow Young With Me doesn't really reflect the story well at all. I recommend reading chapter 1 and deciding whether you like Abby; that should tell you whether you'll enjoy the story.

  Going out on Midsummer had been a very bad idea, Adrien was able to admit that much. He couldn't regret running into a girl named Marinette though, who has helped him through the time where Faerie tried to call him with sweet songs.He really wanted to get to know her better, but there was a slight problem: he was a Cat Sidhe and if she found out about it, she could as well be proclaimed dead on the spot. But the loneliness he had seen in her eyes had been too familiar for him to just leave her alone. Keeping her ignorant of the presence of the fair folk, while he himself was one of them, proved to be a lot harder than he had expected it to be though.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Time travel, based on the Anime. So, the world ended. That's bad news. Who best to get to fix it? Well, there is this guy with a track record in world saving... Not entirely serious. T rating may be overdoing it.

  Transmutation (n.): the action of changing or the state of being changed into another form; the supposed alchemical process of changing base metals into gold.  Harry needs help with his current Auror case, and it looks as if only Draco Malfoy can provide it. The Draco that Harry knew at school would never have agreed to do so... but maybe he's changed?
