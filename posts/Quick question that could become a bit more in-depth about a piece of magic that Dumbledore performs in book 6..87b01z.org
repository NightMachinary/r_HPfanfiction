So, I could be the dumbest person by asking this, or this was somehow completely glossed over by either the canon and the fanon.

At the start of HBP, when Dumbledore is coming to get Harry, he transports Harry's trunk to the Burrow. And Harry just takes that in stride, with no comment. But my question is this: Did Dumbledore actually transported the trunk or did he simply marked it for a House-elf to transport it for him ? If it was himself, this means that there is a spell that can transport (that isn't a port-key) stuff while breaking through (or slipping through) wards. If this spell exists, this could've been used a hell of a lot more, simply to send messages and such, and you wouldn't have to rely in both owls or Patronus to deliver it. Its one of those spells that should've been deal-breaker but isn't mentioned at all.

Now, like I said, I could be dumb and it was simply that Dumbledore transformed the trunk into a portkey and that he's keyed to the Burrow's wards, yes, but taking into account that in canon there isn't a single mention of the word ward, only "protections" and stuff, only its concept, it could be that you couldn't be "keyed" in. Because consider this. When Ron left during the Horcrux Hunt, he was inside the area when the protections were cast, so he was (supposedly) keyed in, otherwise he would've been kicked out or suffered something. But the second he left, he couldn't find them anymore, just like he said. Yes, you could say that Cave Inimicum could be an intent-based ward, and because of the fight he "became" an enemy, but that seems even more far-fetched to me.

The only other mention that I remember of similar spell is when the Hogwarts Express arrives and their trunks are transported to their bedrooms. But that must simply be the elves doing their stealth work. So, yeah, am I dumb or this makes any sense ?


** He also does the reverse earlier in the same sequence where he summons Madam Rosmerta's mead, presumably from Hogwarts. I'd guess that these spells are simply the summoning and banishing charms cast so well that they apparate the object rather than make it fly through the air.

*** That seems... odd, even within the frame of mind of your magic system. The Summoning and Banishing Charm are never hinted to do anything else /but/ physically move around the target; teleportation (be it Portkey or Apparation or Vanishing Cabinet) seems like a completely different branch of magic.

*** I've always imagined that he carried the meade with him knowing he would be drinking it later (or perhaps that he always has some on hand) and magicked it from his pockets or some magical carrying device.

** I'm going to assume that Dumbledore can get through the protection spells on the Burrow in HBP because he already had permission, just as he later apparated there without any trouble. I'd therefore assume if you can't apparate there then you can't teleport objects there either. As such, I'm not sure the spell would be very useful aside from little conveniences. And I imagine it's a difficult spell with risk of splinching your stuff apart. When would you want to teleport your things without you? That would lead to them getting stolen or something. I suppose you could try using things as a weapon but you'd have to already know what you're hitting.

I guess it would be really useful to use on someone else's possessions but first you'd have to get it away from them and at that point there's so many ways to keep it away from them.

Regarding Ron in the horcrux hunt, I'd have to check but I'm pretty sure that while Ron intended to return pretty much straight away, he got captured by snatchers and by the time he'd escaped Harry and Hermione had already moved on. He couldn't find their later camps but he wasn't there when the protection spells were cast and they didn't expect him to find them anyway.

*** Possibly, but this spell could be used to send messages tho, you write a page and then send to a pre-determined location, kinda like a dropbox. Oh Yeah, I forgot that there was a time skip between Ron leaving and trying to find them, you're right.

**** Perhaps, yes. It'd be faster than owls and patronus messages, and there are times when floo-messages wouldn't work. I'm going to assume the spell is roughly the same difficulty as apparition so it'd be pretty hard to cast, which would be a major downside, and presumably some protection spells would stop them from working such that you couldn't use it to send messages to Hogwarts as you can't apparate there. That's just speculation, of course.

Of course, if you're looking for a great form of underutilised messaging in canon, then the protean charm would be far superior. Hermione cast it on coins, having numbers on Harry's coin reflect on the numbers of the other coins but imagine casting it on a notebook and having a message on yours reflected on another's, it could be a network or just two people. Virtually no risk of the message being intercepted and no need to worry about a stationary drop-off point as it would always be on your person. The spell only needs to be cast once so no need to worry about it's difficult every time you need to send a message. (I did see a fanfic use this once and it was incredibly useful.)

** It's possible he just turned the trunk into a Portkey with zero on the "timer". A timed Portkey would still be transported without anyone touching it (as I think was seen in Book 7).

Also, "wards" are a small step away from being completely non-canon, so Dumbledore probably didn't have to go through any protections to send Harry's trunk there.

** This is a great question, and I think can be somewhat explains a few different ways.

I believe in the same chapter Dumbledore also explains why they can't apparate into others' houses and Dumbledore uses the phrase "unwanted visitors" to explain that there are protections against this. This fits with the fact that Fred and George can apparate inside headquarters, but unwanted visitors can't.

We also know that this whole ordeal was planned and that Molly was expecting Harry's things first and then later expecting Harry, so it's very likely Molly had to give Dumbledore permission and that that is the only reason it worked. So it's possible this sort of thing wouldn't work with regular post unless you gave a specific person specific permissions or something.

Though I won't argue against the idea that magic couldn't exist this way in real life, I still find the above fairly satisfactory. I think this can also be answered other ways too, though.

** It's just Muggle magic sleight of hand to increase his mystique. It's either house elves or some other kind of trickery. Same as making the food appear at Hogwarts.

** I've always assumed that whenever Dumbledore pulls something like this off the reasoning is "Elder Wand". In my headcanon the Elder Wand responds better to it's owner than a regular wand can, making very difficult to impossible spell effects happen with little effort. Like, say, repairing another wand with a spell.
