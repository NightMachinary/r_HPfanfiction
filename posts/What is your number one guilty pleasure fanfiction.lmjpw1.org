** I'm a fanfic-psychopath. I feel no guilt for my reading choices. I enjoyed Harry Crow - yeah, I said it! :)

I kid.

My guilty pleasure is a Voldemort-Harry series called Like a Ghost in my Town. I prefer the second to the first, but it's definitely a thing I like which many do not. :)

** In general I'd say that my guilty pleasure is OP Harry. I enjoy the power fantasy but my tolerance for garbage fics is so low I usually can't enjoy it. I like a slow, detailed, build up to power rivaling Voldemort. Not an immediate power up that lets Harry do literally anything. The amount of OP Harry fics that also give him an an edgy ass personality also chap my hide.

**** I definitely enjoy those when they're well written. Time travel fics often find creative ways to power Harry up.

** I read a lot of angsty, dark stories. I love that plot heavy kind of story. Something with at least 3 plot twists and a gruesome death that's what I look for.

But dammit I'm a sucker for Wolfstar muggle AUs. I don't read them often, I don't even really like them! I dont like smutty stuff. But damn, Dress up in you or Sweater Weather or Text Talk, eugh they're so cloyingly adorable that I can't help but like them. It's my guilty pleasure.

** Soulmate AUs. There's something so mind numbing about them. They really help me unwind.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

** Honestly any of GhostKaiser23 or Greyking46 stories but my favorite hp one of either of theirs is Harry potter and the mothers intriguing life flings. the story is good but its a bit smutty so its not something you want your friends reading over your shoulder
