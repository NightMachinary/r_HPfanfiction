... what Harry found there was unsettling though. Endless shelves extended before him, each one holding long lines of shiny blueish orbs. There was a high-pitched laugh in the back. His laugh. And Harry got tense at once. He should run, get help, find Sirius, Dumbledore, anyone... He was going to do it again... He was going to kill...

Then, there was a green light, and Harry stumbled with a shelf. One of the tiny orbs fell, moving as slowly as a cloud. There silence all around him, but, when the orb came into a gentle touch with the floor, the world seemed to shatter.

"... /Neither can live while the other survives..."/ was the only thing Harry was able to understand in the quick succession of unintelligible words and noise.

Then, two red eyes shone and all sound stopped, except for a voice cracking to the very air as a stabbing pain pierced his head, "Kill the spare!" it said.

"NOOOOO!" Harry yelled as he woke up.

He was heaving, loudly, as he tried to understand what his latest dream meant. The pain was gone, but Harry moved a hand to his forehead just the same, noticing the cold sweat.

"Harry, Harry... are you okay?" came Hermione's voice as a chair scratched loudly against the floor. Then he felt his friend's hand on his.

His vision sharpened once she helped him put his glasses on, "Yeah, I guess I am. Just another nightmare."

Harry noticed that he was lying in a bed of the hospital wing. The waning light of the dusk came through the large windows, letting him know that he was the only patient in the room. He saw Ron then, approaching his bed as he put a hand on Hermione's shoulder. "You got us worried there, mate."

Hermione, who didn't seem to notice Ron's hand, looked utterly worried, "You've been having nightmares?"

"Well, yeah, you know, since the last term. Haven't I told you all about them?"

The worry on Hermione's eyes increased as she exchanged a knowing look with Ron, "Reckon he might need some rest," Ron said.

"What is it? What's going on?" Harry asked, able to read his friends easily.

Hermione stood up with a start, "I-- we-- Ron's right. You should rest."

A low chuckle escaped Ron, "Heard that mate? I'm right. A first, isn't it?"

Hermione rolled her eyes, then tucked a loose strand of her hair behind her ear and gave Harry a wary look. As if he could break at any moment.

"Okay, enough of this. What's going on? I can see that---" Harry started, but then he got some flashes of memories, "There was some yelling... At... the courtyard?"

"You've been under a lot of stress lately. Understandable as it is, it's the year of our O.W.L.s after all, " Hermione hurried with a sympathetic smile, "The Prophet's deceitful articles don't help, certainly. Neither does that maddening Quidditch schedule that Angelina puts you through."

"Hold there, Hermione. Quidditch is not to blame here," Ron argued.

"Oh, you think so? Then what do you think this was? Your friend just had a panic attack, it's only proper that we should exhaust all possible factors here."

"I get that, but, come on... You have been nagging us about O.W.L.s and we're not even halfway through the year. Maybe he needs to ease it on the schoolwork..."

"Are you listening to yourself? Our futures depend on this! If there's something that he needs to take more likely is Quidditch, it's just a game,"

"Oi! I'm still here okay, don't I have a say?" Harry stopped the argument before it could escalate even further. "A panic attack?"

Harry remembered being unsettled before passing out, but his memory was foggy at best.

"It was stress. That's what Madam Pomfrey says."

"What, happened?" Harry asked.

"Well, you were unsettled, and you said some things. Nonsensical, but still, you seemed pretty convinced, and... I-- How do I---"

"Hermione!"

"Easy there, mate. We're just trying to take it slow with you," Ron said, then after thinking how to proceed, he just went on with it, "We were fine. Just out of Transfiguration, that is. And then you started going over all this rubbish. About how... well, you know, he was alive and trying to kill you and the like."

"He?"

"Voldemort," said Hermione cautiously, as Ron flinched.

"Well, he is, you know that."

Hermione and Ron exchanged another worried look.

"He is trying to kill me. Ever since he returned--"

"Harry..."

"You know that. I was at the graveyard, and I saw it. He just killed---"

"Harry! It's not real, mate."

It was as if lightning struck Harry just then. He had been called a liar by almost all the world recently, but not by them. They knew. What was happening? Were they afraid someone might be listening?

"Is someone else here? Listening? Umbridge?"

"I-- no. It's just us."

"But then why---"

"Voldemort is dead, Harry. You killed him, when you were a baby."

Harry shook his head and let out a troubled laugh. This was a prank, that's what it was. A bad taste one, but a prank none the less. "He returned. At the end of the Triwizard Tournament, I was---"

"In the stands. With us. We all watched as Cedric took the cup. We had a roaring celebration after it," Ron said, as if Harry should know that.

"No! There was a graveyard. And a cauldron. And he returned. He killed Cedric and I fought him! And Lucius Malfoy was there, he's a death eater! And Wormtail!"

"Who?" Hermione asked, in what seemed an honest reaction.

"Wormtail... Peter Pettigrew..."

"Isn't that the man who--" Ron tried to ask Hermione as the realization came to her.

Hermion approached Harry again, putting a hand on his. "Harry, Lucius Malfoy? If you're talking about Draco Malfoy's father, he is in Azkaban. He's been there since the war. So is Pettigrew. I know he's the one who caused your parents dead, perhaps Sirius told you something about him that caused nightmares, yes?"

"I---" Harry was wide-eyed, at a loss of words.

Hermione turned to Ron, "I probably should probably go tell Professor McGonagall that he's awake. Sirius and the rest would be here soon."

"What do you mean? Sirius can't be here."

"McGonagall sent him a letter yesterday. I imagine he'll interrupt his holidays as soon as he gets it."

"But, the Ministry..."

"He's in holidays, the Ministry will not bugger him off now," Ron said.

This was too much. Had his friends gone mental?

"It's Umbridge! She gave you something...."

"Harry, listen to me. I don't know what your head thinks at the moment, but Dolores Umbridge is a kind woman. She's trying to help. I was sceptical at first with the Department of Magical Education send a counsellor, but she's been keeping a tap on Professor Snape and I think she has managed to sort his less than honourable behaviours towards you. What you did to her yesterday was totally uncalled for."

"What I did?!"

"You almost burnt her hand, mate. Told her she shouldn't be telling lies and don't know what other rubbish."

Hermione gave Ron a look, "He didn't mean it. It was the panic attack, that's all. He'll be his former self soon enough."

"I am alright! There's nothing wrong with me!"

Hermione stepped back as Harry looked clearly altered. Ron put his arm around her and pulled her back, as if afraid of what Harry might do. "Look mate, we're all worried. Even Professor Dumbledore is keeping a close look at your situation. He is in close communication with Umbridge, trying to help her get to you."

So Dumbledore also thought Voldemort was dead? Yeah, fat chance at that. This was all a lie. Another nightmare. A trick.

"I'll go tell Professor McGonagall," said Hermione as Ron gave her a sober nod.

"I'll keep him company," Ron answered.

Then, before Hermione made her way to the door, the most unbelievable thing happened. She stood on tiptoes as gave Ron a quick peck in the lips. Ron gave her a quick smile, but didn't seem unfazed by that.

Harry's was flabbergasted, "You-- and Hermione?" he asked, once the girl was out.

Ron arched an eyebrow at him and thought carefully of his words before saying them, "Yeah, for a year now. It's no secret."

"What--- How?"

"Well, after our blasting row at the Yule Ball, she all but said that she would have liked to go with me instead. I'm not that thick. I asked her what she meant by that, and well, one thing led to the other," Ron said, "You sure, you don't remember any of that?"

"No, well. I remember the row but-- I'm positive there was no kissing after it... or since then..."

The friends remained silent for a while. Many times Harry tried to say or ask something, anything to help him figure out things, but he had so many things on his head and doubted so much of this Ron that he couldn't put anything to words.

The doors busted opened and a woman hurried inside, directly to hug Harry. A beefy man came behind her.

"Oh, we heard all about it, Harry. We came as soon as we could. Are you eating well? I talked to this McGonagall woman, your professor. She thinks you are overbearing yourself," said Aunt Petunia.

His jaw dropped open.

"Glad to see there're decent health facilities here. They say you'll be alright boy," added Uncle Vernon.

Professor McGonagall was nodded behind them. Hermione followed her, after grabbing Ron's hand, she stood quietly next to him.

"You-- you're here!" was all that Harry was able to formulate.

"Of course we are, why wouldn't we?" said Aunt Petunia, "Sirius and Remus said they wouldn't take long, either."

McGonagall nodded, "Hogwarts is a responsible school. We inform tutors right away of any situation with the students. And with muggles, we provide quick Floo Network access so they can visit."

"Ha! That was something, I'll tell you. Next time, we'll take the car," said Uncle Vernon.

Aunt Petunia rolled her eyes, "You know very well that's more than a 10 hours drive. Besides, there will be no next time, because Harry is going to eat well, and be more careful. Aren't you?" she said with a weak smile, brushing Harry's cheek warmly.

It was too much. The whole world had gone bonkers, and Harry wasn't even dreaming, he had pinched himself several times already. Just when Harry thought that things couldn't get weirder, the doors opened again, and Professor Dumbledore came inside followed by another person.

"Oh, he's up and well. Marvellous," Dumbledore said, "I brought this young man here. I thought he would help us clear Harry's doubts and help him sort through his cloudy memories now."

The young man in school robes gave a step forward making Harry pale, he was wearing school robes and smiling carefully at Harry, as a sick joke of fate, "Hey, Harry. How are you feeling?" said Cedric.

Sorry, got a bit carried away with this. Basically, a canon Harry waking up in a world where Voldemort existed but did die after Godric Hollow. A weird mesh between a prompt and a start for the prompt [[/u/james_true]] made earlier.

** This is a really nice prompt. I can see how someone could make a nice wholesome fic out of it.

I can also see potential for a more darker turn: Voldemort /did/ survive. But because every single person affiliated with him was found out and had gotten sent to Azkaban or put to death, there were no rumors of his return.

Maybe Slughorn managed to successfully fool Dumbledore with his modified memory. Dumbledore never suspected that Voldemort survived.

As such, Quirrell had no reason to seek out Voldemort and he never got possesed.

Eventually Voldemort does manage to possess someone and does return, starting the process of rebuilding his forces. Harry sees the writing on the wall, he's lived in it before. He knows how it looks like. But no one really believes him. And then, when Voldemort strikes, everyone is completely unprepared to face him. The situation goes to shit and now they have to scramble to prepare and to defend themselves against his attacks.

** This reminded me of an story that I read a while ago.

In it a teenager and her friends found an underwater cave when they were diving in a cruise. As they follow the cave, they found an old temple with a great library with hundreds of books in it.

Long story short, they unknowlingly free an ancient parasite sentient species that feed on the memories and sanity of humans, tyrning them into a hive mind zombies. They manage to escape unharmed (or so they thought) and escape to the surface.

The parasite quickly spread around the world when they discover that one of their friends had been replaced by a "Queen" parasite. After a few weeks of losing against the parasite, the protagonist returns to the temple and finds a book with unlimited information from every dimension.

When she opens it, she loses consciousness and she wakes up in a mental hospital with her friends visiting her and keeping her company. Turns out she had suffer from a nervous breakdown before they left for their cruise ship and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with small moments of temporary sanity.

However, the next day she wakes up in the temple with the open book and finds herself once more in the world about to be overrun by the parasite. Later on, she discovers that everything did happen, she had simply travel to another dimension. She uses this new ability of traveling back and forth between dimensions to battle the parasite.

** Harry not able to believe anything happening, had a suspicion in the back of his mind, so in typical Gryffindor brashness he decided to ask professor Dumbledore who was watching him with keen concerned eyes. "Professor is there a door with "DOM" branded on it's doorknob? I don't know where it is, but I think I opened that door after dreaming of it many times and there were rows and rows of wooden shelves with strange glittering blue orbs sitting on them. There was some strange stuff swirling in them.

I was in front of row number 97, when I touched the orb in front of me that had my name on it. But it slipped out of my hands because it was warm to the touch, and it fell on the floor and an etheral voice started saying something but in my surprise, I knocked a tall shelf behind me and it toppled all the other shelves like a big Domino , and all the orbs started falling and breaking and there was this strange stuff all over me which was inside the orbs. The last thing I remember is this really strange voice saying the phrase, "he will have the power the dark lord knows not, for neither can live while the other survives...."

At this Dumbledore paled and looked at Harry strangely with his steely blue eyes missing their usual twinkle and warmth. "Harry how did you came into this information? No-one and I mean no-one knows this part of the prophecy, for I was the only one who heard it. And I have shared this with no-one, what with Voldemort being killed."

"Have you listened to the prophecy Harry? Come to think about it, how do you even know of its existence?"

Harry just looked on with confusion and only replied with a shrug if his shoulders. Dumbledore looked at Harry with even more intensity and hummed to himself. At this Ron told Dumbledore of the strange conversation that he had between himself and Harry. "Would you indulge me for a moment Harry?" asked Dumbledore. When Harry answered in affirmative he continued. "Tell me something strange or informative thing if you think that Voldemort is alive." "Well", Harry said after a moment of hesitation. "You reformed the Order of the Phoenix again and also recruited some new members to face off the challenge of voldemort. But I will not name them. The former members are Mad eye moody, Remus Lupin, Dedalus Diggle, Emmaline Vance, Arthur and Molly Weasley, Sirius Black, Edgar Bones, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher and last but not the least Minerva McGonagall", finished Harry. At this Dumbledore's eyes had widened. But Harry continued on. "I also know the entrance to the chamber of secrets and the fabled monster is a basilisk. The heir to Slytherin is Lord Voldemort which is a stupid anagram of 'TOM MARVOLLO RIDDLE'. I also know that Riddle Manor is in a village called Little Hangelton and not far from there is a graveyard where lies the tomb of Lord Voldemort's father Tom riddle senior."

Dumbledore had sat down in the chair near his bed and told Harry to continue with his story. Harry had deliberately mentioned these facts to all these people to prove them that he knew all these things and if according to them Lord Voldemort was vanquished that fateful night on Halloween and Lucious Malfoy was not present during the COS fiasco, then he could not have fabricated these things on his own and he was not getting mad and was telling the truth. "Also for further proof you can check that Bartemius Crouch Junior is not dead like you all believe and is instead hidden under an invisiblity cloak and held under the imperious curse by his father Crouch senior. Crouch Junior was replaced by his mother who couldn't stand her single child locked in Azkaban and persuaded Crouch senior to let her impersonate her son using polyjuice and replace him from his cell. And the plan succeeded." A shocked looking Dumbledore then stood up and told everyone that he was going to check all these facts and see if his suspicion about Harry was true.

After an hour Harry just sat calmly when a shell shocked headmaster returned and informed everybody that what Harry said was true and both of the Crouch were arrested by DMLE and they were working on further investigation.

In the end after much deliberation and arguing it was settled that this Harry Potter was a dimension traveller from another Dimension where Voldemort was still alive, and Harry had accidentally came to their dimension during the accident in Department of mysteries where he had accidentally destroyed all of the prophecies and the supercharged magical matter had transferred Harry into their's Dimensional Harry Potter's body. . .

Harry very easily settled into his new carefree life with just a small amount of guilt for this Dimension's poor Harry who had travelled to his dimension and would now have to stand against a suddenly restored Dark Lord who he must have thought dead and who also was hell bent on killing him. He also felt pity for him, because unlike him the other Harry had not had any experience of life and death situations as his life was not in peril at the end of every year. But with a shrug of his shoulders Harry thanked the fates or whoever was up there, for once in a lifetime giving him some good fortune. All was well.
