During her 1st year, Dumbledore met Luna who was getting bullied. Reminded of Ariana, he gave her a few tips and taught her a simple spell to find her lost items.

Later on, started Luna coming over to meet Dumbledore and talk. Early on, Luna only talked about Crumplehorned Snorkacks and the like. Dumbledore treated her seriously, replying with his trademark 'crackpot old man' brand of humour... while internally thinking about how she was more similar to Ariana than he liked.

It was a welcome surprise when Luna got up to reading about her Headmaster and began asking him about his 'adventures'. Dumbledore freely told her about the various battles that he had fought in and the various magical discoveries he had made.

When Luna brought up her troubles with her classmates, he taught her stuff that a smart 11 year old might find useful for making friends with her peers.

But the impetus behind Luna's transformation was the conclusion of the Chamber of Secrets incident. Finding out that away from her sight, her childhood friend Ginny had been controlled by Voldemort awakened something within her.

One day, Dumbledore realized something. Luna seemed less like his sister and more like himself...

** I feel that Luna and Dumbledore are the only characters that had a whimsically magical characterisation in canon. I love this idea.
