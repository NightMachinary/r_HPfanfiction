I've read too many fics where Weasleys or Hermione were faking friendship with harry, I just can't believe it deep down.

Yes, Ron left 2 times in 7 long years, yes Hermione was a bossy know it all, yes Ginny had a enormous crush on harry, But all these things are just things pre-teens and teenagers do.

Teenagers get into fights and ignore each other for weeks when angry. Teenagers show off whatever trait they value in themselves and are often arrogant. Teenagers crush on celebrities and schoolmates and on your brother's best friend. Teenagers are full of themselves.

But if not given enormous training, pre-teens and teens can't fool long years of friendship where you're literally with other person 24*7. Even Slytherins who are epitome of cool and collected (not that it was portrayed as such in books or movies) can't do it.

Draco Malfoy is one such character, I've read too much that how he was evil from start, but I've been a teenager a few short years ago, I remember having celebrity crushes, need to prove myself to my school friends, getting flustered over small things, repeating my parents views on things that they probably didn't even bothered to think as negative traits and things I never bothered to think about.

I admire Draco's character, he was a 16 years old boy, bought up spoiled and pampered, facing first real reality of death in life. Still braving and moving forward trying to save the people he loved. Seeing people he passed notes to, flew with, attended classes with lying on floor getting tourtured, still lying. Even if it wasn't a significant thing in minds of many, he was a just a terrified boy of 17, we declare a child is adult when they are 18 but how many really seem adult at 18.

17-18 is not an age when people are out of emotional intense hormonal age, my young sister whom I consider my baby turned 17 and I still consider her too young to make any significant decision in life without consulting the family.

I just want thoughts on the multiple fics I've read where Weasleys or Hermione are getting paid to befriend harry. We read a small significant portion of their lives in the wonderful books written by an author, but I want to discuss real life implications of faking a friendship at age of 11-12 or during hormonal teenage years in a boarding school.

Edited- well I wanted to discuss realism of Weasleys and Hermione being money or power hungry fake friends at 11 not Draco Malfoy.

P.s- I said I admire the character as in how it was depicted in books. I don't fancy the actor who played it in movies because let's be real, he is old as in his 30s and not everyone have crush on actors (no haters, my personal opinion), I like how Draco Malfoy was written in the books by jk Rowling as character, I like character growth even negative as it shows depth in character, layers to unravel, even in a lying bullying kid. he was just a kid when the series took place.


** Wut.

I like an arrogant tosser throwing his name around to make things happens as much as the next (slightly off-colour taste) person, but that doesn't change the fact that he's an arrogant tosser. In fact, that's the whole point. Why'd you make him a misunderstood emo?

â€‡

As for the rest, sure. Never is never, which is to say, Tom Riddle could have done that, so you're wrong, but naturally neither Hermione nor Ron were Tom Riddle, so I guess the point is academic.

*** Oh I am not doing anything of sorts, it is a discussion about how realistic it is that a 11 year old kid is a good enough actor to fake friendship for 7 long years.

** You admire Draco?

He was racist. Spewing racial slurs left and right. Do this in real world, scream the N-world everywhere at the top of your lungs and let's see how many people will admire you.

He was a mentally deranged individual that would not care about collateral damage as long as he achieved his goal. That's how Katie almost got killed.

He brought terrorists into a school full with children on order to kill an old man. He sided with a terrorist organisation and I'm pretty damn sure you don't get to be one of them without having a few tortured or killed muggles/muggleborns on your record.

You people need to get your heads out of your fantasies and remember the damn canon. Draco was never the tragic character that needeed to be protected. He was very much his father's son. A snake that would always go to the winning side and eliminate whoever stood in hid path. Even in the final battle he stood up against Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

This goes to show how shallow some of you people are. Loving a horrible character simply because the actor that played him was a cute guy.

*** He was a coward that never had the will to fight back against his family or would do anything not to get disapproval. He didn't want to kill Dumbledore, and he just straight up lost his shit when he couldn't get the vanishing cabinet to work. He did some terrible shit because some terrible shit was done to him in a bad situation.

Also, you gotta relax man, it's just one character in a fantasy novel. Don't always have to agree, but disagreeing is no reason to be rude and loop a ton of people into one group.

**** Draco had no reason to fight against his family and Draco didn't live in fear of his parents' disapproval. "Terrible shit" amounts to being given orders and having his parents' lives threatened. In other words, Draco did terrible shit because Draco was a terrible person. And he did terrible shit /before/ Voldemort returned and /after/ Harry saved his life.

#+end_quote

Yes, for the same reason Narcissa had no reason to fight against Voldemort until her husband became a colossal failure: they gave him no reason to.

#+begin_quote
  Draco wasn't without morals
#+end_quote

Draco wished death on all muggleborns, attempted to get an innocent animal killed because he could, bullied students, and attempted to murder several people.

Had Dumbledore died from the necklace or the mead, Draco would've been just fine. Draco's issue was that he had to look at Dumbledore.

******* Agreed.

Draco was a little shit because he was a little shit, not because he was some tragic character. He was a cunt, period, just like how Snape was a miserable excuse for a human being that should've been shot in the back of the head.

People confuse Alan Rickman and Tom Felton for Snape and Malfoy, just like how they do Emma Watson for Hermione.

The only reason he "changed" after the War was because not only did Voldemort treat his family like shit, he saw that the epitome of his beliefs weren't the sunshine and rainbows he believed them to be, and he had a whole load of proverbial cold water dumped on him.

Hell, even his parents after the War, despite Narcissa saving Harry, were implied to still be such shitty people due to their "disagreements" with their daughter in law over muggles and muggleborns -- Astoria, and likely the rest of her family, were bigoted too, until she similarly was changed by what she saw during Voldemort's second rise (Cursed Shite).

****** "He had Morals, just no backbone" And how is that any different from not having morals? Also, Draco wasn't just a passive observer in the war, he actively engineered Dumbledore's death, and wished for the death of his /classmates/ at the age of 12, solely because of his blood. He didn't take sanctuary with Dumbledore even after being offered to, and even tried to straight up murder Harry and Co in the final battle, and still claimed that "he was on your side", your being the DEs of course. And you saying "his family was abusive" is completely false, that's one of the things emphasized in the books. No matter how Horrible the Malfoys are to the "mudbloods", and how prejudiced, bigoted, and reactionary they are, they do love each other. Remember Narcissa in HBP? And the classic "My father will take care of this?" Doesn't sound like the things an abused child would say. Also, btw, I despise the double standard where people downplay Draco's misdeeds and demonize literally EVERYTHING Sirius done. That's a general statement btw, not in response to something you said

**** Yo. Guys. Can ya'll stop ruining Draco pls?

He's great because he's arrogant, nasty, a coward, racist and a whole bunch of other interesting traits boring people lack. The deleted OP was comprehensive. Removing that by turning him into a helpless victim makes him /worse/.

** I've tried to implement this in the (only) hp fic I wrote, and I completely agree with you. There is no question that Ron and Hermione were Harry's steadfast friends, and there never will be.

I think the reason that many people apply this scenario is to show Harry as completely alone in the world or to introduce another character (or an oc) to be Harry's sole emotional support.

In my experience, fic authors who use the first scenario, use it well, and extremely well. They use it to cut off Harry's emotional ties to Hogwarts (his respect for Dumbledore will be gone because of some scandal brought to light) so that we get a lot of Harry being self-sufficient in magic and others.

If it's the latter, it's probably a cringy self-insert. Self-insert authors do this so that the blame falls on Ron and Hermione (and whoever else is getting bashed) instead of on the oc or Harry for leaving them.

(I know this isn't the discussion, but I've thought about this topic a lot and Harry being self-sufficient just so happens to be one of my favorite fanfic topics)

** This. I have always considered the realism of description of teenage stupidity one of the best traits of the books. Jealousy, bigotry, stupidity of boys about girls and vice versa, crushes, blind following of the parental examples, all of it.

If you are not ashamed how stupid you were when you were sixteen, then you are no more than seventeen.
