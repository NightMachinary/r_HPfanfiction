So, I wouldn't be writing it now since I am currently writing a lot of stories at once, but I have been eying this up for a while and may give it a go. Would anyone be interested in reading a story featuring the full story of Tom Riddle? It would include all Hogwarts years in detail and after Hogwarts as well.

Would not be posted until I finish my nearly completed Harry Potter and The Serpent Chronicles Book 1 at the earliest. But I would definitely consider starting it in the next couple of months.

Just trying to gage interest.


** In my opinion there are already quite a few stories chronicling Riddle's life from infancy through his school years. Most of them involve the insertion of an OC or time traveler, but even so I feel like that period of his life has already received a thorough treatment from fic authors.

Fics that cover Riddle's years after Hogwarts are rarer, and in particular there are almost no fics that explore what happened during his years spent out of England. I'd love to read a well written fic on that topic.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
