:END:
This was a story I read at least 4 years ago and I've been trying to find it again. Basically Harry has a car accident with the Dursleys and he loses an arm. He rehabilitats after a very long period and I think at one point gets a replacement? If anyone recall such a fanfic and if they can direct me to it, I would appreciate it!!

No clue if HPFF has a bot.

Edit: I only knew it off the too of my head because it's in my top 5. Enjoy! I may read it again myself.
