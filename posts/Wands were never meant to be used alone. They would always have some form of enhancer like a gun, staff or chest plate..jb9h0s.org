** "So," Harry said to Ron as they sat in Hogwarts Express' compartment, "I got this at Ollivander's."

He took the Phoenix Flame in his right hand, pressing a button to activate combat mode. The weapon came to life immediately, unfolding with audible clicking sounds, until it stood at its full length.

It was a beautiful piece, if Harry did say so himself. It had red furniture (rather conspicious, but since Harry was a wizard, this was the norm - no need for stealth if you can cast Disillusionment charms), the woodwork was exquisite, as expected of Ollivander, and the receiver was made of a lightweight alloy, allowing the rather scrawny boy to wield it effortlessly. Even Garrick himself said it was one of his finest works to date - rivaled only by that one weapon that he unfortunately created all those decades ago, not knowing how many innocent lives it would take.

"Whoa!" Ron instinctively shrunk back. "Is that supposed to be a wand?"

"It's also a customizable high-impact sniper rifle," Harry rattled off, pride obvious in his voice.

"Um... What?" Ron asked, obviously confused.

Harry sighed.

"It's also a gun."

** In "My Immortal" people shoot each other with knives. There must be some form of magic involved I guess.

**** How can it not count since it's probably one of the most talked about fanfics ever? Maybe only just below Fifty Shades of Grey.

*** Omg I am never gonna read my immortal but that is actually great.

Do u mean the knives fly from their wands like some crazy magical machine gun OR that the wands are forsaken and they are using knives to produce spells instead...

Tell me. For science.

**** No. They were holding knives and they were shooting each other with them.
