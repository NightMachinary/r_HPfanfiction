  what if Sirius wasn't the oldest Black brother? That's it, that's the fic. Read for a story where the Black household on Grimmauld Place isn't quite so overtaken by the trainwreck that is the Walburga-Sirius unchecked clash of titanic personalities as it is in canon, and Sirius isn't the Black son with the weight of expectations landing heaviest on his shoulders. Stay for the adorable Regulus and Sirius Black as eccentric small children.
