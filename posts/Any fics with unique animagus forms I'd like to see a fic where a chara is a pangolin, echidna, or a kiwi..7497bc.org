** I think I read a fic once where Neville could turn into a tree.

Like, a completely normal tree. He couldn't even move like the Whomping Willow.

Oh, it was all dressed up well and shit, like how oaks weather the test of time, are ancient and strong, bla bla bla, and he even used it to ambush Death Eaters once (I think). They even tried to handwave it away by saying "animagus is latin, 'anima' is soul so you turn into your soul-being or whatever". I think Neville should be insulted by the author's opinion of him in that case as he literally turns into background scenery.

But dress it up as you will, fact of the matter is, you turn into a tree. A tree. What the fuck does a tree even do that's even remotely useful to a wizard? That's a worse Animagus form than a goat. Goats can at least climb shit. A tree just sits there, looks like a melted turd stuck upright in the ground and photosynthesizes while dogs piss on it.

Out of all the Animagus forms I've come across, Neville turning into a tree has to be the most bizarre and useless one yet. It wasn't even being transfigured into a tree like canon mentioned in passing once, no, it was literally months of studying and hard work culminating in the ability to turn into an overgrown shrub. I'd ask for a refund.

EDIT: No, this wasn't a comedy fic. It's been a while since I read it but the author came across as entirely serious in his attempts to make it look good.

They were rather surprised when he turned into a T-Rex and trashed the place. Nobody else was though, after all which 12 year old /wouldn't/ want to be a dinosaur?

**** It has been done. Linkffn(11689576)

Short Summary: Hagrid doesn't get his hands on Norbert's egg. He gets a velociraptor egg. It hatches, and imprints on Harry. Harry trains it, gets a couple more and freaks everyone out. Then he becomes an animagus. His form is [[#s]["an Indominus Rex, from the latest Jurassic Park movie. He can turn into the Indominus, or a T-Rex, or a velociraptor I think - because it's a hybrid of those two."]]

Edit: From what I remember, it's an alright fic. But, as someone has pointed out somehow and for some reason Hermione [[#s][doesn't know that they are dinosaurs]]. Which is retarded.

*** Hm. The closest I can think of is a fic where Harry becomes a species of dragon from the Shadowrun universe. That is, an actual dragon (although he relearns how to take human form later), not an animagus. And that kind of dragon was sort of machine-like, I think? He had to eat barrels of oil and scrap metal, as the dragon fire was based on actual chemical reactions.
