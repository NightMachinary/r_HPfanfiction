***** That was one idea, though I didn't want to shoehorn in someone else to listen in on the prophecy. Currently the idea is based on the assumption that since nobody else heard it, there is no need for the Evans or the Longbottoms to go into hiding.

Though I could imagine a scenario in which it does happen and Voldemort kills the Evans family. Severa would then adopt "Harry" Evans (whatever his/her name would be then) and struggle first with the law, and then with the stigma of being the wife of the traitor. For plot reasons I'd say that he didn't tell her the truth about the change of secret keepers. However, since she does love Sirius she'll seek to have him answer to her directly. He'd of course say that hes innocent and after a few drops of veritaserum, homebrew of course, she believes him.

In any case, I see two hurdles with it here. Snape was the one to tell Voldi the prophecy, effectively starting the process of it in the first place. Second, Sirius had many friends, but no lover during his canon betrayal. There was no one who put Sirius emotionally above Lily and James and when they all believed him atraitor, they all chose to hate him. A lover would struggle with this hate, and maybe be more in denial, seeking answers before judgement.

But then again, maybe Severa would just cynically assume that good things don't last for her and just take on the duty she thinks she bears by raising Harry, never looking back and stirring in her bitterness.

Eh... that would need some brainstorming.

****** So we assume Voldemort can't hear the prophecy as set up. Dumbledore knows there is one and it's key to Voldemort's defeat. Right. How cautious is Dumbledore here? How desperate is he to win? So he doesn't leak the bait. But maybe he gets nervous knowing it's one of two babies and maybe he gently urges one family into hiding. Or both. Maybe he informs them of the prophecy. Maybe not. Then Voldemort notices some of the opposing forces have dropped out.

So now. The war goes on a little longer. But he's sharp. It takes a little time but he turns Peter. Maybe starts some rumors about Sirius beforehand once Voldemort puts a few pieces together. I mean. RAB joined then betrayed. So maybe. Maybe RABs death tilts Sirius. At least that's how the rumors would go.

Sev and the others pick up on these rumors. Perhaps Sirius turns a little serious. He may realize and internalize that there's a traitor. And he's fiercely loyal to the Potters/Evans by now.

So. He knows the shits bunk but thinks that there IS a traitor. And he can't deduce immediately who it is but starts acting...out with the rumors. He knows they can't use him as secret keeper but let's every think he is. His opinion of Peter is...well.

The switch occurs like in canon. But obvi we're dealing with a few twists. Sirius is desperate to keep them safe. But he just assumes Peter couldn't.

Now we have Sev and him in a relationship that's been strained, her cynicism taking hold. He's starting to get reckless-ish to find the traitor. Boom. Canon proceeds. It's a piss poor Christmas.

******* The problem here is just that we assume Sirius wouldn't tell Severa. To be quite honest, that is not the relationship I imagine for those two. He may be aloof most of the time, and Severa an unrepentant cynic, but I do think that they tell each other their secrets /and/ trust each other with everything at that point in time. After all, they bonded over their dark secrets, their abuse and the lack of love from their family. They shared some deep stuff with each other.

Plus, Severa is possessive as fuck. Shes well aware that Sirius is A) way above her league in looks and B) the second person /in total/ she trusts, right after Liam. No way is she letting Sirius go on some traitor hunt without her, even if in her head that's just so she can keep an eye on him. Though, since its Liams death shes looking the culprit for, she's probably on the warpath as well.

Anyway, as I said, that will take some brainstorming. I'm not sure what I want from this and how its going to develop. I'll probably need a few sketches and test-dialogue to get a feel for it.

****** Or you could even just drop the whole Harry and the boy who lived line. Something could be done with regulus instead. It'd be a source of conflict- the marauders would be putting pressure on Male lily because severa is hanging out with a potential death eater recruit. Sirius is also pissed because he likes her and she appears to prefer his brother instead. I'm still asleep, but I see possibilities there. Regulus would be the new inside man instead of snape and sort of take his role. If the prophecy has to be kept, it can refer to that instead

******* That's also an interesting way to go about it. I didn't even have Regulus on my radar, him being younger and all. It could make for some good drama and some great crossroads for Severa's character.

She knows shes an outsider in Slytehrin, but she is also entranced by the power that comes with the Dark Arts. Regulus would offer her an in, towards a well of endless knowledge in that subject.

Sirius on the other hand, I'd imagine is emotionally closer to her. They're the two misfits, not quite where they belong, not quite where they were supposed to be.

I can also imagine that it wouldn't quite compute with her that two boys would compete for her heart, which would be a fun and interesting part of it all.. I keep imagining her a rather plain looking, and we all know how cruel kids and teenagers are. At the age when she would start being interested in boys and starts having crushes, she'd have it well and truly hammered into her mind by her peers that she's ugly.

In any case I'll keep your comment in my considerations. Its a good angle to explore.

** I had a small idea where Sirius gets a thing for her. Not because of her looks, if we'd assume fem!Snape is about the same on the attractive scala as her male counterpart, but for her dry wit and sharp tongue that enables her, once she leaves her little shell, to give him contra. They develop feelings for each other when they eventually start to connect over their horrible childhood and abusive parents, and the shared wish of getting away from it all.

They're dating and that leads to the Blacks having some hope for their boy to not become as Gryffindor as they feared. Sirius isn't pushed to snap with 16 and remains in the Black family. Push comes to shove later when Sirius is steadfast about continuing his relationship with the halfblood Slytherin instead of following his parents wishes and marrying a respectable pureblood witch. They're both 17 and both flee from their family and seek shelter with the Potters.

James Potter has a family with Andromeda Black. Since he never uttered his wish to marry "Lily" in this AU and doesn't really see anyone, he agrees to be part in the renewal of the Potter-Black connection (which fizzled out due to Charlus and Dorea never having children). The connection is made by Cygnus and Fleamont in secret. The public, and even Druella, Andromeda's mother, thinks that Andi is betraying the family with a blood-traitor. The truth is that Cygnus seeks to have his eggs in several baskets, still unsure where the war goes, while Fleamont genuinely thinks that Andromeda is a good fit for James. Andromeda knows this and never seeks to run away. With 17 she moves out under the pretense of "being with the family of her husband". When James finishes Hogwarts 5 years after her, they immediately marry. 3 years after that, the little metamorph Belladonna Euphemia Potter was born.

Liam Evans is best friends with Remus, and good friends with the rest of the Gryffindor boy dorm. He develops a sort of brother-relationship with the intelligent werewolf and when the Marauders decided to become animagi to aid their friend, he too goes along with it, ending up becoming an raven (super-intelligent predators that take no shit from any eagle. I thought it fit). Liam is then also known as Inkwing (Ink + wing = bookworm and raven animagus). Liam gets wooed by Pandora Ollivander, the quirky Ravenclaw with blond hair hanging to her kneecaps and the brightest smile in Hogwarts. They connect first over a shared interest in Advanced Charms, where Liam kept Pandora from charming her buttcheeks off, and eventually developed romantic feelings in their later years. Being raised in a rather conservative muggle family, Liam was hesitant to further their relationship. Pandora took it in her own hands and snogged his lips raw during a sunny Hogsmeade weekend. They married with 18. Through the urging of his great-great-granddaughter, Ollivander agreed to take on Liam as a wandcrafter apprentice - but only because Liam knocked his NEWTS out of the park - allowing the muggleborn to delve deep into the most arcane arts of magic. 2 years after their marriage, when Liam was already a fixed part of the Ollivander wandshop and Pandora an up and coming spellcrafter, they married and got little Aster Garrick Evans. As an irish twin, just after Aster, followed little Luna Jasmin Evans.

Sirius and Severa married a month after James. They didn't have children, for the longest time, due to both of them thinking they would be unfit parents, deeply afraid that they would become even just slightly like their own parents. Instead they delved into their carreers. Sirius became an Auror immediately after Hogwarts and Severa bloomed in her work as a potioneer for highly complex potion commissions and experimental potions.

All of them joined the Order of the Phoenix during the war (even though Andromeda and Severa were a bit reluctant). The war dragged on, the prophecy never being revealed to Voldemort, and eventually got to the threshold when the Order spoke about cutting its losses. Dumbledore, in order to prevent him from making it self-fulfilling, obliviated himself of the exact wording of the prophecy, only remembering its existence and that it speaks about Voldemort, so that no-one knew what it says, practically making it one of the thousands of prophecies in the Hall of Prophecies that never came to take hold. The Blacks, Potters and Evans, along with most of the Order, hid their houses under charms and moved to safer shores in Europe, waiting for the ICW to move in on Voldemort. Afraid to loose the history of the place, Dumbledore evacuated Hogwarts, all the books, the artifacts, the portraits - everything but the bare, stone walls, into a new location (something like the dwarven cave systems in the Untersberg, above the catacombs of the sleeping Charlemagne) where he opens a new school for the children of the new british enclave.

Sirius and Severa become parents two years after they took refuge in Central Europe. Virgo Alpha and Sirrah Eileen Black are the twins born to the unsure parents.

wew, that got long... and it would only be Act 1. Oh well... imma leave this here.

** I've read some genderbent Snape fanfiction like this one which is okay.

linkao3(Train Song by masterofesoterica)

In all honesty, I'd love to read a fanfiction with a gryffindor male Lily and slytherin female Snape. How would Gryffindor and Slytherin respond to them here? I think perhaps Lupin would be closer to a Male Lily rather than the Marauders and I doubt Lucius would take a Female Snape under his wing. Maybe Narcissa would instead? Would the Marauders bully a girl Snape as viciously? I doubt it. James would probably not be attracted a male Lily so the sexual tension aspect won't be there. And SWM has a a very different context if you substitute Severus for Severina or Sevanna and I don't think they'd go as far. And how would a poor, halfblood female Snape fare in Slytherin? She'd be even more at the bottom and not even be considered by the deatheaters. And then there's the whole dynamic of Snape and Lily and how it would change with different genders. Perhaps Snape's position would be more sympathetic as a girl. I don't think they'd get together though. It's very interesting and I'd definitely read it if someone decides to pick up on the idea one day. The artwork is gorgeous.

Voldemort seems like the type to view women as weak but would make some allowances if it came to blood purity and wealth.

** When I saw that fan art, a few months ago, I had a burst of head canon inspiration. I think things would turn out very differently with this gender swap. I'm assuming no one else has been gender swapped for simplicity.

Lyle (male Lily) and Severina (female Snape) would still be sorted into the same houses.

Lyle would have to balance his friendships between the Marauders and Severina. James and Sirius frequently tease him for being friends with a girl. There would be five Marauders, four being Animagi. They don't really bully Severina because she is a girl.

Severine would still be drawn to the Dark Arts and curses and name herself the Half Blood Princess. I'd think she wouldn't garner much attention among future Death Eater recruits due to being a witch. She's be some sort of a social outcast due to her looks. However, as she reveals her talents, some of the future Death Eaters may see her as a potential Bellatrix 2.0. Instead of being acquainted with Lucius, she'd see Narcissa as a mentor.

Both possibly have crushes on each other but neither admits it.

Tension in their friendship may come from Lyle being friends with the Marauders and Severina starting to associate with future Death Eaters. This conflict culminates with the werewolf incident in their sixth year. Severina isn't bitten because Lyle and James save her life. Lyle is horrified at what happened, and they realize they have issues in their friendship. [James may or may not start getting the feels for Severina but isn't sure what he feels].

For the remainder of their Hogwarts years (1.5-2 years) they resolve and strengthen their friendship. This develops into something more, and they officially become a couple when they graduate. [Depending on how James feels, there may or may not be a one-sided love triangle).

Lord Voldemort sees the potential of Lyle and Severina as Death Eaters. Dumbledore sees the potential of having spies on Voldemort. Either Severina or both of them become Death Eater spies.

I'm not sure what happens after this, but it could follow canon or go full out AU.

With different genders comes different expectations, especially in the 70s. Severina wouldn't come off as threatening or dangerous. While in canon, Snape would be a bad influence on Lily, in this AU, Lyle being friends with Severina could be perceived as "saving her" from the Dark. SWM would never have happened (imagine teenage boys flipping a girl upside down and taking off her pants).

I went with princess instead of prince since she still wants to acknowledge her mother's side but finding it odd to call herself a "Prince" since she is a girl. There could be a plot of her trying to be more feminine but still traditionally powerful Slytherin.

That's without mentioning how berift of any quality writing or plot a story involving a gender bent character would be, because there's absolutely no reason to do it except for the sake of doing it. It doesn't contribute anything to the plot, it's utterly pointless.

I'm just imagining a lanky, flat-chested, greasy-haired, rude female Snape, and that is definitely one of the nastiest images my mind has been responsible for.

And all of those things you mentioned, if done well, make sense and take time to develop within the story. Changing a character's gender is not comparable to those other things you listed, AT ALL.
