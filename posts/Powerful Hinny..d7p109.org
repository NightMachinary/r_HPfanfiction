Hey, I've been trying to find really good fics where Harry and Ginny are really powerful and awesome. I read one where they run away along with Ron and Hermione. When they came back they were super powerful and idk it was fun. Also looking for humor, like with their attitudes. So yeah, please let me know if you've read any really good ones.


** You can also probably find a lot of fics that fill the bill in the comments of this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/97pyou/harryginny_fanfiction_megathread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app]]

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control]]) definitely fits, though it has some stuff that I find questionable, like Harry being a "partial metamorphmagus," so it's a somewhat cautious recommendation.

** Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a soul bond fic, which isn't every one's cup of tea, but this is possibly THE best HP fic out there. At least in my opinion.

From the soul bond, both Harry and Ginny obtain powerful magical capabilities. So much so that they have to worry about their bluebell flames /killing/ people.

While not a comedy, there are some guy-busting moments in there, especially when the Twins get involved.

Harry and Ginny (after the bond happens) are perfect representations of their canon characters, especially the banter they have.

I just love this fic.

How exacly does that logically follow from a soul bond?

**** Well, it doesn't... Basically, when Harry and Ginny use magic, they're using the magical power that comes from both of them. And it's not added power, it's multiplied power.
