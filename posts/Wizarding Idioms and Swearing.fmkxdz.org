So, I've seen a lot of really interesting attempts at Wizarding idioms ('Like a Reducto through magically-weakened Goblin Bricks' was a particularly... notable example) and Wizarding Swears (Almost always on the genitalia of named people "Dagda's Dangly Baps" to "Merlin's Balls" and hilariously "Morrigan's Muff" from one of the teachers) and I'm curious firstly what people think of things like that, and secondly what other creative ones you've seen or would like to see?

If you want to recommend fics with any of those things in, that is fine; as always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical because I phrase things semi-formally and still don't understand why using a full stop connotes irritation to some people, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** The best one I've seen was, and I unfortunately don't recall what fic I saw it in, or what the action was, but ‚ÄúHe took to [action] like an elf to cleaning‚Äù. It seems like just the sort of phrase that pure blood wizards would come up with.

** The books have a lot of "Merlin's Beard", and then in Deathly Hallows there's "Merlin's saggy left -", "Merlin's pants", and "Merlin's most baggy Y-fronts". Does pants here mean underwear? I never considered it...

So I assume it comes from there.

People do write muggle sayings into fics though. I think the only one that's really caught my attention was "a shotwand wedding" when talking about Remus and Tonks' shotgun wedding. But that probably caught my attention because I mouth words a lot and shotwand wedding was hand to wrap my tongue around.

*** Yeah, we refer to underwear in England as Pants, though we'd probably use undies or boxers moreso now. Interesting fact - the left testicle usually hangs lower than the right, which is why that phrase is usually inferred to have ended with 'bollock'. Also, left is often implied to be evil, what with the latin term being 'sinister', and Merlin was supposedly a Slytherin. :)

But yeah, you're right that's probably the reason for the name-noun format of most wizard swearing.

A shotwand wedding? Wow. That's... I'm not sure if that's hilarious or bizarre or awkward or all of the above. Jeez. A bit of a stretch, no matter which.

I'm always amused when authors try to think up wizard equivalents of muggle phrases but don't quite get it.

In this case maybe the author thought that "shot" in the phrase "shotgun wedding" is meant as a verb, but a shotgun is actually a specific type of gun stereotypically owned by rednecks who stereotypically have 'shotgun weddings'. Thus, "shotwand" makes zero sense in the context of a culture where the average wizard would have no idea what a shotgun or a redneck is. If wizarding culture has the concept of compulsory marriage after accidental pregnancy, then they would be more likely to use an entirely different idiom for it.

That mistake could also be linked to the word Shotglass. Assuming that it's somehow a 'short, sharp mistake' kind of phrase, one which comes in a glass, the other of which comes in a gun. I've seen weirder cross-linguistic miscommunications. :D

That or it's also meant for Fisting) | "Use my Aqua Eructo spell"

** I find when it is sparsely included, or included when the Weasley boys take up a fair amount of the narrative, that "Merlin" swears, as long as their not TOO wordy, are acceptable.

"Oh Merlin/Merlin/Merlin's beard" don't detract as much as some of the really offbeat ones that try to vary it up to swearing on Morgana's "insert sexual body part here" or the Morrigan's or Dobby's or whomever's...

When I was in primary/secondary school, one of the popular curses around was changing your "shit" to "shiitake mushrooms" if a professor or authority figure entered your line of sight or the person to whom you were speaking tipped you off someone was behind you.

If an author wants to come up with a "secret" swear phrase, they'd probably be best off using a single variation to avoid having variety be the spice-of-life, because that means the author usually sacrifices plot and story for coming up with a bunch of creative swears and the like and they are populated everywhere in the dialogue, so you can barely keep track of what's being talked about/responded to when you're the type of the reader who needs to read every word to follow along.

Not all of us hear it in our head or see it play out - some of us have to read it word-by-word to process it. And for me, "original" phrases bog down the dialogue unless they're as common as a simple "Oh my God" or "Shit". Things that are so commonly said, they're next to forgettable, like "said" or "asked" for a dialogue tag.

Even in non-HP related works/fics, having your dialogue run rampant with swears is often a sign of immaturity in an author, as they tend to seem like a young writer trying to sound mature by using "grown-up" words. By contrast, having a single character in that work/fic who curses a lot can be attributed to a character trait; when you want to carry on a conversation between that person and another, it's easier differentiating between the two voices.

But when every character talks like that - even those who are normally polite or reserved in how they were raised to behave and comport themselves, whether in public or private - and are swearing willy-nilly, the voices become interchangeable and juvenile.

Sorry for the long rant, but I did finish trying to slog through an HP fic today where the author decided to include A LOT of "original" swear phrases and the headache hasn't gone away quite yet. One of the reasons I actually clicked on the post, actually, was because it reminded me of that fic.

To drop a live grenade when killed - one of the ones I came up with to include in my earlier fics was "Holy Emrys, son of Tuatha!" - which is quite confusing if one isn't an avid fan of T.A. Barron's /Merlin/ series.

I'd rec the one that irked me but I've read so many HP fics today, they've all blurred together, sorry. I've fallen into the rabbit hole of the "life-is-a-videogame" plot device, but since the majority seemed to based on "The Gamer" instead of just a regular RPG-like game, it's difficult trying to differentiate them all.

The ones I've enjoyed the most are the ones where Harry grinds to be at uber-level because he's already died once so "fuck-it", which fits in line with his cheeky, snarky personality. The more cracky fics tend to have "original" swear phrases, come to think of it, but they're not to be taken seriously, obviously, so the author seems more of the "poke fun" type and not the "I'm so clever they'll never know I'm actually 12" type, provided the spelling and grammar doesn't give the latter away.

So I will rec you this one I read a few days ago - LOTS of cursing!

** There was one rather short fic where Harry got summoned from an alternate universe for the triwizard and he uses very creative swearing based on the greek pantheon. It was one of most memorable first chapters I've ever read. Unfortunately I can't remember it's name and didn't favorite it. Harry in this fic was raised by a clan of very militant vampire hunters. His magic was focused on a bunch of personalized tattoos all over his torso.
