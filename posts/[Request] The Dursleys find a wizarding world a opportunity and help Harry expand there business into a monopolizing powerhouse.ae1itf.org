** This reminds me of a fanfic but I can't remember the name.

Dursley ends up talking to gringotts and they end up stricking a deal. The goblins and Vernon bond with the wizards lack of common Sense and overly relying on magic. they supply drills and stuff while gringotts supply diamond bits. He end up teaching Harry and Dudley how to deal with business man/ bankers and such. even Sirius is baffled why the goblins treat Vernon better. Vernon also helps Harry by teaching how to manage stuff (technically he's teaching Dudley by using Harry's estate and how image affect politics and dealing with clients).

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  Vernon Dursley is an ambitious man. And when he finds a freak at his front door, he opts to see it not as a burden, but as an opportunity. An opportunity that shall provide him with rich rewards in due time.
