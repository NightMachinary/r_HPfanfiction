I am toying with some ideas for a story, and I wanted to see if anybody has suggestions on alternative electives (besides the ones mentioned in canon) that would fit with the overall theme of HP (somewhat whimsical, magic being more mystcal and arcane than formulaic). Some ideas I have:

Synesthetic Arts Animancy Magical Theory Enchantment Ancient Studies Magical Artistry


** - Midwivery - combines healing, potions, herbology, and Divination\\
- Dowsing - techniques for finding lost & hidden things\\
- Smithing
- Masonry
- Clockworks\\
- Corrective Necromancy - Ghostbusting with therapy\\
- 'Seducing Muggles for Fun & Profit' taught by visiting Greek instructor Z. Kronosson\\

*** I can just imagine a crack fic with kids taking necromancy from a crazy Master of Death Harry:

"Good afternoon class. This year you will begin the process of redrawing the line between right and wrong, good and evil. You will learn to spit on the idea of the sanctity of life. You will open doorways that should never have been opened..."

"Are there any questions before we begin?"

"Um, professor, you didn't tell us your name?"

"Oh how silly of me! Why, I am Death, destroyer of worlds. But you may call me Professor Potter."

"Finish dissecting your frogs before you leave! You'll be reviving them tomorrow, and I don't want any disemboweled inferi mucking up my floor."

"No no no! If you chant with that tone, you'll summon a Penanggalan, not a Jiangshi. Do you want to see your mothers severed head floating around the classroom?"

*** Smithing and masonry could fall under some course like "Magical Artifact Creation," where they study the theory behind how many of the mythical objects in both muggle and wizard history originate.

An example could be a study on the creation of magical protection by studying the Shield of Ajax, which repelled the spear of Hector during the Trojan War. Or the creation of bloodline linked objects, like Caliburn could only be wielded by the line of Pendragon. Eventually, each semester would culminate in the students trying to produce a type of unique object based on historical cases like these for a specific purpose.
