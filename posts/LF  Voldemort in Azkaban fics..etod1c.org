In all the fics that I have read, Voldemort either wins, turns good, is obliviated of his memories or marries ( or enters in a relationship with) Harry Potter, or dies after losing all of his horcruxes ( or in a fic being ran over by the Knight Bus), but none of them deal with an imprisoned Voldie.


** If you'd like a fic about imprisoned Voldemort (but not necessarily in Azkaban) then you might enjoy this creepy oneshot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3782908][Case File Seventeen]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** The issue with imprisoning Voldemort is that he could always suicide out and get himself a new body.
