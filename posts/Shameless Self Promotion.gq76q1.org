*Genres:* Adventure/Fantasy

*Summary:* A different upbringing leaves Harry with a unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and a passion for all things magical.

*** I already have some chapters pre-written, so once those go up, I think it might be down to weekly. But I always upload once the chapter is finished, so you might be getting two in the same week. It depends on how quickly I can flesh out my skeleton of a plotline.

I do have a very good plan for this, and I've been told that it looked very good. I won't go into details because /spoilers/, but please check it out, and I'll do my best to not disappoint. I can promise commitment, if anything, though I try to bring quality too!

Chapter 2 should be coming out in the next couple of days, too.
