I'm looking for fics that people think have the best, most dramatic, 'defeat of Voldemort' scenes. There's lots of great stories, but I'm often let down by tepid or predictable final scenes which don't quite fulfill the promise of the story that they conclude. Are there any that you know of which leave you totally satisfied and even breathless?\\
I don't care about pairings or slash, so long as the story is written well and the defeat of Voldemort (however it happens) makes sense within whatever plot the author developed.\\
Oh, and given the question, I would expect answers in here to contain some *spoilers.*\\
Thanks.

** I like how Voldemort is ended in linkffn(10687059). It's a time-travel fic where Harry is going back to his 11-yo self to save Hermione. How Voldemort is ended in the new future is not so interesting but the description of Voldemort's defeat in the old future (in chapter 8) is truly great in a gut-wrenching way. Not epic though, so I don't know if you'll find it satisfying.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** Linkffn(11463030) has a really good defeat, IMO.

#+begin_quote
  In this fic and its predecessor, Hermione is a mathematical prodigy, rather than a heavy bookworm. It comes down to her to figure out how to defeat Voldemort, despite Harry being the Chosen One. Basically, she realizes that Voldemort is just too powerful to fight conventionally, especially after Dumbledore dies. Hermione has some really kickass spells that she created, but she still can't match Voldemort; the power discrepancy is just too big. So, she decides that she will design a ritual that will kill him for them. She finds Voldemort's birthday via the book at Hogwarts that writes down wizards names; she then devises a ritual that will kill everything magical born in the British Isles that day; centaurs, merpeople, witches and wizards, they're all fair game. Luckily for them, Hermione realizes that the chance of anyone else being born on that day, on that year is very low, due to the small population of wizarding Britain. They manage to kill Voldemort without killing anyone else, and just in the nick of time; this ritual takes place at the Battle of Hogwarts, and Voldemort dies right before he was about to kill the ritual casters.
#+end_quote

The actual defeat itself isn't super exciting if you just read the chapter on its own; the buildup of Hermione's mathematical skills and her slow planning of how to defeat Voldemort, combined with the large threat he is in this fic, makes it all very satisfying in my opinion.

****** It's pretty good, IMO, but it doesn't really work if you don't read the first fic in the series beforehand, The Arithmancer. Hermione becomes friends with Fred and George much earlier than canon (first year), and the romance with George doesn't start until partway through year 4.

If you just start reading Lady Archimedes, the Hermione/George dynamic doesn't work if you don't have the backstory from The Arithmancer.

The nice thing about it is that the romance is fairly fleshed out (enough that it works for the story and feels like a natural relationship), but it's not a romance fic so it isn't the crux of story, which is a nice balance IMO.

Hermione definitely considers Harry and Ron to be her primary friends, like canon, she just happens to also have a good friendship with the twins.

Fics that pair Hermione with someone other than Ron often have Ron-bashing, but it is non-existent in this series. Ron is reasonable, likeable, capable. He still has flaws like in canon, but actual Ron-bashing is absent.

Same thing with Harry. Great guy all around who still has flaws like he did in canon, but he isn't a dick or anything.
