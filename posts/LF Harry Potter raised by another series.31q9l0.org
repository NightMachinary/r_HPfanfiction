** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] which is Harry raised by Sherlock Holmes and Watson, specifically the version from the BBC show Sherlock.

** This is still a WiP, but updates fairly regularly. Harry raised by Tony Stark (and other Marvel folks involved) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Incredible Technomage]] by Clell65619

** I think this is just about as "someone else" as you can get: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6867963/1/The-Chronicle][The Chronicle]] by fringeperson.

Basically every chapter is a new crossover, starting with baby Harry accidentally landing on the Time Witch Youko's doorstep (xxxHolic) and her deciding to send him off to visit different universes as he grows up. She sends a living cat doll (The Cat Returns) to be his guardian, and Harry and Baron spend about a year in each universe until he has to go to Hogwarts, then they keep traveling during summers. Can't remember why it's labeled slash, there's very little romance involved and Harry winds up with a girl at the end.

It's not great literature, but I liked getting details about works/fandoms I've never read and seeing where Harry goes next.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza]]'s /Denarian/ series is a completed trilogy that has Harry raised in Jim Butcher's /Dresden Files/ universe by a fallen angel.

Ruskbyte's [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Culture_Shock/index/][Culture Shock]] has Harry raised in Iain F. Banks's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture][The Culture]] universe.

** Can't link on mobile, but Growing Up Black on ff.net might be a good place to start.

There are tons of stories where Harry is rescued by Sirius, so if you're interested in that check out past threads.

*** I am more looking for stories where harry is raised by someone or somewhere that is not in HP or a HP oc. Mainly because it is cool with harry having a non-canon skill set. (And the associated increased potential)

** There is a story on FF.net about Harry raised by Merlin in a pocket dimension, the plot involving heavy politics and includes a trip to the Muggle PM and the Queen before he even started Hogwarts. Can't remember what it's called though. Sorry.

*** Well, it's fairly interesting. Same general events happen, but in different ways. (Ie. he steals the stone before quirrel, he transmutes his sword instead of using sword of gryffindor, etc...)
