** I don't /think/ it's canon so correct me if I'm wrong but I hate the oft used phrase "So mote it be."

I roll my eyes every time I see it. I don't recall seeing it anywhere in the books but it's everywhere in fanfics, and it just sounds ridiculous. I can't understand how it came to be so widespread that magical oaths end with that phrase.

It's hard to put into words just how much I hate it.

*** It's not canon. Magical oaths aren't canon either, and I consider them one of the most /damaging/ bits of fanon out there. No, your protagonist can't prove that they are telling the truth by saying "I swear on my magic that /BLAH/. So mote it be."

I've seen people actually bash Dumbledore for not informing Harry about this wonderful way to prove to everyone that he did not, in fact, put his name into the Goblet of Fire. That's right: bashing a character for not doing something in canon that they could not have done in canon, because that option did not exist in canon.

The closest thing in canon to this is the Unbreakable Vow, which, as far as we know, requires two additional people and probably has other weaknesses and costs, if nothing else because it appears to be used very sparingly. (Or, maybe JKR just made it up as she was writing HBP, without considering how its existence might have affected the prior books. Wouldn't be the first or the last time.)

Well, they could have given him Veritaserum and asked him.. so yes, there might not be magical oaths everywhere, but there is something that would have proven that he didn't do it. And since that didn't happen, might as well blame them for not using any other means that might or might not exist.

All right... Suppose that Dumbledore does as you suggest, tracking down a dose of what he claims is Veritaserum, administering it to Harry, and having Harry pass with flying colors.

Now, you have people who were before inclined to believe Harry in the first place believing even harder that he is innocent, and people who were disinclined to believe Harry coming up with very good reasons for why the test was /obviously/ rigged, using it as evidence that Dumbledore is in on it. After all, they live in a world with Memory Charms, False Memory Charms, antidotes, and who knows what else? As they dig, other things surface, like Dumbledore's House Point shenanigans and the Invisibility Cloak, which doesn't cast him in the best light when it comes to favoritism towards the Boy Who Lived, either.

In the end, Harry has to put up with about as much crap as he had to before, because the Goblet doesn't care whether he can pass the Veritaserum test, but now Dumbledore has to defend himself against accusations of favoritism and worse; and he's already on thin ice after the /fourth/ security breach at Hogwarts in as many years. Add to that Dumbledore's general disinclination to throw his weight around, and what did you expect?

#+end_quote

What kind of logic is that? If writers have a problem with Dumbledore & Co. not trying Veritaserum first, then they can go write a fanfic where they try to use Veritaserum to prove Harry's innocence, and explore the consequences of that. Pulling story-destroying fanon out of You-Know-Where and blaming canon Dumbledore for not living in their fanonverse seems like a rather inappropriate reaction. Besides, it's invariably something along the lines of:

*Harry:* I Swear on My ---

*Dumbledore:* No, Harry, don't! If you prove your innocence that easily now, you'll ruin all my well-constructed plans to sacrifice you to the Greater Good after stealing all your money and giving your precious bodily fluids to the Weasleys!

*Grindelwald:* [from Numengard] What the hell, man?! First, you're all "Yes, Gellert, let's take over the world for the Greater Good." Then, you leave and come back to hex the crap out of me because you don't like Greater Good anymore, and stick me in this here cell. And now, you're all for it again. Make up your mind!

*Dumbledore:* Shut up! /Silencio!/

*Grindelwald:* Also, ordinary skilled adult wizards, and particularly mighty ones like ourselves, don't need to enunciate simple spells like --- [is silenced]

*Hermione:* Wow, Dumbledore is so great and honest and powerful! I totally believe everything he says, because I am totally incapable of disobeying or disbelieving any authority figures or books or books of authority figures. Harry, you shouldn't Swear on Your Motes, even if it will solve all your problems, because Dumbledore says you shouldn't!

*Harry:* No! You were always holding me back with your helpfulness and studiousness. Without you, I would have learned All the Magic myself, becoming worthy of my heritage as Lord Potter/Black/Gryffidnor/Slytherin/etc. ---

*Sirius:* Hey, I'm not dead yet! I mean, BARK-BARK!

*Harry:* --- but I am through being led around and manipulated by manipulative manipulators! I Swear on my Motes that I didn't put my name into the Goblet! [swishes his wand (wandlessly, of course), producing motes]

*Random Spectator #1:* Wow, those are really big motes! I don't know what to think now!

*Random Spectator #2:* Harry must be a Very Powerful wizard to produce such ginormous motes!

*Luna:* I think this mote is trying to build a nest in my hair. I am surprisingly OK with that.

*Dumbledore:* Noooo! Harry has gone Independent! I am foiled!

*Harry:* Well, looks like I don't have to do the Triwizard anymore. What should I do now? I know, I'll start a harem!

*Hermione:* [to herself] Wow, I want Harry to be my authority figure now. [to Harry] Can I join?

*Harry:* Sure.

*Hermione:* I'm so glad that I don't have to think or do anything anymore for the rest of the story!

*Random female student #1 (or Tonks):* Can I?

*Harry:* Sure.

****** Well, no reason for Dumbledore to do all that. But as the headmaster and therefore kinda responsible for Harry, he might have talked to a) Karkaroff & Maxime and b) Crouch Sr as one of the Ministry people (Bagman is just too.. well, unprofessional) and put into motion for the Ministry to ask Harry under veritaserum. The ministry might have said "no we don't want to bother" but Maxime and Karkaroff might have said "but then we will tell our minister that you want Hogwarts to have two champions etc etc" and might have gotten the ministry to just give Harry a dose and ask him.

If people THEN decided not to believe it - well. The would have to accuse the ministry, which is a whole other level than accusing Harry or even Dumbledore. (Cause Dumbledore would do everything for Harry but the ministry not) And about the goblet not caring. Weeeell. I'm still not sure how binding a magical contract really can be when you didn't enter it yourself, which is the whole point. We know nothing about how the goblet works (how it chooses, assuming it's not random, how does the goblet get it's information? From a piece of paper? And if it's more than that, like, magic, why couldn't the goblet notice when a name was put in by someone else? Despite having no other choice than to chose Harry). [I've thought too much about it, I know]

The logic behind it is: If Dumbledore didn't bother with Veritaserum, he wouldn't have bothered with magical oaths either (if they exist. And worst case (aka if they don't) there probably would have been a way to formulate it into an unbreakable vow. Like.. 'I won't lie about putting my name into the goblet' and then saying afterwards "I didn't do it".) Well and with magical oaths becoming kinda fanon in some circles, it wouldn't surprise me if the people do believe that they existed in that extend. And just because they don't and were no option for Dumbledore, doesn't mean he missed to at least try to help Harry with the given options. So he deserves it - kinda. No I'm not happy with how Dumbledore can show all the favoritism in the world when it comes to meaningless house points but doesn't seem to even try to help Harry when it might just be a matter of life and death.

But the motes are great.

******* - It doesn't matter who prepares and administers the Veritaserum, if the subject had been Memory Charmed beforehand, which Dumbledore could do silently in seconds; and everybody involved knows that. Kingsley Shackelbolt does something like that to Marietta Edgecombe in OotP.

- Unbreakable Vows likely have limitations and costs that are not given in canon, since, say, Voldemort never uses them to enforce loyalty. That aside, we don't know if one would kill the subject if the subject lied unknowingly. If it wouldn't, Memory Charms are just as much a problem is before; if it would, how /sure/ is Harry that he had not, in fact, been compelled to put his name into the Goblet using any of myriad mind-control magic that's out there, or otherwise have contributed to or facilitated it? To account for all these things, the Unbreakable Vow and the statements made thereafter would have Harry sounding like a lawyer stereotype. Again, probably more harm than good. Remember, nobody is threatening to arrest Harry for putting his name in. It's about PR.

- For that mater, /are/ there any fics where someone swears a "magical oath" and then loses their magic because they had phrased it poorly or had been Obliviated of the fact that they had, in fact, done the crime? (In fact, for all we know, that's exactly what might have happened: the Imperius that Harry had managed to throw off was the /second/ one he had been exposed to. So, it was, indeed, his hand that had dropped in his name.)

- For that matter, socially, I imagine that Wizards might, in general, be leery of public Veritaserum demonstrations, because next time, it might be them being fed it.

- We don't know the mechanics of the Goblet, except that it's magic. It may well be inescapable. Unfair, yes, but the very concept that a small subset of humanity is able to break laws of physics by waving wooden sticks with animal remains inside, while the rest of humanity can't, is unfair on some level.

Could Dumbledore have done more? Perhaps, perhaps not. I do agree that he is guilty of being biased towards inaction, but that doesn't explain why most of the time he actively tries to /prevent/ Harry from Swearing on his Motes.

******** Well, yes, you did just summarize pretty good while, in the end, NOTHING in the wizarding world of JKR is certain. Just read [[http://www.cracked.com/article_19667_6-horrifying-implications-harry-potter-universe_p2.html][horrifying implications of the Harry Potter universe]] that has exactly that as the number one point.

For all we know, EVERYTHING in the books could have happened totally different and someone powerful just went around putting a potion that works like and obliviate in everyones drinks. And don't say there isn't such a thing - with what the Weasley twins manage to create, someone like Dumbledore or Voldemort could just as well have made something like that.

You can either ignore it and go with "Veritaserum and Pensives (and oaths) solve everything".. or have nobody trust anybody, because that would be the correct conclusion to what wizards are able. But that would make for a really nerve wrecking story I suppose.

(Or yes you go with anything in between, but everything in between is than subject to exactly that kind of attack - either they trust the stuff they have, or they don't and then why do they even trust anybody)

Yeah, wouldn't it be scary to live in a society where it's not possible to /ever/ be sure that anyone really believes what they are saying, much less if it's true in any objective sense; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_%28drug-related_amnesia%29][where inexpensive and widely available potions exist that, if ingested in sufficient amounts, prevent one from remembering what happened afterwards]], with only slightly more expensive and less available potions able to do so in smaller doses; where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke][an injury so small as to have no outward signs can radically alter someone's personality and values]]; and [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/][where even without any injury or deliberate malfeasance, any memories one does recover are woefully unreliable]]? How could anyone live in such a world, where it's not even /possible/ for one person to view another's memory, real or fake?! Oh, wait... :P

In short, muggles seem to be able to have functioning, even prosperous, societies that involve a great deal of trust even between strangers, and they don't even /have/ Pensieves and Veritaserum, the poor dears. Most memories are, in fact, reasonable approximations of reality most of the time, and most people are trustworthy most of the time; and the same goes for the wizards.

As far as we know, very few people have the knowledge and the skill to perform Memory Charms and False Memory Charms undetectably, and they are /very/ easy to mess up and leave obvious signs of tampering, so for vast majority of magical criminals, they aren't a much better option than outright murder, an option equally available to muggle ones.

The problem is that when there is clearly foul play of some sort, like in GoF, where /someone/ had to have put Harry's name into the Goblet, possibly Harry himself, and where highly capable wizards like Dumbledore are around and have an incentive to cover things up, yes, one has to be extra-careful.

********** Well, yes, there ARE ways to drug people to forget things or believe things that never happened. But that stuff is illegal (isn't it? I'd hope so) and they don't teach us in chemistry how to make them - not even close. Maybe in university chemistry, but not in school, and it probably needs a bit more than a couldron.

But Hermione made polyjuice in 2!! year. As a 12 year old. Yes, she's the intelligent one etc pp, but in the end, that means that everyone learns enough from school and books to make it, without having to buy extra chemistry equipment or something - the basic stuff from school is enough.

And the Weasley twins are selling stuff in the open that is questionable. You won't get drugs that help you to rape someone in a jokeshop in real life (right?! You are making me worried).

And knowledge and skill to perform memory charms? /cought/ Lockhart /cought/ seemed like the worst wizard ever, can't even do the simplest spells, but learned the Obliviate. Which to me sounds like "just keep practicing and you will learn it, no matter how bad you are". Messing them up is only a problem in so far that someone might notice that something is off and therefore might investigate and reverse it - if that is possible.

Therefore I think that while yes, you can do similar things in real life, it is much more easy and accessable in the wizarding world. At least I don't assume that every person I know has easy access to drugs or can even make them themselves. In the wizarding world, they learn it in school. And to me, the likelyhood/possibility/availabilty makes a big difference.

*********** The "drug" in question is alcohol, both in memory suppression and as probably the most common date rape drug in practice, it's only slightly restricted, people home-brew beer as a hobby, and school chemistry typically involves at least one distillation experiment, to say nothing of chemistry kits sold in toy stores.

Hermione & Co. had to break into the restricted section of the library, steal some of the ingredients, spend over a month brewing it, and even then experienced a 1/3 failure rate (in a sense). Also, they had Hermione.

Fundamentally, we don't know what made Lockhart good at Memory Charms and bad at everything else. We are told that personality and emotional disposition matter for things like the Cruciatus, the Patronus Charm, and Occlumency. Lockhart's achievement wasn't the magic itself but his application of it --- knowing to Obliviate the right memories at the right time in the right place and deceive the public. Perhaps his personality gave him facility with Memory Charms that he didn't have with other magic. And, anyway, the point stands: if one has to practice a lot to become good at Memory Charms (or be Hermione), that means few wizards will have the skill (because wizards are as lazy, or lazier than, muggles, and muggles are plenty lazy).

Coming back to the original point, there are investigation and verification techniques available to wizards that are not available to muggles, and there are also concealment and deception techniques available to wizards that are not available to muggles, and it more-or-less balances out in the end: most people are safe and trustworthy most of the time, and proving one's own innocence in the court of public opinion is hard, especially where there is suspicion of a cover-up or a conspiracy.

Also, oversexualization. People have sex, this is true. Whatever. A couple banging is fine, exploring sexuality is fine, but what the fuck is wrong with authors who write stories about everyone and their mother raping Harry, usually when he's like 12? There is legitimately a story about Vernon selling him to some old dude who rapes him constantly, and then every single following hardship he faces is someone new raping him. At very young ages. I almost puked a few chapters in, thinking that it was so well reviewed that it HAD to get better, right? Like, yo, if you want to write about that type of thing for plot's sake, that's one thing.

I just started one where somebody is in the hospital wing looking "horrifically malnourished and obviously abused" and half the Hogwarts staff was circled around the bed squawking "omg wat is wrong wit da student???" I quit reading. I've also read good fics where the author is intentionally vague about things like that, or skillfully avoided in-depth scenes about things they don't know much about.

*** Sometimes, this is fanfiction, especially medical scenes:

Poppy waved her 9.2 inch plywood wand with a squirrel tail core over the unconscious quivering student in a series of diagnostical spells. The blue glittering light dripped out her wand and slimed over the bushy haired beauty.

"Poppy, m'dear, what has happened to the poor girl?" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he ate an unending stream of lemon sherberts.

"The diagnostic magic says Hermoine has 10 hours of rape and 10 hours of Cruciotis. Alternating. Everything is bruised or bleeding. She might make it Albus, but I'm not sure she will."

"Let's take her to St. Mangoes," Dumbledore offered sugarly.

"She won't survive the Floo trip and aperition would defiantly kill her! At best she'll wake up in 3 weeks."

"Do your Hogwarts best, then Poppy. She truly is in Merlin's hands now."

Mademoiselle Pumphrey waggled her wand and performed several secret family Healing magical spells. It didn't matter if Dumbledore saw now, family oaths required she save this poor girl she had always had a secret fondness for.

She tried one such secret family spell, "Healus maximus!" A a golden orb belched out the squirrel core wand (which is actually very advantageous to Healing as squirels are the Healers among animals) and entered the smarted witch of her age's chest. It pulsed and throbbed but /nothing happened!/

"Egads Poppy! Truly that is a wonderful spell! Where ever did you learn it!" Crowed Albus Percival.

"Not now Alby," Poppy frowned and muttered, "This next one better do the trick or else..." And wrung her wand between her nervous, sweaty hands. "Grande curar!" And a great bold of green lightening came out (green like the Adava Kedavra curse but the opposite so therefore Healing) and the girl in the Golden Trio jolted but didn't wake!

"Ho ho! I see you've got that Latin fire, eh Poppy!" chortled the Supreme Mugwump. "Maybe the elves should prepare fish tacos for dinner."

Poppy closed her eyes and was very white and clammy. She whispered "I guess I must do it. The ultimate healing spell."

With shaking hearts she pointed it at the girl. "Destroyo diseaso" And the most Healing color of all (white) pored and sprinkled over Mione's battered beated body. It entered her body and fixed everything! The nerves became one and the muscles knit back together. Her bones got harder and her chocolate orbs became more farseeing. It was truly the ultimate Healing spell.

Hermione sat up in bed and wondered, "Madam Pomphrey and Professor Dumbledore! You saved me!"

Dumbledore chuffed and munched on his beard a bit, but Poppy turned away. "Miss Gragner...with great magic comes great consequences," she sniffed and continued "all your teeth have fueled the Healing spell for your body. You will need magic dentures."

"No!" gasped Hermione, or blabbed really.

"Yes. Also, we needed more magic might so you are now soul bonded to Draco Malfoy and Sirius Black. Their magic saved your life."

Hermione gaped but really she had always secretly fantasized about them.

Dumbledore chuckled, "All's well that ends well. Good job, Poppy. Hermione, I have a marital suite for you threesome."

The use of 'sweat dropped' as a verb. Tick marks to describe anger. /Someone banging their head against the wall/. PEOPLE DON'T DO THIS IN REAL LIFE!

If someone is nervous or feeling akward about something, SAY IT instead of using the word 'sweat dropped'! Sweat drops aren't even a real thing, so don't even use them as a noun, let alone a /verb/. Tell me about how angry someone is, show me their scowl and flushed face, their clenched fists, /don't say they have an angry tick mark!/ And when was the last time you saw someone just walk up to a wall and smack their head into it when frustrated in real life. I have the answer, /never/.

People do these things in cartoons because it's a visual cue for an emotion, because cartoons are /visual/ things. They have to use visual shortcuts to show their character's emotions, but don't /ever/ use those same things in a text based story!

It's especially jarring when HP characters do these things in a crossover with some anime, let alone when a live action show is crossed over with anime and they continue to do it. It's just lazy writing, don't do it.

Meanwhile this supposedly so-intelligent Dark-Lord-in-disguise is entirely impotent and incapable of doing anything about this treatment.

**** I'm purely looking at this from a literary way. What does any character (established as 'straight') gain from suddenly being gay for the sake of a story? Sure, you can have characters interact that would 'normally' (and I'm using the term VERY lightly) not interact. For example, what does a Harry/Draco pairing gain in a relationshio that could've easily been written as close friends (even as a Gryffindor!Harry it's not that difficult) or even brothers, were Harry adopted by the Malfoys or a Black family member that still interacted with the Malfoys. Or another frequently used pairing: Sirius/Remus. They are already brothers, if not by blood. There is nothing to gain from a relationship there.

While only Dumbledore has been outed by Rowling... Does it really matter if there are not many gay characters in the HP universe? Is it that relevant for a story? Let me ask a different question: do the straight relationshios really matter in the story? Is Harry/Ginny relevant to the plot of the last two books? I think not. Sure, it gives Harry something to fight for. But would he really be nothing without Ginny? Gay or straight shouldn't have to matter that much.

To be fair, it's mostly the pairings that bother me. Why Draco, or -God forbid- SNAPE? Hell, I've seen fics with a Harry Lucius pairing. Why? Why not someone more believable and less old and gross like Dean or Seamus. Or someone from Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.

The only benefit to those kind of pairings are to explore less fleshed out characters in the HP Universe. Which can be done in a number of other ways without forcing a straight character to 'be gay' all of a sudden.

As for smut... Indeed, slash doesn't always imply smut, but there is no denying that way too many stories use a slash pairing mostly to indulge themselves in writing (often very bad) sex scenes.

***** In many fics a relationship is a key or the primary focus of the story. If those fics aren't your cup of tea, that's fine, but when you specifically declaim slash fics you need a better reasoning than "it doesn't add enough narrative value", which is simply untrue.

See, this is the kind of thing that sounds homophobic. Why is it /bad/ to 'force' a /fictional character/ to 'be gay'? I say it allows authors to explore world and characters of HP in new ways that can be just as interesting as fics with straight pairings. Again, fanfic writers change aspects of canon all the time to fit the story they want to tell. Why is this aspect inviolable?

Nope and that's not what I originally said nor what you originally replied to. I disagreed with you saying slash doesn't mean smut as I do agree with the OP that the majority of slash stories are written as poor smut (which is why I personally don't read them unless highly recommended as I don't mind gay romance but reading explicit descriptions of se with little else is not interesting/enjoyable for me)

I agree that there's not many gay characters, but there are many ambiguous ones e.g. Seamus which i'd rather see in a fic than randomly making a clearly straight character gay.

I also firmly disagree that saying you don't like seeing straight characters portrayed as gay is homophobic in this thread /about things you find annoying in fanfiction/

I've already said I don't read them as the majority turn out to be poorly written and poorly planned smut. I've no issue with a gay main character so long as; he/she is one of few gay mains/people in general, it's not the whole point of the story, the entire thing isn't smut. Oh and also, although this is a personal thing, if you make Harry gay you need to start from TPP not say OoTP, because he's clearly (although for some reason you insist on disagreeing) straight in canon, it's weird to have him suddenly jump Draco/Whoever after he's been staring at Cho the entire previous book.

*EDIT:* To add to that, I also hate that being gay means a characters entire personality changes which is one of the reasons that imo it's better to use secondary characters as they have no real personality for the most part.

Also I don't want this to come off like an anti-gay thing, I once didn't read a fic because it talked about Harry's blue eyes the whole way through cause the author didn't like green ones or something. I just hate when something is forced into a fic and made a huge deal for no reason.

****** There is no straight or gay; there is only sex, and those too weak to try it.

...meaning no label was ever applied except by JKR when she veto'd the scriptwriter's expansion of a dead wife to Dumbledore's background.

As I see it, there are a few pitfalls to the inclusion of non-normative sex behaviors in a fic:

- Bringing it up means you want to talk about it.\\
- Changing the assumed behavior of a beloved character can upset the suspension of disbelief, and the more of those changes made, the harder a reader has to work to adjust. If you didn't warn them ahead of time, it feels like a bait and switch\\
- Even more important if the changed behavior invalidates certain plot points; ex.: Snape being gay directly contradicts the circumstances of the critical moment of Halloween 1981.

In short, the closer to a main character the modified sex behavior is getting, the more AU the story is.

Even without the bait-and-switch, the author is still asking more of the reader than was expected. If you write a story based on Firefly but Jayne acts like a smooth-talking businessman, Inara is a Vulcan and Wash is Dexter reincarnated, the reader is likely to say 'You lost me.

No, the author is asking of the reader /exactly what was expected/. If the content of the story is apparent up front, complaining about it is ridiculous. Just /don't read that story/ if it has elements that don't interest you. There are thousands of others out there that will fit what you're looking for.

I could understand complaining if halfway through a story Harry dumps Ginny and runs off with Draco with no indication beforehand. But you don't start reading a Drarry fic and a couple chapters in go 'what the hell, this contains slash?'

Furthermore, your examples are hyperbolic. You can change the orientation of a character without changing their personality, especially given that sex and relationships weren't very prominent in canon.

** Anyone want to tell me why in any Hp fic if Harry has his age reduced (by curse, potion, spell mistake, etc.) that he immediately forgets everything that's happened? Why he suddenly acts as if he has been replaced by his 4-year-old self rather than shrunk or transformed into a generic younger version of himself? Well, of course I'm being facetious; it's so he can be inevitably adopted by Snape, Sirius, Draco, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Lucius, Lupin, Molly, or whomever (in estimated order of likelihood) to fulfill the goals of a hurt/comfort fic without having to deal with the pesky details of Harry's initial resistance to the idea.

Now, I never see this problem happen in other fandoms. Naruto doesn't usually suddenly forget what's going on, or who he's friends with, Sam and Dean wouldn't be written to forget that their dad is dead, but bloody Harry Potter will be de-aged ten years, replaced with his six-year-old self (immediately cowering in the middle of the Potions classroom because he was hiding in the cupboard exactly ten years ago, naturally) and have to be told that magic is real all over again.

You don't usually see this even with other characters in the fandom, either, or at least not as blatantly. Child!Draco usually remains the same person, merely in smaller packaging, although Child!Snape may confuse Harry with his father. I'm not even arguing against using de-aging as a crutch Trope to support a hurt/comfort fic--it's just strange that it always seems to require amnesia for Harry in the bargain.

Anyway, it's a weird trait of the fandom, slightly creepy, and almost always indicative of poor writing ahead, since it mostly serves to remove conflict from the story.

What gets me is that as soon as Harry realized that he has the body of a girl the pronouns shifted he started referring to himself as she/her and everyone around Harry started referring to him as she/her simply because the body changed. This fails so spectacularly on so many levels its hard to describe. Imagine your best friend came up to you and told you that they're Trans* and would like for you to use different pronouns from then on, even if you're super supportive your going to fuck up for the first little while and it will take some getting used to. In the matter where Harry starts referring to himself as herself, I'm transgender and even after coming to that realization that I want to transition it was still a huge turning point for me to refer to myself internally using the correct pronouns. Basicly what kills it for me is that so basicly all gender bender fics are written by cisgender people who don't understand the difference between sex/gender or body/brain and pretend that the second is always what ever the first is.

*** Portraying any character as honestly evil is pretty stupid. Even the original Voldemort has a reason for being as he is.

**** I don't mean the childish evil of the traditional good v. bad children's story. I meant in those stories that have Dumbledore be a complete jerk out for nothing but himself and just pretending to be the kindly old wizard.

** I will admit that my guilty pleasure fics are Sevmione fics. No idea why, but I love them. What I hate is when the author makes Ron and/or Harry abusive toward Hermione sending her right into the arms of the person they want Hermione to be with whether it's Snape, Draco or Ginny. I once started a fic where Snape looked into Hermione's mind and saw both Ron and Harry try to rape Hermione. It was just strange and so out of character for both boys.
