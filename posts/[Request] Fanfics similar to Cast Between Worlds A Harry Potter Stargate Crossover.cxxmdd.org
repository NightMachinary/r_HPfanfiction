/Non-magical:Harry but with Metahuman abilities. Harry is exiled from the Wizarding World and joins the RAF. This is what would happen if Harry joined the Atlantis Expedition. Follows from season 1 all the way to the end/

What I like about this story is the military action personally involving harry as well as harry being a last resort weapon


** I started reading it. I'll dig through some of my stuff later to see if ti matches. Does the author get a beta or does the writer have typos throughout? Just want to know if that gets better...

** After having read it, I don't think I have anything quite like it. I've read some crossovers with stargate before, but none with a harry with no magic, where he's a weapon like that.
