in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/Motivations][Motivations]] Jeconais presents an idea where Harry joins one of Hogwarts' other clubs, one that spans house membership. Ron and Hermione aren't interested in it, but Harry finds other friendships and support in it. He totally glosses over most of Harry's school career, but suggests some of the ways that this might have made life easier on Harry. He basically skips to the end, sets up a relationship with Astoria Greengrass who while Slytherin, is presented as coming from a family that historically isn't always (Yes I realize the Greengrass family as presented here is essentially AU), then handles the horcruxes really really fast after convincing Malfoy Senior to betray Riddle (some suspension of disbelief necessary - more AU).

Despite the AU Malfoy senior, it is a really good story, and I've often wished that Jeconais had done more with this. A multi-chaptered work that allowed us to see more of the ways in which Harry's character is changed by the extra support, and the growth of his relationships with the other characters we know next to nothing about.

Plus I'm a total sucker for having two or three chapter epilogues and this one-shot barely has any happily-ever-after.

I'd really like to see someone run with this idea, extend it out and show us the 200k version, or the version that spans several fanfictions covering a shorter time period each.

I'm very confident that I'm not nearly talented enough to do this, but I can't imagine that as long as credit is given that you can really object to someone making a fanfiction of your fanfiction, so I think it is a fair request.
