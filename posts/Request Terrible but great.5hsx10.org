**** The problem with the shopping trip isn't that it exists. The problem is that authors either copy canon exactly and don't introduce anything important to the story, or that introduce every cliche possible in a stupid way.

The trip in canon is the first, true introduction to canon. That's where Harry truly discovers that there are others like him, gets his wand, and we (the readers) gets introduced to the plot: Voldemort and Harry's role in his defeat. In fics that actually use the shopping trip well, the shopping trip is used similarly. In what is my favorite 'true' AU, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), the trip shows us that Harry has a synesthesia-like reaction to magic (which really, that's what wandsong is: magical synesthesia), introduces the important character that is Harry's wand, helps show more of the AU world building, shows us that Tom Riddle exists but isn't Voldemort and introduces us to what is one of the more important sideplots through Hermione: wizard and muggle/muggleborn relations.

Hell, even HPMOR uses the trip correctly. Through the Gringotts scene, we learn of Big Yud's interpretation of the magical word (everything we see in canon is all the truth of how things work, and therefore all magicals are one or another variety of stupid), Harry's acceptance of James and Lily as his parents (literally his only character growth) and the introduction of a non-aggresive and even friendly relationship with Draco Malfoy.

It's not the cliches/tropes, it is how they're used.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

**** I would rather they skip the scene but refer back to it later, or maybe go through it all quickly where it takes up a mini-chapter. The shopping scene also helps for world building, going through the surroundings of Diagon Alley really allows you to see the wizarding world.

***** Which, at this point, every single reader is familiar with.

Unless you are creating significant departures from canon in that shopping trip, and I am not just speaking about WonderTrunk(TM) or UltraCustomWand 3.0, skip it.

The only thing that needs to be skipped more within fanfics than the shopping trip is the goddamn first sorting hat song.

I disagree, the wand is exceedingly important. As it shows the road the Author wants to take with the story (I'm not talking about the "38 core, 365 wood" wands, I'm talking about the wands that were done with careful consideration to what they want Harry to become).

******* Except at least 99% of the time, the wand falls into one of two categories. Either it is the canon wand or it is some amazing never seen before UltraCustomWand. If the first, skip it. If the second, the story is likely crap anyway. Perhaps it is because I don't read slash fics.. maybe it is relevant there more frequently.

If something useful to the plot happens in the wand shop, show it. Otherwise, Blech. In most year one fics you can skip to chapter 6 and effectively miss nothing, since background and worldbuilding are lifted straight from canon.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
