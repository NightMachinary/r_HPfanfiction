Instead of Dumbledore showing up as Harry's lawyer in OotP, it was Elle Woods from Legally Blonde.

"You can produce a fully formed Patronus?" "What, like it's hard?"


** Elle Woods would make an excellent Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, you can't change my mind.

  A spin on Harry's trial in Order of the Phoenix. Instead of it just being Harry vs Wizengamot, Elle Woods joins the case. Her agenda includes kicking Umbridge's butt, winning the case, helping Mrs. Figg, charming the Wizengamot, and also kicking Umbridge's butt again.

“Bend... and snap!” Elle said as a bright green light flooded the room.

  No good deed goes unpunished. How does a fleeting act of compassion cause Lavender Brown's name to be drawn from the Goblet of Fire? And will she survive her unwanted journey into the world of warrior witches? Read on to find out. LavenderxRon Rated M for profanity in future chapters. Chapter Fourteen: Lavender finally talks to Trelawney.
