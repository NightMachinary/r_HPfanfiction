:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im looking for a specific slytherin!Harry fic. I dont remember much of it but i know that Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy end up finding out about the neglect/abuse of the Dursleys and they start this Act in Harry's name. The act basically means that a witch or wizard born to muggle parents is immediately taken and raised in a wizarding family. I think there's Dumbledore bashing.


** I have to double check but the sounds like an earlier plotline in the "They Shook Hands" series by Dethryl. Linkffn(7659033)

OR

There is a series by DrizzleWizzle that had some similar plotlines to They Shook Hands, it may be that one. Linkffn(8666085)

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]]

This fits most of your criteria, but Harry went to an orphanage instead of the Dursleys. Could it be the right one?

*** Is this the one where Harry basically befriends voldemort? I don't know how to do spoilers but i also remember a very gruesome and drawn out situation with Tonks.
