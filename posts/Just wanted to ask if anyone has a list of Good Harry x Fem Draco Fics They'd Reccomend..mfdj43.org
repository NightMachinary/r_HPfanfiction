I ran into a funny comic that made be begin thinking. I like this concept. So many shenanigans and denials. Lol.

Wanted to ask this this morning before work, but Reddit appeared to be down.


** linkffn(A Life Twice Lived by Nemesis13)

Haven't read it in a while, but it was a good story, as I recall. Had some funny moments.

On the flip side of the spectrum, I just finished reading linkao3(That Universe Over There) which is sort of fem!Harry/Draco and I died laughing.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
