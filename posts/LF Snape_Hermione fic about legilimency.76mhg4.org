Hi everyone! I read a fic ages ago and can't remember the name of it or where I read it.

What I can remember: It is forbidden for men to teach women (and vice versa) because it creates strong sexual urges which are almost uncontrollable. Snape needs to teach Hermione but tries to stop before the urges happen to both of them.

Does this sound familiar to anyone at all?


** Ohhhh that sounds EXCELLLENT. I'm afraid I haven't read it, but now I desperately want to...

EDIT: Until you find it, check out linkffn(getting the best of the gloomilows) which has lovely descriptions of Legilimency-as-sex

  After their life-changing encounter, Severus is adamant that he and Hermione keep their distance until graduation. But how can he turn his back when he finds that Hermione is suffering? Can Occlumency help? A story about healing & finding new perspective. M-rated (to be on the safe side) - for adult themes, descriptions of violence, mild PTSD and sexual content. SS/HG
