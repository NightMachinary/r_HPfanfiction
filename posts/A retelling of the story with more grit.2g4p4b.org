Inspired by [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2g48qf/first_time_ive_completed_deathly_hallows_since/][this post]].

Are there any retellings of the story where none of the characters lean any clear on the good and bad spectrum, but instead have personal motivations which are fairly presented, and where Harry matures quickly enough to deal with a dark world?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1023780/Kwan-Li][Kwan Li]]'s two latest stories go to some very dark places, with more morally ambiguous characters than canon.

Others that come to mind are mira mirth's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]], Myst Shadow's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], and Silens Cursor's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] by Voice of the Nephilim (who also wrote Elizium for the Sleepless Souls) retells the canon from Slytherin Harry's perspectives with some AU elements and much more grittiness. Have fun.

*** "Much more grittiness" is a good descriptor for pretty much all of Voice of the Nephilim's stories. Very appropriate for the thread.

** I'll second On the Way to Greatness. It's Slytherin Harry, so it's not an exact retelling, but the story is one of the better HP fanfics that I've read.

One of the darker fanfics that I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]. It takes place after canon in Azkaban. I'll leave it at that, because I really, really liked this story. It's setting and characterization where pluses for me. Not exactly a retelling, but definitely darker and grittier.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hollowed]] is categorized as horror for a reason. Definitely grittier.
