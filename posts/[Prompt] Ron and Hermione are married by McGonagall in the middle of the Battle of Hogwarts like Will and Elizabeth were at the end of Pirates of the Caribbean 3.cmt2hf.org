****** That's such a ridiculously over the top scene, middle of the climactic battle between three sides on a ship trapped in a whirlpool. I love it.

******** I still feel the first movie was the best, but I definitely have a soft spot for how they were able to find the line between "cool action" and "holy cow that's ridiculous" and then blithely rampage across it.

** Man, why do people just want to wholesale steal great scenes and dialogue from other medias so much? Why not come up with your own stuff? Can't say how many times I've read a HP fanfic and then there's just this whole paragraph of dialogue and actions lifted out of some other movie or TV show. It's as bad as people straight up copy-pasting scenes out of the canon books. Is it really too much to ask of /FANFICTION/ writers to have some damn creativity and imagination here?

*** Hmmmm. People using other people's ideas, characters, dialogue, settings, plot devices and fictional creations for their own creative purposes and enjoyment regardless of the fact that it was someone else's idea in the first place. Why does that sound familiar?
