i was looking for this story in my favourites list and couldn't find it. not helped that;

1, my favourites list is 750 items long for harry potter alone(near 2500 in total)

2, i dont remember the name

i think they were sent back to first year and his partner wasn't a witch the first time around.

i remember there being a deal with(i think) a dark elf relating to harry's staff

pretty sure the dark elf rapes them and removes the ending, and while the kid from the event is raised by harry, they are to give the kid up to the elf to be raised as the leader.

harry gets out of this by giving his kid the hogwarts letter at 11


** It's called "once more around the bend"
