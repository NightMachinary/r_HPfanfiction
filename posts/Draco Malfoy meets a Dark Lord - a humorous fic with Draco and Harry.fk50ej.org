Hey everyone, I'm writing this fic and looking for more readers.

The basic premise is this -- Draco goes to the zoo on the same day as Harry and the Dursleys, notices Harry talking to a snake, and the poor boy is convinced that Harry is a Dark Lord.

I published the first chapter a year ago, and only picked it up again a few days ago, so the writing style might be different starting the second chapter. Please give it a read and give your opinion if you can. Thank you.

Also, 4 chapters are uploaded, but the 4th one might not be showing yet, since I uploaded it ~15 minutes ago.


** I love the premise you set up, so I gave your fic a read.

I liked the subtle foreshadowing that Draco would become a Gryffindor from the start. And it makes sense- he's pretty brave to decide to befriend someone he thinks is a Dark Lord.

The "some wizarding families think they are better than others" bit is hilarious. It makes sense though, Harry based so many of his decisions on initial impressions and since his initial impressions are so different... *shrugs*

The only thing I would change to make it better is to add some sort of monologue in the first chapter really talking about how Parseltongue is the mark of a Dark Lord. The jump from him speaking Parseltongue to him being a fearsome Dark Lord feels a bit choppy, and I think adding a bit more context would help. You could talk about how other Dark Lords like Herpo the Foul or whatever spoke Parseltongue, and then regale the audience with over-the-top tales of their villainy.

Overall I liked your fic, the idea is very original and I especially like your characterization of Lucius.

*** Hey, thank you so much for giving it a read and for you detailed comment, I really appreciate it.

I'm happy that you enjoyed it, especially the characterization of Lucius, he's very fun to write in this way.

Thanks for your suggestion about the first chapter, I might rewrite it, since it was written a year ago (and was supposed to be a one-shot). Once more, thank you :)

** I just finished all four chapters, and have to say that I enjoy it so far. I really like the premise, and don't think I've seen something similar, at least for a while.

I'm at my work computer, and can log in to reddit, but not fanfiction, so I'll have to remember to give your story a follow later today.

Keep up the good work!

** Any plans for how long it's going to be / when you'll have it completed? I love the premise but generally avoid incomplete works.

*** Thanks for commenting. Honestly - no idea. I treat this as a fun and enjoyable way of getting back into writing and I just improvise the whole thing without planning beforehand. For the next few weeks, I should update with new chapters practically daily, since I'm at home for obvious reasons. When normal university classes start again, the update rate will certainly get slower. So, anyway, back to your question - sorry, but I don't really know.
