Hi guys, since I don't want to flood the forum with a bunch of seperate LF posts, here is a list of type of fics I hope you can help me with.

- Setting in the "cowboy" era
- Main char is a necromancer
- Main char is the master of sex slaves, where that kind of relationship is actually held like that instead of functioning as a way to give Harry a lot of wives who then command him around
- Main char is a feared student in Hogwarts, kinda like King/Queen of Slytherin
- Main char is the inhabitant of a nearby forest, and the villagers scare their children with legends about said char

Okay, I believe that's it at the moment. Please no Male/Male pairing, and extra cookie if the main char is a female ;)


** Closest i can think of that matches is linkffn(west of here by mk-one). Cowboy, check. Necromancer, check. Master of sex slaves, ... well he has just about all the hogwarts female population after him at one point or another. Feared student... well, he does scare everyone a few times. Villagers scared of him, well he is a sherrif.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

*** Addendum: you actually meant this as each option individually, a necromancer story that i liked is linkedffn(Knock 'em Dead). Incomplete though.

*** This story is terrible. The editing is nonexistent: I had to reread one sentence a dozen times before I realized the author was using for instead of 'fore.

What killed it though was Harry saying AK was created by healers to euthanize. One of the stupider cliches I see in fanfics.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** sex slaves:\\
not completed but does end at a good stopping point and some fantastic rough scenes in it, Harry gets a sex slave and then decides to get more. Path of Conquest [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=987]]

not actual sexslaves per say, however Harry has total control and does beat/dub/non con ginnny during sex also has violent 3way with ginny/hermoine. [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1567]]

(I know you asked for master fics but fem sub fics can be suprisingly good, when written in third person) incase you want a story where hermoine is a sub and gets abused/raped/ enslaved by her family [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1199]]

for a fun actual fic that isn't smut, FemHarry who is Bi (but no sex slaves or real lemons though decent teasing ) check out the Black princess trilogy by silently watches, although not a necromancer exactly she is dark vodoo / pleged for entirinty to the "baron of death" so kinda is. although its very !superHarry [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks]]

superlong fic with necromancy, feared by students (but in ravenclaw) and sex slaves, although they are kinda bossy but its more of ordering him to hurt them more so idk if youd like it. its more consenual BDSM than slaves. also has Tonks as a repressed subslut. oh yea also if its the story i'm thinking of all the hufflepuffs have secret massive orgies in the common room.
