In some fics Harry and/or Hermione get expelled from Hogwarts/magical Britain, or decide on their own that they'd prefer to study and live in the muggle society.

However, far too many times this is a sinple plot-device to allow them to be angry at the wizarding world when they return, so that their revenge which they inflict on not only all the ministry personell, but also everyone else the author wants to bash, is justified.

So I was wondering if there are any stories where Harry and Hermione both for one reason or another both drop out of Hogwarts and then go to a muggle school/university/job together, without later returning to the wizarding world. Whether Harry and Hermione have a romantic relationship or just best friends dynamic foesn't matter.

Suggestions?


** This sounds like a fantastic idea. I love the idea of Hermione (or Harry, but mostly Hermione) getting fed up with the magical world.

*** I can totally see her losing her shit right around year 3 or 4. In fact, I think before the first task of GoF would be the perfect timing.

Trolls? Plenty of non-magical creatures are dangerous to kids as well.

Dark Wizards? Whatever, Muggles have terrorists as well.

Deranged House-elf? You shouldn't piss off your servants, magic be damned.

Extremely lethal snake? Oh, Muggles have those! Wait, this one kills with a look... I suppose Harry did kill it and only almost died.

Demons that consume your soul and bring up your worst memories? Er, I suppose magic is worth it right?

My best friend is now trapped in an unbreakable contract that demands his participation in 3 deadly tasks or he no longer has magic. Lovely. Fuck this whole situation, lets look for loopholes.

--------------

GoF is my favorite place for a fic to diverge from canon for this reason. Magic has intent right? Part of the problem is likely that Harry ultimately accepted his own involvement. Harry and Hermione could have ditched the magical world and Barty Crouch Jr. might have found himself bound to participate instead.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.

They don't /necessarily/ return to the wizarding world, but they certainly interact with it. Don't know if this counts.

Also there is some bashing:

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!
