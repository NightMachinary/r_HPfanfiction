:END:
All I can remember from the fic is during a battle at the ministry snape kidnaps someone, and Harry kills a death eater takes a port key off of him then kills snape during the rescue, the only other detail I can remember is it was during the final battle with Voldemort and some of the auroras/unspeakables died due to people not realising they were suffocating. If anyone can help jog my memory it would be appreciated.


** The only one I can think of with the silence/suffocating combo was (I think) "Three to Step Back" by Sinyk. I don't remember the Snape part, though.
