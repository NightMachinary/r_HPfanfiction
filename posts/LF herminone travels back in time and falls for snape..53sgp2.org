But please please no children! I don't mind during the epilogue, but I cannot read crap where people think babies solve all problems.

Sorry. But any suggestions would be most appreciated:)

I will say is that I have not read all of these - they are the recommendations I collected last week when I asked for the same thing :) - I didn't stipulate "no babies" though.

There is at least one awesome one I read where Marauder Era Snape was thrown forward (temporarily) to a time post-Deathly Hallows and encounters Hermione who helps shelter him and keep him safe at the Grangers' home while they try to figure out how to return him to the timeline despite how unpleasant he is. Alas, I can't remember its author or a complete title, but it was along the line of "300 Days" or something similar. I do remember it was so named because it reflected the length of time he was forward in time and also the amount of time Hermione allows herself to grieve when she believes she is sending him back to die (as per the original timeline).

If you've read that one, I would dearly love to read it again so if anyone knows of it I would love a link.

Cheers

**** Well, there are no children in Thirty-One Days. I quite enjoyed it although something about the denouement just didn't quite track for me - still worth a read, though.

Pride of time will be next on the list over the weekend so I'll give you a heads up if it turns out to be a plot point

***** pride of time does have a kid BUT i still think you should give it a chance. It's a wonderful story with a really beautiful romance. The baby isn't really a focal point and definitely is not a 'babies solve everything plot point' seriously this is the ultimate hermione goes back in time and falls in love with snape fic I cannot recommend it enough.
