so fics where major characters happen to be LGBT+ in relationships (ie in 4th year). Ideally where it is not the main focus of the fic.


** I know that there's something like '' Harry Potter LGBT edition or something'' on ffnet but I didn't even try to read past the title.

  "U guys r pissing me off! Give me Hogwarts or I'll kill the girl" and he held Ginny Hostage. Harry smiled cheekly and everyone else gave Voldemortess that "You done goofed" looked.

  "That ain't Ginny. That's Bellatrix!" and Voldemortess gasped but it was too late! He already shot the "Adra Kalevala" killing spell! Belatrix screamed and died simulatlory.

A diverse inclusion of sexualities, genders and cultures will be featured. Year 1 to Year 7 of the journey. Harry/Hermione/Draco and Sirius/Lupin as well as other pairings...

** Smut is an integral part of any kind of queer HP fic. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to write one without it. I don't know this for a fact, but as it's never been done before...
