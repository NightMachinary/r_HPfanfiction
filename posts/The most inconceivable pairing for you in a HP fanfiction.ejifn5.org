Mine is a tie between HP/LV or HP/TMR and HP/BL

I... honestly don't understand how anyone can pair Harry with the man who killed his parents and attempted to kill him too üò≠ its the same reason for Bellatrix. Harry loved Sirius even though their time together was short. Harry ‚Äúwaking up and going dark‚Äù doesn't sensibly include forgiving Bellatrix in anyway. In fact, she'd prob be number 2 on his hit list.

What really gets me is when Harry is made to justify falling for Voldemort: many authors have him reason that he never really knew his parents.

Yikes üò≠

Canon gives us no clue for a lot of ships but I think sometimes good arguments can be made for a lot of ships. I think the problem is a lot of people tend to throw hate toward ships with unpopular characters (Snape and Malfoy for example) so people really have to defend it pretty hard since not a lot of people like them and can get mean about it. I've personally experienced this and tend to stay out of arguments lol

#+end_quote

If I recall correctly, canon never said whether or not the Diary was aware/awake when not interacting with someone. I've read good fanfics that go either way on the matter, but I think that Diary!Riddle in canon would have turned out much more obviously insane if he had actually been endlessly awake while trapped in isolation without a body for 50 years.

#+begin_quote
  Technically Voldemort, not sure canon Harry could get over that (Had the roles been switched, He would have become Voldemort and Voldemort would have been him. They're one and the same.)
#+end_quote

In fics which handle this pairing well, there's typically a period of Harry getting emotionally close to Tom for a year or more before realizing that he is Voldemort. In my opinion it's realistic that a person would feel torn after finding out that a close friend/romantic interest was not who they thought. Even in the original book Harry didn't write Tom off immediately after finding out the truth, and that was only after having spoken to Tom one time. Harry only killed him because he was given no other choice. Imagine how much more emotionally conflicted Harry would have been if he had started to develop feelings for Riddle over the course of months spent together before the truth came out.

The storyline in such fics also usually shows that Tom has changed due to his hellish experience trapped in the Diary and/or that getting to know Harry forces him to realize how wrong his prejudice and hatred has been. At that point Harry sees the evidence that Tom is /not/ the same person as Voldemort and is growing into a better person, so it's a little easier for Harry to separate his different feelings towards Voldemort and Diary!Riddle in his mind.

** When I first read about HP/LV I didn't even realise what that meant till later, I just kinda glanced over it and moved on. Only later did I remember the pairing and think: ‚ÄòWait, Voldemort is 55 when Harry is 1 year old.' That means he's 65 when he first meets Harry with any personality. And 68 when they spend longer than 5 minutes talking to each other. This is a little bit old for poor 14 year old (and way too young) Harry. So about 6 years later, Voldemort isn't dead and isn't as evil or something. Oh yeah, he's also 74 now. And Harry is only 20. :/

(If they were muggles, and got married a year later, they'd have most likely 5-10 years together. And Harry would be a widower (a gay widower?) at 25-30)

I will also defend Harry/Tom as a fun example of what someone should look for when they read some seriously fucked up stuff. I'm writing a Harry/fem!Riddle fic and it's a lot of fun to have her slowly corrupt him.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

And while those can be explained with the stupidity of youth, those were highly impactful events for Hermione and would have left a lasting impact.
