** Well, Grindelwald is kind like that in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929). But it happens after Dumbledore's death, and he allies with Harry. On the other hand, his army slaughtered Death Eaters, their Ministry minions, and many others.
