I've already read linkffn(Stages of Hope) and linkffn(The World I Leave Behind), among others, and both were great. Does anyone have any other suggestions?


** *His Mother's Love*, linkffn(10132530): Harry forced Dumbledore to come clean during his first 'private lesson' in year 6, and things worked out rather nicely.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): Harry's horcrux was sentient and made a deal with him shortly after Sirius died, but Voldemort was hardly his worst enemy.

*Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, linkffn(10959290): Hermione had a powerful special ability, and Dumbledore decided to come clean early.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): they found out before year 4 was over, but they knew a ritual to get it out.

*The Thorny Rose Series*, linkffn(9631998;9969456;10288020): Ginny retained all Diary Tom's memories, knew about Horcruxes, and told Harry after year 4.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
