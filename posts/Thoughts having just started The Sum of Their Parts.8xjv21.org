I have just started reading The Sum of Their Parts and first of all, I love it and I'm really grateful for the recommendation. I feel like because it is so good I'm holding it to higher standards, and this is somewhat distracting for me. I have two major criticisms and I'm wondering if they resolve as the story gets going more. 1) I don't feel Ron's presence very much. I wonder if the author had a hard time writing him and that makes him more quiet. 2) The dark stuff isn't balanced well with hang out fluffy time. Don't get me wrong, I really like the dark stuff and the get down to business, but I miss just seeing my characters enjoy each other's company too.

Other than that I love the additions to the world building and I feel like the character motivations are clear and make sense. I'm really enjoying it so far! Just wondering if those of you who have already read it have some thoughts.

Ron is just as important as Hermione in this fic. He and George, not Hermione, are Harry's most die-hard supporters.

This fic is more about dark stuffs. Even though the actual pairing is the Trio, the author decided to cut out all romantic moments.

*** I think I probably just want it to be another book and it's not. I'm definitely enjoying it but probably need to put it in a different category in my head.

** The story is non-extant; there is a black hole of thought, logic, emotion, and anything else between the first and last words of the teasing worthless piece of /bleep/ that is "The Sum of Their Parts".

What is this __________ ...oh, nevermind.
