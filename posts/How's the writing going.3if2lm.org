** So I finally made an account on AO3 after ages and ages of writing fics and not finishing them, or hiding them from everyone because I was terrified that I'm an awful writer and no one will like my work. I decided to start doing one shots because I always start something intended to be long and then never finish it, so I put out a bunch of short stories in the past week and I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED to actually feel like I'm accomplishing something other than just mental exercise.

However, now all of my long fics have once again taken to the back burner and I'm not sure if I'll ever finish one. .-. Bleh. I just start thinking about "oh god how is this fic supposed to end?" because one of the main characters is supposed to die or canon wouldn't work out properly if I didn't kill off the OC... it's so daunting. ; ;

*** YOU GO! The first leap is the hardest. The first six months I wrote fic in earnest, I swore I would stop writing as soon as I finished my first story. It's been five years. Everyone thinks old writing is terrible, but look at it as how far you've come. You can't get to where you are today without covering all that past ground, and for that, be proud.

Finishing a story is one of the most exciting things! They're definitely a commitment with highs and lows, and making a story feel complete thematically is much more than crunching out words. KEEP WRITING is really the best advice as grueling as it sounds; I explain a bit more [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/91667086429/keep-writing][here]] (because I don't like that advice on its own). I hope you can push to that point for one of your longer stories.

Also, canon is overrated in my opinion ;) I think you should do whatever services /your/ story best. Maybe try going wildly off path with how you're thinking about the story (what happens if tragedy strikes elsewhere; if someone betrays in desperation etc ); sometimes you get absurd but amazing ideas that actually fit with your plans.

The thought of someone actually visiting my profile and waiting for me to put up something new was just... gah. ; ; <3

That link was great, thanks!

I think the nice thing about trying to work with canon at first, is that I tend to start thinking really out of the box in terms of plot points to try to get my stuff to seem coherent. I think you've made me more comfortable with the idea that I can diverge from canon even if it's just a little bit, because who's to say Voldemort didn't somehow learn you only had to disarm the owner of the Death Stick so Snape didn't have to die?! /Ahem./ So yeah, thank you. :3

***** Trust me, there's an entire subset of fandom that is only interested in very non-canon things :D Me personally, if I want canon, I'd read the books. I'm in fanon for the what-ifs, original ideas, and the stories we don't see. Canon characterization and following the spirit of the book is usually all I need.

A work is not lesser for not following canon, because canon is not the end-all, be-all. It's the inspiration, not to mention that canon can be deficit. When you write, you've created a new work on its own. It can be, but does not have to be, limited by the source material.

** Not especially well.

I currently have 3.5 stories in process.

Shadow of Angmar is my main focus and the next chapter is now than half done. However my computer finally popped its clogs last week and so everything's on hold. Also I'm battling with creating an entirely new culture, architecture and language for the new people that Harry will be encountering. It's slowed things down a lot.

A New Man only has 1000 or so words written towards the next chapter. It was easy to write (much easier than Angmar) but it is also the story that readers are most dubious of due to the setup.

Harry Potter and the Sun Queen has about half a chapter waiting. It's mostly action and not too difficult to do. But it's also my least popular fic. It was also the first thing I wrote, so the story isn't really planned in any meaningful way.

Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous is the 0.5. Chapters for this mostly happen very quickly in a single sitting after a moment of inspiration. No moments recently, sadly.

On top of my computer dying I'm also still trying to find the best way to fit my writing around the new job. But I'm determined to never abandon anything, even if it might mean weeks between updates.

*** I'm very much enjoying reading Shadow of Angmar. It's nice reading a middle-earth crossover that's not a rerun of the hobbit+LoTR with Harry smashing the life out of everything. I've not read the silmarillion, as I tried reading children of Hurin which drained my enthusiasm for the series, so everything is fresh and interesting for me in your fic. I'm enjoying him not having a wand just yet and I'm excited for your next chapter.

The elves most fabulous is hilarious and whenever an email comes through about an update everything gets dropped and for the rest of the day I'm in a brighter mood.

The power he knows not was a nice read that was short enough to get through in a sitting, it was an ideal length and was more interesting than any other rerun I've read. The ending was particularly good.

** It's going with ups and downs. Just had a lot change in my personal life, so updates have been on hold for the past 2.5 months. I've just started continuing my first and only (thus far) fanfiction. I'm pretty excited about the story though. As my first story, I was extremely nervous about the reception, especially since the premise of the story has some clichés (wrong BWL, abused by Dursleys and different name) which can put people off. But, I've been told I did them rather well and didn't fall in any pitfalls like illogical reasoning and straight up bashing. Which comforts me, because I like those clichés but I've often found them poorly written, completely over the top and illogical.

Now I'm barely passed 60k words and have nearly 1.5k follows and more than 1k favourites, which I find a good accomplishment for my first fanfiction as a non-English writer ,and it's a huge motivator to continue writing.

My current troubles are writing natural conversations. Not sure if it's just my perspective as an author, but it's difficult to write good conversations that don't feel forced, especially for eleven year olds. Which makes me somewhat regret not having the story start in fourth-year like I was tempted to do at first, but I didn't want the story littered with flashbacks. The plot is going along nicely, I've figured out enough for at least 200k words, the only thing now is putting all those thoughts in actual content.

Anyone got any tips on how to write good dialogues?

*** Write out the conversation without worrying about how people talk- just get the rhythm of it down and make sure you're hitting all the points you need to cover.

Then (and this is the part many beginning writers miss) go back through the conversation, concentrating on one character's lines- do they sound right for their age/education/background/knowledge? The biggest pitfall is not checking that someone is talking about something they wouldn't know about.

For each character, pare down or add to the wording so it sounds more like them. This is especially useful for Hagrid, the Delacours and house-elves.

** I'd say I'm a perfectionist when it comes to writing. While this did great works writing essays and the likes, when it comes to free literature writing, it means that I'm never happy with what I write. It's never good enough, ever.

Even if my writing skills were on par with a truly skilled wordsmith like King, I'm fairly sure I'd still be dissatisfied with my writing. And as a non-native amateur, it's a recipe for disaster.

Anyway, I have a single paragraph of a Naruto story written. I'm happy with the paragraph. It took me several hours to write. This story isn't going anywhere, and I keep this paragraph as a reminder.

For a HP story I haven't yet decided upon what it's really going to be about, I've written 10 pages on a compendium on various knowledge for the AU world, I've written a scene where Grindelwald speaks to his followers after returning (I'm still not happy with it - writing a master orator without any particular speechcraft skills is hard, and even lifting some lines from our friend Adolf hasn't helped much,) so I'll probably drop that, too.

I've also got a time-line for a rough European war involving both wizards and muggles, which I'm definitely not happy with - trying to find a plausible way to integrate into muggle warfare, and vise versa, is really bloody hard. How Marquis Black ever did it will forever amaze me - I did lift the idea to remove nuclear weaponry from the equation from him though, it helped a lot.

I have a few chapters of a fic that starts out as a Renegade Cause clone and then spirals wildly, but I'm not particularly happy with it. About the time I had Harry become a terrorist in an effort to appease a nazi veteran so he could get to one of Voldemort's horcruxes, I realized I had no clue what I was doing and my plot was ridiculous. That story is probably dead too.

A week ago I got the idea to just write scenes I wanted to write, roughly label the date in the timeline it occurs and try to build a library that I can later compile for a story. I have this;

- 1993 - 09. September - Harry duels Dean Thomas in DADA
- 1995 - 22 September - Hermione awakens the Elder Ones
- 1996 - 09.September - Harry fights Theodore Nott in the dungeon
- 1996 - 12.December - Harry participates in the Berlin Yule Coup

I'm still not sure what causes the AU - I for sure want to make the Diary piece take residence in Harry's scar and absorb the other Horcrux there (this has to be my favourite trope!), but I'm trying really hard to keep Riddle /Riddle/, manipulative, cold and uncaring.

As it turns out, having a genius with 60 years of experience really makes manipulating a teenager rather easy.

Essentially, I want to have this as a multi-POV epic where I do all I can to avoid characters acting stupidly and falling into classic fantasy failings.

Every character has aspirations and goals and will do what they can to achieve them, even if it infringes on the "master plot". Voldemort won't decide to become an idiot and a magical imbecile that can only use one spell just so Harry can triumph on a technicality. Just a weenie bit of the skill he showed against Dumbledore in OOTP would have crushed Harry in Hallows, protections or not. After so many failings, any intelligent character would just squash Harry indirectly or have someone else do it.

It's really hard though. How can Harry be relevant in a world that doesn't revolve around him? He'd be outclassed totally by so many players.. and this is true, and my greatest challenge. If anyone has any ideas on how to improve that, I'd gladly hear them. For now my plan is that Riddle wants to "help" Harry destroy /evil/ Voldemort and helps him gather the Horcruxes. I think you get what horcrux Riddle wants to do.

I'm considering reusing the terrorist plotline and have a horcrux be placed inside Grindelwald's bunker, which was, after Voldemort placed it there, sealed by some of Grindelwald's followers and for some reason I've yet to flesh out be impossible to break open. Thus, Harry would need to convince them to let him inside. Cue Wizarding SS Officer Harry Potter further on. I've never seen a pretty-much-a-nazi!Harry, and it'd be interesting to explore his character essentially being forced into this. Also, Grindelwald as a player and an ally (or master..?) of Harry would level the playing field a great bit.

And it'd be a great motivator for a larger scale war, too.

Anyway, I'm struggling a lot with actually writing this - there's so much empty room to be filled, characters that needs to be built.. Multi-POV is a great amount of work - for example, I doubt my Hermione will get into interesting things before in fifth year, but I still need to build her character before that and show her changed experiences.

With a probably Slytherin!Harry sorting, I see Hermione being all alone and +possibly+ bullied - a completely asocial Hermione with no attachments seems like a great springpad for interesting storytelling.

If you have any ideas on how I can make the outline above less titanic to try and tackle, that'd be great, too.

*** That's super ambitious! You might be encouraged if you find a writing buddy to trade ideas and critiques with. You did a good writeup of your idea here. There might be someone on the sub who's interested in doing that. It's ok to "shop around" for writing buddies, too; not everyone fits. Try it out with a few casual chats. Also, I skimmed the drafts. I'm not the audience for fight scenes, but I'll that you might want to watch out for unnecessary description and adverbs. Kill your darlings and keep the best description. It makes the fight scene go quicker. On that note, not everything has to be a complete sentence and experimenting with styles can make the scene more dynamic.

Since it's so huge, work on this fic one arc/story at a time. You've got an idea of what happens later, but things change, especially as you develop as a writer. JKR didn't plan out HP entirely either when she started. There is no point is plotting out every detail of twentieth chapter if you cannot finish writing the fifth. Actually writing is the hardest part of writing.

Allow yourself some mistakes and retcons. Our most popular media is rife with mediocre bits, including HP. Since your project is ambitious, sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and go, "oops, gonna go back and edit this characterization" or "oops, dropping this subplot out of nowhere." I'm a perfectionist too, but I try to be a practical perfectionist. Think about how much you complain about things you love and how you still love them anyway. Give yourself that same space.

It's actually my most popular fic right now, too. It started as a satire of next gen romcoms and became an elaborate commentary of fandom, mob mentality, and the media. It reads like a mature contemporary YA. The beginning is still kind of bad, but I can't be bothered to edit because I'm rewriting it into an original when I'm done.

There will be people who love your story and people who hate it, regardless of how popular or well-regarded it is. Some people can't deal with that, and if you're not passionate about improving your writing, then that's okay. Criticism (from yourself or others) is not an easy thing to take; seasoned pros can have a hard time dealing with it, too. But I'd look on the bright side, knowing there are some people out there who will enjoy your story, and you will improve. It's a grueling initial curve to good writing, but you'll get there.

So why do I write it? One day I just got tired of not finding the exact kind of story I wanted to read so I decided to just write it myself.

One story I'm writing that's pretty fun is one where Draco and Harry are both competing for Hermione's affections and she is torn between the two.

That's exactly why I started writing and why I continue to write! I was tired of seeing heroines I could not relate to.

I know I'm leaving a lot of cheesy encouragement in this thread but: everyone is terrible at writing at first, and no one makes great things until the world intimately knows their mediocrity. So don't think of your writing as contributing to the crap; think of it as preparing to contribute something great. Your fic sounds fun! I hope you find some inspiration.

I see Remus as a kind but often cowardly soul in canon. And dangerously neglectful in the third book. In my story Dhampirs often act as monster hunters, hunting monsters for bounties and/or body parts (werewolves' pelts), so when he meets my OC he isn't too fond of her and starts harassing her in class.

I'm currently in the confrontation after class, he's just tried to summon any and all weapons she's carrying from her, and now they're standing alone in a classroom, he has his wand and her dagger pointed at her, she has her long knife pointed at him. She has her wand but not in her hand yet. Basically they're in a bad situation that I wanted them in, but now I have to get them out of it in a realistic manner.

  Lorcan McLaird was born no later than 1906, somewhere in the British Isles. His surname suggests he was Scottish, or had Scottish ancestry. In his youth, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Ravenclaw. McLaird rose to the office of Minister for Magic of Great Britain and Ireland in 1923. He was quite a talented wizard, but was considered something of an eccentric, as he liked to communicate by puffing smoke from the tip of his wand. Eventually, he was forced out of office in 1925 due to irritation at his eccentricities.\\

Complaining is fun, but we've been having a needless amount of those threads, and it has consequences like discouraging new authors. People are pretty good about saying everyone has different taste here, but I still see a lot of unpopular interests (slash and such) downvoted for no reason at all. I don't like most things rec'd here - heck, I don't read anything with Harry as a lead - but I'm not contributing anything by downvoting people who want to read that. I'm active here because I want to make sure people who have more obscure interests in the fandom feel welcome.

And definitely write what you want to write! I write mostly OCs, too. It's a hard genre to break out in, but regular updates, review swaps, and other advertising can get you readers, if you care about that :)

*** Just a thought on the discouragement:

Anyone writing a story would love for it to be wildly popular and praised, but even the most popular stories have detractors. What you write is first off for you, and you post it to see if others like your ideas.

Not ALL others- just a receptive audience.

** I've hit a snag. I'm writing a story about the daughter of Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange. Kreacher took her when her parents were captured and then she went on to live in Grimmauld with the elf and the paintings (+Walburga for the first five years) The whole world thinks she'd died.

I've finished all of the pre-Hogwarts stuff (Prologue, home life, Diagon Alley, etc) but now that I've reached Hogwarts, I'm not entirely sure what to do. I want her to develop a friendly relationship with Draco because she has to be invited to Malfoy Manor for Christmas in order for the next big plot point to play out but she's quite a hostile person and Draco's a wimp, they just don't fit together all too well.

I could have Draco inviting her on his mother's orders, but then I'm not certain how I would write that either.

*** Do you think Draco would be a show off? Sort of like how he tried to impress Harry initially. He managed to get cronies early in Hogwarts. Do you think he'd get it in his head that he'd have to show this girl the ropes and recruit her into his inner circle? If she's hostile, what are her weak spots? Is she lonely or curious or naive (I love the combination of pride hiding naivety)?

*** One of my favorite moments as a writer was when I finished my previous next gen, because the very ending is that kind of scene, where I'd been waiting to write it for two years. It was the easiest thing to write, more perfect on paper than I could have imagined, and I'm still happy when I reread it even if I would tweak a sentence here or there now ;)

That's super super exciting! I hope to make this topic a bi-weekly/monthly sort of thing, so you can post an update then :D After answering the subreddit survey, I figured if I want more topics for authors, I can start by making them myself.

***** Hmm, then I'd suggest trying one of the above! Writer's block is common, and treating it is like treating a cold. You can try a little bit of everything and eventually it goes away. Read a book or other fic and focus on how they write, write something entirely different - something short you can finish in a night, make an inspiration board, or just do something else entirely and come back to your story a little later.

*** Hey, you've already done the hardest part! Actually writing :D I see quite a few grammar errors - run-ons, incorrect punctuation, incorrect verbs and such; I don't know if this is a first draft thing, but take note if you haven't. Like the first sentence of chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  It was still well before dawn when Hermione rose and showered, slipping into sober, navy blue robes and shoes and taking extra care with her hair, smoothing it into a low chignon, even adding a touch of lipstick today.
#+end_quote

is saying that she put on her robes and shoes while showering, and it sounds like the lipstick is applied to her hair. It's also generally confusing.

And look up resources on how to "show not tell", which I know is vague advice, but I can try to elaborate with some examples.

#+begin_quote
  She patted the wand at her waist in the way that was the habit of years
#+end_quote

What is the way that makes it seem like the habit of years?

#+begin_quote
  Hermione knew he was afraid
#+end_quote

How?

#+begin_quote
  The memorial service had gone well she thought, Kingsley spoke eloquently but, as always, it was Harry the crowd came to see.
#+end_quote

This sentence contains redundant information. You can leave it as "Kingsley spoke eloquently but, as always, it was Harry the crowd came to see" which is the more showy part.

And of course, there's always a balance. Telling isn't a sin; it's very good for getting through unimportant information (No need for "Kingsley spoke with the blessed voice of gods" unless it's relevant!). But lengthy bouts of telling are tedious. Showing is better at building scenes, managing pacing, and directing focus on what's important. Note: showing isn't just tacking on a bunch of adjectives either. It's definitely a style thing though, so it'll develop as you write!

** Ugh. Lousy. I signed up for three fests because having a firm deadline is the only way I actually get anything written anymore, but while I know where I want the story I'm currently working on to go, every time I sit down to write, the words disappear from my head! It's very frustrating. And it's the only one of the three I actually have plotted, and all are due between two weeks from now and the end of October. :/

** Ever get stuck looking for something horrible to do to a character but you're just not feeling it? Whether for or against Umbridge, I'm just stuck.

That's not the big problem, though. The big problem is the sex thing. Love writing it, but sometimes it doesn't seem plausible that Dumbledore (or at least McGonagall) would allow for witches to hook up with the Chosen One without punishment.

At the same time I'm balancing on a dangerous edge when it comes to taking Ginny into the adult realm. For Hermione, she's almost a year older than Harry and already acts more mature than the rest, but Ginny...

Y'know what? Fuck it. Story charges forward.

**** The wording may have been inexact; my problem is that the school should feel locked down and oppressed by Umbridge even more than normal administrative oversight, but Harry is moving around more freely than ever, making it hard to escalate- how often can Harry be tortured before Umbridge should have enough cause to just expel him?

Upon reconsideration, it might be the ultimate defiance for Harry to be getting a rep as a sex pirate despite her chronic oppression. After all, a rep isn't reality.

*** Horrible things to do to characters I love? Easy. Horrible things to do to the awful ones? Yeah, I got nothing.

I made peace a long time ago with how ridiculous some of things that happen in my stories are. I set out to let my fic be 'fun' and the free reign I let myself have with it has produced some of my best writing. Sometimes you have to give up plausibility if it means you can create better things out of it.
