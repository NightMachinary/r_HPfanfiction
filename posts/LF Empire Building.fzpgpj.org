I've had enough of Hogwarts, of tiny children acting like adults, of all this promise for some large-scale actions only for the fic to be abandoned right after a crucial plot point. Where are the fics that skip straight to using all that magical, social, and political power?


** for a wizards supposed longevity there seems to be two generations of wizards only. That's why the Charlus and Dorea Potter fics are great, because they bring in so much more to the stories with numerous allies and enemies more than school children and pencil pushers

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321][October]] is a little rough at the start, but it's the only Harry Potter fanfic I've found that's both of good quality and has large-scale literal world building.

** Linkffn(core threads) gets into making an island for the citizens, has basically achieved autonomy and harry is god

Oh and it starts at the kinda end like 2/3 through the fic so, I somehow think you wont like it much.

** Linkffn (Rise of the Wizards) has this towards the half way point I think? There's some time skips. Amazing fanfic in my opinion.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] has an ungodly amount of bashing/exposition in my opinion, and that kind of put me off reading it. I do thank you for the rec.

**** I agree on the bashing part, I wasn't the biggest fan. It ass interesting that it was slightly different than the usual bashing but still annoying. And no problem!
