  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  My take on the 'Potter in Azkaban' theme. Harry and Daphne have spent the last 4 years in Azkaban for a crime they did not commit. Dark! Powerful! & Unforgiving! Harry & Daphne. Graphic violence, sexual situations and some dark humour.

** I'm shocked and appalled that the clearly best story for this category hasn't been mentioned yet:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

It actually tries to take the issue somewhat seriously and does not entirely frame it in a comic-book or dark vs light RPG style. It's more about the repercussions than the actual killings though - you know, the interesting bits.

Summary: They call him Blackmoor. They call him a dark lord. They have only themselves to blame for the man Harry Potter became. When the Light Movement strikes a personal blow in their efforts to control him, Harry will risk everything to take back the life stolen from him and show them all the true folly of provoking the Master of Death. Harry/Hermione/Draco, time travel, 140K words.

Currently the body count is 44. And she's only counting the ones directly killed by the main characters. The body count is actually given at the top of each post.

This is a challenge fic she's at least planning to finish this month. Projected total word count is 175K.
