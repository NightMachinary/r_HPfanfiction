Like Harry being a criminal, in gangs, and stealing cars and shit? I'm not talking about the actual GTA plotline. In other words, it doesn't need to be a crossover.

** Mix it with Part 5 of JoJo's with Death Eaters and that right there is a banging premise.

Harry Potter joins the DE to assassinate Voldemort and become the new leader to control other new crime groups that have entered magical Britain and have led to his best friend Ron Weasley dying because of an OD.
