Does anyone have any good dragon harry fics, been reading a few lately and I'm hooked. Ex. linkffn(Breath of the Inferno) No slash. Complete stories are preferred. Also are these fics rare or am I just not looking in the right places. I would have expected this to be a popular OP!Harry trope :(

  [HIATUS - Read Profile!] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

He is a dragon animagus, but it's not really a major plot point.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called â€˜The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.
