I've been lurking around this sub for a while and I wanted to see if some of you know of a fanfic like this.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][*A Butterfly Effect.*]] In this fic, Diary!Tom is a bit difficult to explain without giving some really great {great = uber creepy} plot elements away. Let's just say that his corporeal form plays a huge role in the second, third, and {I assume} fourth book {which is only two chapters in}.

** The Tom that appears in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] sticks around in some form of another, and has some POV, but he's not the main villain. I enjoy the story, strongly AU, but well written.
