There's a post here from 3 years ago that has lots of recommendations (I don't remember who the op was but thank you so much), but I'm 98% sure that it doesn't cover all the good Drarry fanfiction out there and 100% sure I'm not the only one that loves this ship

So please comment all the ones you think are good, regardless of the length, plot, genre whatever and we can all exchange our favourites and it'll be great (I hope). Also please don't leave me hanging, it would be awful (if you do I'll delete this, pretend it never happened and post again some other day)


** I asked a friend and they sent me these:

#+begin_quote
  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/119096]] (Lord of the rings crossover with Draco/Harry, it's good! Trust me!)

So I've read hundreds of Harry potter fics and I'm 100% certain that I have a decent amount of drarry fics HOWEVER FF.net is rubbish at organising stuff so I've got to troll through my follows and see what I've got which might take a while so.... Yeah.

I shall succeed!!!! (⌐■-■)

(The one above which I recommend, it really is one of the few drarry crossovers I've got so don't worry! Not all my fics are like that! )

I'll be back... Might take a few hours since I should be asleep but I WILL be back! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5114608]])

So there are these ones (which I got from a quick run through my follows) but there seemed to be a growing trend of Draco being Harry's best friend and not partner. Which is not what I'm looking for!!!

I'm going to check AO3 again. I have a bad habit of not saving everything I read so when I want to find something, it's not there. /sigh/

  Draco Malfoy wouldn't go back to England for anything less than an exceptional case. Being asked to figure out why Harry Potter can't control his magic might be exceptional enough to qualify.

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.
