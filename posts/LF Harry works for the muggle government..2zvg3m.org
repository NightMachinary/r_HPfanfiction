Is there a fic where Harry is recruited/works for the muggle government in order to rid the MoM of corruption or spy on the magical world for the muggles?

  Title pretty much says it all. OotP AU, some swear words. No pairing, though HP/HG is hinted at a little. Harry does what he should have done. Complete for now. Author's Note added!

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

*** I was liking it up until Dumbledore's POV. I thought I had seen character bashing before, but /holy shit/. Some of the thoughts he was having were more worthy of Lucius Malfoy. He was given no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

** Try this: "A seventh-year saga that begins one hour after Dumbledore's funeral. Harry gets some unexpected and unexpectedly useful help from the Muggle World...so much that wonders whether the power he knows not is actually the British monarchy!

** I vaguely recall a fic where Harry is turned into a squib after Voldemorts failed attack and stays in the muggle world instead of going to Hogwarts. I believe he eventually works for the government along with Hermione (who left Hogwarts after the troll attack) and is kind of dragged into the wizarding war after Scrimgeour learns of the prophecy.

There's also one where Harry leaves after the war after killing Voldemort. I think he won after Dumbledore shoved him outside Hogwarts and locked the door while Voldemort was on his way to siege the castle. He never forgave them and left. He later teams up with the muggle government after the wizards kidnap his kid.

Someone else will have to link these. I don't think either were particularly good, but they seem to be exactly what you're looking for.

** Was reminded of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8465414/1/Agent-Potter][Agent Potter]] which is a HP/James Bond crossover. YMMV, but I found it an enjoyable read.

** Why the fuck would Harry spy for the muggles? He hated his time in the muggle world and all of his friends are magical.

*** Probably because his friends don't run the magical world. If the people he likes are stuck in the clutches of an oppressive culture, seeking help from an outside source would make sense.

Elements of this come up in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][HP and Merlin's Reaper]], where Harry is transported to a dystopian AU where Voldemort won but the muggles aren't quite subjugated yet.

*** That's stretching it a bit. he hated the Dursleys sure, but he has no hate against muggles or muggleborns in general.

It's the opposite in fact, he hated the purebloods and the corruption of the magical government.

**** I think it's a bit more nuanced than that. There is hatred for the government corruption that happens to be perpetuated by purebloods/pureblood supporters. Its hardly like he hates the fact that Arthur Weasley married Molly Prewitt rather than a non-pureblood.

Yes, certainly his encounters with magic-ignorant muggles weren't good (how bad I suppose depends on your interpretation on how much he was abused). But the wizarding world hardly treats him any better.
