If anyone could recommend any, I'd finally be able to stop rereading abandoned stories while looking for complete well-written ones. No slash and I'd prefer if it were on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

Since I'm posting anyways, I wanted to ask about a line in A Cadmean Victory (I do not forgive. I do not forget). I loved the fic, but I see a lot of people talk about that in a negative light. It is cringey though.

If anyone wants to check the fic out, here you go. linkffn(A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** "I do not forgive. I do not forget." It is cringy. There's also just some really bad characterization. I put it in the same class as rise of the wizards. It is a very interesting premise, has quite a few interesting ideas, but the writing, is only alright.

***** I find it extremely annoying when people decide to just write whatever comes into their head. I don't mind most tropes, but I've read around 400 Lord!Harry fics and I think only about 60 were any good. From those 60, 30 would be abandoned or on indefinite hiatus. That's part of the reason I made a Reddit account, so I could ask for good fics.

That may be a bit hypocritical of me since I'm a 13-year-old who has 7 different stories in the works, but I at least /try/ to keep any grammar mistakes to a minimum. I write the stories in a book, give it a read, type it into Microsoft Word, use the inbuilt review feature, plug the document into Grammarly then give it a final read through before storing it safely on my laptop.

******* I mentioned grammar because that's the only thing that I can relate to. Except for how hard it is to turn an idea into a story. Plot is definitely a big headache though. I remember reading stories where, using lordship as an example again, Harry is emancipated and suddenly becomes Lord Potter Black Peverell Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Slytherin Emrys Le Fey Pendragon. Then suddenly Dumbledore is evil, the Weasleys are after his money, Hermione either realises she's madly in love with Harry or is in with the Weasleys, and Harry is a jerk.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Anything by jbern really, especially linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness).

linkffn(A Champion's New Hope).

If you like Super Harry there's linkffn(Honour Thy Blood).

And there's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend), its sequel is currently WIP. Not far enough into the series for Harry to be powerful, but he's definitely smarter than canon.
