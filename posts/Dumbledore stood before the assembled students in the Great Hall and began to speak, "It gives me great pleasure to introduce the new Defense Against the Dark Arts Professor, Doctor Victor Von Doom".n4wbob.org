** Harry keeps unintentionally impressing Doom by sheer accident.

People who follow the muggle world are horrified, but clueless witches and wizards are impressed.

"See, Hannah! I always said there was something special about Potter beyond gossip."

Susan's smug smile had Hannah wanting to throttle her: Why couldn't anyone see that Professor Doom was evil?

His name was Doom, for god's sake!

** Imagine if it resulted in Voldemort aggroing Doom: Crazy and amoral he may be, but Victor Von Doom is a genius-level intellect. If he could get the necessary information, possibly by working with Harry, he'd probably have a pretty easy time getting most of the Horcruxes.

** Doom is not a nice person but at least you'd get a proper education with him there. Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort might even annoy him enough that he'd spend an hour to destroy them all.

****** Honestly, I think both that and a Doombot are equally likely.

(Though if anything, you'd think Von Doom would teach at Durmstrang).

** The buzz in the DADA classroom is only growing louder as the new professor is a minute late. Harry wonders where he is, or why he would decide to be late at all. The Dursley's were extremely focused on punctuality.

He looks down at the hairs on his arm as they stand in end, and looks over to Hermione and Ron, who also seem to feel a disturbance of sorts. He tackles them to the floor just as a thick stone wall of the chamber were blasted open.

Up close, he was even more intimidating than when he had been a hall away. Easily over six and a half feet tall, and in an armor of sorts with the green tunic, he looked like a mystic knight of some sort. Intense brown eyes stare at the class, and seem to be judging all of them harshly.

“Uh, professor? What was that?” Harry hears himself ask before he can stop himself. His friends try to hush him, but it's too late. The large and armored man's head turns towards him.

“Ah, yes. Harry Potter. I've heard many things about you. That, Potter, was how /Doom/ enters a room. How do YOU do it, young man?” With a casual wave of his hand, the stones begin to rearrange themselves on the wall, repairing themselves as he stands expectantly.

“Er...I would say through the door, sir.” Harry rubs the back of his neck, not understanding the question. Doom scoffs, a strange sound coming from an otherwise deadly serious figure.

“The door? Like a peasant?”

If it was one thing Professor Victor Von Doom's class taught him, Harry thinks looking back, it was how to make an entrance.
