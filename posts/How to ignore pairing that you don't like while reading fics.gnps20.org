** Heh, I skip any Harry/Daphne story. Can't stand the OC hype, especially if it goes with "The Death Eaters had a point; pureblood culture yay, mudblood values boo" attitude, and the "the Weasleys are barbarians, only a pureblood princess can teach Harry pureblood culture!!!" bashing.

But I've changed my opinions on pairings in the past, mostly because of the portrayal of the characters and ships. If you've read too many stories that bash Hermione and Ginny - and, as a Harry/Daphne fan, you probably have; both tend to be bashed in those stories - you might need to read stories where these two characters are portrayed favourably and - and this is important - the plot has a hook that still draws you in. Like "Growing up Kneazle" for Ginny, for example.

** I'm not a big fan of Harmony myself but I can enjoy a well written fic with that pairing. You just need to get lost in the narrative.

** My first suggestion would be to look at the author pages of your favorite stories and see if they've written stories for another pairing. Chances are if you liked their style of writing it will translate over. Also, maybe look into Marauders era stories. No chance for being annoyed with who Harry is paired with that way. :).

*** I've seen Marauder era fanfiction with Harry paired with Bellatrix.

** I just don't read those fics. But then, I don't particularly care about pairings, one way or another, though I due tend to like “Lunar Harmony”

The only pairings I tend to avoid are slash with Harry, especially with significant age gaps. Remus/Sirius doesn't really bother me, but I'm not at all interested in Drarry or, ugh, Harry/Severus. Don't get me started on Harry/Voldemort. Dude's old enough to be his ****ing grandfather.

*** I don't even want to get started on just how wrong Harry/older male pairings are, especially if they contain mpreg (to continue the Potter line, of course)

**** Yeah. The only time I really find that remotely acceptable is if time-travel shenanigans are involved, and they're the same biological age, but even then I'm disinclined to consider it. And even then, there's still the fact that for the most part I generally don't like slash... Mostly due to a couple a of bad experiences reading slash fics that were just ****fests rather than actual plot.
