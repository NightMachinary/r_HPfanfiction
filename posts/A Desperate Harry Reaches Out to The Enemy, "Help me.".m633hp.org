Harry Potter, after yet another life or death battle of a school year, and nothing to show for it but loss and isolation, comes to realize that Dumbledore sees him only as a pawn. His father and mother's acquiescence to Dumbledore's every command only damned him from the start to be nothing more than a child of prophecy, a tool, leaving him without control of his own fate. Everywhere he looks the faces of those he loved no longer shine within his heart, but instead look more and more of the cogs that move within Dumbledore's plans. Plans that he feels rob him of his freedom and autonomy. He's tired of having no control in his own existence, and tired of being played for a naive and easily manipulated fool.

In a desperate move Harry reaches through the bond he has only just learned he shares with Voldemort and begins his talks with the man who, in many ways, was also a victim of Dumbledore's machinations. After finding enough common ground with the maligned dark lord, and wishing to cut the strings that the leader of the light so blithely uses to control him, Harry expresses the thought that starts it all; the beginning of the end.

"Help me." Harry says through his mind, and the Dark Lord nods, his approval resonating through the link they share.

EDIT TO ADD: I've changed the tag to prompt/request because I'd love to read any of the stories with plots like this one that people can recommend! Thanks, everyone! This community never disappoints ðŸ˜Š


** "Hello, Harry." It was a little incongruous to see Voldemort leaning against the Little Whinging playground's Merry-Go-Round; his skin pale and waxen; red eyes glinting with an emotion Harry didn't want to examine. Behind, the Death Eaters spread out into an arc, muttering to each other in confusion.

Harry nodded back politely; forcing himself to control the instinctive flinch of revulsion at his new ally's inhuman appearance.

"We've 'spoken' mind-to-mind and you sought my aid to free yourself from Dumbledore, correct?"

Another nod. The Death Eaters exchanged amazed glances.

"My program is simple: slaughter the Mudbloods and rule a Magical Britain cleansed of the Muggle excrescence, forever. The new world will be one of of discipline and order, everyone with a place and that place below me. I'm curious, where exactly do you see someone who values their autonomy fitting in?"

Harry was starting to get a bad feeling. He drew his wand; Voldemort mirroring his action.

"What special skills will you bring, that I might overlook the threat of the prophecy, the injuries you've already done me? No, Harry Potter. Your only role in my plans is to-"

Desperately, Harry flourished his wand. "Expelliarmus."

Voldemort tried no counter spell; he let the magic hit him, staggering back a pace, his wand flying out of his hand.

Harry briefly felt a thrill of triumph but then, as the yew wand reached apogee, his enemy reached out and it reversed course, gliding back into Voldemort's grip.

"Ah, there we have your special ability. A devastating weapon... against a Second Year." The Death Eaters tittered. "Now let me try."

The return spell was non-verbal but Harry felt his phoenix and holly wand twist in his hand, the wood suddenly slick then it shot away into the darkness.

"You promised not to attack me," Harry said.

"I did. We exchanged oaths in fact... then you struck me with a spell first. Lucky for you the old saw about oath-breakers losing their magic isn't true."

"That's not fair."

Voldemort stalked closer. "No, it isn't. For a long time I thought us similar. Both half-bloods, both orphans," he chuckled darkly, "both orphaned by me, both Muggle-raised. I entered the Magical world as the lowest of the low, ignorant of my Magical heritage, a Mudblood in Slytherin House but I rose, studied, fought, learnt everything I could and, " Voldemort spread his arms theatrically, "triumphed."

"You, on the other hand, were famous and surrounded by loyal friends. But both I and my servants have been your teachers; you coast, slide by on the minimum... yet between luck and Gryffindor bullheadedness you've disrupted my plans again and again. Is it fair that my enemy should be so pathetic? Well no more." The yew wand was now pointing at Harry, a white finger of death. "Avada Kedavra."

--------------

Sometime later Harry woke up in the now empty playground. He'd been to a spectral Kings Cross, seen the effects of the Dark Arts on Voldemort's soul and endured a long tirade from a furious Lily Potter. Everyone had told him of his mother's kindness but wow, she could really tear someone apart when she got angry. Still he was alive and cleansed of Voldemort's taint. The Light side might be imperfect but he would give them a second chance.

*** Great scene! It is always kind of annoying when Dumbledore's side is made out to be the lowest of the low and Voldemort's perfect when Voldemort is the one committing acts of genocide and trying to impose a totalitarian rule. Even if Dumbledore and the order are not perfect Voldemort definitely isn't either.

*** So basically Voldemort despises Harry because he's a lazy underachiever with most studies, that's understandable.

Wonder if he was a prodigy like Voldemort.

People complain about fics where they do this, but at least some of them change the background around so that Voldemort is more like Palpatine than just Wizard Hitler.

**** He has a rant like that at the end of DH ("snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women"). I feel Voldemort might be quite insulted if Harry tried to make a deal. "I'm the greatest wizard in the country leading an army of fanatics. What do you have to offer me?"

** There was a fic like this, they struck up a friendship and Voldemort learned that Harry was being starved. Voldemort sent him cake and Harry ate it. It was poisoned and Harry died.

** Could be an interesting take on a WBWL from the perspective of the twin who is believed as the BWL (regardless if he is right or not about Dumbledore's alleged plan). We always see the other twin resenting being in his brother's shadow and going dark, sometimes even allying with Voldemort, would be a nice change of pace to have the supposed BWL twin grow resentful of his role in defeating Voldemort and cannon's yearly adventures while the other twin is just chilling around with friends or otherwise not involving himself too much on the war one way or another.

** I've read a fic or two that more or less has this plot already, but I'm blanking on one I know for sure has it. The closest one that comes to mind is Broken by Batsutousai. Pretty entertaining concept.
