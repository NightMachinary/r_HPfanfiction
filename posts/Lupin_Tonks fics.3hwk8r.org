I'm looking for some well written Lupin/Tonks stories of any genre, any setting, any length with them as a couple/eventually a couple/romantically involved.


** I have two things to offer you. First is a long-ish one-shot that's written from Tonks's point of view and shows an event in the early part of their relationship:

Second is a very good novel-length fix by Pandora Jones that I really enjoyed. It's pretty M-rated, just so you know.
