** I assume you mean soul rather than sole, and I don't think anyone can tell you that, no matter how good at math they are. As far as I know, the books never actually guarantee that exactly half a wizard's currently remaining soul gets placed in each horcrux object. If it's random, Harry could have ended up with over 99% of the original soul or a tiny fraction of a percent of it. If it's decided by the caster, then if I were Voldemort, I'd put the smallest piece I could into all my horcruxes because that leaves me the freedom to make more if I have to.

*** This is what I believe also happened. Random bits of soul getting sliced off Voldie's original instead of the 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128 thing.

*** I mean, it's not even clear whether it makes sense to think of fragments of the soul as being a "fraction" of the soul. Even if you are committed to thinking of it mathematically (which I am not), there are alternatives.

E.g. the set of natural numbers is infinite; the set of odd numbers is a sub-set of the set of natural numbers but also infinite. The mathematical relationship between a soul fragment and the whole soul could be like the relationship between odd numbers and the natural numbers.

** Luna makes a good attempt, but you can't really do that as fan fiction added the half part. When Slughorn explains it to TMR he just says split and rips.

Simply put, a piece of soul is broken off and how much of it was in Harry isn't quantifiable beyond 1/8.

** No, they can't. A soul isn't quantifiable

*** Ok thank you I'll use that math for my book. You should know though the diary was first he used mortys death to make the diary and the death of his father for the ring
