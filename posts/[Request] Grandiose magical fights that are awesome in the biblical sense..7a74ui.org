** I'd love to see this in the Grindelwald vs Dumbledore duel in Fantastic Beasts, if they show it. Just have both of them constantly deflecting powerful spells, and the spells just blowing giant holes in the ground and walls.

*** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.

  “Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

HBP Chapter 26

I like to think that the impressiveness of the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald duel goes beyond bigger explosions and more fire. Indeed if you think about it, such attacks are rather pointless - large scale attacks do no more than small scale attacks to defeat your opponent. Blowing down a house 2 blocks away in a huge explosion isn't going to make any difference to your opponent. All that matters to that is what powers you can specifically target the opponent with.

#+end_quote

Well, the purpose of the spell would be to blow your opponent up, not a random house.

Though, I could see the duel lasting 3 hours because neither of them wanted to use any lethal spells. I could just see them constantly trying to capture the other nonlethally.

My point is that you only need an opponent-sized explosion to do that. Any larger area of effect is pointless with respect to that opponent, though certainly useful if you're facing, say, a horde of inferi.

******* Larger explosions have a better chance to catch your opponent in their area of effect, if you're fighting a non-stationary enemy. And since canon shows that you need to aim to hit your enemy - Harry dives behind a tombstone in the graveyard fight, making Voldemort miss him - using "opponent-sized" explosions is not exactly ideal.

I mean, let's pretend to be completely serious. Think about those animated armours that McGonagall calls into action in Deathly Hallows, and the Whomping Willow, and think about how Dumbledore animates the golden statues in Order of the Phoenix.

If smaller stuff like that is useful in a fight, why not use a big armor? Load it with enchantments to improve its protection against being exploded and give it more mobility and some autonomous ability, then use it as a shield against hexes and clouds of nasty stuff and whatnot. Throw in a magical-equivalent-of-a-gun and you can shoot and evade while still casting and countering spells from the cockpit.
