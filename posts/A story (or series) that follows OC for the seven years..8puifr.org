** I would have said the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom, since he might have been until recently (and wasn't that just great?).

The series of fics by sweasley that follow Teddy and Victoire through school are one possibility linkffn(The Start by sweasley), but they are also sort of not OC (even though practically nothing was/is known).

You might try the Alexandra Quick series by Inaverarity. Four of seven books have been complete, and its an AU magic in America story, but it is probably the most original answer to your questions.

You might try looking for stories about Sirius's daughter fics. There are several out there that follow her growing up alongside the main characters in Hogwarts.

  Every relationship has a spark, but every friendship has a start. Even the best of friends can face obstacles, which Ted Lupin & Victoire Weasley must learn the hard way. PREQUEL to "A Year in the Life" and "The Spark"

** Latet Anguis in Herba goes through the seven years and onwards. The characters are also in Ignite which doesn't quite fit the requirements as it doesn't follow through seven years but I imagine it is similar to what you are looking for. The sequels are: Shade to Shade, Falls the Shadow and Beyond this Place.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5496653/1/The-Blood-of-Your-Veins-Calista-Snape-Volume-II]])

This is my fic, it is the middle one in a trilogy that is actually almost as long as the entire seven HP books. The OC is the daughter of Severus Snape and Bellatrix Lestrange (Making it an AU). I am linking the middle one because it is the one that follows the OC through Hogwarts. I pride myself on a sympathetic but true to character portrayal of Snape, and it's mentor!Snape as well, if that's your thing.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.
