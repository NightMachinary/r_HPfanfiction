By which I mean which fic had the most unique gimmick, premise or twist on canon?

Are ther epic poem fics? Choose your own Adventure fics? Fics which focus on all the most unlikely characters? Fics which touch on the most unlikely subject matter and aspects of the Wizarding world?Fics made on drugs? Fics made by serial killers?

  The Harry Potter saga told in a form where every word in the story is composed from the letters “Harry James Potter.” It's slightly harder than it looks .

  Lily Evans got described by many adjectives: vivacious, charming, bright, natural, talented, brave, funny, witty, kind, popular...Truly, she was an exceptional witch who for some reason left behind her a trail of deeply troubled individuals.Answer to the question: What would change in the story if Lily Evans had been born a sociopath is: not necessarily anything.

** Well "My Immortal" definitely has a spot in the list of top experimental fics.

Now, in all seriousness, I read one that dealt with abusive relationships. It had Percy as the victim and Penelope as the abuser. It had a very realistic and very disturbing representation of the thought processes that abuse victims go through to the point that they even defend their abusers.

#+begin_quote
  Joining the Order was easy, a chance to die for their beliefs. It was much harder to live with his own choices, each worse than the next, until all he had left was to face the person he had become.This is the story of a man who survived, like a cockroach. This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable. Falling down the slippery slope of your own decision-making is so much more human than rat.AN: No Horcruxes AU. The pairings are tagged, so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.

  "Death is but the next great adventure."Our heroes find themselves in the world of the living once more but their memories can only take them so far. What does it truly mean to get a second chance? This is the final story in the Concentric trilogy. Read "The First Circle" and "Harrowing" first!
