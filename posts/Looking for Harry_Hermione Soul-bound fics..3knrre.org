Hi everyone. I've recently gotten back into Harry Potter and have been reading a ton of fanfiction. I'm wondering if anyone could recommend any good Harry/Hermione soul-bond fics. I will also accept general romance fics as well. I've just finished "Harry Potter and Futures Past" and am looking for more stories in this vein.

Thanks.


** maybe people downvote Robst, but the man provides what I am looking for, a fairly interesting story that has a happy ending with characters I like being in situations I like. Sometimes when I am depressed and want something that I know will cheer me up, I read robst. I used to read the cheesy stuff that Broomstick Flyer wrote, and laughed at how cheesy it was, but I still appreciated it for what it was. upvote or downvote, I don't care, I like what I like.

*** The thing about Robst is most of his stories would be very good if he's stop doing 11 year old(or younger) romance. He's a good author, even if his stories lack true conflict they're fun to read. He also has a lot of great ideas for stories.

I was really impressed with the idea on his latest story. Harry get obliviated of the wizarding world. Everything goes to shit and Hermione risks it all to go back in time. So Harry is an adult, but doesn't know any magic, but Hermione does. However he then did the love at first sight, 11 year olds dating and everyone is cool with it, bullshit.

**** you kind of overlook it. When I was writing HP fanfic it made me nervous to write any kind of romance/relationship thing,a and I have some problems reading such, even if it's 'older Harry coming back in time' kind of thing.

**** Robst recommendations get downvoted around here, even if it's exactly what OP asks for. I think it's stupid and I recommend Robst if warranted (I actually like some of his stories! Sometimes I just want trope-y goodness!). But it seems to be one of the rules of the subreddit.

**** Robst isn't really known for quality writing around here and is also disliked because most of his stories are rather cookie-cutter.

Better than nothing but there is better content out there for H/Hr.

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction-index/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter & the Soulmate Bond]] by Keira Marcos. Rated NC-17, has 363k words, is currently incomplete, heavily AU.

linkffn(H J Potter by S.M wane)

I don't remember if its any good but its one of the more popular H/Hr soul-bond fics. Complete.

linkffn(The Harmony Bond by brigrove)

Another fic that I don't remember the quality of. Establishes the soul bond much earlier. Essentially AU. Incomplete.

You put /soul-bound/ in the title which is much different than /soul bond/, had me confused there.

As for general H/Hr romance, here are 2 fics I re-read recently that deserve mentions.

linkffn(Nocturnal by forcedInduction)

** linkffn(Came Out of the Darkness) is my favorite Harry/Hermione soul bond fic ever written. Unfortunately it is currently abandoned, although the author has said she'll continue if she ever gets her muse back. But seriously, it is so so good.

linkffn(In this world and the next by robst) is something I think you would like. Robst is really not recommended around here, but I think you'll enjoy the story since you liked Future's Past.

linkffn(The End and the Beginning by muggledad) is really good too.

Searching reptilia28 in story on fanfiction can also get you some good results, although you'll have to wade through some crap. But one of reptilia's challenges is about Harry and Hermione being soul-bound and travelling through time.
