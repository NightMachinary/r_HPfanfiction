**** Well, half of the stories in the list generally got favored from most fans.

In rest half, some are my personal favorite. And I don't pretend what others like. So included stories which some might like, some might not. For example, stories written by James Spookie. He has several H/D stories. I've read all his stories. Most of them fluff stuff & I not a big fan. But many people can like them.

**** I have to say, I don't love it when people link dump without explaining much about the fic themselves. I get why they do it, but I think it's nicer to explain for everything why you liked a fic and why it might be of interest to the original poster.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  The most disturbing thing was the pool of blood. The coffee table itself was literately dripping blood onto Daphne's tan carpeting.

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

*** I swear, all of my most anticipated authors just upped and died some time in the last few months. Half of them were posting pretty regularly, too. Noodlehammer is the only one who still updates in a timely manner.
