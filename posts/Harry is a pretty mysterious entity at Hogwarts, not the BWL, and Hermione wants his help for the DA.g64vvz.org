I remember he knew a lot of the secrets of Hogwarts, like a room where some historical figures carved their names in their Hogwarts years and I think that Sirius is in some sort of coma, or maybe had been kissed by a dementor?


** It's the Unfound Door by Joe.

**** There are a few similar in that 'Knowledge is Power' sort of vein, where Neville is in fact the BWL and Harry is just a mysterious guy who stays on his own a lot, so perhaps you got those confused in?

****** Not specifically, other than the actual 'Knowledge is Power'. They tend to be found in the same sort of trope-genres though. I think there's a similar one with Werewolves and the search for a cure, but I can't remember the title. I'm currently resorting my bookmarks for download with Fanficfare, so I'll check through them while I'm going through and see if I can find it. Might be worth making an actual thread for it though, if you're interested in recs for it. It tends to be a rather cliche-ridden area, but there are some good fics in that whole trope-genre.

** I know the fic you are talking about but can't remember the name. Harry is a Ravenclaw. In the first chapter he is running on the rooftops of Hogwarts trying to make it back before sunset because he would be attacked. He brewed and drank a clarity potion which enhanced him. He also sold the potion not knowing that it is illegal. James was alive and almost catches him in one of his operations and he was trying to find a way to bring Sirius back.
