** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] is my personal favorite finished xover. HPxFirefly.

Dont necessarily need to have watched firefly to enjoy it. But you definitely should. And the movie.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/112085)[Sam]] at Hogwarts], on AO3. Sam Winchester (from Supernatural) and ends up attending Hogwarts. There are some grammer mistakes and plot holes, but overall, it's a pretty good read.

** This is my personal favorite. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1318796/1/Comes-a-Slytherin]] It's a crossover with Highlander (more the series than the show). I've read hundreds of fanfics since, but this still comes out as one of my top fics. Methos, the Immortal who once took the mantle of Death is also Slytherin, Harry is a Highlander style Immortal, and Duncan is the boyfriend of Methos. There's nothing explicit, though, some incredible scenes, and some beautiful swordfighting.

Though since a sequel is coming, idk if I'd say it's complete. But it works as its own story.
