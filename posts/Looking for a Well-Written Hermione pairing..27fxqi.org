I've been doing my best to find some good fics with a good Hermione pairing, but it seems like everything written is... sub-par.

Anyway, I've caved, and now I come crawling on my hands and knees for something to cure this... lack of Hermione-ness. I guess now I list requirements.

Word count doesn't matter to me too horribly as long as the story is coherent and thoughtful, with minimal fluff. (But I'll love you forever for something with 500,000+ words.) A sudden romance isn't believable, and neither is gushing over a kiss from a hot guy.

I'm not much for slash, sadly.

Unfortunately, I don't want a HHr, nor a Ron/Hermione. A Dramione would be just lovely, but a lot of them are very dark, so if you manage to find a good one that doesn't have bundles of rape and torture and death, I might die of happiness.

AUs are fine. Character bashing is fine. OC's are also fine, as long as they're not taking a lot of the story to themselves. Anything rated "mature" is fine, although I'll silently cringe if they refer to losing their virginity as the most magical experience of their life.

Help me [[/r/HPfanfiction]], you're my only hope.


** Try Parade of the Sun by everythursday. It's more action than romance, but the romantic parts of it would fit your requirements quite well.

Chaos Is Come Again - Snape/Hermione

Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation - Vera Rozalsky (Hermione/Neville with Hermione/Draco)

Overall, consider looking searching for Snape/Hermione Marriage Law, over 60k words with many reviews.

A few years back when I was into that pairing, I found that quality of long ones on that premise is usually much better than HHr or Hr/D

Edit: For example Care of Magical Creatures, Pet Project, Cloak Of Courage, Where Your Treasure Is, Chasing the Sun - smutty and somewhat adult if you can stand the incredible amounts of angst.

** Someone just recommended me [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377][Practical Solutions]], as a funny and short(ish) HGSS story. Witty dialogue, adult humor, and a surprisingly refreshing in-character take on how it would work out.

**** Yeah, that author isn't such a Harry fan it seems, but I love her writing. I like her other big post-DH story but didn't link it because 1) it's incomplete and 2) her characterization of Harry is so out of character in my mind, I mean he basically ditches Hermione completely for no real reason. (Also it has some pretty messed up sex stuff but I try not to judge...) If you like her you might like [[http://lop.shoesforindustry.net/][AJ Hall's stuff]].

** I highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] by Minisinoo. It is an extremely rare pairing: Hermione/Cedric, and very well written.

** *For longer fics, my favorite is writer [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=2][everythursday]] -- someone mentioned Parade of the Sun, and there are others that will fit the bill, including The Fallout (has dark bits), and The Symmetrical Transit (nothing dark at all, after an initial battle scene). Some are darker than others, but I don't like too much rape/torture/death, either, and I love these stories.

*[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]] by pennilyn novus starts out unbelievable, but turns into something amazing, so just wait it out after the first chapter. It has some Draco POV, too, if that's OK, and skip the alternate ending because it's dark. [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night]] by nelpher is along the same vein plot-wise (memory-charmed Draco), but not as long.

*For things that aren't nearly as long as you requested but are still great Dramione, anything by phlox, MiHnn, eilonwy, and worksofstone (off the top of my head).

This was very well written and believable.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4844655/1/][One Timeless Chance]] » It's a long shot, a suicide mission, something she's not even sure she can do...But she has to try. To save everyone she loves, she must learn to use a kind of magic she hates, from the one she hates most of all. HG/TR A twist on a timeless tale. Harry Potter, M, English, Romance & Tragedy, chapters: 26, words: 130k+, favs: 682, follows: 417, updated: Jan 9, 2010 published: Feb 6, 2009, Hermione G., Tom R. Jr.

This is a time travel fic, a bit dark in some places but not cruel or much gore. You have to expect it to be dark though- it's Hermione/Tom Riddle. There's a sequel that's not been updated since 01/2013.

Have you done a search on ff.net with the filters? Or take a look for a community. There's a few communities that are Dramione or Hermione/Snape.

*** I've done a number of filter searches on ffnet. It just seems like any time I come across something promising, the jumping around in the story just gets too bad, nothing is explained, and everything is leapt into.

However, I haven't done a lot of exploring on it, so I don't really know about communities.

**** You should try pretty much anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1419259/Alydia-Rackham][this author]]. She has a really good Dramione story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6532581/1/What-the-Room-Requires]["What The Room Requires."]] I highly recommend her Loki/Jane fics too. If you're into Avengers, then the paring is very similar to Hermione/Draco.

** Three Hermione/Snape's:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]] by Hayseed. "How do ordinary people cope with their extraordinary circumstances? A SS/HG romance that strives for realism." PG-13, written pre-HBP, 95,000 words. It remains one of my absolute favourites to this day.

[[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]] by Abby and Domina. Body-swap fic, written pre-OotP, NC-17, 126,000 words. Personally I consider it a decent take on the body-swap idea, but it's also the only of its type I've ever read so I don't know how it stands against others.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2230284/1/][Unfinished Business]] by Ramos. "Hermione Granger dies in a potions accident during her final year at Hogwarts. She's not thrilled when she comes back as a ghost, and really not happy at the idea of spending eternity haunting Severus Snape's classroom." M-rated, written pre-HBP, 81,500 words. This fic manages to break my heart no matter how many times I read it.

One of the few Draco/Hermione I've read: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8807604/1/][A Primer for Small Weird Loves]] by unicornesque. "Born and raised in France, Draco Malfoy attends Beauxbatons and leads a privileged, well-ordered existence. He meets Hermione Granger for the first time at the Triwizard Tournament, and that's when things get... strange. But kind of wonderful, too." T-rated, 60,000 words.

Another D/Hr is Maya's /Draco Malfoy, the Amazing Bouncing... Rat?/. Quite old and well-known when it was online, so you may have heard of/read it, but it is quite light-hearted and fluffy so perhaps not what you're interested in. In either case, Maya took everything of her's off the net but I have a copy if you (or anyone else) wants to read it; just drop me a PM with your email.
