Harry makes it clear how shitty of a human Snape is please


** I think the worst thing is that beeing held upside down showing underwear and calling lily a mudblood is considered his worst memory. Murdering, raping, etc as a deatheater was no biggie, it shows Snape has no empathy for those he killed/raped, but any slight against him is bliwn wildly out of proportion.

Snape namecalls and bullies younger students? Well the marauders "bullied" him so hes totally innocent.

The fact snape only became a spy because lily was targeted makes me ill. Any other baby voldemort coukd have gone after, and Snape eould have been completely content to continue murdering.

Bah.. Snape at no point even tried to redeem himself in canon. The fact that if Harry hadn't been there when Snape died, he wouldnt have known he was a horcrux is just.. urg.

*** IIRC, Death Eaters raping and doing all that is fanon. It could be implied with some of them, but that'd be more fanon creative license territory.

But, yeah. As a Death Eater, I fully expect Snape to have killed innocent people: his worst memory is of the girl he had unrequited feelings for being called a slur and a bullying situation.

Not, you know, killing innocent people like muggles, muggleborns, half-bloods, and "traitorous" pure-bloods.

*** Another thing is redemption also IMO shouldn't be earned for dying in a war like tonnes of actual innocent individuals who were fighting the same fight. There might be a slight argument if he sacrificed himself for another, but then it'd still be a partial redemption, since redemption actually involves trying to be better and not adding to your list of victims.

**** Since he was murdered by voldemort out of the blue, (or he would probably have left information for Harry that he was horcrux instead of going to his death with the information) i would say that Snape in no way sacrificed himself at all. And yeah Snape never attempted to redeem himself.

***** Yup exactly my point. Lots of people fighting against Voldemort were suddenly and mercilessly cut down. Snape also being one of them doesn't gain him much on the karmic scales IMO.

The fact that he decided to fight gains him some points, but his initial reason loses him points. As does his actions against the kid he helped cause to be orphaned.

** Snape is also so angry that he actually smashes the jar of beetles in Harry's head and accidentally kills him. Now it's Voldemort that's angry because a Death Eater disobeyed his order of leaving Harry for him and after prolonged torture, he kills Snape. Now Dumbledore has to train Neville to fulfill the prophecy and is happy to do so because now there's no link to Voldemort that could snoop into their discussions.
