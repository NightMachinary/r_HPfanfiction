Something about the soft spoken timid boy, melting the ice queen(though she doesn't have to be that) strikes my fancy. Don't care about cliches, hell it could even be a contract fic as long as the romance is solid and the writing isn't too bad.


** I might be remembering this incorrectly, but wasn't this being hinted at in HPMOR? Albeit it was only during the first year or so of Hogwarts. Maybe a sequel could have fleshed it out more, I know there's been a few.
