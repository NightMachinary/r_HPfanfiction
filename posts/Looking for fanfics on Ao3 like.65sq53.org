  What happens when you use an entire vial of Harry's blood in the ritual to resurrect the Dark Lord Voldemort rather than just 3 drops? ....... It changes the game.
#+end_quote

That sounds pretty interesting, let's check the tags

#+begin_quote
  Sexual Content, Bondage, Mpreg, Orgasm Delay/Denial, Minor Character Death, Torture

Oh

*** With FFN, summaries are hit and miss. They either scream at you "This fic is fucked up!" or "I'm a cute fic!". Of course, said "cute fic" then turns into the best kind of smut...

Oh the joys of my niche reading habits.

*** I just got to chapter 19 of a fic on ffnet and bam authors note at the top announces that btw this is a crossover.

It's not so bad cause the chapters were short and the fic really not that good but jeeze way to do it wrong.

** Reading fics on Ao3 always runs the risk of encountering really extreme kinks and/or graphic depictions of violence. If it wasn't so well known among the fanfiction community, I'd suggest the site put a disclaimer up before you enter.

*** I mean, it's not really a "risk" so much as it's an eventuality. Due to the tags system though it's pretty easy to avoid it. I've never read any content in Ao3 I didn't actually want to read. As a dev would say: working as intended.

**** Maybe risk was the wrong word. But still, you're gonna encounter a metric tonne of stuff you've probably never even dreamt of before. It's a bit jarring if you're not prepared.

** The thing I do like about AO3 is that it's pretty easy to filter out tags you don't want. I like slash, but my standard search at AO3 filters out mpreg, veela, and A/B/O dynamics because those things squick me out something fierce.

***** I once stumbled upon one once without quite reading the tags and within two paragraphs Voldemort was showing his dominance by making Harry suck Snape's greasy hair.

Just thought I'd give you some imagery to go with those tags.

** I think my problem with that site is that there are very few het fics! Like even in other fandoms, the fanfiction is almost exclusively same-sex pairing and even the canon pairings are ignored. I mean it is nice to see fics explore different possibility but i like het/cannon pairings as well!

*** Yeah, Ao3 is the haven for slash, it's kind of annoying. Trying to search the top rated stories there and like the top 5 being Harry's Futa Adventures and stuff like that is just off-putting.
