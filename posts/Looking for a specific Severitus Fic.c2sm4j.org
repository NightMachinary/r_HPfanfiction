:END:
I'm trying to track down a Severitus fic I read forever ago. Here's what I can remember:

- Harry moves into Slytherin as Snape's son

- People don't know he is Harry

- He, and other children of death eaters were to become Voldemort's "Asps", and all had particular "venoms", with Harry being the highest ranked.

It may have aged terribly, and I am very curious to revisit and find out!
