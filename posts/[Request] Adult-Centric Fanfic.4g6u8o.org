Embarking upon a Harry Potter reread in my 30s, I've been focusing quite a bit more on the adult characters and am eager to get to know them better. Can anyone recommend any adult-centric fic? (I don't necessarily mean the NC-17 kind).

Whether it's post-Hogwarts Marauder Era, the story we know through the lens of the professors or the members of the Order of the Phoenix, even the Ministry! The trio grown-up is great too. I'm very open to anything well-written with a focus on the adults rather than the younger generation. Your suggestions are greatly appreciated.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** linkffn(one hundred and sixty one by mrs. J's soup). Hermione goes back into time and falls in love with one of the marauders--but what makes this one different is she does it as an adult, not as Hogwarts student. My absolute favorite fanfic.

Also, linkffn(the strangers at drakeshaugh by northumbrian) is a good one that's incomplete at the moment. A very different kind of fic, almost a novel of manners (with a strong mystery subplot) rather than the sort of adventure novel that's more typical in hpff.

Also, tip of my tongue. Mcgonagall's Tuesday? A very long Tuesday with Mcgonagall? It follows Mcgonagall during a Tuesday during Harry's fifth year. Not novel length, but still pretty long and entertaining. Hopefully someone knows the fic I'm talking about.

This one is pushing it a little, but linkffn(10772496) is an 800k word romance (verging into smutfic territory) that follows hermione during her time at hogwarts with the marauders (similar in plot to 169, above, but she gets regressed in age and has to repeat Hogwarts). I include it because a. lots of adult content and b. my favorite parts of the fic are when we're following adults. We spend a lot of time with the marauders post Hogwarts, and we spend a lot of time following Sirius and Remus when they've met Hermione but she doesn't know that they've met her already. I dearly love all three of these fics.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** This story starts at the Marauder's 5th year, but continues all the way to November 1, 1981, so they're adults for at least half the story. It's one of my favorites, even though I usually avoid canon!Marauders like the plague because they usually make me want to cry.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/la_reine_noire/BAMSR.html][Be All My Secrets Remembered by La Reine Noir on Schnoogle]]

This is also one of my favorites - I've re-read them twice now. linkffn(1248431). It's an AU!Marauders series, set in the 90's, so they're definitely grown up by then.

** I just finished this one - if you don't mind slash, I think it's just what you're looking for. (Trio is in their 40's). Brilliant writing, characterization - I loved it so much I made a post promoting it a few hours ago, and I've never done that before, :D.
