Hey guys,

this is something I never understood:

Why would people (students, parents, teachers and even the ministry) accept that their supposedly best magical school (at least for Great Britain) is a danger to its students?

I mean:

Who needs trick stairs, moving staircases, doors with cursed handles, doors that lead to other parts of the castle on certain days/at certain times etc.? I think no one does! Those things are endangering the students and helping no one!

This ties in to another question:

Why did muggleborns accept their lot in life/at school so easily (I mean Snape should have been out of a job because of pureblood pressure alone (3/4 of the parents should have been against him, with Slytherin parents being the exception!), but muggleborns probably liked him even less!)? Why didn't they stand up for themselves (or leave - I mean if every muggleborn leaves (for other countries or muggle life!) then the magical world is truly in deep shit IMHO)?

Not only are they harming themselves, but they are harming the next generation, too if they don't demand more/equal rights and things like Hogwarts being fixed (not only the teachers and the building, but the courses, the clubs (no football/soccer? no duelling club) etc. etc. (Hogwarts is really lacking - for a private boarding school that costs a pretty penny (the Weasleys seem to be barely able to afford it - though of course having so many children offsets Arthur's income, too even though he is a senior government official (department head)) it's not great at all -.-) as well...I mean: It's no wounder there's prejudices against muggleborns (and purebloods, too as most muggleborns see them as living in the past (candles instead of light switches, scrolls of parchment instead of notebooks etc.) without being able to adapt), if they never get taught the customs of their new world -.- (should be mandatory, just like muggle-studies should be mandatory for purebloods)) in order to live up to its name (best school in Britain...not that another is ever mentioned in the books, though other schools would have to be worse in order for that to be true -.-)

Well, let's discuss (note: Of course it's just that Rowling wrote it that way, but I'd like to hear a rational explanation non the less!)


** I imagine the original idea for the trick steps, etc. was partly to give Hogwarts a sense of strangeness and to showcase it as a place of magic and wonder. It was also (I think) to provide a sort of commentary on British boarding schools having obscure traditions that make no sense to outsiders.

I always assumed the moving staircases were a way of getting from one side of the castle to the other without having to walk the entire way, with some kind of spell to prevent people or belongings falling off. I assume the doors that lead to different places at different times serve a similar purpose. These two also provide examples of things you "just have to know", such as which door leads where at what time, and which staircase moves from which area of the castle to which area of the castle. The idea of the trick steps is a prime example of the theory that these things represent obscure traditions, being something that serves no purpose, is something you "just have to know about" and inconveniences you if you're not careful.

I'm not really addressing your main point with these, but a few things:

#+begin_quote
  no football/soccer?
#+end_quote

It would extremely difficult to introduce non-traditional sports into real life schools with the kind of history Hogwarts has, let alone introducing a sport that is completely alien to the magical culture.

#+begin_quote
  private boarding school that costs a pretty penny
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is a state school; there are no fees. Incidentally, this is also why the Ministry was able to influence such control over it in /Order of the Phoenix/.

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't they ... leave[?]
#+end_quote

Because organising the mass exodus of every single muggleborn in the UK and Ireland would be completely impossible.

#+begin_quote
  they are harming the next generation, too if they don't demand more/equal rights
#+end_quote

When was it ever shown, or even implied that muggleborns have less civil rights than other witches or wizards? There's prejudice, sure, but that's shown to be in the minority, and, in any case, it is a social issue.

#+begin_quote
  living in the past ... without being able to adapt
#+end_quote

The reason quills and parchment are used as opposed to pens and paper is that Rowling wanted her magical world to resemble the stereotypical, faux Middle Ages, storybook idea of what witches and wizards are, hence the robes, cloaks, pointed hats, broomsticks, etc. The actual in-universe reason, however, is simple. The existence of magic. One can make a compelling argument for why almost anything could be true given the existence of magic, especially the loose, intention based magic of Harry Potter. You say that the magical world is "unable to adapt", but we really get no indication of:

a) How long the wizarding world has had this technology for

b) How effective it is compared to its contemporary muggle counterparts, or

c) How much magic has advanced compared to how much muggle technology has advanced over a comparable period of time.

Without having this information, we can't really say that the magical world is any less adaptable than the muggle world. After all, a major part of the series is that it draws parallels between the two worlds, and shows that they're not that different at the core.

#+begin_quote
  they never get taught the customs of their new world
#+end_quote

Are there really any customs that muggleborn students would need to know about? From what we see at Hogwarts, the magical world celebrates Christian holidays. Outside of Hogwarts, a lot of culture seems to be shared with muggle culture. The issue of law and history would probably be the main areas of difference, but there is a history class (however incompetently taught), and law isn't taught in muggle schools at that age either.

#+begin_quote
  Snape should have been out of a job
#+end_quote

This is absolutely true. Snape, as well as Binns, should have been out their ears long before the books take place. However, due to Harry Potter originally having been written as a children's book, not an enormous amount of thought was spent on verisimilitude. Hence, the stereotype of the boring history teacher overblown to enormous proportions. Snape was there to provide a red herring in Philosopher's Stone, and to play the role of someone who was on the same side as the heroes, but personally disliked them. Of course, we don't know how long Binns had been teaching for, so it's possible that there's nobody else qualified to teach history, as the previous few generations have had him as a teacher. Regarding Snape, we know that Dumbledore kept him on staff due to personal reasons.

*** Wow, I never thought out it this way. It's still nice to see other theories that make sense. Thanks for the post!

The way I've always thought - since that Statue of Secrecy in 1692, the magical world has sort of forgotten to keep up with the Muggle world. Firstly, they don't need new inventions for convenience since everything is already convenient, secondly, they might not realize new inventions exist. They like radios, but tvs never caught on, they use cars occassionally, but they are still considered a "muggle thing", computers and internet don't seem as important when you can instantly appear anywhere in the world you want to talk to someone or go to a library. Not to say these things couldn't be /useful/ to wizards, but they probably live in ignorance of the convenience because they don't /really/ need to innovate because they already have so many conveniences due to magic.

** A. Because it's funny

B. An in-universe explanation might follow this reasoning: Hogwarts as a school was set up to train young magicians in controlling their access to magic. During these formative years, accidental magic becomes more likely and more dangerous, so moving them out to an isolated location was key. The castle is meant to absorb the excess impulse-based magic, leading to all sorts of unintended side-effects, like moving staircases, benign intelligent Giant squids and a personification of pre-adolescent chaos know as 'Peeves'. The castle is still considered a 'safe' proving ground because the challenges presented by the castle give young wizards and witches reasons to use and leverage their magic.

I have a secondary theory that the Founders arranged for a particular protection: anyone coming to the school as a student cannot die within its walls. The exceptions to this Great charm are from equally Great magic: ancient creatures or other powers that pre-date the Founders.

Just thinking about it, I could see the Sorting Hat as being the avenue of delivery for the protection- once a student is Sorted, they come under the protection of a Founder.

**** The Battle of Hogwarts started with Voldemort breaking the protections on the castle in order for his forces to assault it. He came to do murder and used his considerable power to supersede that protection.

Myrtle was killed by the Basilisk, one of those Great magics that could overcome the protection. In fact, as my theory is only that, I'd have to say that Dumbledore believes that the castle offers this protection, but he hasn't told anyone else about it or can't prove it for certain. Perhaps it's one of those special situations where the magic only works if it's kept a secret- told to the Headmasters as part of their induction but not made clear how it functions or what the limits may be.

Albus and Barty Crouch Sr. were not students when they died, though, so that part of the theory still works.

I have a variant theory that Dumbledore himself created a protective charm to ensure the survival of all students after seeing Myrtle's unfortunate end when he was only Professor of Transfiguration, and that this protection disappeared after he died. That's not quite as cool to me, though.

** Part 2: Biases and options

Muggleborns have nothing to compare Hogwarts to; if there are smaller schools, they won't have as large of a staff and can't therefore offer as wide a selection of courses.

Complaints by parents to the school administrators would be answered as politely as you can imagine, but the end result is still 'where else are you going to go?' What's more, there seems to be no tuition for Hogwarts as it's supported by the Ministry (almost like a safety measure if you accept the idea I mentioned in my first post), so a muggleborn having to take their child out, find a smaller school or a Master willing to take an apprentice and then buy enough gold to trade for Galleons to pay them might seem prohibitively expensive. The Finch-Fletchlys might be able to afford it but they already were pointing Justin at Eton.

Whether the Ministry subsidizes the school on the basis of it being a safety measure (isolating accidental magic to save lives and to protect Secrecy) doesn't mean the Ministry has direct control over it- that's why there's a Board of Governors- an organization that is canon, as Lucius was on it, had bullied the other board members to oust Dumbledore in Harry's second year and afterwards lost his position on it when Albus was proven correct that none of the students would be killed.

** I would assume that the castle having trick stairs, moving staircases, etc. would help engender the sense of magic and wonder, like others have said above. Not to mention that it doesn't seem out of place given the wizarding world. I mean, one of the entrances to the Ministry of Magic is through a toilet. I'm ok with moving staircases as the alternative.

I always have mixed feelings about Snape's class. Obviously the man can't teach, but in terms of his standards, I don't think it's as black and white as it would seem. The aurors had to take and pass NEWT potions - I'm guessing so would healers. There might be other careers that rely on potions knowledge, but well, thanks to Harry, we don't really know. So, these are high level careers that depend in part on sufficient knowledge. Slughorn may have taken more students into NEWTS, but how many of them really knew as much as they needed to to have a good grounding for NEWT classes? To succeed in their chosen career? It might have been that the EE students weren't actually prepared for NEWTs and beyond, it's not exactly uncommon for standardized tests to incorrectly gauge the level of knowledge a student has. As far as him being unhelpful in class, it really is difficult to gauge since Potions is for the most part fictional. Like I said, the man obviously can't teach. But I can't help but wonder if some of the stuff he expected students to know would be obvious and basic if students put in time outside of class. There is something to be said for expecting students to show some initiative rather than holding their hands throughout their education.

I mean I get that the guy is passionate about his subject, but how can incite other people's passion if you never explain a single thing? - IMHO you can't!

I agree that NEWT-Potions (and the NEWT itself) is probably important for a large number of career choices (from the Aurors to Healers and probably several others...I think magical paint requires knowledge of ingredients etc., too!), which makes it even worse if the teacher destroys the chances of a lot of students of ever working in those fields (unless they get a tutor and re-take the NEWT or something!)

**** You are completely missing the point I made with regards to OWLs. Like I said, "It might have been that the EE students weren't actually prepared for NEWTs and beyond, it's not exactly uncommon for standardized tests to incorrectly gauge the level of knowledge a student has." Think of it this way - any standardized test results in grades that represent the level of knowledge for the student. So let's say that an EE on your Potions OWL represents knowledge level A. Now, to do, "ok" in NEWT Potions, you might need knowledge level B - and when I say "ok," I mean average with a little bit of effort. For those of you familiar with the American grading system, think "C average." It is entirely possible that knowledge level A is below knowledge level B. Hell, an O on the Potions OWL may translate to knowledge level C which is still below knowledge level B but closer. That is what I mean when I say that the reasoning behind his standards probably isn't as black and white as it would seem. It's not uncommon for students that are stamped as "college-ready" to be anything but. I don't see that changing just because we've started including wands in the classes.

** The stairs provide atmosphere. My (very fancy) high school had marble staircases. They are beautiful. They are also completely and utterly treacherous when wet, like after a fire drill. The wizarding world seems much less concerned with safety than schools in real life, so the school's quirks seem completely reasonable to me.

Also, no muggleborn is going to complain too much about learning how to use /magic/ at first. They're not going to take it for granted that way. They might object more later, but probably only if employment prospects are bleak. Otherwise, people tend to prefer to keep their heads down.

The castle is a possibly a bit sentient, oozing with magic, and has its own personality.

The blood purity stuff in the books offers a new perspective on things like sexism and racism and the way they work in society. People get treated like they're worth less over irrelevant things they were born with all the time, and maybe we should be thinking about it more.

Hogwarts has no tuition. [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]] Education is paid for by the Ministry of Magic. The Weasleys are broke because there are a ton of them living on a single income, and I don't get the impression the Ministry pays Arthur very well (his office is pretty much a closet he shares with another guy and he doesn't have enough status to get a window in there).

I think part of what makes the books so great is that magic doesn't just make everything perfect- people are flawed, and society is complicated.

  @emmalineonline1 @micnews There's no tuition fee! The Ministry of Magic covers the cost of all magical education!

*** Ok, I know wizards can fix some injuries pretty quickly - but you aren't spared the initial pain (broken bones hurt like hell...broke my right arm as a child (which no one noticed...hell, I could still use the arm, though it did hurt a little and then got worse) and couldn't sleep that night because of the pain -.-)) which is bad enough and should (and can be!) prevented (not doing so is neglect at best - abuse and child endangerment at worst!)

**** Maybe the Wizarding community feels that pain builds character... plenty of muggle doctors agree from what I've heard and sometimes felt!

Learning magic is dangerous. Gruesome mishaps are the norm, why worry about a broken arm here or there?

Edit: I broke my arm as a child too, so badly I almost needed surgery. I don't feel like that physical pain did any lasting psychological damage.

***** Those doctors are assholes (not going to sugar coat it as IMHO any doctor who says that should look for another job -.-) as are all other people suggesting that :(

Mishaps, yes - but those aren't on purpose. Leaving a trap for anybody to step into (if you know exactly where it is) is like harming them yourself IMHO and should not be encouraged!

Well, it's going to cause lasting damage - if it happens constantly (makes you feel afraid!)! (it's like child abuse IMHO (must not be sexual, though that works like that as well, I was thinking about starvation and beatings!))

****** Yeah, those doctors are. But it does seem like some people think of pain as no big deal.

I was imagining the trick staircases as not deliberately designed that way, but maybe an attribute the castle developed by accident (was hogwarts built when the school was founded, or was an already existing castle turned into a school?). I could imagine stuff happening as a result of the energy students unintentionally give off. Maybe the funny stairs are just one of those things the school means to fix but never gets around to?

******* Maybe - there's a lot of those things (maybe Dumbles is really overtaxed/overburdened/stretched to thin with the many positions he holds and with keeping an eye on Harry (could call it: Spying on Harry or: Keeping Harry down) and arranging for - stupid tests for him and for his neglect/abuse (we don't know if he was beaten etc.) by the Dursleys!)...same for the teachers (who IMHO have too many classes (if you teach from morning to late afternoon you don't get a lot done otherwise...especially if you are a head of house in addition to teaching and maybe are the Deputy Head as well -.-)

That's why I think Hogwarts needs to be "fixed" (not only the stairs, staircases etc. but classes, equipment (the outdated brooms for flying lessons come to mind!), teachers etc. as well!)

** Because that's the entire premise of the series. Magic is wacky and chaotic and illogical. This is not the muggle world where everything is cardboard-cut and committee-approved and designed for maximal practicality and equality and straight angles and BOREDOM. If the muggleborns don't like it, they can go back to their perfectly normal muggle world and have tea with Petunia Dursley. Also, Hogwarts is hardly the only school that has terrible, bullying teachers. Mine certainly had despite being considered high quality.

*** It's not totally chaotic - sure it's a little wild at times, but a scientific mindset/scientific method does help when it comes to magic, sure it can not fully explain everything, but it's not totally wasted either (hell, they have a class - though it's an elective - for that: Arithmancy (in addition to runes, which are also kind of logical and straight forward!))

Mine did, too and it was considered (still is, sadly enough...I thought opinions would change, as the school wasn't well liked by most of the students after all) pretty high quality, too (private catholic school run by a monastery (the only monk was the headmaster though (who taught Latin and Religious-Studies) - was, as he's dead now and now no teacher there is a monk))...still, I think bullying is not acceptable at all and bullies should be punished as harshly as possible (and people enabling them - like say Snape, Dumbledore (and all the other teachers...I mean calling somebody a "mudblood" or even a "mudblood whore" isn't ok, but no one did something about it!) - should be punished even more harshly (probation, losing their job etc.))

ps: What you are saying sounds like something Draco Malfoy (or Lucius) or even Voldy would say -.- (have you been taking "How to be the perfect pureblood?" lessons? :D)

I think it'd also be good for confusing invaders that aren't familiar with the castle. The students (minus Neville and the forgetful types) pick it up quickly. Any injuries can be quickly healed in a short period of time.
