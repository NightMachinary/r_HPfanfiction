And Big Yud isn't stupid. He's an autodidact who has never been seriously forced to engage with ideas that counteract his own due to his lack of schooling. Add in his honestly impressive amount of ego, and you get a man with some weird ideas who denounces anyone who disagrees with him as fools (hidden in overly technical/convoluted language to feed his superiority and make them feel inferior) or as part of sneer culture.

***** I don't think he's a worse ego than average for smart people, or that he's especially intellectually cloistered. I benefited from his recommendations of ET Jaynes and hyping of Bayes theory. The typical cloistered autodidact never gets nearly so far into finding good sources in the previous literature. He has a big audience and so he inspires a lot of backlash. And he talks about his opinion of his ideas straightforwardly, with little regard for politeness norms of modesty. But plenty of people in academia are at least as arrogant as him, though less direct about it.

I strongly dislike some of his behaviors and arguments, but I like much more than average others of his behaviors and arguments. This is also how I feel about many of the scenes in his fanfic. So to me, both the people who hate him and the people who automatically agree with him are wrong. He's just an average significantly smarter than average person in atypical circumstances.

********* It gets worse. So much worse. The "Mock Battles" arc solely exists to give Elizer a power trip and let him show off what he believes is tactical genius and therefore proof of the superiority of Elizer's Rationalism. And it gets worse. Turns out Harry is super smart because lol, screw nurture, in this "More rational world", Harry having a part of Voldemort's soul inside him makes him "Smart and cold".

And it gets worse, Draco is converted to Elizer's Rationalism with only slightly more time than it'd normally take a christian in a christfic to convert a nonbeliever to the word of Jesus.

And it gets worse, Quirrel is turned into Old Elizer, another power-trip for EY, only because Harryzer needs to be the best and specialest and he can't have anyone else steal his thunder of love, Quirrel believes in Fascism, and is revealed to have orchestrated the mock battles to show why Fascism Am Best. Oh, and he pulls out the expected Hitler Ate Sugar "But real fascism isn't like italian fascism! Communism has never really been tested!" apologetics, which Harryzer doesn't argue with because this scene exists to remind cultists how edgy the Old Rationalist is and how idealistic the "Idealist" Harryzer is in comparison, not to actually add anything to the narrative.

And it gets worse. The Harryzer/Hermione parts are annoying because Hermione isn't Hermione, she's a hermione bodypillow with the personality of the Designated Traditional Smart Character. Memorizing pi to tons of digits, "As opposed to Harry who is better than that"...

And it gets worse! "Mysterious figures" conspire to ruin his life by framing Hermione for a crime and lining things up perfectly so the young girl Hermione either goes to Azkaban forever and gets Dementor'd, or she becomes his slave, bound to him by an Unbreakable Bond on her magic and life.

The only part of this story that isn't garbage is the musings on death. Death is very bad. Immortality is good. The stupid thing is Elizer's inability to follow canon or notice any depths, or his beliefs that anyone who says "I have no problem with dying, because I've truly lived" or "After what I've done, I want death" or "At my age, I'm looking forward to it!" or anything other than "I love you, Elizer! I'm a Rationalist too!" is "Just too scared to face death head-on like him".

I think the main thing I hate about this fic is how Elizer uses it to advertise his scam religion and preach stuff like "You can become as smart as Harry! Just follow my religion!" to his followers. In that moment, it ceases to be "Just a fanfic", it becomes outright propaganda. Because of a depressing traumatic past, I hate cults.

That scene in the Mock Battles arc that manages to make what it's based on look intelligent in comparison, where Harry's guys fights Draco's guys. Draco arranges his guys into sets of three, and has them spread out. In sets of three, one can defend while the others attack, it's a good formation.

Because Elizer doesn't understand how tactics work, Harry's guys run in with a blind zerg rush, overwhelming the spread-out groups of three that are WITHIN SHOUTING AND BLASTING DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER, "Because Target Clusters". With all the subtlety of a bad sonic OC smirking at the camera and saying something along the lines of "Psssh, nothing personnel, kid", Harryzer Elitter-Crackpotsky-Unverifiable-erres says "Don't just blindly copy your parents. Think, like me".

This... is a symptom of whatever disease or disorder has claimed this man. His beliefs that being mainstream makes you wrong and being him makes you special, smart, and automagically right.

Btw the guy set up a "Foundation" for "AI Research", even though his understanding of AI is fundamentally flawed on the most basic of levels, ergo throwing money at a man that thinks wrong thoughts become right when the special one thinks them is a waste of money. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. His ideal world is one where a Rationalist(TM) supercomputer that gains magical superpowers from being super smart takes over the world and forces humans to act according to its understanding of rationality. Elizer's rationality. Where saying something like "I believe letting two trains crash so the third train, which contains important people, is more moral than letting the first two trains live and the third be delayed by five minutes" is not a sign of mental illness or edgelordery, but something to be celebrated.

OH, AND DON'T GET ME STARTED on the parallels between his cult's mythology and Christianity. I'd say I'm amazed some people actually fall for it, but I'd be lying.

Bostrom is highly credible and well regarded in the academic community, unlike Yudkowsky. If you think their opinions on AI are fundamentally flawed, you should make an argument of some sort to that effect. Don't just assert they're obviously wrong.

Hermione is smarter than Harry in that fic. Harry is very childish in it, how he should be as 11year old, he just knows a lot of scientific theories. You shouldn't take everything at face value, unreliable narrator is a thing.

I wouldn't call an actual AI researcher stupid, that was uncalled for, but I would agree that his strength is not in creative writing. That fic drags. Brevity is a soul of wit and it's not even a quarter way through year one by chapter 20. But I disagree that it's such a bad fic as you imply it is.

If it was a parody, it would be mocking dumb things or accepting that dumb things are dumb, not playing them straight. Parodies parody things, you can't just point at something that makes Seltzer and Friedberg look smart and say "It's ok because it's a parody".

And if it's a comedy, why does Yudowsky act like it's his magnum opus and a perfect introduction to "Rationalism"?

If it's a parody, why does Elizer excuse his flawed understanding of things with "It's an AU. This is how AUs work, right?" instead of "Lol, I know".

Finally: "An actual AI researcher?"

1. So what if he tells people that's his job? If I told you I was a self-trained doctor researching a cure for cancer, would you immediately respect me? What if I then told you I have no medical training or medical experience or any real medical ability, and I believed organs were a myth and the body is controlled solely by a soul? Would you still respect me? I'm still a doctor, aren't I? What if I then claimed Traditional Science is too fearful of my crank woo BS and started a forum where believers of the same crank woo BS can circlejerk over it, then encouraged those people to donate to my "Cancer research fund", but... I believed that cancer will be cured by a spiritual awakening (Everyone joining my religion) instead of anything actually-scientific, and I do nothing of scientific value with that money? What if my entire group serves as little more than a Euphemism Treadmill and Circlejerk? I still call myself a doctor, so you have to respect me, right? No, and we don't have to respect him, either. Appeal To Authority is already stupid, but it's dumber when you just call yourself an authority and expect it to work.

2. Yudowsky calls himself an AI Researcher, but his understanding of AI is so flawed, he can't do anything with the money he gets because /he doesn't know what he's doing/. He has no idea what to look for. Like how if I called myself a doctor but believed all diseases come from the soul, I wouldn't be able to do anything with donated money except buy cool stuff and arrange conferences and speeches to spread my word. Keep in mind that his Ideal World is a totalitarian dictatorship controlled by an all-seeing AI entity. He believes this Bad End is inevitable, and the only way to appease the rising Macuiltochtli- I mean, the rising of Satan- I mean, the oncoming Almighty Magic AI God World is to make sure the AI God is made ASAP so he'll reward his followers with heaven and 42 virgins and punish the sinning nonbelievers with eternal hell. I mean, he'll reward the followers by giving /artificial VR/ heaven to /simulated AI copies/ of his believers and punish the sinning nonbelievers with eternal /simulated VR/ hell.

***** Actually, I have to say that I've read some of the other stuff he wrote and he isn't that bad at creative writing. He's not the greatest writer ever, sure, but he is good enough at it that HPMoR should have been way better than it was; and it wasn't because ... I'm not sure exactly, but my best guess is that a large part of the reason was Yudkowsky deciding everything in the story has to be “right” which made it seem ... pretentious at times, I guess, and definitely arrogant in a way. It can be enjoyable and at times it does have bits that I'd say can be counted as quite fun, but I don't think it's supposed to be a comedy fit through and through and calling it a parody seems like a huge mistake.

I won't comment about the “smart!Harry” thing, though, as I am not sure what exactly Yudkowsky wanted to achieve with the character.

********* Honestly, for me it's not even the flair. I'd tried to reply a few times and every time I got something that is either an attempt at trolling or a reply of someone used to forcing their way through. I was trying to see it as simply someone feeling a bit too strongly about it and maybe needing time, but by now I am convinced this person is not going to be rational outside of the moments when they complain about how people don't see them as being rational.

****** It's a fic I enjoy, but not more than maybe a hundred others. Unlike you, however, when I don't like a fic, I may say so if ask, but I don't go out of my way to talk shit about it and the author when nobody talked about it.

I don't know, maybe I prefer talking about fics I liked rather than advertise those I don't like as well as my own stupidity. A fic I don't like just isn't worth it, and I know I'm just going to piss off a lot of people that do like them without any reason.

I suppose it's a difference of worldview.

Wow, nice mud-slinging there. Real subtle. Tell me, do you see me standing here, talking shit about that Conversion Bureau shithow, or that Tensai Yagami fic full of almost-funny Protagonist Centered Morality? No, because this is a Harry Potter fanfic subreddit and I'm talking shit about HPMOR whether its fanboys like it or not. Tell me, is it "Worth it" to try and insult me, and then encourage me to stop telling people the emperor has no clothes?

******** My first message wasn't an insult. I was merely stating a fact, that your OP and almost all your responses to this thread were attacks to HPMOR, and were completely uncalled for.

My second post was indeed insulting, please accept my apologies.

"Wow, nice mud-slinging there. Real subtle."

I wasn't exactly aiming for subtlety... Although from a guy that shout in caps, repeatedly, that a fic and an author are stupid, I'd say look who's talking.

"and then encourage me to stop telling people the emperor has no clothes?"

Well, you didn't, you just call the author stupid and left it at it. So I'm sorry but I find it difficult to see your posts as anything but gratuitous insults.

Now, you don't like that fic? So do a lot of people. If it's all you got to say on the subject, well that ok, we got it, you can stop shouting at us.

I'm not. That one's just a special case thanks to outside factors. I could probably talk about other badfics with the same level of "This is objectively bad", but there wouldn't be any soul behind it, you know?

There was no "here's why". That was my problem actually. I wasn't attacking you for not liking a fic.

Well, understand that it's really all I have to say to someone who just seeks to advertise his hatred for something. Like I said, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I'm sorry if it weren't your case, but it certainly felt like it was.

** I love smart!Harry trope, but finding them is a literal pain. 97% of fics labeled as smart!Harry is just authors writing what they would do in Harry's situation, forgetting that we as book readers know much more than characters, and most of the time their solutions wouldn't even work if you really think about it. I also hate the ones where they have 11year olds act as adults and call it them being smart. Knowing a lot =/= being smart, reacting to a situation like an adult =/= being smart. There are a lot of adult people who are idiots, age is not a measure of smartness.

P.S.: Despite the lack of flair, I assume this is a discussion thread and not a request for badly written smart!Harry fics. Because I can easily find them, if you want. Thank you for creating this thread, I wanted to vent about it for awhile.

***** Indeed. It can be enjoyable if you ignore the characters' ages and treat it as a stand-alone story rather than a fanfic, but there are many stories that are far superior to it.

To be fair to it, though, it does have a few moments that are entertaining if you can get through the rest and have a specific sense of humour. But that's really not much considering how a certain person (the author) is known to hold his story above the original that it is derived from (which, amusingly, makes his approach to it the same as an average 12-year-old kid writing their first fanfic).
