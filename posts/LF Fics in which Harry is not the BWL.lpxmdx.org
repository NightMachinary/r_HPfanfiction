** There is the obligatory Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][ffn]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21393430/chapters/50965216][ao3]]). Yes Harry is a prodigy in this story. Yes He goes to Durmstrang to not be held back by the schooling system. Yes the Potters are alive. No he is not angsty edge-lord who hates his family. He actually cares about his brother. Note that ao3 has 6 more chapters, though (if I understand it properly, correct me if I'm wrong) those are from another author. Still, more chapters.

Oh, and LPT: Try reddit search function with key words/phrases like WBWL, BWL, etc. to find threads with possibly similar queries to what you are looking for.

** Are you looking for the focus to be on Neville and his story as the Boy Who Lived? Or for it to be focused on Harry? If it's the latter, try the Art of Self Fashioning: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]] or Forget-Me-Not: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24931486/chapters/60339388]] or The Thrown Pebble: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16083065/chapters/37558553]]

** How do you make a fanfic, just saying some things that would happen?
