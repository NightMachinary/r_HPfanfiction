Dumbledore had just lost his family, his sister, Ariana, now gone from this world. His brother wishing it were him instead of her. The man he loves locked away like a mad animal. He was despondent, to say the least. He was hunted by reporters, well wishers, and brown-nosers. Sometimes he just needed to be away so he could forget who he is.

Rambling through the streets of muggle London, he's not entirely sure where he is to be completely honest. He pauses in front of a sweet shop. A young muggle girl is trying to tempt passerby's with samples from the shop, with many stopping for a sweet.

‚ÄúWe have licorice, jelly babies, and lemon drops on special offer! Try one now, it'll change your life!‚Äù

Albus glances inside at the shop, it was clearly muggle. How in the world would they be able to change someone's life with a simple sweet? It was an evocative thought. Like a tendril of Amortentia, the thought caressed his mind, beckoning him to give in and see for himself. Sweets infused with Felix Felicis, with Vertiserum, with the Elixir of Life, with...

He frowned, and pushed away that thought. Thoughts like that had almost cost him his life, the reckless and ill thought out plans. He turned and picked up his pace, now realizing where he was and that he was not far from an apparition point.

The young girl called to him, ‚ÄúSir, I only have lemon drops left, but would you like to try one? They make me smile when I'm having a bit of a day.‚Äù


** Albus has reached her at that point. Feeling it would be rude to refuse after she singled him out, he cast a non-verbal poison detection charm. He carefully took the lemon drop offered on the the young girl's tongs, remembering to thank her quietly.

He put the sweet in his mouth, not expecting the rough texture from the sugar. Then it hit him, the sour. His face scrunched up and it took everything in him to not spit it back out. The girls laugh tinkled, for a second he heard Ariana in her laugh.

‚ÄúHave you not tried a lemon drop before sir?‚Äù

Cracking the sweet in his teeth, finding it more pleasant to do so, he apologized, ‚ÄúNo, madam, I have not. It was an unusual experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's why there best when you're having a bad day. They're the most cheerful sweet. They're sunny yellow, and if you look in a mirror, it will definitely make you laugh when you eat them. My Da makes them especially sour for this reason.‚Äù

Albus gave this a smile. ‚ÄúWell, you've certainly managed to brighten my day a little bit, and I thank you for it.‚Äù

She smiles and turns to go in the shop, her tray now long empty, and Albus, he followed her in.

‚ÄúI would like to purchase some of your special lemon drops if I could.‚Äù

They finished the transaction quietly, Albus thinking about how a little sweet managed to lessen the weight on his shoulders. He was glad he remembered to bring Muggle money, even if he did have to look closely for sickles and knuts. He bid the young girl good-bye and thanked her again.

She called out as he was exiting, the bell ringing cheerfully as the door opened, ‚ÄúA single day can change a life, sir.‚Äù

He turned to ask her what she meant, but she was already gone.

-Epilogue-

Albus offered the boy in front of him a lemon drop. Harry refused, looking down at the desk in front of him. He had been quite morose since Sirius had fallen through the veil.

Albus remembered the days he ate the sweets so much to distract him from his thoughts and the misery that had overtaken him. He offered again, knowing that sometimes that pride won't always let you accept help the first time.

Harry, understandably already a little moody, yelled, ‚ÄúWhy are those sweets so bloody important to you?‚Äù

Smiling benevolently at Harry, he answered, ‚ÄúMy boy, try one and I will tell you.‚Äù

Harry begrudgingly accepted a lemon drop. As he shoved it in his mouth, Albus conjured a giant mirror to let Harry see his face as the sour hit.

As soon as his face puckered, he started giggling. Eventually he had to swallow the candy before he started to laugh even harder. Each time he looked in the mirror only making it worse. He had calmed down when Albus produced a glass of water.

‚ÄúHarry, my dear boy, each day is a gift. We must always treasure the moments that leave us full of happiness and contentment. We must also treasure the days that leave us aching and empty. For it is on one of those days, I found one of my greatest treasures. A muggle sweet shop. It's the same one that made the lemon drops I have today. I found them on one of my bleakest days. I now treasure that miserable day as one of my best.‚Äù

Harry thought about it for a minute. ‚ÄúAre you saying that a sweet changed your life so that's why you want everyone to try it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Albus said, ‚ÄúI do it because I love seeing the faces people make.‚Äù
