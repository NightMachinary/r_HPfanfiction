Several people, myself included, couldn't find the timelines on the new HP Lexicon, but I happened to click an old link that took me to the [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/calendars/calendar_ps.html][one for PS]], which has links to the rest of the school-year timelines (all of which still have the old design...) so I thought I'd share it for the rest of you who couldn't find them.

I did manage to get to [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/timeline.html][this index page]], but half the links there don't work. From what I can tell, any link with "hplex" or ".php" doesn't seem to work, but if it's "legacy.hp-lexicon [...] .html" then it seems to be okay. With any luck, the rest will be updated and working with time. (Pun not intended.)

If you are in desperate need of the timelines, the amazing [[/u/tusing]] archived the whole lexicon a year ago and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2zol6h/hp_lexicon_archive_for_offline_use_download/][it's still up for download]].


** Awesome, thanks for posting and letting us know of the downloadable timelines!!
