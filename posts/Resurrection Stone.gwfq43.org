:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi All,

I'm remembering a fic and I can only remember a part where something happens and Harry and Dumbledore get trapped in a safe house. Dumbledore hurt his arm from the resurrection stone and Harry uses the stone and his parents appear and help him help Dumbledore.

I'm pretty sure Harry uses a chocolate wrapper to cover the burns and he pushes the curse out with his parents help.

It may have been a mentor Snape fic? But I can't remember anything else.

Thanks for the help in advance!

#+begin_quote
  When Severus Snape is left in charge of Hogwarts over the christmas break, he is less than pleased to discover Harry will be one of his charges. Events force him to face that Mr Potter may not be quite what he has assumed all these years. Year 6
