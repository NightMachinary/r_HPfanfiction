The best I can came up with right now, if I flip the W into an M, is "I, Abyssal Lord Le'Nimue". Though Nimue is the Lady of the Lake in Arthurian legend so I don't know why an Abyssal Lord should have that name.

**** Anyone who "thinks" they have a sound mind and become a slayer might try that technique. Also, just got a visual of Danny Phantom's Ember....

"Sound Slayer!!! The Renowned Devastator!!!"

Much better than his good lord riff of:

"This is Ronald!!!! You will get Fondle-" "Cut the mic! Cut the mic!"

******** It sounds horribly Hufflepuff for dark lords to band together thus starting to investigate Hufflepuffs. It was then noticed that all top positions belong to Hufflepuffs( but it's simply due to being hardworking people getting at the top).

Council of Dark Lords run by a Hufflepuff Dark Lord?

A further investigation to the Dark Lord council conspiracy has netted a disturbingly proof that we might be facing a Hufflepuff conspiracy. As you all know, every major head position is seated by Hufflepuffs. Every single one of them. This begs the question as to why would so many badgers risk getting close to the Heliopaths in the ministry unless there is more to it.

There has been a strange successive emergence of dark lords lately.

It is very well known that Albus Dumbledore is in fact a Very Griffindor Dark Lord whose campaign is to blind the enemy with flashy clothes and inflict the most Heinous crimes against Fashion in order to push forward the goal that one must wear at least 3 clashing colors and feed people with Lemon drops that will make people feel, see and taste psychedelic colors. He is very straightforward, very Griffindor in motives and very honorable in accepting defeat when one says no to lemon drops.

It was further supposed that Grindelwald with his pursuit of mythic object is a very Ravenclaw for Dark Lord. Despite not going to Hogwarts, the research needed to trace even a single Deathly Hallow is enormous. Thus, only a true academic or should we say, a very Ravenclaw dark lord, would endavour to complete the set..

While the most recent dark Lord, You know who is a decendant of Slytherin while not very Slytherin in some of his methods, the Pureblood propaganda is popular amongst Slytherin as well as the snake motif that he used. Very Slytherin indeed.

Perhaps the newly uncovered Badger Dark Lord roams the ministry this will complete the cycle.

Thus Quibbler concludes that perhaps there is a Hufflepuff dark lord running the ministry

A Quibbler exclusive by the dark lady, Vodoo Angel Lu (not to be confused with Luna Lovegood)

** Royal Basileus Wendel. AKA king/emperor Wendel. (Ronald Bilius Weasley)

He is no mere Lord Because Weasley is our king.

I can Imagine his motif is Chess Pieces where his mark changes based on rank. Like bishops or knight, a queen for inner circle. A King chess Piece as Dark mark. Literally treats people as Pawns. A highly strategic Dark Lord but emotional. Someone who switches from crazy like Ceasar to Claudius to Nero level of madness.

Not entirely powerful but knows how to make powerful people do things for him and how to put the right person for the right job. A king piece only moves one tile and rarely fights but its fine, that's what the other chess Piece are for. He'll just run away or get someone to interfere to prevent checkmate

** If you flip the W to an M, you can make it the latin “Diabolus Lyra Semel In” which means “Once The Devil Lyra”. A “Lyra” is a musical instrument, but it sounds like “Lier” when spoken today, so I imagine it will be altered by accident by the public.

And as they say, “Once a devil, always a devil”.
