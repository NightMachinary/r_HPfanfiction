#+TITLE: Standard entity of power sends Harry to a different dimension with just a few subtle differences... only the concept of ‘subtle’ is far different for an almighty force in charge of the universe in relation to a human.

And so Harry shows up on an earth where the moon is made of actual cheese; normal, non-magic and non-sapient Llamas are in charge of the Ministry of Magic and whales frequently swim around on earth and are used instead of cars, things like that...

Basically the idea of ‘subtle differences' for an extra planar being concerning the laws of reality as a whole instead of societies as seem by a human's perspective.


** So, as an example of a subtle difference, the universal gravitational constant is a tad off, or an electron has slightly less or more change than it should...

**** The sound waves one is just cruel. Imagine Harry whispers something extremely embarrassing to a friend, and half the country hears it.

***** Oh, that's just the least unpleasant possibility. Imagine a bee flying around, the sound grows progressively more intense the further it travels gaining energy, at an inch from the bee it is merely annoying but mostly ignorable, at the edge of the town it is strong enough to equal the sound of a particularly powerful sound system at it's maximum volume blaring the sound literally inside your ear; as it enters a new town it becomes an actual and particularly dangerous health-hazard and breaks every window in it's path; at the border os the state it gets strong enough to cause actual earthquakes and drop buildings by itself (meaning without the help of the earthquake); as it arrives in the ocean it is now creating town-devouring tsunamis, then it crosses the entire surface of earth and is at this point so powerful it literally disintegrates solid objects and increases temperature to unbearable degrees... of course, this would be the sound of a single bee batting it's wings, more sounds in different directions and intensities would ironically work to downgrade the impacts of the other sound waves or increase it depending on the direction it is moving, the type of sound and the place it comes from. In sum, absolute chaos.

** reminds me of a manga where a screw fell off the earth because a spaceship crashed into it. So everything went a bit... weird.

** Apart from the "standard entity of power" bit, it sounds like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side by Clell65619) would fit.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
