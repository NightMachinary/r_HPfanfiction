I have stumbled upon multiple fanvids inspired by this story, and was super excited to read it after looking through the many positive comments regarding it, but sadly all traces of said fic have been removed. I simply can't find it anywhere. The fic is a Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings crossover with the main pairing being Hermione/Legolas. I even tried using the Wayback Machine with the original link: [[http://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245552]]

Strangely only 5 of the 17 chapters show up, so that's equally useless to me. Any help finding this fic would be greatly appreciated!


** I'm curious, was it completed? I like LOTR crossovers.

When was the last time you saw it online?

*** I never saw it when it was properly online. I found a dead link to the fic in the description of a fanvid just today. I then used the Wayback Machine to try and see if it was archived ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20091230124322/http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245552]]), and it said it was last updated December 12, 2009. The status says "work in progress" with 17 chapters.

Also, I miscounted the chapters that work in my original post.

The chapters that work are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

The chapters that don't work are: 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17
