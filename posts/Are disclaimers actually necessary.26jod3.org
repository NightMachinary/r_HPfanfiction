Pretty much every single story on fanfiction.net seems to have them. Yet many of them are so funny and creative, I doubt they serve any other function besides amusing the readers.

Is there anything in the rules about having to write your own disclaimer? Is there any chance a story could be removed just for not having one?

** Back in the bad old days, it was basically a requirement to post on some of the older websites. JKR's lawyers were raging beasts and it was a voodoo charm to hold off the madness. Most sites of the time required it as part of their terms of service for posting, to try to avoid getting C&D letters.

As for a legal requirement nowadays? You can get sued for anything, but I understand it as not being a required ass covering measure unless you were doing something for money or that could have been confused for JKR's work. Like maybe if you were posting on a personal website and had paid ads on it, but that gets really obscure and I am not a lawyer. So you'd need to ask one about that.

You don't need disclaimers to post on FFN or AO3, but basically everywhere else that hosts fics still wants you to do it. I actually bounced off a few sites that wanted full disclaimers for /all/ real world copyrighted and trademarked mentions in the fic.

Like, for example, I mentioned the Terminator movies, and they wanted a full fucking IMDB note that I didn't own that copyright and who did.

/Yeah/, I didn't choose to continue trying to post with those bumbling idiots.

** The only disclaimers I use, other than in the first chapter which is the usual nod to JKR, is when I am quoting phrases or excerpts from one of the books, I usually cite the book. Only when citing the books do I feel it really necessary.

** For me it became a habit because one of the sites where I was cross-posting stories insisted upon stories having them as a policy. I came up with something simple and now include it for every chapter I post.

*** I figure one for each story, but one every chapter always seems a bit superfluous to me. Do you do it for a 'better safe than sorry' ideal?

**** That, and I have a habit of working in .rtf files, and they get weird about spacing. By having a base template (including disclaimer) I start new chapter files with the preferred line spacing. Also, this helps distinguish between the actual chapter file and the snippet files for that chapter. Not always, but sometimes.

***** I like using a complete boilerplate for each chapter in part because it helps identify my work when bots scrape and "steal" it from FFN to repost in weird places.

I don't care so much about the copyright issues, for /obvious/ reasons. But I think if someone randomly runs into a floating chapter somewhere, it will make it easier for that reader to track my work down if they have pen name and full title in the chapter text.

I also do the chapter template thing for consistency. Playing the "is that a <br> or a <p> new line?" game every chapter destroys creative flow and editing focus instantly.

** I would think that it would be assumed that nobody writing on a fanfiction site actually owns the rights to their stories. If they did, they wouldn't be writing on a fanfiction site. I find disclaimers unnecessary and don't use them; I've never been cited or anything for not including one.

** A lot of them are amusingly wrongheaded. "No copyright infringement is intended." Yeah, like that would make a difference if you got sued.
