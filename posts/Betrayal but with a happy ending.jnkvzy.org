Some sort of heart break or betrayal. Things aren't forgiven automatically, but are worked through gradually.

No main character deaths.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, no Ron abusing Hermione

No Rape of the characters.

  COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.
