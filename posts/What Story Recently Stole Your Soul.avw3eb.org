What story recently pulled you into it more thoroughly than most others? I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

I just finished linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) maybe fifteen minutes ago. I made an audible sound of anguish when the next chapter didn't appear when I see the app. I started reading it early this morning. I only paused for a short lunch before reading again (and for moments of dancing when the hype became too much). I'm crushing on Calypso hard which is really put of the norm because 1) Girls don't typically crush on other girls and 2) I am almost always against a story with a pairing.

The story was leagues better than most of the stuff I've found. I noticed several meh flaws with it of course, but those are a given for any story given how critical I am. It was definitely added into the aptly titled "Good shit" folder for writing I find exceptional.

Now show me yours.

***** No. I was making a joke about how much she was into that story, and with TenorDrummer having told her there's more, she'd ignore reddit, and read the rest of what she's missed. Basically my reaction if I knew something like Core Threads had updated.

****** Any chance there is something else past the Russian site? I admit that creating a program to reformat that horrible garbage was kinda fun, but separating the bold/italic text into paragraphs took way too long due to the original epub not using proper paragraphs. Imagine a fanfiction where the entire chapter was a single line of text. I had to translate that into legible paragrapghs. Either way, I just finished chapter 23.

I need more. My crush on Calypso is stronger than ever. I need to see her +get plowed+ relationship with Harry finish its evolution. I really want to know where that pathway is going. My own abandonment issues were bothering me for a lot of it. Also, the story just has so much left. I need closure.

Not sure how they change so many different elements from the regular series and still end up with the exact same story beats but just with Harry acting slightly smarter when going through them (though the different outcomes still don't change the direction of the story?). Feels like I've given it an overly negative review here but it's definitely something I've noticed while reading.

Of course, Hermione's stutter was incredibly endearing to me which made me tolerate it long enough to like it. The author was very clever in not overusing it. If y-y-y-you stutter more than three times, then I'm basically dropping the story.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

This one. Found it recommended somewhere in this subreddit and I really, really enjoyed it. But goddamnit, the part where it leaves off is just the worst! I could have understood stopping a couple chapters back, even if I wouldn't have liked it, but it stops just at the start of what I wanted to read about the most. It's like when you read a completed story, and then you see a sequel that has 2 chapters and 3k words.

Still, highly recommended, really interesting read.

Wilhelmina Gamp had no plans to one day become the grandmother of Gellert Grindelwald, but a Slytherin heart has a way of getting what it wants. Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France and its wizarding backlash, it's a tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love. This is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?

** Recently read linkffn(The Truth Between Wands and Zee) and its sequels nonstop. It's not perfect but then again, I did like watching the World War Z movie and reading the book so that played a big role in getting me very interested in this fanfic.

  The war between humans and zombies rages even after five years. Military efforts to repel the hordes of undead prove less than entirely effective. A team of military medical specialists are brought together to try and find a solution. They are joined, however, by some unexpected participants. The survival of humanity rests in what emerges from the meetings. (First Tale)

*** Sequels? There's only 6 chapters. :( I'm hooked on what I've read so far. Is there some other site that had more of it?

Edit: never mind, I found the other stories. The stories are not tagged as complete but I guess they are. I've seen two other stories on the author's story list

** My latest was [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/they-said-i-could-be-anything-jumpchain-si.702859/][They Said I Could Be Anything]]'s beginning (the HP arc) ~28k words

--------------

It's light hearted, cracky and without tension... was completed when I started reading it (it's a jumpchain, so only the HP arc is/Was completed but /'MC transitioned to next universe'/ is an acceptable ending to me).

I also enjoy OP-MC stuff, /'cause escapism!/ so it was right up my alley especially when the cast go /uuh, what?/ as reactions go.

--------------

It and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky][Black Sky]] are the two fictions I feel like recommending from time to time.... but I don't expect this one to stay '/cool/' in my mind for long.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** The Fallout by Everythursday is an amazing mature Dramione.

It's written as there was a long term war between the Order and the Deatheaters. The character development is insanely good. I actually read it all over again after I finished.
