**** In an open battle they would, there is no doubt. Look at the sheer firepower for example the Red Army could field. At the Oder-Nei√üe they amassed over 2500000 soldiers, 40000 artillery pieces and 6000 tanks ready for combat operations. There's no way wizards could match that.

But wizards don't do field battles. There would be guerilla tactics involved and magic is unbeatable at that. If your opponent could literally strike at any time and place, kill ten soldiers before vanishing the resulting conflict would make Vietnam look like a vacation.

***** Go ahead and draw up that many forces. Wizards can "match" it easily.

I will portkey in ten wizards, spread out, who then invoke Fiendfyre.

They will then portkey out, rest a bit, then do it again.

Wizards have WMD capable spells that take moments to cast. MAD means nothing to people who can teleport. If Fiendfyre is half as uncontrollable as we are led to believe, you'll have a glass field and millions dead in a half hour.

****** I said in a field battle. Smart wizards would fight like you described but I can see the Death Eaters walk in front of an armoured division to teach those muggles a lesson.

Uh...how would the wizards/witches stop the Fiendfyre afterwards? Like, before it incinerates the entire surface of the planet?

I mean, considering it can vaporise water, consume any and all magically-protected items up to and including horcruxes, resists being dispelled... If you let ten wizards cast a Fiendfyre in the open air and let it run wild, how many wizards would it take to contain it again?

******* Once the military threat has been dealt with, the fiendfyre can be contained, unless it is simply allowed to burn out on its own. HP Lexicon/canon is understandably vague on how to deal with it, but it is known that it will eventually go out by the fact that the epilogue happens and the world wasn't consumed by Crabbe's curse. :)

***** Why would wizards need to match muggles in combat. They'd win a war in about 30 minutes, and they wouldn't even need to try. The minister would tell some underling to go take control of the muggle Ministry. Then Percy or someone like him would go do it.

It was a hypothetical scenario because that's how many people imagine war works. Two sides meet on the field and only one leaves.

******* I don't even think a wr with the muggles would get off the ground. Kingsley in HBP is a good example that wizards have infiltrated muggle governments at a high level. They would just cripple the leadership if the sentiment for a war got to a serious point

*** If, in a fic's universe, a modern, non-electric muggle telescope is objectively better than a telescope bought in Diagon Alley, why should "Harry" bow to tradition and spend money on an inferior product just because it's tradition? Why not just say, "The tradition is great, but I'd prefer not to waste money on an inferior product. You do you over there. I'll do me over here."
