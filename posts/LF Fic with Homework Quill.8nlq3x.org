Harry made a Quill that did Homework for him by combining Anti-cheating Quill, Quick-Quotes-Quill, Dicta-quill, or somethinig like that. It was a decent fic.


** I think it was called Harry the Hufflepuff, the author has a few in the series and Harry is really lazy

*** Not the one I'm looking for. Harry sells the quills to make money as well as using them himself. It was a reasonable long fic iirc.

**** I know of two. Harry the Hufflepuff which was suggested. He eventually outsources the manufacturing and sales for a cut of the profits.

A second one which I don't remember the name of, he demonstrates it by reading out bullet points, which the quill turns into full sentences.

*** i am not sure, to me it seems that he sometimes puts more effort into not having to do things than it would take to just do them ^{^}
