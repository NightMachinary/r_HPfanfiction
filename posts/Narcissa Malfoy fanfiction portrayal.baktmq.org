I am a little bit irritated at the portrayal of Narcissa Malfoy in fanfics. Especially in those that she is portrayed as a saint. You can have her portrayed in a favourable light in the protagonists eye but where I find it irritating is when all her negative traits are removed. You have to remember she is as bigoted as Lucius there are instances in the books where she shows that like for example when she is with Draco at madam Malkins she says something in the vein that they are gonna take their business elsewhere because of the filth that shops there as she looks specifically at Hermione. Another Instance is when Harry, Hermione and Ron are taken to Malfoy Manor she pretends that she doesn't know Greyback and that is most certainly because he is a werewolf she would never want to be associated to 'their kind'. Sorry for the rant but what are your opinions on characters that are completely changed in fanfictions.


** You can have several representation of Narcissa Malfoy, as every other character. While most of her representation are canon compliant or tend to gloss other her negatives traits (but yeah, she is like the Ultimate MILF or Harry Potter and as for the other, you try to make the ship looks better), some can push her in the other direction.

For example, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] , the author makes Lucius look pretty good while Narcissa is just a barely saner Bellatrix Lestrange.

** I think if you're writing a fanfic, you have the right to change a character, but I feel that it behooves the writer to have a compelling reason for the change. If a writer just decides to make an arbitrary change in a character's behavior or attitude without any reasoning behind it, it can be very jarring for readers, especially in the fanfic realm where people come to read about characters they're already familiar with.

So, with Narcissa, I think there's quite a lot of wiggle room with her, especially since Lucius is such a dominant personality. How would Narcissa behave and change is he were out of the picture early on? These are the sorts of questions fanfic authors seek to answer.

*** Yes that is fine if you explain the change in character. I was talking more about the sudden unexplained changes.

**** That's probably mostly new writers with big ideas but little understanding of how to execute. This is where your well-considered feedback as a reader can help!

** Personally I always saw Narcissa as a bigot, but "tamer" than your typical Death Eater. Basically, she doesn't care for Muggleborns, and doesn't shy away from saying so, but she wouldn't join the Death Eaters herself. She would, however, not care if the Death Eaters won, and not see anything wrong with that (she doesn't care about Lucius' activities as long as they don't result in danger for her family).

** What about fanfics with Mary Sue Hermione or OP Harry? It's the same thing. People write what they want, and popular portrayals become stereotypes or tropes.
