Just wondering about a few things that as readers you look for in a Fic that makes the difference between a good Fic and a great one. The difference between a “this is a pretty good Fic” and reading it until four in the morning and as soon as you wake up.

Also what are the ‘Great fics' or the ‘classics' of HP fan fiction? What are the stories that everyone has to read and changed fan fiction?

And I was not sure about the flair but this is more of a discussion than a recommendation. Although recommendations are part of the discussion if that makes any sense.

Knut for your thoughts


** Great dialogue is important to me. I feel like that's where you can immediately tell --- is this author interesting, compelling, subtly funny? Dialogue is where I decide: Do I want to spend my free time with this person for the next few days?

** Ramp and justification.

A story that starts at a million miles an hour has nowhere to go. How do you make that more exciting and more tense? You just string fun action scenes together and hope it all works out. A great story has slow bits. It has progression. As the story goes on more bits fall into place and you realise how high the stakes have got and then it peaks and ends, no dragging it out for the sake of increasing the word count. Too many stories are a collection of 'cool' ideas loosely strung together. The stakes don't have to be end of the world stuff, just make it seem like it matters. Petty school rivalries can be really important to characters and stories could be built around it if you can get the reader to understand why its such a big deal.

Justification. Harry walks into a bar and starts a fight with Moody. The reader reads a cool fight, gets a decent action scene but the moment it ends you're left wondering why on earth did Harry fight Moody? If the fight was good enough, it was fun then you might read on but if the why never comes then the whole thing is pointless. Once again you have an idea not a story. That's not to say everything needs an explanation, a sense of mystery can be great but things need to make sense. Its a reason a lot of people hate CC, people don't make choices that fit with what we know about them and therefore they stick out. A villain that is evil for the sake of being evil is okay in a children's novel but it works so much better if they have a reason. If they have a clear motivation and their actions line up with an attempt to achieve their goals I understand. I should understand but disagree with the antagonist. An example of when its jarring and frustrating but okay for children is something like Wacky Racers. The bad guys should win except they keep making dumb choices. Its fun but nobody will say its truly great.

** Canon fidelity is important to me. A story should not /be/ equal to Canon but should respect that it exists and it's the basis of all fanfiction.

Characterization is key. Keep your characters... well, in character. I am so done with "Manipulative Albus" fics because /they clearly have no idea just how terrifying the idea of a manipulative Dumbledore would be./

Take the job of explaining /why/ the world you created is different from the original. I don't care that Harry is ooc in your fic, I care /why/ is he ooc. Give a reasonable explanation for all the divergences.

Lastly, bashing is the ultimate expression of a bad writing and bad author. It literally adds *nothing* to the story and detracts from the value of your characters. It shows immaturity and unoriginality from you as an author that you resort to bashing.

Just my two knuts.

*** The issue with canon Dumbledore is that he is either manipulative or simply incompetent and stupid. I mean, if a thirteen year old girl can figure out what is going on, then why could the greatest wizard alive not do the same. Or the thing with Sirius. He is Head of Parliament, Chief Justice and could take the entire ministry in a fight, but let's instead use two children to deal with this extreme miscarriage of justice.

And to be clear, with manipulative I mean Machiavellian, not mustache twirling "for the greater good, Harry".

**** Most of that has to do with Rowling wanting to give Harry and the Gang a reason to do what they do during the books. Especially considering the fact that the first few books were very much targeted towards a younger audience, ie. 11-14.

If Dumbledore was written as competent, at least in how the fan community views competency, the books wouldn't exist as we know them. It would simply be, "look at Dumbledore save the day again."

So you get this weird gray area as a result of it, where Dumbledore is either incompetent because he didn't fix every conceivable problem, or he's manipulative and allowed everything to happen because he wanted it to turn out that way. That's just the problem you have for including such a powerful character with a protagonist that's very evidently weaker. Gotta' make it about Harry, not Dumbledore.

It's all up to individual interpretation, but for a series that went from a tween audience to young adult, it makes sense that Rowling ended up writing him that way.

I don't recall him committing anything that would be considered a war crime during the series, unless being an insufferable prick is now an executable offence.

Snape I would say isn't a hero at all, he's just an asshole, as well as being a sad, broken man. Honestly, I felt he was one of the more believable characters in the whole series. Yeah, he's a dick, but everything he does makes sense within his character.

Especially violations of subsection f were usually just dealt with in one way, and Malfoy did that constantly by wearing Hogwarts robes or polyjuicing himself into a civilian and not wearing Death Eater regalia and hiding his dark mark.

** For me it's about the world building. I've been reading fan fiction for so long (before the last two books came out) that I'm not particularly fussed about strict adherence to canon. For me, I'm always sucked in by the fics that take the wonderful world JK Rowling created and expand on it in ways we don't get the opportunity to see through Harry's limited POV in the books. Of course the fic also needs the foundations of any story (plot, fleshed out characters, grammar, etc.) but its the world building that takes it from good to great for me.

** It's hard to pin down, but for me, I'd say a lot of it is that things have to /make sense/. That means no one holding the idiot ball. It means that diverging from canon is fine, but you should think through the source and implications of your divergence, what the ripples will touch. It means that people should generally stay in character, unless there was some specific divergence that caused their character to change. It means that the villains have to have a logical reason not to just shoot the hero, and moreover, they should have a logical reason (however flawed that logic) for being villains in the first place.

The more you have to handwave things and have them just because the story requires them, the more it becomes just an interesting idea, rather than a classic.

** Good, well motivated characters, each wanting something different. This is the foundation of any well written story. Out of this often will come a plot.

In "The Scourge From the North" by Cal/DogheadThirteen (one of the best written fics I've read recently) currently only posted over on the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group, Harry and Pansy have been forced into an arranged marriage per the usual tropes, and that where things start to go sideways.

Harry wants to prove he can be safe away from the Dursleys, Draco wants revenge on Harry for "stealing his girl", Pansy wants to make her future as stable and happy as possible, Dumbledore wants an heir, Dobby wants to secure a good place for elves in the future, and Hermione wants safety and security after a massive shock.

Many of these naturally cause conflict, and that's just chapter 1.

Edit to clarify Harry's motivations. Also worth noting that the exception to the rule that plot comes from character motivations, are instances where the setting drives the story, such as disaster stories and the like. Even then, the story is interesting because of the differentiated characters exploring and reacting.

How original the execution is. You can write a complete trope fest, but as long as you manage to come up with something unique, it still will be an outstanding fic. Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass does this really well. Do over time travel with a lot of focus about hiding the time travel thing, but at the same time, it's Tonks who is thrown back through time and there's no "preserving the time line". She tries to make changes and while she has foreknowledge, it is not a complete stomp either.

**** Yes, but for one Harry is way closer to Sirius than to Lupin. And it is part of the charm of the story. Tonks spends a year towards changing things, and in some ways she does, but in some ways, she cannot. For example, due to changed events, it is no longer possible to guarantee that it is just a trap, hence the need for the DoM trip.

And it also has a really great friendship dynamic between Harry, Hermione and Tonks.

** /They Shook Hands/ is, for me personally, an alternative canon series. Its so good and well written that it can easily stand on par with the original material.

After this come a few 'great fics', such as Methods of Rationality, Emperor, Benefits of Ancient Laws, and another which I forgot the title, but it involved a much darker Harry that ends up with Fleur. Currently reading Rise of the Wizards and its quickly rising up in the rank.

I think what I look for the most in a fic is, in a sense, profesionalism. I want good characters, good dialogue, and a decent enough narrative which makes an even wacky premise shine.

** A good fic for me has competent characterization, a decent plot and an actual beginning, middle and end.

A great fic has all of the above plus an * atmosphere*. This heavily depends on genre and it is a delicate balance of prose and descriptions; not overly wordy, not too short, but evocative and curiosity-provoking.

This probably comes across as a bit nebulous so I'm going to give two examples of fics with great atmosphere in their respective genres: linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) in eldtrich horror and linkffn(Unatoned) in noir.

** For me the most important criteria are: 1. Characters: They have to be flawed in some way and they have to evolve to work on their flaws or days flaws should be their downfall. Either way the characters shouldn't be perfect. 2. Progression: As in the characters should progress through their story in a believable and organic way. They can't be floundering in mediocrity in one chapter only to have magically overcome their flaws in the next chapter. The same applies for the story and romances. Calm down. Slow down. No need to rush through the buildup to the climax only to rush the downtime in between to the next buildup to the next climax.\\
That's not how story telling works. 3. Writing style: This is even more subjective than the last two but it's very important for my enjoyment of any piece of literature. You need to work on your narrative style. The story you're telling is only as good as the way in which you communicate it. Like in comedy, it's all in the delivery. If you're structure is bad and I get annoyed by how you choose too tell your story then I'm not going to bother. 4. Basic language: Pretty self explanatory. Don't suck at grammar and vocabulary. Change things up don't use the same words and phrases. Vary it from time to time break out the thesaurus of need be. And learn to spell properly. If you're not sure how something is spelt use a dictionary.

Personal favourite of mine is Poison Pen which does hall prey a little too the near perfect character but they do justify it pretty well and he's not entirely without flaws. However, the biggest draw for me is the way in which the story is told. He does a fantastic job and I was hooked from start to finish staying up all night to finish it because I wasn't willing to put it down.

*** Also clearly cut character motivation. Even the most basic motivation of "I want to be strong because I am and/or used to be weak" will do. As long as you can make it believable and stick to it. However, making a character lose sight of why they started doing something in the first place can be very effective when used correctly. For example, if a character in trying to protect someone goes off the deep end and do something that drives away the person they were trying to protect.
