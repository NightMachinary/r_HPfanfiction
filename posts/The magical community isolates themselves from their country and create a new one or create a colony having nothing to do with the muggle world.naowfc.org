I remember reading this kind of fanfiction once. Where Harry got together certain people and bought an island and created a community there absolutley isolated from the world. And another one where he did the same with the moon. It can be any kind of fic and any kind of main character on any site with any rating and any length. I just want some of that good colony stuff. Thanks in advance!!


** The only one I know of is this one where the colonization isn't exactly voluntary:

I'd be interested in reading the colonization fics you mentioned too if you have links

** Say a Prayer (Mischief's Heir) gets there eventually - starts as over the top bashing/crack, then turns into a fluffy space race. It remains a bit silly throughout the series, but the bashing gets toned way down by book two. Except Ginny - the author hates Ginny, apparently.

Journey of the Starship Hedwig - Like Mischief's Heir, there's a space race. There's even a similar reason for it. However, the results are /very, VERY/ different. The ending is also very abrupt.

Island of Fire - It's by Esama and there's tons of dragons. So like.

On an Island in the Sun - Like Rorschach's Blot? Good - have some silliness!

Rebuilding a Utopia - Harry joins Sirius and Buckbeak on the run, and they try to find a fabled lost city that seems to be based on El Dorado. They made a magic-only city.

A Place Apart is also pretty good, and was already mentioned. Book one ends on a cliffie, book two is.... well the Voldemort plotline isn't going to end anytime soon!
