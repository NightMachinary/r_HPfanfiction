Title says it all. Over 70k+ words please.


** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) Harry isn't quite yet the potions master you're looking for, though he does get pretty experienced in the later installments. This is a pretty long series, and the fourth is still incomplete, but I found this and the next two really interesting.

** Clarification: are you looking for fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] but with potions? Or fics where Harry is just acknowledged as 'a Potions Master'.

Like, an in depth explanation and exploration of the field of magic (closest I got is pretty weak on that, but a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][good fic]], there is a chapter centered around arithmancy and potions), or just the title and maybe show Harry brewing something crazy.

Also, like to point out that the title of Potions Master is solely a product of the fandom; J K meant it as being equivalent to an in school title for [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Potions_Master][the individual holding the position]], not an indicator of a higher level of education or certification. There is nothing past Hogwarts which is formally acknowledged.

Not that I'm complaining; I personally think it would make a lot of sense for there to be private individuals who are acknowledged as 'Masters' of their field who take on students in a classic Master/Apprentice type arrangement, in particular because it would help explain why Muggleborns have such a shit lot in life: they never get taken on as apprentices.

** linkffn(Shadows of Angmar) This might interest you. Harry gets abducted to Middle Earth and doesn't have a wand so he relies on potions a lot.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Abandonned by his guardians, Harry Potter vanished from existence. Years later, a young man graduates from one of the most elitist and secrete Magical schools and makes his way through Magical societies. Fate or Fatality? Ancient Greeks called it Anarkia.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
