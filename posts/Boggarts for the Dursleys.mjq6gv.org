I'm trying to think of some good ideas for my fic and wanted to see if anyone could assist.

Imagine for a moment that muggles could see boggarts. I'm going to work in a plot device so it is possible.

What would each of the Dursleys see as their worst fear?

It should be noted, that in this fic, Harry won't have been living with the Dursleys for about 6 and a half years by the time they see the boggart, though Vernon had a traumatizing run in with wizards a year and a half before the boggart.


** I think I can say what Petunia's boggart will be. In canon, she is very self conscious, takes into account what other people think of her and hates anything extraordinary or weird outside of her world views. She has her own ideas and views on how a married women should live or behave. . . . And this will be her boggart, seeing herself as a whore who cheats on her husband behind his back for money so she could buy herself drugs. Being a bitch to her sweet little Duddykins. Being un-heigienic and worst of all, all of the society knows of her behaviour.

**** I think not, because in canon it was shown that Petunia was jealous of Lilly's ability to do magic and she even sent a letter to professor Dumbledore asking if she could also get admission in Hogwarts. So if Dudley was a wizard, outwardly she would show that she was upset but inwardly she will be secretly pleased that she had a small amount of magic inside her like Lilly, as she was able to pass on her magic to Dudley.

***** Dudley being a wizard might actually work, but make it so it implies that the wizards are going to take dudley away and she never sees him again.

** So if Harry is out of the picture for the potential greatest fear then I think these ones are quite possible (not that like I actually remember what is canon anymore but whatever):

VERNON:

• Dudley being a wizard (I agree with the opinion of IamPotterhead that Petunia wouldn't really mind but Vernon wouldn't be able to live with such a fact when all he believes in are “normal” things).

• A family where Harry is loved by Petunia and Dudley.

• Dudley's death.

PETUNIA:

• A younger version of Lily telling her how pathetic she is for not being a wizard.

• Receiving a letter from Dumbledore that she can't attend Hogwarts.

• Her parents telling Lily how great she is for being a wizard.

• Dudley's death.

DUDLEY:

• Being ignored or treated like Harry in any way.

• Not being the best one (Imagine a situation where he wouldn't be a gang leader but the one being bullied for his weight or stupidity for example).

• Ending up as a pig (The tail alone was quite a shock so a whole transformation into a pig would be quite a horror for him).

• Dementor (But I have no idea when the scene happens in your story so it's last).

*** I agree, it's hard to remember what is Canon and what isn't anymore. I actually keep on my writing desk a Harry Potter encyclopedia just so I can look stuff up and check what is Canon and what is fanon now.

I put on my plot outline that even after so long of being away from the Dursleys, Harry's boggart is still going to be Vernon in a specific non Canon situation from my fic.

This situation is already in the published story if you want to read it.

Part of that arc is going to involve Harry forcing them to see their own boggarts to get over his fear. Maybe making their fears be perfectly mundane would help him or maybe making them see him as a monster will help, I haven't decided yet.

** When is this in the timeline and how old was Harry when he left them?

A canonical Dudley may very well fear dementors most (if not Hagrid), but those are invisible to Muggles.

*** Harry is 7 when he left, he was occasionally affected by Harry's accidental Magic before that, but it only spurs him to bully Harry more

This is the fic so far, it's up to the point of Harry leaving

The boggart scene will probably be around chapter 45 or 50 and I've only finished drafts up to ch 30

**** So Dudley's just been a big bully?

The thing he'd fear most is probably a bigger bully.

Or one of the kids he picked on got bigger and stronger than him and is ready to squash Dudley like a bug.
