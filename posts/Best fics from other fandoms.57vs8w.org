Not requesting Harry Potter crossovers here. When I get tired of re-reading the same Harry Potter fanfiction over and over again I branch out to see what "good" fanfiction there is from other fandoms.

To start this off, I'll put up a list of my favorite fics from other fandoms.


** [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] has a ton of amazing fanfics, most of which is found on SpaceBattles (if not exclusively, then with nigh all of the discussion taking place there).

Some of my personal favorites: * [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] features an OC benevolent would-be conqueror of the world to make it a better place gets dumped into Worm.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]], and it's sequels, Wake and Legacy, starts with a very simple what-if question from the very start of canon, and spirals wildly from there.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/][A Cloudy Path]] features the protagonist of Worm getting the ability to build technology from the Supreme Commander series, and uses this to become a hero. I am not entirely sure what the word count is, but I'm fairly certain that it's at 1 million. It's huuge, in any case, and does an amazing job of elaborating on characters and taking small events and creating big, believable ripples.

For other fandoms besides Worm, it's mostly Naruto for me, I'm afraid, but there are some gems there. * linkffn(Scorpion's Disciple) takes an antagonist (Sasori) and places him near a 9 or 10 year old Naruto, and has a brief encounter spiral into Sasori beginning to teach Naruto. There is a bit of combat and drama in it, but it has great character development, primarily of Naruto, but other characters gets to shine too.

- linkffn(Legacy Undone) takes a Naruto from some alternate future timeline, and throws him back in an alternate timeline, to when he was about four years old. The point of divergence in the timeline he's sent back to is Jiraiya being dead, which has resulted in Orochimaru still being a loyal leaf ninja. Furthermore, it totally ignores the rampart inflation in powerlevels that occurred around halfway, if not sooner, through Naruto, and creates a believable world with a strong set of OCs. (The OC Daimyo in particular. I'm not entirely sure whether or not I'm joking when I say that half of the comments over on SB are people gushing over him.)
- linkffn(The Lives Worth Saving) is rather like C'est la Vie, if you've read it. There isn't really much conflict in it, but you can't really help but smile when reading it.
- linkffn(Black Cloaks, Red Clouds) is a /massive/ AU whose point of divergence is... something I will not spoil. The results is that the Akatsuki, which were antagonists, are (sort of) the good guys, and where a character who was given very little spotlight in canon gets to be at the center of this, with many OCs and canon characters fleshed out playing a large role.

I don't read many Warcraft fics (mostly because few of them seem worth reading, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong), but linkffn(Frostblood) asks what would have happened had Jaina taken up the mantle of the Lich King, and goes from there. I'm rather fond of it's take on necromancy, and there is a theme in Jaina finding allies in the unlikeliest of places even when those she would have expected to support her fail to do so due to her new burden.

** So here I go.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man]]) An amazingly well done Lex Luthor fanfiction that makes precise use of each and every word to create a fanfic where every chapter is extremely gripping. No expense is spared for fluff with well done characterization and plot rounded off with an ending that's bound to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate]]) Another amazing Lex Luthor fanfiction that's set spanning the entire DC Universe. The plot is set at an epic level and the fabulous writing makes this truly one of the best DC fanfiction there is. The fic does have romance but it isn't forced or overbearing on the plot in any way.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain]]) Written by the same author as above^{.} This one is a Spiderman and Prototype (the videogame) crossover. No prior knowledge of Prototype is necessary. At least I didn't have any prior knowledge of the game to enjoy the quality writing and the original plot. The romance again isn't overbearing on the plot but is arguably more tropey at times. That said, it's well done and doesn't diminish from an amazing fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3294180/1/The-Incredibly-Dense-Mind-of-Lois-Lane]]) A classic funny fic written by arguably fanfiction's greatest comedy writer, Nonjon. This one's set in the comic book world with writing that'll truly make you laugh out loud.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898868/1/Professor-Arc]]) The best RWBY fic I've had the pleasure to read. It's a comedy fic that gets better and funnier every chapter while not falling for the problems that plague most comedy fanfiction. The author is by far the best author in all of RWBY fanfiction and is easily in the top authors in all of fanfiction. His other pieces of writing all deserve their spot on this list, but if I added more there would be a dozen more RWBY fanfiction recs on here so I chose to go with his best one. I really reccomend that you folks check out his other works if you like this one.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11259714/1/A-Common-Criminal-Or-Something]]) Another RWBY fanfiction but one that's much more darker. This one's situated on the edge of deserving to be on here and "what is this fic" level. It's an interesting take on how an innocent youngster becomes a common criminal and not in an idealistic romantic way. The style of this fic can we offputting but the subject matter makes the style worth bearing through, at least until it starts growing on you.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4553963/1/The-Mystery-of-Conan-Edogawa]]) A well done Conan fanfic where Ran pursues the mystery of what happened to Conan. Ran's character is truly fabulous in this fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6441645/1/Patriot-s-Dawn]]) My favorite Naruto fanfiction. The characters are wonderful and the plot is filled with realistic action and consequences and to top it all off the fic is structured with fabulous writing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10342836/1/My-Adolescent-Romantic-Comedy-Is-Incorrect-As-I-Had-Logically-Proven]]) An Oregairu fanfiction that is actually able provide an amazing characterization of Yukinoshita Yukino. A characterization that fits hand in hand with what we know of her from the original light novels. It's unbelievable how well the writer was able to grasp her attitude and thoughts.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10750716/1/The-End-of-the-Affair]]) An Oregairu fic set in the future that is hard to describe. Alongside the above fic, its the only Oregairu fanfiction that actually is able to grasp the characters, their attitudes and personalities to an accurate degree.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5588986/1/Trust-in-God-or-The-Riddle-of-Kyon]]) My favorite Haruhi fanfiction. I really don't think that any ending to the series the original author provides could be better than this fanfiction.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia]]) The best Code Geass fanfiction out there. An au fic where Lelouch is not exiled and instead grows up with Nunnally in the imperial court. The story is extremely compact and well put together. It doesn't waste any time with fluff but that shouldn't mean that the story feels rushed. Far from it. The plot follows along with the original storyline and the author makes sure to try to bring together all of the original characters in a non forced way.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761190/1/Topple-Your-Kings]]) An extremely well done Code Geass, High School DxD crossover. Lelouch is the same conniving magnificent bastard that is found in canon and it's extremely enjoyable to watch him begin to apply his talents in the DxD world.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11467696/1/Do-Me-A-Wrong]]) A surprisingly well done Bleach and High School DxD. Especially since it's coming from a fandom not known for well done crossovers. Not only is the writing a pleasure to read, but the plot and characters are well put together. Not surprising that this story is written by the same author as Oblivion, one of the better Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls crossovers.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]]) is the best SOA fanfic that I have ever read. By far better than canon with characters actually fleshed out and Kirito not being the generic harem mc he is. The word building is astounding in this one and the plot is more intricate than that of almost any other fanfiction I've had the pleasure of reading.

  AU reboot of the entire SAO storyline, beginning from the premise that Kayaba Akihiko was obsessed with magic and Norse Mythology rather than swords and pure melee.

Well, aside from White Squirrel (who does Harry Potter), my favourite author is probably Saphroneth.

Ashes of the Past, linkffn(7262793) , is one of those absolute doorstoppers; it's a story where Ash Ketchum, following the destruction of the world by Cyrus, is sent back in time by Arceus, with a little bit of training in Aura from Sir Aaron, and the ability to restore the memories of the 'old timeline' to his friends and family.

I solemnly swear that you'll enjoy it, even if you've never watched the Pokemon anime (I know I haven't). All of the characters are likable and/or competent, there's no Super!Ash or anything going on...

*** Well, there is /some/ “Super!Ash”, but in my opinion it's well done and more often than not him being in some way overpowered is played for laughs. The fights are actually entertaining, is what I want to say, unless they are things like random mook attacks in which case he overpowers them something silly and that's entertaining too.

That said, this story does contain Squirtle, so people who absolutely cannot enjoy certain things being changed for the sake of amusement and entertainment and better plot progression might not get into it. But if you treat it like a long-running crack fic with actual plot that it happens to be, it's glorious.

** Flashman and the Throne of Swords - linkffn(10784082 ) A crossover between Game of Thrones and The Flashman books.

I have a taste for picaroon, anti-heros, of which Flashman is pretty much the archetype. His cynical opinon of Westeros and its personalities and politics is fun. He gets on splendidly with Tyron Lannister, as you might expect.

I suspect this is a very much a minority taste, and comparatively few would like it. But hey.... it's there.

  When it becomes possible to travel between nineteenth-century Earth and Westeros, Britain needs its finest to represent it at King Robert's court. Who better to call than Sir Harry Flashman? (Actually, almost anybody else would do, but he's burdened with his reputation.)

** Avatar: The Last Airbender

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6148203/1/Worst-Field-Trip-Ever]]) Not the best written by any means, but I have to say the author does a good job writing Toph's blindness into the story--the descriptions just feel right.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6200018/1/Slumber-My-Darling]]) This one is simply heart-jerking. Magnificent story.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9058021/1/When-Past-Meets-Present]]) Another great fic. Unfinished. Probably abandoned. But I honestly prefer it to the Trilogy Comics.

Bridge to Terabithia. Trust me, I only picked the best.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3718824/1/Stars-Over-Terabithia]]) Sadly unfinished. But this was the first fanfiction I ever loved.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655216/1/A-Life-Rescued]]) I had my doubts about this one, but this turned out to be a very well-written fic, and an excellent YA story in its own right.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5630256/1/The-New-Life]]) A Bridge to Terabithia story that may as well be literally in Terabithia.

Avatar: The Last Airbender/Stargate

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple]]) This one is fantastic. I know very little about Stargate, but I loved it anyway.

** Okay, so I made some recs [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4pmh5z/what_is_the_legendary_fanfic_in_your_fandom/d4n0qbx?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4ihc6s/if_i_liked_embers_by_vathara_what_stories_in/d3whnd9?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4mmdaz/daily_discussion_for_june_05/d3wy2u0?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4lan96/fic_rec_friday/d3luweq?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4i7n6w/ficrec_friday_may_6/d2vv7fk?context=3][here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4lan96/fic_rec_friday/d3luvmb?context=3][here]].

They're a bit of a mixed bag. I'm a multishipper as well (het, fem/slash, poly, gen, etc) so there's that, too. :p

ETA: I also have a bunch of Naruto recs [[http://amethyst-rei.livejournal.com/17592.html][here]]. It's not a comprehensive list but lots of my faves are definitely on there.

Also, I'm currently reading (well, listening to) Metisket's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31364][Demon Alchemist 'Verse]] (Fullmetal Alchemist, GEN) ([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/172415][podfic here]]. It's really brilliant and I definitely recommend it.

I also started Bob_Fish's FMA series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/6053][Wrong Turn 'Verse]] which is shaping up to be quite a read. It contains slash and het, but romance isn't really the focus of the story.

** If like me, you have given up on most Pokemon fanfiction, Olivine Romance is the one for you

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8068559/1/Olivine-Romance]]) Some parts are quite 'mature' so there is a AO3 version uncensored but the story is still quite understandable without it.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1609088]])

It manages to not only give the Pokemon world some depth and realism, it also tells a very compelling story. It's somewhat hard to describe, but this fic can make you feel any emotion. Happiness, sadness, joy and a great heaping dollop of frustration too. If you feel like reading something good, read this.

** Since you've mentioned a couple of Superman fics, I'd suggest Veritas([[http://www.lcficmbs.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Forum/6/topic/001338/Number/0/site_id/1#import]]). It explores the reactions of humans to an alien presence in our post 9/11 security environment.

There are a couple of Superman Returns fics- In the shadow of my father(linkffn(3034436)) and Being Jasom White(linkffn(3226609)) which explore the strained relationship between Clark and Jason. It's angsty but pretty good.

If you've watched the TV show Chuck, there's a magnificent fic called What Fates Impose linkffn(5756619). It's not just the best Chuck fanfic, it's among the best fics I've read in any fandom.

** I've recently tumbled into reading Code Geass fics. So far, Dauntless linkffn(6175861) is amazing. (By the way, does anyone know if there are any good communities like [[/r/HPfanfiction]] for code geass? I've got too comfortable with only needing to look here to find anything good.)

  Lelouch had been quite happy with his life. Sure they were living in obscurity, but he and Nunnally were safe. All of that changes however, when his identity is revealed and Lelouch is forced back into the fold of the Imperial family.
