So umm this is a kind of weird request but I recently read a fic where dolohov has some sort of creepy obsession with hermione. Anyway, this intrigued me and it got me thinking about how much I like him being this creepy, sick antagonist. Any suggestions? Thanks a ton!!


** So a lot of the fics in this general area with these characters are very dark and/or have elements that would break the rules to recommend. I haven't found any that I couldn't comfortably say don't break rule 6.

With that said, linkao3(Matryoshka by Seselt) has a bit of background that could be behind an obsession on his part. It's a only a one-shot/drabble length though, and it probably doesn't meet your criteria. I am a big fan of some of the writer's other works and her writing in general.
