Like for harry the Patronus charm.

It was sort of hinted at with the Apparition Instructor.

  wycross was described as "oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away." Harry Potter, upon meeting him, wondered whether this was because of the large amount of Apparating and Disapparating he did.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/The-Crown-of-M%C3%A8tis][The Crown of Metis]] Voldemort encounters a powerful Light witch who appears as eerily inhuman as Voldemort himself, though in a very different way. The implication is that delving deeply into either Light or Dark magic gradually changes the body of the practitioner.

linkffn(6939995)

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/][Turning of the Times]], Harry gets an explanation of what defines 'Dark' magic and sets it apart from other spells. 'Dark' spells are acts of magic that would be impossible for a normal wizard's body/mind to commit. The process of casting such spells /changes/ the caster on an intrinsic level in order to make them more capable of that magic. Repeated use of the same spell alters the caster further and further.

For example, legilimency (excerpt from Chapter 14):

#+begin_quote
  “Dark arts have a bad reputation because they let you push past the limitations of being human. I'd thought that legilimency was just a powerful sort of charm, not unlike the patronus, but if you're reacting to it then I can only imagine that you're essentially... well, your magic is expanding to allow for you to become more than just yourself.

  (...)

  "Most people only have one mind. When you're using legilimency, you're probably opening up your mind to encompass the subject's---my mind, and existing as both of us at once.

  (...)

  "Your mind is just opening up to allow for two where there was only one behind. It might even become instinctive after a while, no spell needed---"
#+end_quote

Another example is the Unforgivables (excerpt from Chapter 34):

#+begin_quote
  "To have direct power over another's actions, to cause pain, to kill. Three things that many would argue are so naturally repulsive to humans that they are labeled inhuman, and yet we cannot deny that some humans have no qualms with any of them.

  (...)

  "Some people would call it a fundamental aspect of being human, to be horrified by the very concept of performing the Unforgivables. Ignorant cowards without even a tentative grip on reality, the lot of them.” He paused, and conceded: “But, the repulsion is shared by the majority of humanity, or is at least professed to be shared, enough to perpetuate your concept of literal dehumanization.

  (...)

  "It relates because the way that the Unforgivables change you is to deaden the repulsion,”

  (...)

  “The more you... kill things, the less you find a problem with killing things.”

  "Yes."
