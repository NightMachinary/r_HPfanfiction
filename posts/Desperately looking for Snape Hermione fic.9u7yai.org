Hello﻿﻿, I am looking for a story about Hermione and Severus. I am desperate. I have looked for weeks now, trying every search combo possible, browsing recs and archives. Please please please, someone help. Severus was discovered as a spy and deaged by bracelets (Remus, Moody, McGonagall and I think Dumbledore) which each take 5 yrs off him. He is sorted into 7th year Gryffindor and shares a room with Harry and Ron. He has no memories of his life﻿ but has nightmares over which he bonds with Harry. He and Hermione fall in love and they are cultivating a flower in a greenhouse that is allergic to magic, Neville helps and then Severus gets his memories back and is afraid Hermione wont love him anymore, but she already knew who he was. D wants to force Severus to give﻿ Hermione up, he refuses and leaves Hogwarts


** I dont think I know which one you're looking for. Have you tried Ao3 or Ashwinder?

*** Ao3, Ashwinder, Petulent Poetress, fanficti9n, hp adult fanfiction... LOL

I know I read it, I remember so many things vividly, but for the life of me I cant find it. It was very long! Super well written and just overall very enjoable. When Severus left Hogwarts at the end, he did so with an the trio flanking him. Loosing all your bookmarks sucks balls.
