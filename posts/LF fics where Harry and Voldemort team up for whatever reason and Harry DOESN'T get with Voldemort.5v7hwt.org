Just fics where Harry and Voldemort don't need to do the nasty to see eye to eye.

Slash, dark!harry, bashing and crossovers are okay. Please no mpreg, harems, romance/smut-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you!

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions) is pretty good, but You'd have to read the prequel. The prequel was written before book 5 was though, so expect major changes from canon.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent) is the first of the trilogy

**** Holy cow, this is garbage. Another one of those "fics" that isn't actually a story but an excuse to rant about everyone and everything in canon that the author wants to bash.

This sort of tripe is worse than 'My Immortal' type fics (even the unironic ones), because at least those are entertaining to skim.
