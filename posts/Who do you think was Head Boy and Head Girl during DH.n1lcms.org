*** That's a good thought on Neville.

I believe there were 5 girls total in Hermione's dorm, but I don't believe we know who the other two girls are.

Thanks!

** I think it's safe to say that Slytherin house or a public Voldemort supporter would have been favored if there was a head boy and girl that year. Malfoy and Parkinson make sense but it's not out of the question that another student got the headships without being a prefect first (see James Potter...) or that a nameless Ravenclaw who had an important death eater parent was 'honored.' And Malfoy can't have been in Voldemort's good graces that year, so I honestly don't see him getting the badge. Not sure that Voldemort would care but his supporters would and Snape would want to make as few waves as possible.

And it's also possible that there were no prefects or head students and that the Carrows were unilaterally in charge of discipline.

In any case, I don't see any 7th year gryffindors getting any official authority.

*** I'm not sure, can you be a Prefect and Head Boy/Girl at the same time? And like you said the Malfoy's weren't in Voldemort's good graces at the moment.

Maybe Theodore Nott?

Definitely agree I don't see any Gryffindors getting it.

It is possible for a student to hold both positions (Lily Evans, Bill Weasley, Percy Weasley), but one doesn't need to be Prefect to become Head Boy (James Potter being the obvious example).

** I don't think it really matters to know "who" became the Head Boy or the Head Girl during DH. Because the presence of the Carrows completely changed the balance of power inside the school. Sure, Draco may have become the Head Boy as a "reward" for his part in Dumbledore death, or maybe another "Good" Pureblood from Slytherin like Theodore Nott got it. And some blood purist girl, more likely also from Slytherin became the Head Girl, but it's not like these positions holded any authority by themselves.

During DH, Hogwarts was effectively run by Death Eaters and Snape own objectives (helping Harry and stopping the Carrows from going overboard) means that the day to day business probably went to the Carrows. Comparably to the "/Inquisitional Squad/" in OotP, the authority wasn't in the hand of the Prefects anymore, but whoever was favoured by the Carrows. I'm convinced that people like Crabbe and Goyle, despite having no official role, had more power in the school than the Prefects or even Head Boy/Girl (depending of who it were).

Concerning the Gryffindors, I'm not even sure Ron and Hermione got replaced. The 7th Years were decimated from the start, with only 4 confirmed student (Neville, Seamus, Lavender and Parvati), and none of them managed to stay a student until the end (since they were all hiding in the Room of Requirement).\\
Neville may or may not have become a Prefect at the start of the year "to keep the appearance", but after he got his position revoked (probably around 2 weeks later after he did something insulting to a Carrow), I don't think they bothered replacing him. The girls were probably in a similar situation.

** Honestly Head Boy from Slytherin perhaps Theodore Nott and Head Girl from Ravenclaw. It is the only possibility both Griffondor and Hufflepuff are light house and the dark is ruling.
