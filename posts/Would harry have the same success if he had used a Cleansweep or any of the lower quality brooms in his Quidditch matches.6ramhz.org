Ok, so I was just thinking. Harry is a natural to the sport of Quidditch. But except for one match against Malfoy in second year, he has consistently flown on better brooms than his opponents. How fair is it for Cho or any of the other seekers to face him with a Firebolt while they ride on not even a Nimbus.


** Yup. He's got the main protagonists +20 power boost

** Perhaps the games would be a bit tighter, but I still think he'd win most of them.

It's not the brand of the broom that matters, it's how you use it ;)

*** I remember JK Rowling wrote most of the endings of Quidditch match as nail biting ending. Except for some total winners in the first years like the coughing incident, the Hufflepuff match most others ended with the seekers fighting to catch the snitch. Honestly I think Harry's broom helped him. Come on man, you honestly don't think the speed of the broomstick did not help him even a little in these matches

**** You have a point. But I believe Harry was a more talented flyer than the other seekers (not counting professionals). Just look at the first flying lesson.

Granted, catching the snitch isn't only about talent, but still...

  "Great Scott, he can fly!" yelled Bagman, as the crowd shrieked and gasped. "Are you watching this, Mr Krum?"
#+end_quote

Ludo Bagman was a professional player with a long and illustrious career. He seems to think that Harry is not only good, he is also good enough that Krum - arguably the best flyer in the world - would be interested.

I think it's safe to say that Harry was very good at flying, yes.

** Is it fair?? Well yes, unless you force them all to use the same brooms,in which case luck will play a big factor than skill, as skill alone cannot compensate for the snitch appearing 8 seconds away from you but 2 from the other seeker.

Anyway, the sport itself is stupid, so trying to make it fair is a fruitless endeavor.

** Harry was a natural flyer even on the crappy school broom the very first time he tried. I think he'd be good enough to compensate.

Having said that, it's still massively unfair there isn't a standard broom everyone is expected to have to play school Quidditch.

** How is it fair, its life. Having a better broom is an advantage, so is having more talent people can whine but at the end of the day results matter. You shouldn't look to Harry since he's meant to be talented, instead look to Malfoy who had the second best broom in the school but wasn't meant to be a prodigy, how did he compare to the other seekers.

** I guess part of his skill was handling the broom, considering that the firebolt was a high end broom, I doubt that many students his age could really handle it, same goes for his Nimbus 2000, but to a lesser degree. While the broom did give him an advantage, he almost always had to compete with older more experienced seeker, who probably already started flying brooms, before they entered Hogwarts, if they grew up in a wizard family.
