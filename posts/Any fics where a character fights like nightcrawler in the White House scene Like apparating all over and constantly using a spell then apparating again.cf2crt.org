** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Harry's wish for a better life time travels back and changes a small detail in the marauder era. Regulus survives, learns to master Apparition and Portkeys and becomes the Black Phantom, the single vigilante anti Voldemort fighter with more success than Dumbledore's entire Order of the Fire Chicken. He constantly apparates around in the middle of every battle and summons birds to make people think that he's an animagus.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  For this prompt on the kinkmeme:After the Grindelwald incident MACUSA and MoM are holding a dueling competition. Originally Newt only came to be support for his older brother and his new american auror friends. He's not comfortable at such events. Some asshole who wants to take revenge on Theseus for humiliating him the year before, thinks ge can get it by challenging Newt to fight in front of everyone. Anything goes. Before Graves can intervene, Theseus smirks and accepts the challenge for Newt.Newt procceeds to wipe the floor with him by using apparation, martial arts and an impressive list of spells, leaving everyone who was worried gaping. Theseus, proud and protective older brother that he is, admits on being responsible for the latter two.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
