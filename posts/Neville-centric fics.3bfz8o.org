Pretty self-explanatory... can anyone recommend a fic where the main focus is Neville, or at least features a lot of him? Thanks


** linkffn(Asking for Roses) A lovely Neville/Hannah fic with an awesome Augusta Longbottom and appearances by Mr. Weasley and Hermione. It takes place the summer after Neville's 6th year. Intriguing plot, well-developed characters and canon-compliant. One of my favorites!

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** Oh definitely Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by thanfiction It's a very well written story that focuses on Neville and really fleshes out characters we didn't really get to know too much about, like Hannah Abbot, Seamus Finnagan, Colin Creevy, and more. This fic made me love Neville more than anyone else.

** If you don't mind the question, why do you look for a Neville centric fic? I mean what's interesting to you about his character? Or what do you expect in these fics that you'll enjoy?

I read your request and realized I've never come across Neville-centric fanfic so far, have actually never even thought to look for one, so that got me wondering.

*** He went from 'miserable fatty with a toad' to 'badass who fights death eaters and cuts heads off horcruxes' almost overnight in the end of books 6 and 7, so it'd be nice to see how that change came about.

In canon, and most fanon, he has few friends, he's looked down upon, and he's pretty much a joke of a wizard ("Why is it always me?") until BAM! Look, in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, it's NEVILLE! With a SWORD! Riding a DRAGON! Shooting LASERS out of his EYES!

Cue female swooning, washboard abs, piercing eyes (so dreamy!), unflagging confidence and a sparkling smile, and you're left with a massive hole in his history and the needle on my what-the-fuck-is-this-ometer climbing into the red zone.

So yeah, it'd be nice to read about him overcoming his failures rather than Harry overcoming them once in a while. Not that Harry doesn't make a good story, but I can only read so many stories with Harry as the main guy before I get sick of him.

**** Now that you mention Neville's change, I think there is a story about what happened at Hogwarts in 7th year while Harry & Co where Horcrux hunting. I never read it and don't know how much screen time Neville gets, but he is bound to be one of the more important characters. Maybe somebody knows which fic I'm talking about and can link it?

Edit: I think I found it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]]

  When Neville agreed to become an Auror after the Battle of Hogwarts, he never expected to be asked to hunt down an old friend...or the nightmare into which that would lead. Sequel to "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" set 5 years later.

Hope it comes close to what you're looking for. Both are complete and I heard also rather well written.

  Harry Potter dislikes Severus Snape. Severus Snape loathes Harry Potter. No one is more shocked than the Hogwarts Potion Master when Harry takes a potentially fatal spell to save the Death Eater turned Phoenix spy. Harry's sole hope of survival lies with Severus Snape, Hermione Granger, and, of all people, Neville Longbottom.
