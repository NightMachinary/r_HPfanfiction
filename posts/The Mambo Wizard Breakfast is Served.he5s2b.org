So I don't know if this can legally be considered "Harry Potter fanfic," BUT... it IS satire based on Harry Potter! Close enough?

Book Blurb:

Spring, 1919. Jeremy Fletcher is having a rough week.

The boy wizard and orphan extraordinaire spent all year harassed with accusations of copying the look and backstory of fictitious comic book hero "Tommy Cobblestone," and now finds himself permanently expelled from Pigpimples Academie of Magick. After three years of studying spellcasting, he only ever mastered the single trick of transforming everyday objects into breakfast food items (a novice spell at best, and one not even found in any of the Headmage's textbooks).

But perhaps Jeremy's luck is due for a change. Two inept space pirates just crash-landed their ship on his family's property. They're on a quest to steal radio broadcasts out of black holes and build the ultimate night club featuring music from the future. They also appear to be famished--is this Jeremy's chance to provide a complete and balanced breakfast?

Join Jeremy Fletcher and a cast of alien misfits, wizard-school failures, and various other weirdos, on a sci-fi / fantasy adventure to dysfunctional magic schools, deep space radio stations, and night clubs on the moons of Jupiter.

The Mambo Wizard: Breakfast is Served! Truly a gem of the orphaned wizard genre!
