This doesn't (and preferably wouldn't) be due to some Ministry policy but it'd be interesting to see how the population decline from both Voldemort periods and greater demographic shift towards Muggleborns would lead to more marriages to Muggles.

How would Wizarding society react, what changes to Muggle society would this cause, how would the two societies meld together, what sort of "scandalous" pairings would occur...

It just seems like an area that I haven't seen exploited all that much, with only occasional (and largely abandoned) "Harry dates /x/ Muggle" fics but not further than that.


** One of the only ones I remember like this is one where Harry marries a Muggle woman and becomes an accountant, burying his Magical past and once they have a child worries about it all coming out.

*** I hated that his wife died in it. It seemed unnaturally cruel.

**** No that isn't the one I'm thinking of. It involved living abroad as I recall.
