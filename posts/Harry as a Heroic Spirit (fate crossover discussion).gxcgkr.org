** There's a dead crossover fic where Caster summons Harry instead of Kojiro as Fake Assassin in the UBW route. In it Harry is essentially the embodiment of the Harry Potter franchise, with Harry as the template since the story is about him. That's essentially my headcanon on the subject.

  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.
