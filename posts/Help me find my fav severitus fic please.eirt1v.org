Severitus HP fanfic request!!

I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a while back (in either AO3 or Fanfiction.net).

Harry is staying at Grimmauld Place with Lupin during the school year (I think he had an accident or issue and can't be at school.) Snape regularly floos in to teach him occlumency, but does it in a new way by sitting behind him and holding his temples(?) and helping him meditate, etc. Harry keeps asking him to show him a death eater meeting but Snape gets angry and refuses. Lupin knows Harry hates being shut up in Grimmauld Place and leaves to get him ice cream (?) and somehow Pettigrew finds a hole in the cellar to come through the wards as a rat and he and Malfoy kidnap Harry. Snape is called to the meeting and has to watch Harry be tortured before he can manage to rescue him.

Anyone recognize this?? I'd LOVE to find it again.


** A Year Like None Other. There's a whole series (followed by A Summer Like None Other and A Family Like None Other). I don't have a link for it, but I've read it multiple times. I think it's on skyehawke. It might also be on AO3.

*** Severitus is when Harry is actually the kid of Lily and Snape, instead of Lily and James.
