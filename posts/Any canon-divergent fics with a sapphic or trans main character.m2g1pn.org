Sapphic meaning a bi or lesbian woman. Nonbinary main character definitely counts as trans even if they never specifically say the word in the fic. I'm also not looking for gender swaps, although trans headcanons/AUs are good. (in other words: ftm Harry makes me happy, lesbian Harry does not)

I'm especially interested in fics that don't put a lot of emphasis on the MC being queer, but instead on a more action-filled plot. I'm also rather fond of slytherin main characters and morally grey characters. I'm also generally of the opinion that the longer a fic is, the better.

I have read New Blood and that's actually what pushed me to ask for reccs since I've generally just assumed any queer characters would be gay/bi men.

I wouldn't say I make Hannah all about being queer, but there's obviously references to it, especially as the first half is basically her coming out. Latest chapter for a example I don't think referenced her being trans/queer at all.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  Harry's trans and no one in the wizarding world seems to know. When he got his letter, he was stunned to see the right name on the address. When he got to Hogwarts, everyone knew his name. They called him the Boy Who Lived as if he always had been. No one had any idea that his whole life was a lie. He thought he'd gotten away with it--until the summer before third year, when everything went batshit crazy and stopped making any sense at all.This is a story about keeping secrets and telling lies, but it is also about finding truths and discovering trust in the most unlikely of places. Set during Harry's third year.
