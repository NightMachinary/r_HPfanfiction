** I was initially going to say no, potions need to be consumed by a living being. But On scrolling through the Lexicon it's clear that 'Potion' is a more general term that covers topical ointments (Sleekeazy) and general enchantment;

However, we only ever see characters use wand work to alter the perceived reality of enchanted objects, (Quirrell and the mirror, Crouch and the Goblet, Hermione and phineas' portrait) so it appears that conventional wisdom in magical Britain is that potions aren't the way to go.

But that just means that most people wouldn't know to guard against it. Dumbledore stresses that Voldemort, despite his power, has dismissed large areas of magic as useless. So using Veritaserum-infused ink to bypass the defences of his Horcrux seems like it follows in that theme.

Great question!

PS: Would using colour changing ink make the Horcrux's memories psychedelic?

** I can see it working or not. If it fits your plot, go for it.

There would be some tension there, since the person writing with veritaserum-laced ink wouldn't really know if it was working. Tom might be like, “Damn, why do I feel strangely compelled to tell the truth now?” while lying, happy in the knowledge that his lies are now extra believable.

** Veritaserum-laced ink you mean? i've never seen induce used like that and neither has Merriam Webster.

And it depends on your interpretation. I lean towards no, though I understand why some people would say yes. Restorative draught was used on Nick, a mere non-corporeal imprint. The diary contained a fragment of soul which is probably more weighty than just a sentient imprint. As such, I would say that there is a reasonable argument for it to affect Riddle.

However, one of the defenses against Veritaserum is to seal one's throat, though it may then remain in one's mouth. It's use seems to be dependent on dosage and reliant on the mechanic of the victim swallowing the Veritaserum. As such, I do not believe the non-organic construct containing Riddle would be effected by the laced-ink. Even if it did, Riddle is future Voldemort and likely has some control over his mind. Veritaserum seems to force speech and not bind thoughts (Crouch is able to react although he can't prevent his truthful thoughts from being conveyed) and Riddle is not communicating through speech (for the most part). If Riddle was moving on to becoming corporeal from the diary, I don't think his partially corporeal form would be effected by a potion interacting with his soul construct.

In short, I think there are too many reasons for it not to work and few for it to work.

that is what I meant. I would edit my post but for some strange reason, you can't change the title of a post.

*** Curious where did you come across the "defense" of sealing your throat? I don't see how that would work as the potion would get absorbed through the tissues of the mouth and quickly get into the bloodstream. (Think nitroglycerin tablet which you hold in your mouth (don't swallow) if you think you're having a heart attack).

I'm aware of how drugs work in the actual world. Why on earth would they be applicable to potions? Drugs can't create a body, drugs can't help ghosts which don't exist in the actual world, and there sure as hell is no truth serum that actually works. The best you can hope for in the muggle world is a psychoactive drug that puts your victim off balance.

Magic does not parallel well to the muggle world because the muggle world's model of the universe is flawed by a lack of magic. Magic isn't some energy or force that will closely tie into it. Magic recognizes intruders, secrets, can make it impossible to map a location, and so much more. Any attempt to assume the mechanics of potions will mirror drugs is flawed from the start. After all, do ghosts have a bloodstream and cells with receptors to be activated by molecules? No.
