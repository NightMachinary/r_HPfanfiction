Any fics where Hermione is just not in it, or a minor miiiiiinor character. I am so sick of fanon Hermione I literally can not take it anymore. It doesn't have to be bashing, just where she is irrelevant. Any pairing het or slash is fine I just want a good Harry centric fic where it's not Hermione saving the day. Thanks.


** legitmately running through my list of good Harry-centric fics and I can't think of a single one without Hermione. /gosh/

** Hermione is a very minor character in the Art of Self-Fashioning. Harry centric.

linkffn(11585823)

She also appears but is pretty irrelevant in:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

It's also Harry-centric.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Gryffindors Never Die

Linkffn(6452481)

Harry and Ron, at the age of 58, are divorced from Ginny and Hermione, and are severe alcoholics. Much to their shock and horror, they're transported back to 1994, the day before the Goblet of Fire spits out Harry's name, and now have to deal with old Voldy coming back, the Triwizard tournament, and Dumbledore trying to tell these grown-ass men what they are and are not allowed to do. Ugh. Oh well, at least they have healthy livers that they can ruin again.

**** I mean, you'd be wacky too, if you woke up one day to find 44 years of your life gone, with all of your kids and grandkids gone, and people who you buried decades ago were suddenly back in your life.

Oh, and you have to relive some of your most hectic years of your life, in your teenage body free of joint pains and soreness and supercharged with hormones?

And behaving in school? They haven't had to deal with school in 40 years, and they've been the top authority figures for the British wizarding community for decades. Sitting in school, being told to sit and behave like good little kids, knowing the events to come, and the fact that they may only have this small time to goof off before Voldemort could come back?

idk, saying and doing wacky things, and acting out in general seems like a healthy way to stave off the insanity.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I very much love linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter). It's a Harry Potter+Song of the Lioness mashup (though you don't need to know SotL at all), VERY AU, with 2 completed continuations and 1 ongoing.

More importantly, for you, Hermione has little bearing on the plot, being all the way over in America because muggleborns can't go to Hogwarts (neither can half-bloods, but the entire premise is that Harry (that's fem!Harry, btw) finds a way)

Hermione is back in the ongoing book for the sort-of-Triwizard Tournament, but she's far from saving the day (and there's, like, almost a million words of practically no Hermione before that, so)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

#+begin_quote
  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
