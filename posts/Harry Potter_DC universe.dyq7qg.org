is there any good fic where harry is a street thug or a villain in the DC universe and not an overpowered hero with a harem because I really hate those


** Closest I have is a fic where Fem!Harry is Batgirl to the campy tune of Adam West's Batman. */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11806414/1/][Amy Potter is Batgirl]]/*

** Harry Potter the prince of clowns, is a really good one with a dark harry.\\
Harry is raised by joker and harely, however dick/Robin plays a large role as well However it is dark and bloody with slash later on. But still really good

*** I'd very much recommended against megamatt. Everything he writes is the same thing with a slightly different skin.

His smut scenes are intrusive and repetitive to the point that they feel routine and distracting from any potential storytelling that he was trying to craft.

He has some fun ideas for stories, but the very obvious dominant male wish fulfilment fantasies overshadow every single aspect of his stories to the point he should get rid of character names and plot points and just write the same porn one-shot over and over and over.

***** I didnt say they were good. Just literally almost every single story is dc crossover. I only like one of his stories. One of his earliest ones. Dark Harry little smut HarryxGinny. He actually says that he hates this story and only keeps it for historical purposes. When it's the only one that's decent and actually good writing

***** I don't think he's written a story that isn't a harem that doesn't have Harry/Peter Parker/Clark Kent getting at least 10 women.

It's beyond absurd.

*** I cringe every single time his stories are recced here. I love me some smut and OP!Harry when I'm in the mood for it, but everything he writes is just so fuckin bad...

Also, OP asked for "not an overpowered hero with a harem because I really hate those". So reccing megamatt here is double wrong. It is neither good enough to ever be recced, nor does it fit the ONE restriction OP asked for.
