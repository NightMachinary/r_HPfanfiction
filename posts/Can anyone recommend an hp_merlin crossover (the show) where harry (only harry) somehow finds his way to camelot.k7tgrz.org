The idea is that instead of merlin coming to hogwarts, as a lot of these fics tend to like doing, are there any fics where harry finds himself in camelot.


** I recall coming across a story's summary where the trio end up in Camelot, but I didn't read it so I can't say anything other than that it exists on AO3.
