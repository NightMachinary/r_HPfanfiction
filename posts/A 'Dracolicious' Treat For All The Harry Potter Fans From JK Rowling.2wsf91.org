** I think that if we can recognize the good parts in Snape, then we can also see it in Malfoy.

**** He couldn't kill Dumbledore, he didn't identify Harry and the gang at the Manor, and I'm sure there are other examples I just don't remember. Don't get me wrong, I don't think he's good. I don't understand his fans or all the fanfiction glorifying him, but I also don't think he's literally Hitler and irredeemable.
