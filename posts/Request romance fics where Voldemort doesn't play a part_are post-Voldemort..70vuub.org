Tons of fics are written with the intention of being romance fics, but the author often feels like they have to solve the Voldemort issue, splitting the focus. I'd like to see a fic set kn the HP universe that is a romance and has no imminent war hanging over it. Please no slash and no Hermione.


** I can only think of a few that fit the bill.

linkffn(11111990) - Unfinished, but a fantastic read. The author clearly understands the struggles of running a family. Harry/Flawed and well done OFC Abigail Waters. linkffn(11054843) - Don't remember much of it, but I think it was pretty good. Harry/Ginny.

I'll try to think of more once I'm on my laptop.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

***** Cannon I didn't care for. I felt that it was rushed and the Lucius plotline was both unnecessary and added nothing. It also did a poor job of explaining its own backstory, along with being fairly unbelievable - information about Voldemort's death would have leaked somehow.

I really liked Setup, though. Good comedy. Also rushed the romance, but it was a fun enough read that I didn't mind at all. Thanks again for the rec!

** Haggis for Algernon is set in the Marauder era -- and yes, I know the time period has an imminent war. However, the war has basically no effect from what I've seen (and there's no Voldemort issue solved), which is why I'll still recommend it. I'd describe the fic as....uh, teenage romance and drama written in short journal format from many POVs, I guess.
