As in, Voldemort kills Frank and Alice instead of James and Lily, so Neville becomes the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, [[/spoiler][and the last Horcrux]].

I did find [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6945562/1/The-Chosen-One][this story]] where Neville is the Boy Who Lived, but Harry is still the Chosen One, so that's not what I'm looking for.

I'm fine with alterations to other characters too (including ships), as long as the title is the only change to the core premise.


** linkffn(The art of self-fashioning) Neville is the boy who lived and Harry's parents got tortured. Harry is kind of a sociopath here though, he is very different from canon.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.
