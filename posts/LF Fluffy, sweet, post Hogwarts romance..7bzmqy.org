The title is pretty self explanatory, I'm looking for any post Hogwarts romance that is really sweet.


** Not going to lie, I read the title and thought you were looking for three-headed dog romance.

*** I read your post and my first thought was, if it's Fluffy/Sphinx does it count as bestiality.

** Linkffn(Grow Young With Me) has a sad premise, but is very sweet (and impeccably well written, besides).

Otherwise, most of Northumbrian's stuff is post-HW and has character relationships as a focus. One that comes to mind is linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
