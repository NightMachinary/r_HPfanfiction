I am looking for a Harry Potter story where harry senses keep on being magnified. It turns out that he is a creature that is really rare. He is part of a triad with Draco and Blaise. They both have wings. When his senses go out like his hearing is when Draco finds him on top of the Astronomy Tower and cover with his wings to block out sound. I remember reading on fanfiction.net but I can't find it now. I also don't know the name or the author's name of it. Please help.

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?
