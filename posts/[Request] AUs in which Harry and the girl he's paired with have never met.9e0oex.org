I'm looking for fics in which, for whatever reason, Harry has never met the girl he is paired with. It should be somebody he knows in canon.

It doesn't have to be a romance fic, but the romantic as left should be prominent and not just a minor side plot.

The reason that they haven't met doesn't really matter, but it should be more substantial than they both went to Hogwarts and just never talked until now. Something like Harry or his partner were born out of country, or Harry was raised in hiding from Voldemort, or hell even time travel is acceptable.

Any pairing, though if it's H/Hr I'm not going to read it (but someone else reading this thread might).


** linkffn(11027086) is a pretty good Tolkien crossover.

linkffn(2095661) is slower than Starfox's cognitive abilities, riddled with grammatical errors, and becomes the most awkward canon rehash, but is a good way to pass time if you have absolutely nothing better to do.

linkffn(7402590) fits the bill, and was quite popular a while ago, but it hasn't exactly aged well. It manages to somehow hit a large majority of the rEEeEEEeEEeEEee PET PEEVES.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  On that fateful day, two Potters were born. One was destined to be the Boy-Who-Lived. The other was forgotten by the Wizarding World. Now, as the Triwizard Tournament nears, a strange boy is contracted to defend a beautiful girl.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
