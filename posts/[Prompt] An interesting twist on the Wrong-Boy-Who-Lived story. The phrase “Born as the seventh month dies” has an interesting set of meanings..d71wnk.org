Charlus Potter was born in the last moment of July, and took his first breath in August. His older brother, Harry, was born similarly in the last moments of September, a year earlier. Their parents loved them dearly, as two children born to a pure blood parent was rare enough, let alone two born so close together. When Harry first set eyes on his little brother all the errant, barely coherent thoughts of the nearly two year old child came together with one purpose, /protect/. And, several years later when that driving force drove him to place himself between a rather vicious stray bulldog little Charlus (Charlie to his brother) decided that he would do everything in his power to make his big brother proud of him.

So, as you can see, there shouldn't be any hate between the two brothers, that's a rather overdone trope in these stories. Are their parents dead or neglectful or as caring as we were led to believe they would be had they not perished in the books? You decide. Though I doubt Lily would stand for anyone neglecting his children, not even Dumbledore.

The requests I have for any stories is as follows;

Harry is a year above Charlus, as is Hermione. And Luna was allowed in the same year as Charlus. A little fudging with the cut-off date for admittance should take care of this.

Preferably Harmony and maybe even Lunar Harmony if you're up to it, but I'll accept other pairings so long as they're not Ginny or Ron.

Harry has some sort of telekinetic magic he discovered in some forgotten Tome of Magick and when he's not slinging around dozens of knives or some other bullshit he uses it for pranks or making his life a bit easier.

I said it before but I just want to reiterate it here; there is no bad blood between Harry and Charlus. They get grumpy, have spats, and roughhouse now am again, they're sibling for Pete's sake! But there's no hatred and things get resolved reasonably quick.

Harry looks and pranks like James but reads and acts like Lily. Charlus looks like a genderbent Lily but has all of James' personality at heart. (Read: smart, prankster harry with a fiery temper and the smarts to simmer it down to a tranquil fury and a brash, wannabe Casanova Charlus whose rather brutish behavior and aggressive tendencies are tempered by a strong sense of loyalty, doing what's right, and wanting his brother to be proud of him.)

The whole potter family is made aware of the prophecy after its wording is hidden behind a fidelius. Voldy loses the words but remembers there's a prophecy that drives him to kill a son of James and Lily potter.

And biggest of all: at some point after harry does enough Boy-Who-Lived stuff even though he isn't considered to be the Boy-Who-Lived and Dumbledore and others get on his case about it he has to say that, as Thursday is Thor's Day and Saturday is Satrun's Day, July is Julius' Month and September is the Seventh Month. (If you want this to make even more sense then perhaps Trelawney isn't a seer, but repeated memorized prophecy's from Roman times she found in her family records that the family kept secret because of seer reasons, putting the original date before the modern calendar)


** Born in July but took his first breath in April? What did he do till then, use his gills?

*** Magic? I mean, I don't know what you mean, I totally didn't just go back and edit the post.

Reality is an illusion! Ignore the man behind the curtain!
