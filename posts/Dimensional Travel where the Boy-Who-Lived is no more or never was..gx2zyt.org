Hey so I just finished reading through I'm Still Here by kathryn518 and I was wondering if anyone has either written or come across other stories with a similar idea as I'm Still here. If you have found a similar story feel free to share it and for my specific tastes I'm good for basically anything that may happen in those stories. Thanks guys.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

*** You and me both. I have a few minor complaints about that story but overall it is a well put together story with an interesting enough plot that I can overlook the few complaints I have.
