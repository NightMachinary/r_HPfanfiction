Title essentially says it all, im looking for one of my all time favourite Harry Potter Fan fictions which I unfortunately didn't think to link or save anywhere.

I believe it is hosted on FanFiction.Net.

Essentially harry is taken in by the goblins and gets the chance to create his own powerful staff, he has to mine gem stones in a goblin mine for the required for the staff and gets caught in a cave in.


** Sounds like "Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone"

** Sounds like one of Captain Compass stories. Sorry I can't remember which one. Lost my laptop in a fire and most of my favorite stories with it.
