** I recommend linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum). It is an auror mystery that deals with both the remaining blood supremacists and muggleborn extremists. Really good story.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

***** Why doesn't this sub like HPFF? I've always been curious about that but haven't asked it seems like it must be taboo around here for some reason. It's a good site its where i found Mrs_Granger's series and an incredible series by SiriusAura92 about a war between the ICW and an alliance between almost all of the dark wizards in the world it seems. The third book in the series is still in the middle of being written but it is an incredible series. It's set 9 years after DH and the action sequences are some of the best I've read.

****** I can't speak for the sub, but I personally find HPFF very hard to navigate. And most of the fics I've found on there have been ridiculously bad.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** *A Cannon's Harpy*, linkffn(7768541): pretty fun story about Ginny's Quidditch career

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327): most canon-compliant postwar fics lack serious actions, but this one is different

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848): very nice smut fic with a plot, almost epilogue compliant (Fred was alive).
