I'm reading the series for the 2nd time, and I'm now onto DH. I want some stuff to look forward to after finishing.

I've read 2 or 3 series from the artist called Slide on fanfic.net (I think that's the site), and one deals with death and how one of the characters fell into a Veil but came back due to holding an artifact. (if you haven't checked her out, her Languis and Ignite series are crazy awesome!)

Sirius is my favorite character, so with his death by Veil leaving so much unexplained and much to be desired, I want to see what other people's take on death and the afterlife are like!

I liked how this story explained the concept of death thanks to what Harry learns after speaking to the shades summoned by the Resurrection Stone. Death is a peaceful state of being where you're healed of all the hurts of your life, but it's not something that can be explained or that the living could understand. Though the dead slowly forget their lives, they never forget the ones they loved. The time they spend in death is equal to the length of their life and then they're reborn again.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
