Im looking for stories where the Weasley men all try giving Harry advise or get Harry drunk. Or any stories that describe the run up to the wedding. Particularly anything with an element of fun.


** I e read a few good ones. The only one I can name, is one I read recently. Grab The Cheesewheel, and Run! Not sure how the bot works for the link. It's more Ginny centered, but it's a fun little read.
