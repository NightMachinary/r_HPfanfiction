I would love to hear some of your favorite pairings: some unique pairings that you just can't get over or some common pairings that you're obsessed with.

I also want to know what your thoughts are about having original characters being introduced as the main love interest. There are also some m/m/m that feature characters we know and someone brand new. Does this bother you? Do you have certain requirements to read these? Or are they a hard pass?


** I probably read the most Harry/Tom OR Harry/OMC. And omg I love love love when I find a good m/m/m fic. Kind of difficult bc I'm not the /biggest/ fan of Snarry, though I have given it a chance in the past. (I just mean that I feel like I see Draco/Harry/Snape quite a bit tho I could totally be wrong).

Otherwise, I'm also a fan of Harry with most of the Weasley brothers. Got a soft spot for him and the twins but not a ton of long finished works for them together.

And I kinda said it already, but this is one of the few fandoms where I'm totally down for an OC being paired up with a Main. I just love Harry centric stuff but I'm not super into some of his most popular ships. So checking out Harry/OMC fic gives me more reading material. :D

** Favourites: Harry/Ron and Dean/Seamus

I'm not adverse to having an OC love interest but it'd have to be quite well-written

** Wolfstar isn't unique but is the only one of the main m/m pairings I like.

Harry ships in particular seem to go to the areas I am not cool with - Draco, Snape, Voldemort. That said, a pairing I really like is Harry/Cedric. I've also read a few cute Harry/Ron

*** Wolfstar is one of my OG pairings and I will love it to the day I die. I'm only okay with Sirius and Remus hooking up with others, especially OCs, if it's on the path towards them getting together. (Or, you know, whump, because they both wear angst so beautifully)

** My inner monologue be like â€˜don't tell them you'll ruin your street cred' but my favourite male slash pairing is Tom/Harry! Obviously only time travel, AU, or Horcrux Tom so there's not a stonking great age difference. I love different author's exploration of Tom's character, and JKR made them to be perfect foils of each other so they're similar but different in an interesting way. I dislike relationships where there's a power imbalance or when the author glorifies toxic relationships though, so I gotta wade through a lot of shit.

Original characters are fine but I prefer it when someone invents a backstory and new personality for a named background character in canon. Otherwise I skip over the fic because there's a 95% chance the OC will be a self insert.

** I have a sequal in mind for my current WIP that features Charlie Weasley/Oliver Wood. I dig it.
