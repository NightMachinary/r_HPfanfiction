Okay, I know that this is a bit of a stretch, but I've recently been going on a War of The Worlds binge lately and wondered what it would be like if the Wizarding world found itself facing annihilation alongside the muggles of the world. Or at least wherein the wizarding world has to face something bigger than itself/Voldy that threatens the world at large. I don't know, I just love the build up to War of The Worlds in the beginning. The dread feeling.

If there are none of those, are there any large scale wizarding wars/battle fanfics I could look into? A world war would especially be cool, whether it be set in the past or in the future (i.e. WWIII). Hell, I'm currently reading revenge of the wizard, which is an awesome Star Wars / HP crossover fic.\\
Just please no slash. Not my cup of tea.

Thanks.


** HP/War of the Worlds, not gonna lie, that sounds pretty awesome. I'm having a similar search, as well. I wanna see a good HP/Halo crossover fanfic.

Might I ask what you mean by â€˜slash'?

*** An HP Halo crossover? Never thought of that, but would love to see the banter HP would have with 343 Guilty Spark.

But yeah, slash just makes things weird. Anything that wasn't a character fixation before, just makes things weird, and is the cause for very unrealistic and awkwardly written explanations, in my opinion. It's usually a mess.

But anyway, seriously, read Revenge of The Wizard. Just started it back up again and the invasion seen of the Empire upon the Earth is jaw droppingly well written. Tragic, but by god one of the best scenes I've ever seen written into fanfiction. Really, */really/* makes you */hate/* the Empire. It's in one of the beginning chapters, but even the rest are totally worth it. Just give it a try. I'll [edit: try to ] link it here.\\

**** As an Empire fan and Sith fan, I'm sure I'd still somehow find some way to root for them. Lol. I've actually heard of Revenge of the Wizard before, but I never checked it out.

What I really wanna see is the Trio and Aurors working alongside ONI and the Master Chief, fighting multiple wars: Against the Covenant, Innies, and You-Know-Who. Before eventually finding Halo, and unearthing the ancient terror that is The Flood.

***** As for being an Empire and Sith fan I totally get it. I am too lol. But at this story makes you really hate them. It's very good at doing that. I mean I feel that despite that a part of me will always like the Sith to some extent even so, but I can't help that, as a lot of the Sith usually had good reason to become Sith, especially Darth Caedus.

haha... the flood or hivemind could be used in some extremely twisted way to allow Voldy to become what he always wanted to be. Immortal. But at great cost.

*** Slash is referred to when the main character is gay. Slash for male/male and femslash for female/female :)

** I tried once to find any hp/zombie apocalypse fics. But either Harry was super gay, or couldn't use magic for whatever reason.

I just want me a competent Harry (and co?) Running around scavenging and murderizing all the zombies. No "zombies are immune/attracted to magic" "i lost my wand and am now a muggle hurr durr" "apparition and expanded bags what are those? Combatmagic? Necer heard of it!"

Ffs. /rant over

*** Nah I get it. I'm currently writing a fic write now. It's not on the Fanfiction site yet though because I'm working all of it out. It's about a guy who traverses through the veil and yes, I know that is to some extent already used or overused depending on the person reading it. However my version is a tad unique. Some of the story was influenced by the other HP. Lovecraft, in other words. I don't think I will use even that much from that universe, but I will use the mystery and costs attached to such forms of magic. Abyssal magic.

Probably due to my degree in history, I've so far made up an entire magical history that follows along and originates from the Greek Gods themselves to make the lore of the story that much stronger. The veil itself however is used as a method of travel. A very dangerous method. In fact people who go through the veil usually don't end up where they intend, because it's random. And thus even my self-insert (its my first fanfic, I have to write self-insert for practice purposes) who finds himself in the recognizable world of HP eventually realizes that the enemies of the world are a little bit more fearsome... I plan to make voldy literally the worst possible villain you can fight. Chaotic Evil. But still smart enough to make some valid points.

Anyway, with every advantage the character has, there will be just as many disadvantages. And fear not, this is not some weird suck-up story where I am using the story as a medium for unrealistic wishful desires. I'm a 27 year old male. I'm not into that crap lol. In fact the character is going to be older than the main trio. More like a bodyguard or protector I suppose (I am the eldest sibling in my family). If anything romantic happens between the characters it will only happen if the story "wills" it. And it's not going to be sappy. I've never written romance before, so I think if anything it will be very light, and more likely to happen muuuuuuch farther in the story. Or... I'll burn that bridge when I come to it. Who knows? Also, I make use of clever word play but that also comes with the offset of some terrible puns. Please forgive me in advance [for instance, I made a Limp Bizkit reference/joke with the Rowling's name in one of the classic chapter disclaimers. Again... I'm sorry.]
