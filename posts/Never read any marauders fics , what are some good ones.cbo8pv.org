** I only read Marauder Era so here's some of my favorites!

Linkffn(the life and times by jewel5)

Linkffn(against the moon by stoplight delight)

The above are two (unfinished, kill me) of the most famous and large-scale marauder era ones. Both excellent with good characterization. The worst part is they are incomplete and likely to stay that way. You combine them and you could almost have their years 1-7.

Linkffn(they're hiding inside me by divine comedian) is just one of many works by that author, all in that era, and all fantastic reads. Focus on the Black family and some mild R/S.

Linkao3(glass of water by lyin) is the aftermath of “The Prank” and focused on the fledgling Lily and Sirius friendship.

For adult Remus and Sirius (non-slash), I'm really enjoying linkffn(the bureaucratic error by iniga) right now. AU, Remus time travel, and heart breaking at times.

Finally, for first war, its pretty sparse out there but these are far better than average:

linkao3(first blood by januarygrey) linkao3 (Pyrenees by draconunquamdormiens) linkao3(the hell where youth and laughter go) Linkffn(dark marauder)

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.

** I finally get to share my favorite Marauders fic, it's titled “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7144245/1/The-Game][The Game]] ” and here is the description, “Seventh year Gryffindors all decide they need a bit of fun and Sirius suggests Truth or Dare, but with a twist. Will it really go for a week non-stop? And what is with the parchment?” It's very funny, I remember laughing a lot while reading it.

** PSA: This sort of thing is what the "Request" flair is for. "Recommendation" is for when you have something you want to share with us.

One I've been reading lately is linkao3(The Dog You Feed), which has a focus on the consequences of the "let's tell Snape about the werewolf 'prank'" on the relationships among Sirius, James, and Remus. The main plot involves Sirius running away from home and having nobody to get help from except Lily, who's visiting London at the time.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

** I love linkffn(the life and times), it's probably my favorite fic of all time. Unfortunately, it's unfinished.

These are all pretty good fics:

Linkfnn(tears on the balcony) - More romance based, has two sequels which are complete

Linkffn(against the moon) - Focuses more on Remus

Linkffn(The debt of time) - Time travel fic where Hermione goes back to the Maurader's Era and is adopted by the Potters

** Kind of the second time I've ended up recommending this today, but An Unexpected Attraction by thegingerhairedlass is really good, and also blessingly complete. It's basically starts in James and Lily's sixth year and goes all the way to the Halloween night they're killed where Voldemort is first defeated. Resolves around James, Lily, Sirius, Remus, Peter, Frank and Alice, and Marlene McKinnon, and is a story I would overall highly recommend. While it does start with a bit emphasis on teen drama and stuff, it does get dark and serious as it goes on.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** linkffn(Tears on the Balcony) and its sequels are good but drawn out just a little too much. But if you just want a really angsty and long story to take up time then they're good.

  Lily & James have hated each other ever since their initial meeting took a wrong turn. After a shocking goodbye at the end of their 6th year, are things going to be any different in the following year when they are forced to work together as Head Boy and Head Girl?
