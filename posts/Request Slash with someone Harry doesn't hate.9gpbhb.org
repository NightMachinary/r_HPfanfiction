Any good slash fic that pairs Harry with someone he actually likes? For example, Ron, Neville, Dean, George... could even be like... Cedric Diggory, idk. Why can I only find slash that pairs Harry with people he hates?

​

Prefer medium length (20k-50k), ideally with an actual plot in addition to romance? I especially like Post-Hogwarts stuff but any time period is ok. Please please no Mpreg. Please.

​

Thank you!!


** There's a real dearth of slash fics with actual plot that have Harry with someone canon Harry doesn't hate. These are what I could think of, though many are longer than you say you prefer:

/Shattered Illusions/ is a Ron/Harry Hogwarts-years story. Very teen years (i.e. no actual sex) and Harry is pretty meek (abusive Dursleys in play), but it's not bad. linkffn(917996)

/Skin Deep/ is a completed Harry/Bill with a good Snape. It's been forever since I read it so I don't remember if there's any annoying bashing, but it left a good impression on me. Also Abusive Dursleys. linkffn(2519543)

/Under a Watchful Eye/ is a very long WIP (still updating) 'characters read the books' fic where it's implied that Harry might have a relationship with Charlie. Hasn't happened yet though. (I dislike the 'reading the books' trope, but I do like this story.) linkffn(10917272)

/Shadow Magic/ is a recently completed Harry/Theo Nott. I'm including it because canon Harry doesn't seem to care that Nott exists. It's a darker-Harry (but not Dark!Harry) story. linkffn(13013716)

/Little Dragon:/ I only read the first few chapters. Way too cloying for me, but it fits your criteria, I think. (Harry/Charlie, soul bond <cringe>, WIP, I think still updating though I stopped reading some time ago). linkffn(10553003)

/Come Starlight/ has Sirius returning from the Dead because Harry makes a wish (silly, I know) right after killing Voldemort, and they end up together. Real plot here, but tons of angsting over the obvious 'it's his godson!' bit. I found the whole pairing pretty squicky, but it's a well-written story, and the characters are close-ish to canon. linkffn(6482502)

/The Second String/ is a weekly-updating time travel story that says on ao3 Harry will eventually have a relationship with Gideon Prewett. It's about 70,000 words in and there's no slash (and no Gideon) yet, so I'm not sure how slashy it'll really be. Great, interesting, well-written story though. linkffn(13010260)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel/AU cliché. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.
