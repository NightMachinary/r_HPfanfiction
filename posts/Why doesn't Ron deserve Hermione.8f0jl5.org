** Hermione is a remarkable person and an exceedingly accomplished witch. She's frightfully driven, fiercely loyal, highly knowledgeable about a world to which she has very recently been introduced, and every bit the steel-nerved Gryffindor that she presented to the Sorting Hat. She's wonderful, and everyone should admire her.

Now that we've got that out of the way...

Hermione has fans. To clarify, I mean real, /bona fide/ fanatics: the type who would ride that ten-and three-quarter inch length of vine like a Rampant Rabbit if they could get their hands on it.

They will exalt her every virtue and excuse all of her flaws because of all that she stands for, and it's natural to do that for our favourite heroes. But it does get out of hand - for sure. The films' portrayal of the Trio certainly exacerbated matters to the point that it is more subconscious than many Hermione fans would like to admit, especially where Ron's "worthiness" as a partner is concerned.

But that's just it: they wilfully ignore the fact that, magical skill and intriguing personalities aside (both of which Ron has in spades, see books), Hermione /made that choice/. You've read and listened to the way that she talks to Ron, so we can rest assured that he didn't pester her into dating him.

Bear in mind, I don't think Harry, Ron, or Hermione should have gotten together at the end. But they're three of my favourite fictional characters, and they're all plenty awesome and *more* than good enough on their own.

** I think a big part of it is movie portrayal vs the book. Movie Hermione is, frankly, far more attractive, less annoying and hard headed than the book one. And likewise, Ron is more capable in the books than he is in the movie, where he was mostly used as comedic relief.

Personally, I always thought Harry and Hermione's sibling relationship made way more sense than a romantic one.

** Where did you hear that rubbish? And why do you think Harry would be interested in Hermione? I never got the impression in the books that Harry has seen more than a good friend in her, a good friend who often annoyed him to no end.

** It's not that "Ron doesn't deserve Hermione". They are just different.

Ron is an average boy with average dreams. He doesn't work hard to achieve them and mostly goes with the flow.

Hermione has ambitions and is working hard to achieve them and because she's brilliant she's achieving a lot.

Books shows that Ron has jealousy issues towards people who are better than him in something he cares.

Pairing him with Hermione first of all will make *him* either miserable, because her career is a lot brighter than his, or house-husband under Hermione, if he fully accepts her dominance.

Try to put yourself in his shoes: your wife has the top post in the Ministry and you are just an employee (not an owner or co-partner) in the shop that was sponsored by your best friend who is the Head Auror.

*** First of all, Cursed Child is not canon. Second you call someone who stood up on a broken leg to defend his friend from a mass murderer average. Someone who, as an 11 year old, set a goal to become Quidditch Captain, Head Boy, Triwizard Winner, and Cup Champion. You call that person average. The only thing I agree with in your post is that Ron and Hermione are different and shouldn't be together. Because Ron deserves someone much better than her.

I took info from HP wiki and according to it it's not from "Cursed Child", but from [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/DUMBLEDORE%27S_ARMY_REUNITES_AT_QUIDDITCH_WORLD_CUP_FINAL][Dumbledore's Army Reunites at Quidditch World Cup Final]].

Also I admit that the article tells he's "co-managing" the shop.

Still getting the job, because your brother owns the company... It's not bad. But if he compares his career to Hermione's, it may give a very strong kick to his confidence as a man.

Are you implying that, for example, Neville would had run away? Or Dean? Or Seamus? Or any other Gryffindor (House of Brave) boy?

That are his dreams, not goals. During his school years he did nothing to achieve them. Almost all boys dream about similar things.

***** I'm 100% sure that at that point in the story, no other classmate of Harry's (except Hermione) with have got in between Harry and a crazy mass murderer and told said mass murderer that they would have to kill him first. They might not of ran away but they sure as fuck would have stayed on the floor clutching their broken leg. Furthermore, Ron's basic arc other the entire series was overcoming his jealousy and he was imo shown to succeed in this I by the time that him and Hermione get married I don't think that he will care at all about their different careers. This partly because he would hate to be the minister of magic and would not envy Hermione at all.

****** Ron and Hermione were only Harry's friends.

I'm not sure that if Seamus or Dean were, they would had left Harry to deal with Sirius. They are in Gryffindor for a reason too.

Success in career usually mean a lot for a man's confidence. Yes, he can accept that his wife is better in achieving her goals and he has his work because of his brother, but it's likely that his self-confidence is totally destroyed. He's nothing to be proud in comparison to his wife. Personally I don't wish such fate for a man.

******* I don't know about you, but if I'd been a vital part of destroying the darkest wizard of all time I'd be pretty fucking proud of myself. Also with regards to success in careers WWW was ludicrously successful and if Ron was a part of the management there then he is part of the reason for that. Ron is also probably proud of his family and also proud that his wife is changing the world.

For how long? Would it defined you as a man? I don't think so.

I'm not decreasing Ron's role. I just think that one-in-a-lifetime event should not define a person as fighting Nazis doesn't define WW2 veterans for their remaining life.

WWW shop was successful long before Ron's joined them. Everything else are speculations.

Is there at least one event in the books when Ron is truly proud of Hermione's achievements?

***** Ron could have followed his dreams, but he was too busy helping Harry in their adventures. And no I don't think Neville, Seamus, or Dean would have stood up on a broken leg at 13 years old.

Neville was a coward until book 7 and we don't know enough about Seamus and Dean.

It's very weak defence, if it's based on bashing everyone else.

  "There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."
