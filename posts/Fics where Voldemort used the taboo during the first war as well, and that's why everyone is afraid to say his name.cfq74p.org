I know that isn't how it went in cannon, but I get a bit annoyed with how preachy some fics can get about not being afraid to say the name. While I agree that "fear of the name only increases fear of the thing itself", I find that some authors can have the characters get really condescending to people for not saying it and I'm tired of reading it. Not saying the name Voldemort (despite it being his chosen alias) became a widespread cultural phenomenon for a reason, and I'd like to see a fic acknowledge that.

So, does anyone know of any fics that show that it is perfectly reasonable to be afraid of saying his name? Dumbledore could be the anomaly who is only able to get away with it because he is powerful enough to take on whoever might come for him. Conversely, it could be that Voldemort tries to use the taboo but it fails /because/ Dumbledore keeps setting off the sensors and no one can actually take him. I don't know, just something that turns the preachy, 'everyone is silly for being scared to say Voldemort' attitude on it's ear, or takes it in a unique direction.

It doesn't need to be a huge part of the story, and I am fine with any or no pairings (slash, het, whatever).

Thank you!


** This probably isn't what you're looking for, but it at least touches on what makes the name so disturbing to magical people but not muggles. (You can skip to the end for the bit about the Name.)

** There's a wee bit about this buried about halfway through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]]. It was something like, the original first-reign taboo (still in effect) was simply that Voldemort could tell when his name was spoken in proximity to a Dark Mark, and since you never knew who had one, you just didn't say it.

The poignant bit in the story was Hermione's horror that Dumbledore says it on purpose around Snape simply as a /taunt/. And then the second time I read the fic I realized there's strategic places where Dumbledore says Tom instead of Voldemort, like during the summer, which when Snape tells the Dark Lord that he doesn't have as much access to Dumbledore. It's just another detail in the story that gives us more character building for Hermione, Snape, and Dumbledore, but I spoiler-tagged it because I enjoyed reading it not knowing it was coming.

I like this fic for all the ways it extends canon magic. House elves, arithmancy, the sheets (!), the affinity, and probably some I've forgotten.

*** Oh interesting! I'm not usually one for Hermione-centric but I will definitely check this out! I love the idea of Dumbledore using “Tom” or “Voldemort” strategically and good world building is my fave. Thanks for the rec!

** I don't have a fic but one explaination is that during the first war, anyone who said Voldemort was targeted with their family. Anyone publicly going against them, they and their families are targeted. People are less likely to want to risk their families lives than their own for what they do after all. I don't remember the fic where I saw it but Harry told Arthur the fear of a name thing and he responded with the terror of saying it and coming home to the dark mark. After all people didn't know who was and wasn't a supporter/fake/imperiousd.

*** Thanks! I wonder what made him decide to start targeting people for saying his name, after he created the name to begin with. I know he would love the idea of people quaking in fear at the very sound of his name, but it does make me curious about how that particular action/reaction got started.

**** Voldemort was to separate himself from his muggle roots and he likely targeted people who said his name as a scare tactic. He became a monster instead of a person. Because people can be killed but monsters are much worse I guess. Also it could be an attempt to be called the dark lord. Also just think, people would think “people saying his name let alone opposing him gets them and their family killed”. His numbers were likely much smaller than the population so he was winning by making people too scared to fight back.

** In linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) Dumbledore tried to promote calling him Voldemort just because he wanted to avoid the renewal of the taboo which existed during the first war (if everybody called him Voldemort the power of taboo would be effectively broken). Unfortunately, he failed, because not enough people stopped call him You-Know-Who and similar nonsense.

*** I am so incredibly glad you shared this because The Accidental Animagus is actually the fic that inspired this post. I'm currently reading it and am only at the start of second year. They've already had Harry making a big deal about saying the name a couple times (references to not being scared of Hitler's name, Harry saying it over and over in the Great Hall while everyone flinched, etc), and there's been a lot of implication that muggles are better than wizards (which I'm not usually a big fan of), and then this passage just rubbed me the wrong way:

”Voldemort. That's You-Know-Who's name. Some of us aren't afraid to say it.”

“Wow, that's really brave,” Colin said in awe.

“No, it's common sense,” Harry told him. “I was raised in the muggle world, too. Out there, I'm just a normal kid, like you.” He motioned vaguely out behind him. “You know that no one's scared of names out there, the same as I do, and you shouldn't be scared in here, either.”

“Huh, I guess not. I figured it was some kind of magic name or something.”

“No, it's just people being scared.”

It made me crave a fic that mentioned that there actually is magic attached to the name. I'm glad you commented because that tells me that things aren't quite as they seem and Harry is just thinking that he knows it all based on the knowledge he has, which is realistic.

EDIT: tried to err on the side of caution and black out everything, but it doesn't seem to be working.

I don't use the official app, so I'm not sure exactly, but you may need to look for "markdown mode" in the text editor and remove a slash from in front of the >

** I have seen this sometimes, but beyond using it for bait, it's mostly only mentioned in Dumbledore bashing fics, as he wants Harry in trouble and all that shit. Of course no one bothers explaining the taboo to muggleborns or muggle raised, so they also get rounded up often very easily.

Sadly I can't remember the name of any specific fic, since this isn't all that remarkable.

*** Yeah I didn't think there'd be much luck, if only because it's not likely to be more than a side-note in most fics.

I don't mind a bit of Dumbledore bashing, but teaching Harry to say the name just to get him in trouble feels like a bit of a reach imo.
