I've recently returned to the fandom after a six year hiatus, but I've been in the fandom now for twelve years. Like any preteen, I was very opinionated about what should happen to the at the time unfinished saga and well, I took to fanfiction. I remember gravitating towards HPFF because of the use of banners, and that it had its own awards (The Dobbys). All the cliches and tropes were new to me even though it was the middle of the series run, and all the reviewers were so supportive. In hindsight their strict rules and moderation probably saved me from potential harm or embarrassment, while FFN was the Wild West in comparison. Since there's only a few weeks until it's demise, I've been going through my old account which has been untouched since 2006. I'm debating whether or not to save my terrible stories, or try to save my favorites. It's nice to see the child who I was, but mostly I'm mourning for the almost twenty year site. All things must end, but I must thank them for the fond memories.


** Save any reviews you have. I feel the same way about the demise of Checkmated. I made some good friends on that site and I wish I'd thought to save their kind comments.

*** That's a good idea! I'm looking at my old stories and cringing at the premises (A Harry in Slytherin AU, etc) but in hindsight I was a better writer at 13 than I am now

** My gods, I cringe every time I look at anything I wrote at age 13. I mean, there were some interesting ideas, but I sucked at writing. I can always spot a teeny-bopper writer when they write smut though. There's more of those than there really should be and I was one myself. I still have all my old chapters. In a folder inside a folder inside a folder inside a folder. Sometimes I think about going back and rewriting them, then I start reading them and end up wanting to burn my computer (not good, considering it's a very new computer.)

*** I agree, the cringe can be strong. I honestly think that it's hilarious seeing lemons written by very inexperienced writers, but I also empathize because to be honest I was one too. I don't see anything wrong with it though since it seems like a healthy way of processing ones own sexuality while figuring out why they like the things they like.

**** That's fair enough. To a point, it's healthy and okay, but young teens writing full-blown porn is not something that should be happening. They're still children really and don't need to be sexualising themselves (which is often what they're doing.) It can do serious damage to have those sexual expectations for yourself at 12, 13, 14 years old.

***** I completely agree. But I don't really know what can be done other than strict forum moderation, and the standard warnings before M rated fics. And if we're being honest I think fanfic can be just as damaging as watching porn. At least in America, with abstinence only education I can see a lot of young adolescents turning to alternative sources such as fanfic for information. This is tmi I know, but maybe with more information literacy parents can monitor what their children read and discuss what the limitations of the media they consume. But that's probably too uncomfortable for most families. I know in my adolescence my parents never paid attention to my internet usage because they didn't know the risks.

****** I agree wholeheartedly that fanfiction can be extremely damaging. It's not really known to parents and it's not moderated and supervised as strictly as porn. In Australia, they teach abstinence in religious schools and â€˜Condoms! The pill!' In public schools. Or they're supposed to. A lot of the time, sex ed gets passed over because it's an uncomfortable topic. Parents do the same, leaving it up to schools and books when they really should be talking to their kids. I suppose when the technology generation become parents, they'll be more aware of the dangers, but there's still a large amount of people in that generation that won't know about fanfiction and the dangers of it.

** I'm going to post links to some of my favorite stories. They aren't everyone's cup of tea, but feel free to post your own favorites too!

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=227552][Bouquet]] A look into Petunia's childhood "Some mistakes are to big to forgive. Some hates run to deep. Some loves are too strong. Some memories are not meant to be forgotten..."

[[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=226118][Give Up This Fight]] "It is the summer of 1925 in the sleepy village of Little Hangleton, where lives intertwine and stories are rewritten. There is the handsome Tom Riddle, restless despite his wealth and privilege; Bethe Lawney, a gifted young woman with a mysterious past; and Merope Gaunt, destined to become the mother of the most powerful dark wizard in history..."

[[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=246712][The Power of Orange Knickers]] Fred and George gift Ron a pair of tickets to a chicken Cannons game one Summer, and Ron busts out his lucky pair of orange underwear in order to get someone to snog him.

** It's always sad to see a big site like this go, but it's interesting how perceptions can be different. HPFF never seemd interesting to me because most of it is either canon pairings or, worse, Next Gen fics.

Another example:

#+begin_quote
  I remember gravitating towards HPFF because of the use of banners
#+end_quote

That's always a huge turn-off for me. Silly banners always make it seem more childish to me. Especially when they look like the most cliched romance novel covers (you know what I mean) ever. Also banners often indicate a weird obsession with the movies, which for me isn't the first thing I associate with Harry Potter.

*** Well I was a bit juvenile as a thirteen year old. And sadly many of the fics I read were heavily influenced by the movies. The site had a pretty extensive Marauders section and I was a huge Jily fan, so that was probably another reason I liked it
