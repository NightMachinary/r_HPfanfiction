I am not worthy of your assistance but I will ask anyway. I've been reading HP Fanfiction for 11 days, but I've logged over 2 million words so hopefully what I lack in experience I make up for in exuberance. My OTP (gosh I hope I'm doing this right) is Snape Hermione, but I can't stand the idea of them getting together while she is anywhere near eighteen. I just don't think Snape would go for a young Hermione. I'm looking for recommendations of stories where they get together much later, My three favorite stories that I'm hoping to find others like are: Rule of Law by Arsenic Jade Post Tenebras Lux by Loten The Gilded Cage by AppolinaV Also the longer the story the better! I really appreciate all of your help. I don't mean to disrespect anyone who is a big fan of WIKTT (?) it's just not my thing. Thank you for reading and any suggestions you may have. I'm really really enjoying getting into HP fan fiction.


** Got your back, fam! I'm on mobile right now, but can link things as soon as I get to my computer. SSHG is my OTP as well. =)

EDIT: These two are a good place to start. Feel free to PM me if you want more!

** Mundungus42 definitely has some later SSHG fics....my favorite of this author is linkffn(The Fine Art of Fine Print). This author shies away from Ron-bashing/hating.

SSHG is one of my favorite pairings. If you're feeling uneasy about the age difference, but want to read something where SS and HG are younger, I'd recommend linkffn(Pride of Time) and its companion linkffn(Divide of Time).

Post Tenebras Lux is the fic that hooked me into the ship!
