A fantastic fic centered around young Ron. It has an interesting premise involving the Grim. I'd recommend checking it out!

  Eight-year-old Ron knows his crazy Uncle Billius wasn't as cracked as everyone believes. Wearing gloves in the summer, pockets full of cheering charms, terrified of Patronuses: all of these things seem pretty reasonable to Ron who can see the Grim just as well as his Uncle could. Ron is content to ignore the creature until he accidentally-on-purpose kills someone.

Seeing an incredible opportunity, they decide that staying is the best choice, and work to prepare humanity for the coming war from the shadows. But in the land of gods and magic, their arrival heralds great change. For they are god-slayers and fatebreakers.
