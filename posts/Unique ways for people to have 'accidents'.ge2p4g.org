I'll start: Holding a portkey in each hand, set to trigger at the same time, heading in opposite directions - the portkey hooks pull in opposite directions, so the person is just ripped in half, and the Aurors have to follow portkey trails or blood spatters to find the halves and hide the evidence

*** “I mean, it's odd that they're 10 feet to the north of a northbound Northern line train and they were 100 yards /into a tunnel/ as opposed to, you know, in a station, but there's no other explanation, is there? After all, it's not like they could've /popped/ there or anything, is it?”

** Or just change a regular portkey to end up in the middle of the Pacific. Nobody can apparate that far to get to land, flying without a broom is unlikely and good luck swimming with heavy robes.

*** There are spells to freeze water, and you can likely either directly transfigure water or the resultant ice into a boat. From there, it's just a matter of using the Point Me spell to divine north and then conjuring wind into your boat's sail until you reach land. Rinse and repeat until you're on a continent, hitch a ride to the capital of the country you're in and find the magical district.

**** Judging by how much of their schooling the average person remembers and the fact that not everyone takes NEWT Transfiguration, I suspect that there are fairly few people who could actually do that.

***** Perhaps, though it's not canon, but who would even want to arrange a seeming accident for an average person?

**** Why conjure wind when the augment spell would act like a hydro jet or the banishing charm would act as a acceleration shock wave and either way you could achieve extreme speeds and there is spell to make stuff umbreakable and a sticking charm so you don't fall out.

** I bet you can splinch someone real bad if you put something else in their apparition point.

On the topic of portkeys, you could stun someone and then throw them a portkey that goes straight into the earth, or into an active volcano or the mariana trench or something like that. Antarctica is another good choice. They have to be stunned for that, though, as a wizard can probably heat themselves.

Potions accidents must be relatively easy to stage. We see that a boil cure for example can explode into a boil causer, if you sabotage someone's potion so it becomes a boil causer and then get them to drink it, they'll suffocate on the boils in their throat. That doesn't even touch just adding random stuff into a potion while it's simmering so it explodes or kills anyone who drinks it.

What about wand sabotage? Crack someone's wand like Ron's was, and then stage a robbery or something that'll make them respond violently. They shoot off a spell and it rebounds.
