*** Well, seems like an obvious hole needs to be filled.

I'm imaging the interesting dynamics of harry being considered quarter giant growing up

**** He's just so tragically short, everybody assumes Hagrid must have had a very very short wizard as a father because that child is puny even compared to other wizard children.

Then Harry shoots up in like fifth year and almost gets to Ron's height.

***** Well harry was originally short due to malnutrition. Can't remember if that is canon or not though tbh.

I'm more thinking about the rumor mill of bwl notbeing a potter at all. Ya know?

****** That's a fair point. I guess it depends on when Hagrid gets him? As a baby or after some time with the Dursleys.

******* Baby. Just Dumbledore never entered the picture. Hes a principle of the school, leader of the war effort, and he lets go of the small details like a baby. I would like it that the kid got a quailty parent, as I think hagrid is a big mythical version of Steve Irwin

******** Oh my god just Hagrid holding baby Harry over Aragorg to introduce his friend to his son. ðŸ¤£ Minerva spends hours baby proofing the hut then says fuck it and tries to convince Hagrid to live in the castle like the other professors.

Hagrid teaching first years care of magical creatures with an infant strapped to his chest, Harry fears nothing.

Hagrid cries with pride when his boy talks to a garden snake.

"He's just like his mummy he is! It's a family gift you see, working with the beasts."

********* Exactly!!

"Now ya see Harry me boy, this here is my friend Aragog. He and his family protect the castle with their webs from some of the truly scary stuff. Never judge a book by its cover. I know he looks scary but here's an important member of the family ya hear?"

Harry riding on unicorns and thestrals growing up.

"Just cause you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there. Harry."

Harry and Luna (my favorite character and pairing) going on adventurers looking for fabled beasts.

Father son bonding over the dragons coming for the tri wizard.

********** Hagrid brings home the dragon egg and Harry drags Ron down to meet the new baby.

Harry is convinced that he could talk to a dragon if he met one since they're "practically snakes".

Harry rides on Fang like a horse as a toddler, that dog is a coward except when Harry is around. He'd fight a werewolf for the boy.

Ron nearly shits himself when a spider the size of a cat scuttles up to Harry in their dorm. Harry laughs so much he cries at the amount of screaming from his roommates. "This is just Melvin, she's too small to kill anybody."

The centaurs love how polite he is and gift him pretty rocks and skulls when Harry comes along with his daddy for negotiations, The children of the herd and Harry play for hours.

Just, sweet baby Harry makes friends with all the creatures of the forest and grows up taught to treat everyone as people.
