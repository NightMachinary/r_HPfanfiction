So the premise is that through a series of events as a shade Voldemort ends up in a body that is genetically Harry's half-brother through James. He then goes through school with Harry and the main plot is very interesting.

However, in first year he ends up going down on Tonks who is 16/17. Voldemort is 60. In the body of an 11 year old. In what fucking world is that acceptable? They then get married a year later. Every one is pretty chill about it.

Any other creepy moments in otherwise good fics?


** Wtf? Nevermind the fact that she would have been 17/18 during their first year (graduated 1991), just no.

I like my age gaps, but 60/16 is a bit much, even before throwing in the 'in the body of an 11 year old' piece. I see no situation where any part of this is okay. The 16/17 year old having sex with a first year? The adult in a child's body having sex with a teenager?

Let's... just not.

*** It's not exactly presented as a good thing in the story. That's the Dark Lord Voldemort there, plotting the murder of Harry Potter, the subjugation of Britain, and the death of all muggles. Underage sex is actually the least of his crimes.

**** It is 100% presented as a good thing. Voldemort is seen as a hero for saving Tonks from all the evil men that want her to change her looks for her. It's the reason they're allowed to marry early in America (who obviously find that kind of thing repulsive).

******* I didn't interprete it like that. Voldemort killed his prior love, Bellatrix, in cold blood. Odds are, he'd do the same to Tonks, should he tire of her or otherwise think her death would benefit him.

So, I think the relationship was seen by the duped characters as something good, not to the readers though.

Also there's several times that Voldemort recognises feelings for her, he even feels guilty for cheating on her.

  Hermione gets the cat, the flat, the food, and the furniture. Ron gets the family and friends. Harry gets the boot, his little book, the blame, and the shame. Ginny gets a new bloke and a haircut. New circumstances mix with old patterns, and Harry and Hermione find their friendship put to the test.

Well, it's not like they know that he is Voldemort, and Vito Potter is very mature for his age.

With wizards and witches who age for hundreds of years, a 5 year difference isn't that much either, so it might not be creepy in the Wizarding World.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.

** He was Voldemort, shagging young women was the least of his crimes.

He killed scores (50 muggles along with Vernon and Dudley, Sirius, Remus, Peter, McGonagall, Dumbledore, the Malfoys, Percy Weasley, and all of his old Death Eaters) before his 2nd year was over. Then he fooled all the light siders (Harry, Hermione, the Tonks, the Longbottoms, remaining Weasleys, the Boneses) in participating in his genocide against Muggles. I mean this Voldemort was far more dangerous and scarier than the canon one.
