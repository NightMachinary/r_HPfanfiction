I read the fic a few years back. Harry runs away after the war because he is tired of the attention (maybe fights with Ron?) And goes to france (?). He has trouble with his magic. There Hermione goes looking for him and convinces him to come back. Harry ends up teaching practice dada and Hermione goes back to finish school. And somewhere in all of this the trio goes to have adventures? I remember there is a fight in a forest.

These are all the details I remember.

Hope someone can help me find this fic.


** Are you sure the description is about one fic, not a mixture of two or more? No offence, but I know I did that multiple times before.

/War Widow/ by anthfan linkffn(8414628) fits to a few points, but not all (at least that's what I remember, it's been a while since I read it too).

  After the war the Trio has split. Harry's disappeared and Hermione has turned away from magic as a way to deal with being alone. But now there is another threat to the wizarding world, and the Trio must unite once again.
