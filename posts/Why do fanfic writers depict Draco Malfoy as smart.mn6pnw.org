This is something that really bothers me. There's really NO indication in the books that he competed academically with Hermione or even Harry or Ron. Hell, the boy got 3 OWLS. Harry and Ron got 7. He's also really impulsive, even more than Harry, and his comebacks aren't even witty. Yet in fanfics I commonly see the authors making him really smart and academically driven? It doesn't make sense to me.


** Where does it say the number of OWLs he got? Also he got an O in potions which probably indicates he's at least somewhat academically inclined.

Edit: I also read the fandom article just now and he was also a good enough Occlumens to repel Snape and was able to do nonverbal magic before sixth year. Based on that, he almost certainly got more than 3 O.W.L.s

*** Guessing they're going by his fandom article which only mentions three (DADA, Transfiguration, Potions). However, he stunk up the joint in Potions and may have only qualified due to Snape.

**** But Snape wouldn't have been the one who graded his OWL, so he got into Potions on his own merits. Even if the acceptance score was lowered under Slughorn, he still qualified.

***** He didn't need a new textbook like Harry and Ron, so he most likely got an O

** So I don't love the Draco Malfoy is super smart trope personally, but I can see where it's coming from. He went through the effort of making ridiculous badges in both 4th year and 5th year (I think?) that had somewhat impressive magical qualities. He also fixed the vanishing cabinet which seemed hard.

So I take him for being clever, but only when it suits him. A lot of people extrapolate this to being really smart but I view it as a different kind of intelligence.

But it is what it is ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** He's intelligent the same way humans, in general, are intelligent. I think he's just average in terms of his sole intelligence level. The schemes he came up with, you don't have to be genius to think of them. It does sometimes irk me to see him portrayed as such.

*** This explains how he could have academic success without being unusually intelligent, and since his actions don't indicate particular intelligence, this is my preferred interpretation.

** I would say "NO indication" is a stretch. There is enough evidence that he's smart for fan writers to do what they want in terms of his intelligence and still have it based in canon. You can check out this Quora page for the evidence that they're using when they depict him as smart: [[https://www.quora.com/Is-Draco-Malfoy-smart]]

** He does manage an O in potions and he is better at Occlumency than Harry, so I think there's some evidence that he is smart. His attempts to murder Dumbledore aren't that terrible, either. And he manages to repair the vanishing cabinet, which probably isn't easy.

*** Or... he had immensely more helpful tutelage at potions than Harry ever received, and Occlumency is a damn sight easier to learn when you don't have a piece of the soul you're trying to keep out lodged in your skull...

I don't think Draco is any more highly intelligent than Harry, he just has natural talents in different areas.

***** I don't think Draco's stupid, by any stretch of the imagination. I just don't buy into all the hype that he's second only to Hermione, I think that's a fanon invention and it gets used all too often to make Harry look stupid and/or lazy by comparison.

****** To be fair Harry isn't that academically inclined considering there's a genocidal dark wizard after him. One would think he would attempt to train more in order to survive.

** So the thing is if you upgrade an protagonist there should be an antagonist upgrade as well. I have no problem with Malfoy actually being Smart or cunning instead of dumb Gryffindorish slytherin

** There isn't no proof. I think he is smarter than Harry and Ron and it would make sense that he is smart and all. He probably grew up having private tutors and such. Harry is definitely more impulsive than Draco?

*** I think it's hard to say just how smart Harry is. He was able to learn advanced spells and later teach them to fellow students fairly well.

His lack of outstanding performance in classes can easily be attributed to him being an underachiever or general apathy.

**** In DADA Harry is definetly better and he isn't dumb by any stretch of mind but I do think Draco is a bit smarter in other areas, or at the very least, more academically inclined than him. If Harry's lack of performance in class is bc he's an underachiever then we won't really know how smart he is.

*** Having private tutors doesn't make a person smarter - it just gives them advantages when it comes to knowing how to work academically, and navigating resources.

** Off the top of my head, based on half remembered book canon (and probably some accidental fanon).

I would say Draco is of average intelligence. Draco probably beats Harry academically, because of his wizarding upbringing and he has parents to push him.

I also think Harry is of average intelligence, but maybe a tad smarter than Draco. Cause in my head Harry would perform better than Draco if he had the same advantages and motivation (a magical upbringing with guardians who care).

They would both always have different strengths.

Also, I would slot Draco somewhere in the top 20 overall at Hogwarts. But don't see him in Top 3 (except for Potions on it's own).

Just my opinion in this moment, I have no evidence to present.
