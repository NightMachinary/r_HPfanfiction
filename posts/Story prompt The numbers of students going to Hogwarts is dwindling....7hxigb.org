A deeper investigation of the matter showed that fewer Muggle-borns were choosing to attend Hogwarts. A new wizarding school has sprouted, offering Muggle-borns the chance to continue their regular education and at the same time receive lessons in the "basics" of magic.

At first no one really cared about this new school. But when it is revealed that what its curriculum considers to be the basics is actually wandless magic that helps wizards blend into the Muggle world better, the school starts attracting Half-bloods away from Hogwarts, further cutting down enrollments. The Hogwarts staff finally has to make a hard review of the courses the school offers and revise what's being taught and the way things are taught.

How would you work with this idea?


** Not what you adk for, but there alredy is a story withthis premis. It's on ff.net, though I can't remember what it's called.

It's your basic Harry gets fed up by wizarding society and changes things story.

**** Ah, but this another one of those stories where things are made to appear worse than in canon hence the "need" for change.

I'm looking for one that doesn't do that. Isn't the current state of Hogwarts enough? It doesn't e en have to be Harry doing the changes. Maybe the new school is founded in the present day (2010's). And if it doesn't exist yet, how would you write it?

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).

*** Not quite the kind of story I'm looking for but it does raise a point that could be used as a defense/argument on why the hypothetical new school would be founded:

"...eleven year old children... offered them places at their magical school Hogwarts and then, after seven years of schooling, they didn't suffice for the jobs in their stupid world. But thanks to being out of contact with the normal world, they also didn't have the needed education to get other jobs that they would have got if they hadn't chosen to attend Hogwarts."

** I'm pretty sure there is a series based on this called the Cupboard Series. Harry doesn't like how Hogwarts is being run so founds his own school or something like that. I think it happens in the 3rd or 4th book.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** Hmm...there's a thought there.

Wandless magic might be 'weak', in the sense that it can only perform basic tasks; levitation, mind tricks, small conjurations, daily-use charms, etc.

While wanded magic would be more effective at more powerful magic; complex transfigurations, grand conjurations, intricate charms and long-lasting enchantments.

When faced with the notion that magical children might only want to know the magic that's used in their day-to-day life, and choose wandless for more convenience, Hogwarts might end up working to rebuild its own image; not as an all-purpose magic school, but a university dedicated to high-level magical engineering, construction, healing and warfare, and basically everything else required for top-tier jobs in the wizarding world.

Hogwarts might even raise the age of its students (and adjust their education accordingly), so it's not competing with the wandless school; students could graduate from Bubblegloop Primary School and head for Hogwarts University; now they've learned to work with their bare hands, now it's time to find out how to wield the universe's conductor's baton.

*** Thank you so much for that comment!

"...magical children might only want to know the magic that's used in their day-to-day life, and choose wandless for more convenience..."

Yes, precisely! For example, if set in today's world, there could be Muggle-borns wanting to have the "best of both worlds" - not giving up modern conveniences and the chance to land jobs in the muggle word later on, however seeing magic as a useful tool to make their lives easier--magic to clean the house, change outfits without causing a bedroom mess or simply levitating a bag of chips from the kitchen while watching TV--hence the choice to go "wandless" even if it's weaker than wanded magic.

And then for those who are like Hermione who are willing to full-time delve into the magical world, there will be Hogwarts, with its revised curriculum.

Basically, a Hogwarts story that shows how it is adapting to modern times and outside influences. ðŸ˜€
