** "Canon", "rewatch". Something doesn't fit here.

*** Lol though I agree that movies are quite different from the books.

**** Indeed this is true, although of all of the movies, the first one is the closets to its book counterpart. With the only real differences being due to the limitations and possibilites of a different entertainment medium. The others though are totally fucked as far as sticking 100% to the books goes.

** If you really want to separate canon from fanon, re-read the series. Movie Ron gets shortchanged. Book Ron is much more badass, far funnier, and has a solid bromance with Harry

*** It's ridiculous what they did with Hermione. PoA is a prime example. In the book, Sirius last line is "You really are your father's son, Harry." In the movie, Sirius instead says "You really are the brightest witch of your age." Yeah, Sirius's final line is to Hermione. Really just highlights how much the directors wanked over the character.

** I apologize. I'm aware it isn't canon. You have the books which are canon, but don't list everything you want to know about the world of Harry Potter. There were things left out, small little details that don't effect the story.

And so the movies came out, trying to fill in blank lines and make the books more movie friendly. Ultimately, this didn't work out.

But then fanfiction is on another whole level. People aren't stressed into making their projects similar to the books. They are given a whole sandbox to play in. Some people try to base their story off of the books/movies, some people get lost, and fill in time with ideas they got in the books. And some take other turns, remaking the entire world, because the canon world is incomplete.

And my point was that some people will get bored of writing and lose their interest in Harry Potter. If you care about learning canon facts, the books are for you. But personally, I will get this blissful feeling of nostalgia every time I see PS, and will be inspired to continue writing.

The line between canon and fanon is very blurry. Albus Dumbledore has a scar of London Underground somewhere near his left knee. Why would he have that? It is possible to assume that the wizarding world isn't as unfamiliar with muggle technology as they seem. Of course, maybe he was being tortured, and the only branding rod ‘they' had was of London's train system.

Then in PoA, muggle authorities were used to (albeit blindly) to keep an eye out for Sirius Black. How did they get in contact? Did they use the imperius curse? GASP, could there possibly be a faction of wizards pretending to be muggles!? Could an entire floor in the ministry be dedicated to regulating muggle/wizard relations?

We will probably never know all of the details. When I try writing about HP, this is my main kryptonite.

But of course, in the end maybe I'm just mistaking book canon for movie canon.
