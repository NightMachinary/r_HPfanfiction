Hello! I'm looking for (preferably light-hearted) stories spanning all seven years or more, after the fashion of things like linkffn(The Arithmancer). Of course, if it's a story and its sequel(s), that's quite alright too.

If not completed, then the story should be regularly updating with a clear intention to reach the end of seventh-year.

(Blatant shipping-focus is out, but I don't mind what the relationships are as long as they're in the background/develop late into the fic)

*** Alas, I have been in the fandom long enough to have long ago read /Seventh Horcrux/. Might you give me more details on the other one? I've seen the name thrown around but I have no idea what the plot is.

**** The other is a fun rewrite of the canon plot, in a non-magic sci-fi AU.

I generally hate canon rehashes, but I'm honestly interested in how canon events would unfold in this world.

Even if most canon stations do repeat in first 6 years, they do so with significant differences, and the balance of power between good and bad guys isn't nearly as lopsided as in canon.

The last year, which occupies 67 out of the 200 chapters, is very very different.

I just published the first task of the Triwizard Tournament a few weeks ago, and I've got plans up through the end of seventh year. As for light-hearted... it has its ups and downs.

*** Ah, sort of like /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/, then? I'm interested! You might want to get a better summary, though. People (and by people I mostly mean me, but I think I'm by far not the only one) tend to dislike "cryptic" summaries like this.

** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning On The Wave is a massive 7 book AU (completed), where Harry has a twin brother, Connor, who is the boy-who-lived. Admittedly, it's fairly intense, sort of ship focused (Harry/Draco; you learn to tolerate it) - come to think of it, mostly the opposite of what you requested. However, would definitely recommend it - the first book is titled Saving Connor.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
