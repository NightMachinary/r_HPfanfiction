It seemed to have started around last year. Most writers before that seemed to write separate Stories in FFN for each Year or sequel of their fanfiction, but recently a lot of people are adding onto the same initial story rather than creating a new story for their sequels. Anyone know why this seems to be happening?

Examples:

Dodging Prisons & Stealing Witches splits into Books as following

#+begin_quote

  - Book one: Chapters 1-14 --- Revenge is Best Served Raw

  - Book two: Chapters 15-?? --- The Foundations of Power
#+end_quote

Harry Potter and the Game splits into Books as following

#+begin_quote

  - Book 1: Chapters 1-19 --- Press Start

  - Book 2: Chapters 20-40 --- Glitching Souls

  - Book 3: Chapters 41-? --- Source Code
#+end_quote

*** I'd like to piggyback on this and say I got similar advice, (although a few people were dead against it) but also bring up the point that the only thing that is really new about this is in calling the separate years 'books' for the sake of reader convenience. Rolling multiple years into one fic has been common for quite a long time.

Off the top of my head:

- Nightmares of Futures Past

- Harry Crow

- Weres Harry

- The Merging

- The Children of Change

But then, there are plenty that do split years up as well.

That should be "neither could you" and you're right, Emma Watson would never have sex with me. I'm facing it and don't care about what you're yammering about. The point is that Conneron gave an answer that is making sense to people and your first instinct is to be dick for no good reason. Oh, be a dick, but have a reason to be one. And who's "we all"? If they use bots, whatever, they're not hurting anybody.

Yes. You've joined us. You're jealous too. All your hours of hard work were met with nothing but mediocre and tepid responses, and these people use bots and whatever other methods they can to boost their review numbers and grow bigger than you ever could. You see it too. They deserve none of what they have.

Yes. You are one of us too. You are jealous too. All your hard work spending hours on your stories, and yet these elitist botting reviewbaiters manage to get more reviews than they ever could deserve. You deserve better, and they deserve worse.

** idk if I'd call it a new trend, it's always been around. i imagine one benefit to keeping it all together is to build higher review/follow/fav numbers for it

** I think they realize a lot of people who are on the fence of a story will keep reading it if it's one big story, but not if it's split. Plus your mega story now has a larger numbers of follows, reviews, and favorites.

Basically, it's to get more readers.

** Because it keeps it simpler for the author in question, and it makes it easier for readers to find and follow. Breaking your stories off when they're one narrative thread doesn't make as much sense when you don't make more money for releasing more books, you don't have to worry about binding, and you don't have to worry about losing readers because they didn't find your newest derivation on the same theme.
