Hi, Harry Potter fanfic folk. I'm posting a link to the most recently-released episode of Retro Fanfic Retrospective, our book-club podcast for classic fanfiction, because the topic of our discussion was Cassandra Claire's "Draco Dormiens." It's our first Harry Potter fanfic on the show, but I expect we'll be returning to it at some point. Please let us know if you've got any comments!

Here are the links and episode description as per the /podcasts subreddit:

We unseal the endless well of Harry Potter fanfiction. Combine Draco and Harry, shake well, and you end up with two snarky teen anti-heroes who want to make out with Hermione. [[http://bit.ly/rfrdraco][Link to the story]]

Retro Fanfic Retrospective is a weekly podcast where three friends explore classic fanfiction from a variety of franchises, and see how well they hold up in the cold, harsh light of 2018.
