For instance, I prefer seeing Harry as a Professor or as some type of healer. Either someone like Pomfrey, or more complicated.

He was damn good at helping the DA, and while I do understand, there's more work involved when you're an actual Professor, I think Harry would have a knack for it.

I never really saw Ron becoming an Auror or staying with George at the Joke Shop for more than say 5-8 years, so that George could get some help/support. I'd love to see him as a Coach for a Quidditch Team. It'd be great if he could be one for his favorite team.

Hermione, I don't really like the idea of her becoming Minister over time. But actively working to better Werewolf Rights, Vampire Rights, etc would be perfect for her. I should see her opening up a voluntary blood bank, giving volunteer blood to Vampires, helping lower the cost of the Wolfsbane, having Werewolfs not get fired just because of their change, etc.

What about you? What do you see the characters (can even be outside of Harry, Ron and Hermione) doing?


** I understand that this is a rather controversial opinion, but I think Harry would do great as a pro Quidditch player. Most pro athletes don't choose to go pro because of attention, to be in the spotlight, or even the money. They do it because they love the sport. An athlete isn't able to get that good unless they really enjoy and have a passion for what they do. I think Harry would see the press attention as a nuicance, as many pro athletes actually do.

Also, I think because he was practically sent down the Auror route due to circumstances, and not because of his passion. That doesn't mean that he wouldn't be an excellent auror, but to me that just makes it sound like he became an Auror just from obligation. I would love to see a Harry who does what /he/ loves to do, not what society and other people expect him to do.

*** Agreed. Also I think Harry actually wouldn't mind the fame that comes with being a quidditch pro because he actually worked for his fame this time. I feel like Harry didn't hate being famous, he hated being famous for his parents dying and him being lucky enough to survive.

** Personally, I see Harry as an Auror but retiring in his late thirties or forties and deciding to take up a post teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts in Hogwarts. I don't know why. I think it's because I feel that it would be something that Harry would do.

I like Ron as an Auror as well, but I feel that he wouldn't be able to do it after awhile and deciding that he had to do something else for awhile. I've always seen Ron as a possible Curse Breaker like his older brother Bill...

Hermione is a bit difficult for me. I don't really know what she would have done... I feel like she would have done something more academic based. However, I see her also being a staunch supporter for fighting for Werewolf rights or the rights of house elves... ending the stigma associated with 'dark creatures'... etc.

** Pretty much anything that isn't an auror, honestly. I feel like after the war, he would have gotten sick to death of that, and I don't think he would appreciate being a direct ministry employee very much, let alone a beat cop, which is what aurors are. He wouldn't enjoy working as an auror, and he wouldn't enjoy being the head auror either.

I feel like Harry becoming a doctor, a teacher, or a cursebreaker would be his most enjoyable careers. He loves helping people, he really does have a thing about it, so being a doctor would come naturally to him. We know for a fact he's a fantastic teacher, and he absolutely has the talent for it. And I feel as though Bill probably has the coolest and most interesting job in the magical world that we've seen: cursebreaker is literally getting to be an explorer/archeologist/tomb raider/magizoologist, but all at once. You're basically a professional adventurer and they pay you for it. If Harry doesn't really like the sort of slow life of not doing anything, but doesn't want to constantly get into murder fights with insane dark wizards, then being a cursebreaker would be a great way to sort of allow the adventures to continue, but in a more controlled way, and with professional help. And they pay you. Nobody paid Harry jack for dodging Devil's Snare or using a time turner to dodge Dementors and werewolves.

If Harry is going to get into crazy situations involving various kinds of peril on a regular basis, he might as well be getting bread for it. They don't pay cops who get in trouble, that's the antithesis of being in law enforcement. But a cursebreaker is basically a professional troublemaker. Hell, by that logic, Hermione, Harry, and Ron could probably start their own cursebreaking incorporated company and be wildly successful. You could write a whole extra series of books about that.

I also feel like just being a rich jock who plays professional quidditch for the sheer fun of it is another viable career path. I don't really understand why he didn't do that in canon, because it's obviously the easiest job for him, he's incredibly qualified and has a fantastic pre-existing resume, and it's one of the few jobs where he could legitimately get into a really high level position purely on his own merits. If Harry is a genius at anything, it's flying. Flying and teaching. He could go pro, play until he gets bored, and then have sabbatical seasons where he works as a trainer. It would be fun for him, and I'm sure any pro team would pay out the nose to have */Harry Potter/* train */their team/* with the same quality teaching that Harry gave to the DA, which is */not/* a secret organization anymore by the end of the series and is actually quite famous.

**** Not correct. Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is who they send to hunt down and kill dangerous and high-profile criminals like Sirius Black or Bellatrix Lestrange. MLEP is Hit Wizards. Aurors just do arrests and investigate criminal cases, it's not explicitly their job to kill people.

Which means the correct analogy would mean that aurors are in fact the beat cops, while the MLEP is SWAT or military riot police.

The topic is confusing because technically speaking, we're never actually told what MLEP /does/. But we can infer what they do because we know their employees are called Hit Wizards, we know they only go after really dangerous people, and it is explicitly the job of aurors to investigate crimes and arrest people.

This problem is also muddied by the fact that aurors appear to do double duty as both beat cops and detectives. Private detectives don't seem to exist in Harry Potter, or at least magical Britain; all those jobs and positions are incorporated as government work under the MoM, and it's all apparently lumped under two offices: auror and MLEP, with the only real apparent difference being that the aurors will arrest you while MLEP will very violently arrest you.

This topic is also confusing because Rowling seems to forget that MLEP and Hit Wizards even exist. It's not really made clear how defunding the aurors specifically is some huge blow to the ministry by behind-the-scenes Voldemort. It would make more sense to defund the MLEP, who are the people who would actually stand a chance at arresting people like the Lestranges, Snape, or any other Death Eater that was competent with a wand. At some point, Rowling seems to just lump them all in as 'cops' in her mind, so I tend to do the same. There is largely very little difference between them.

Maybe that's the realism. It's two or three different departments, so they can get more money. Bureaucratic bloat. Pork barrel politics.

***** The MLEP does have hit-wizards on their payroll however it is stated in Ootp that the MLEP handles ordinary crimes as well. Aurors are stated in text to be elite.

****** Then Rowling is contradicting herself, because the Hit Wizards are described as the elite as well. I've further confirmed this by checking several canon sources: Hit Wizards are described as dealing with highly dangerous criminals and high risk combat operations, such as dark wizard killing, riot control, and hostage situations. A direct quote from Prisoner of Azkaban:

#+begin_quote
  "/Nobody but trained/ /Hit Wizards/ /from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered./"
#+end_quote

The aurors, by contrast, are described as "merely" existing to arrest (not kill) people and to solve crimes. However, contradictory to that, the Hit Wizards are far easier to get into: you only need 5 OWLs, with one OWL in Defense, whereas the aurors want five NEWTs, with at least two of those NEWTs being Defense and Potions.

The way Hit Wizards and aurors are described and compared with each other does not seem to be consistent across the various canon sources. My understanding of this is that aurors ARE beat cops, but somehow beat cops are more elite and have higher standards than SWAT in the magical world. Apparently. No, this doesn't really make sense.

I maintain this as further evidence that Rowling couldn't keep them straight.

******** Possibly. Given the way the two are portrayed, the only way I can really reconcile the contradiction would be to assume that the Hit Wizards are the magical equivalent of the military. That would explain why they have more dangerous problems on their job list, but also simultaneously have lower standards than the aurors. You do in fact have to be trained and educated to be in law enforcement, but they'll accept any idiot with a GED that can point a rifle barrel-end forwards into the army. That would explain away */most/* of these problems, except for one really big one.

That problem being that nobody gave a shit about the Hit Wizards and the MLEP when the */actual, literal war started./* It was auror this and auror that, while Hit Wizards vanished up their own asses and were never mentioned or relevant again. Not to mention that if they really were some kind of standing army of military police, that Voldemort and Lucius Malfoy would have cared a hell of a lot more about cutting their funding and sabotaging their training and recruitment than either would have about the aurors.

Them being the military would explain the apparent contradictions in how they're portrayed in contrast to the aurors. Wizards do crimes, call in the aurors, but dangerous wizards do the big crime, call back the aurors and send in the magical jarheads. But by the same token, they can't be the equivalent of the magical British military, because they never mattered during the war and were never treated as such. Aurors were the first, last, and only line of defense.

I continue to maintain that Rowling just clean forgot about the MLEP and Hit Wizards. She just forgot. That's my line and I'm sticking with it.

2. GOF Moody needed a cooler title and featured in the memories with the dark wizard chaser role and cool factor.

3. OOTP Moody and Tonks were being blocked at the Ministry so their job description was reduced, but also at career advice Auror is the elite.

Throughout you get scenes of Kingsley just being a bodyguard.

After that it seems we just don't care about it anymore, are Moody, Tonks etc even going to work? What do they do when no ministry? Then they die.

***** Not totally correct, law enforcement in Wizarding Britain as organized by the Department of Magical Enforcement can be described as such :

- the everyday law enforcement is the jurisdiction of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad later rebranded to Magical Law Enforcement Patrol. They are the equivalent of the police services in the UK. When the everyday law breaking is done by a high-profile the the arrest is done by Hit-Wizards or hit-Witches . While it isn't said anywhere we can speculate that they primarily serves the entire Department of Magical Law Enforcement as a generic task force which takes its assignments from its various many divisions, such as carrying out house raids on behalf of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, and while not participating in tracking down Dark Wizards, may help in direct confrontation with them with the goal of apprehending them. It is also possible that the 'Ministry official' who the Improper Use of Magic Office almost sent to destroy Harry Potter's wand before Dumbledore intervened would have been a member of the Patrol, since it is known that they are authorised to carry out arrests, while the Improper Use of Magic Office are only known to issue warning letters.

- the Hit Wizards and Hit-Witches are a specialized sub branch of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol that deals with crowd control and situation that needs tactics of brute force intervention or sheer numbers. They are the equivalent of the SWAT units in the US and the firearms tactical units in the UK with also equivalence in British SCO-19 in the metropolitan police or the SAS.

- Ministry of Magic Witch Watchers are a sub department law enforcement that deals with fugitives criminals.

- The Auror Forces are more of an elite force whose abilities went far beyond simply arresting suspects such as investigation, concealment and disguise, stealth and tracking, poisons and antidotes, etc., They are specialized in Dark Wizards and Dark Witches, like an counter intelligence agency that deals with traitors. They are also the only one allowed to investigate cases. As they are the only one allowed to investigate because the Ministry seems to assume every law breaking can have Dark elements.

As we can see the Sirius Black situation is within jurisdiction of several of those law enforcement divisions. Every Death Eater would be a cross juridiction of Witch Watchers if they escaped Azkaban, Auror Office as they are Dark Wizards and Hit Wizards of the Patrol.

By this we can infer the Ministry has no specialized forces for Law Breaking done by Light Wizards. Very black and white ideology.

She had Al March of 2006 meaning she conceived June of 05. So she couldn't have finished that season unless they didn't make playoffs or she would have to quit during playoffs.

Lily was Sept of 08. She conceived Dec of 07. I guess she could've tried to pay one more season 06/07, but it takes professional athletes a few months to get back in shape after birth. Plus with young kids at home it would've been very difficult for her to be competitive especially since younger people would be coming up in the sport.

The timeline just doesn't make sense to me. Someone who I believe would've cared about her sport wouldn't be getting pregnant during or around playoffs. She would've been on birth control so that wouldn't happen. None of this is written in the book, but is implied by the timeline above.
