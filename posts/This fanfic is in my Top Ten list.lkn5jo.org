[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13598559/1/Eyes-Wide-Shut][Eyes Wide Shut]] ~ /Of course Rose Weasley would be standing behind him when he insulted her. As a consequence for his rudeness, he has to complete 9 tasks "to get to know her better" or he's kicked off his Quidditch team./

It's sort of Scorose, but technically there isn't any in it. You can basically interpret it anyway you want.

While I was reading the first chapter, I was very confused.

/"Weasley was the opposite of Rennings utter confidence. She was blander - the nutmeg to Rennings cinnamon./

/Scorpius didn't like either holiday spice./

/It was a surprise she was even in class, Weasley skipped school all the time. She was a terrible student, she had no mind of her own, and followed Rennings every whim, fancy and notion."/

Usually when reading NextGen fanfiction, Rose is a totally different person. Kind of a recycled Hermione, which can I just say is horrible! But we're not here to talk about this, we're here to talk about this amazing, plot-twisting fic!

I swear I almost cried at the end of chapter. The outcome was very obvious, but the it happened made me cry.

I really recommend this fic if you like plot-twists, characters with depth, a good Quidditch plotline, and just an overall very well-written COMPLETE fic!!
