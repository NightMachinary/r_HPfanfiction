EDIT: If anyone is still reading this, HELP - I'm now stuck between Heather Potter or Sophia Potter, but am also considering Holly Potter JUST so I can give her a unicorn hair wand and make the joke that Harry's wand is Holly and Holly's wand is 'hairy'. . _.

Also thanks to everyone who responded so far and gave ideas, help, and opinions!

I'm writing a story (my first in awhile) involving Harry having a sister, and I'm struggling to find a name for her. I want something that 'fits', that's a little flowery or witchy, but I don't want to use one that's been beaten to death. Here's what I have so far:

- Daisy

- Iris

- Violet

- Marigold

- Jasmine

- Amaryllis

- Rose

- Holly

- Zinnia

- Clover

- Lavender

- Primrose

- Ivy

- Marnie

- Matilda

Now, Lavender and Amaryllis are kind of in there to use as a suggestion that someone discards, because Amaryllis is a bit much for a name (I think) and I can't figure a workable nickname for it. And Lavender won't be used because, of course, we have a Lavender in their year already. The rest though, I'm having trouble picking between. I feel like Rose is out because there will eventually be a Rose Weasley. I also feel like I've seen quite a few fics with a female Harry who was Jasmine, Iris, or Violet...and even one with a Zinnia, I think? So I don't want to use those if they're vastly overdone.

I haven't seen one with a Holly Potter before, but I feel like it's probably pretty common? Seeing as it's the closest to 'Harry' and matches with it well.

I really like Primrose, but don't know if it would sound too 'Hunger Games' or pull people out of the story any. I liked it as a name in general for a long time before The Hunger Games came along, so I don't really associate it with that - but I know a LOT of people do.

Marnie (Halloweentown) and Matilda are half a joke, half serious, as they're witchy names.

I'd have to say my top picks are Primrose, Violet, Holly, and Marnie - what do you all think? Which ones are used most and which are more unique? And is 'Primrose' too much?

Thanks in advance!


** I like flower names, but nothing too pretentious. Harry is a real commoner name, after all. "Primrose" is even too haughty for me. "Hyacinth" is right out. Fuck Hyacinths.

** Primrose brings to mind Hunger Games, but it isn't like you're using the character set up from there... although this would be the main character's little sister who will no doubt be put into danger.

Violet is another way to say Pansy, but it also has connotations for shyness. Then again, most people I've known with a 'meaningful' name have tended to embody the exact opposite. Depressed Hopes, greedy Charity's, a wild at heart Prudence (only met one, but the model fits).

So if you choose a flower name, do the right thing and make her act exactly wrong for it; as if Tonks' first name was Grace.

** I prefer "Holly Potter" because it sounds like Harry, isn't overly pretentious like a "Hadrian"-style name, and fits with her character in that her wand wood is usually holly, 90% of the time.

"Holly" is also the name of the fem!Harry in one of my favorite Harry genderbend fics. linkao3(13435224)

** I use "Holly." It sounds like "Harry," and it also sounds like something Lily Potter might have named her daughter. It's a fairly common name, unpretentious and approachable, like "Harry."

I think James and Lily, who named their son "Harry," would NOT have given their daughter a name like "Zinnia" or "Primrose" or "Hyacinth." Short, simple, unpretentious names sounds more their speed.

A lot of fics use "Harriet," but I'm not too fond of that... it's a bit of a posh name, more like an upper-class thing.

** I've seen Daisy, Rose, Mary, and Harriet. I've only seen Holly in short fics and parodies, nothing serious. Zinnia is right there with Amaryllis (Amy as a nickname btw, or Lis), and Marigold will be nicknamed Mary unless you really fight it. Matilda, Marnie (best pick of the three, not as mainstream), and Primrose (do not nickname her Prim) envoke other fandoms but that doesn't disqualify them as long as you're willing to put up with people thinking they are clever for finding all the other references to that fandom, whether they are there or not.

*** Harriet grates on my nerves, for reasons I really can't explain. It just seems...low effort? And they usually call her 'Harry' anyway.

I was laughing when considering Marigold and her chance to end up as Goldie Potter - funny if she's in Gryffindor, even funnier if she's not.

I've just checked, and Matilda (book) was published in 1988. So while it wouldn't be a reference at the time Harry and Sis were born, she'd probably get a bit of teasing for it in school (muggle and later Hogwarts)...Oops! As for Halloween town, it came out in 1998 - Sis would JUST escape the majority of teasing at school, though face some ribbing from peers, I'm sure.

I was initially going to go with a "person from our universe is born into HP universe and thus has 'future' knowledge" kind of plot (people probably hate them, I know they can be trope-y, but I figured it would be a somewhat easier type of story to start on and improve my writing with rather than just trying to jump in to something more unusual). I was considering Matilda and Marnie as names just so she could get a chuckle out of/be ticked off that she was a witch named after a popular fictional witch in her own time/universe.

** I've read stories with Fem Harry or Harry's sister with the name Holly or Hailey (various spellings).

Daisy seems to be common fanfic lore for Dudley Dursley's Daughter's name---Daisy Dursley. (Which cringe I've never been a fan of either.) I have read a few Poppy Dursley---younger sis to Daisy...

What about Heather for a flower name? The flower heather, looks like a pink version of lavender. Also it flows with the flower theme but is more subtle... when I hear the name I don't automatically think of the flower. Harry and Heather Potter is a good mix for sticking with the H---if thats what you're looking for.

Another option would be to pick a “regular” non-flower name and maybe make her middle name the flower. Perhaps Lily liked the flower tradition but couldn't imagine putting one of her children through the ringer with the options. Someone in the fam could use her flower as a nickname/teaser.

Otherwise, of the options you listed I'm partial to Marnie. I don't automatically think Halloween town, so it's more subtle to use then Primrose (automatically think Hunger Games) would be. Marnie Potter flows nicely.

I like the name Emily, it's a little simple, but has a nice ring to it: Emily Potter. (Though I'm also guilty at using Holly for a female Harry, or a sister of Harry's).

Eliza or Elizabeth could be a fun name as well; with using a couple of different shortened ways to do it. Especially if you don't want to do the flower name.

Olivia Potter is pretty different and not one that I really see.

Allison Potter is kind of nice.
