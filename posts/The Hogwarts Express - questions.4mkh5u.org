What else is the train used for? Where is it stored for most of the year? Does it just sit at the Hogsmeade Station from Sept 1st to the winter holiday? If Harry just put on his invisibility cloak and didn't leave the train when it got to King's Cross for the summer break, where would he end up?

I have no idea why all this suddenly occurred to me. The last part came first. Anyone writing a "Harry escapes control" fic is welcome to it. But seriously, staying on the train and then leaving from the storage facility (or from King's Cross several hours later) seems much easier than evading or confronting the Order/Dumbledore at the station.


** There was a great bit at the end of linkffn(Forging the Sword) where it was used like the Beauxbatons Carriages and the Durmstrang Ship. I thought that was the most fitting way I've ever seen it used in a story and my favourite train use by far.

** Given that Hogwarts is an isolated castle in Scotland and food can't be conjured up, I think it's a supply train most of the time: transporting food and other goods from London to Hogsmeade, along with some people who can't or won't floo/apparate/fly.

*** Food may not be conjured wholesale but it can be summoned from elsewhere, flown, apparated, flooed... and most importantly, procured from settlements closer to the school that a city on the other end of the country.

** As far as I know, no official word from JKR has ever been given on it. However there are plenty of rumors. I had come up with a thought myself back when I was first reading the books, and recently saw a similar version of my thought in a FF, but for the life of me cant remember the FF name. But here is what I had thought then, although I am sure others have thought similar things. It just seems the most reasonable explanation in my view.

--------------

Basically at one time the train was used heavily to bring supplies and people who could not use other travel means (either due to costs, skill/ability, or other such things) too and from Hogwarts/Hogsmeade and London, stopping at a few other magical villages and locations along the way as well. Before the train there may of simply been a dirt road used as a caravan route. The train was just the latest updated means of travel on that route.

However, as time went by other means of travel either became cheaper or easier (floo powder costs dropping for example, or perhaps more relaxed restrictions on port keys). In addition more modern ways to travel for witches and wizards who flitted between the muggle and magical worlds came into being, such as cars and trucks which began replacing train travel for some.

While the train still would run, it ran less often as the years passed. Then came the years of Grindelwald and then Voldemort and as the wars tore the country apart, many of the magical villages along its route ceased to exist, and less and less people were traveling in the open or at all. Soon the train only became useful for bringing children too and from the school and perhaps the occasional supply run if other magical means were not an option.

It now stands as simply a reminder of the past, and as a gateway and adventure for excited students and almost exclusively operates for school travel only.

When not running, its stored at platform 9 3/4 and its upkeep is payed for by Hogwarts funds. It may one day be retired but certainly not by Dumbledore or anyone with a similar mindset. Those who operate the train or serve on it for the few times it runs these days, are contracted from various shops and businesses (such as the snack cart lady who is contracted through Honeydukes).

--------------

TL;DR - Used to run more often. Changing times and wars has made that no longer viable. It now operates more as a nostalgic feature for Hogwarts, and adventure for students and is simply maintained at platform 9 3/4 when not in use.

** I've seen fics where it's used regularly, and Hogsmeade is only one stop. And fics where it's closed up and doesn't run at all, except when needed for Hogwarts. I don't know that it really says anything canon-wise, though?

If anyone ends up writing Summer on the Hogwarts Express, then please let me know.

In terms of what it is actually used for other than the few days a year it is required to transport students I have no idea, but I hope that it is used regularly somewhere in the Potter universe, it would be a shame for it just to sit there.

** Its my bit of made up lore that the Hogwarts Express is merely one of many wizarding trains throughout Europe. The Hogwarts Express is actually chartered for this reason, the rest of the year, its purpose is to transport wizards and witches over national borders because portkey laws... or something. It was a minor part of a barely thought out concept for a fic.

** I think it was mentioned in one of the books that it runs every day for people who don't apparate or floo, so they can get to the Diagon Alley.

Or was that in one of the fics? Regardless, that's my headcanon.
