not looking for a smutty fic, just a good story where the romance (which doesn't have to be the focus) is between two female characters. not into stories about professor/ student relationships, or stories set in marauder era.

** *Call Me Moriarty*, linkffn(11602420): this fem!Harry was very dark, but also in love with Hermione. She appeared overpowered, but the plot is really fun.

*Here and There*, linkffn(7525570): Hermione/Ginny. It would have been great if the author hadn't blown the last few chapters.

*Murder Most Horrid*, linkffn(10099028): Bellatrix/Hermione. This AU had no Voldemort, although some canon bad guys were still bad, and there were new bad guys.

** Those Gilded Chains We Wear: linkffn(7755315), surprised it hasn't been mentioned yet, but probably *the* Bellamione story. Breathes depth and life into the character of Bellatrix Lestrange in ways you probably didn't think were possible. If you think Bellamione is a crack pairing that could never work... give this one a shot. It may surprise you.

The Dark Corners of the Earth: linkffn(11448506). A blending of femslash romance with mystery, politics and action. Lovecraftian, but not drearily so, and the ending made me cry a little.

Entwined: linkffn(6507212), a sweet, fluffy, and quite touching Fleur/Hermione story set during 4th year. Doesn't go overboard with Veela fanfic cliches, and cleanly written if memory serves.

Skirmish: linkffn(11775327). Just plain adorable, if prickly and initially awkward, romance. Not that you'd expect anything less from Hermione and Narcissa, I guess.

I've basically read most of the HP femslash fics on ffn with over 30k words, I've just forgotten which ones were especially good, apart from my obvious favourites. Will post more when I can remember.

** linkffn(A Butterfly Effect) is IMO not only a femslash story with a great story, it's also one of the most interesting fics out there. It follows the canon plotline pretty closely BUT as if the HP books had all been written for a mature audience. For instance, the author makes Quirell completely terrifying. I can't reccomend it enough. The only downside is probably that we have no idea if it will ever get finished.

** If you're willing to do an archive trawl, try here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/7/0/20/0/0/]]

It's not particularly picky (only criterion being HP femslash) but it does collate the stories into one area, regardless of pairing, which is nice when you're just generally looking for femslash. Since you're not into prof/student stuff, stay away from the HG/MM pairing, and keep an eye on the Fleurmione summaries (a common plot device is 'Hermione returns to complete 7th year. Fleur lands job as DADA prof. Sweetness/kinks ensue.') Otherwise, you should be fine, so long as you're willing to look through for the stuff you actually want. Marauder era femslash is pretty rare, afaik... generally just weird timetravel plots involving Narcissa or Bellatrix, in my experience :P
