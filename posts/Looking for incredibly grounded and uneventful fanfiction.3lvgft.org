My favorite parts of the series have always been the everyday life. I LOVE to read about the characters complaining about homework, studying for an exam, sending an owl etc. I suppose I just like to dream myself away to Hogwarts.

I'm looking for recommendations of uneventful fanfiction. The less plot the better. Would prefer it to be exclusively characters from Rowling's books, but I'm open to other suggestions too. Obviously good writing skills is a big plus.

I hardly know anything about fanfics, so maybe this is a ridiculous thing to ask for, just figured I'd give it a shot.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** Slice of life, fluffy fics are a weakness of mine as well. Unfortunately, their summaries are usually less than eye-catching ... as a result, most of the stories I read have excitement in some way. The closest fic I liked is /Session Transcripts/ by lastcrazyhorn. Character-centric, and follows interactions of students in Hogwarts.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.

** Read anything by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=168043][Celestie]]! She writes a lot of eras and genres, so you can pick as you like (most are complete; I personally like her next gens). Most of her stories are funny/melancholy slice-of-lifes.

  My take on the Slytherin!Harry genre. What if Harry's less-than-happy childhood had left him more jaded than canon? No pairings, and you won't find any eleven year olds talking as if they were at a Renaissance fair here either.
