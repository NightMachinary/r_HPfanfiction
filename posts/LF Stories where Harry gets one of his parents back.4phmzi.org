** Marauders of the Mind comes to...um...mind. Basically Lily, James, Sirus, and I think Remus all get stuck in Harry's brain and he has to get them new bodies. Its Post DH and isn't finished yet. My description sucks but the story was good.

There was another one where Lily and James didn't actually die. They went into hiding but Harry still lived with the Dursleys and didn't know they lived. Post OotP story. That one was finished. Can't remember the name of that one.

*** I loved the concept of this and enjoyed reading it, but couldn't stand the characterisations of the Marauders :( There was something really off about how open they were with Harry.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

**** It doesn't make a big deal out of it like most do. This fic focuses on Harry and his story, not Neville and the prophecy. Trust me, I have a similar hate towards WBWL. This story ignores it entirely.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
