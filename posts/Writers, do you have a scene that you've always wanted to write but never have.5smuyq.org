** I've always wanted to write a scene that's conceptually similar to the Person of Interest episode 'If-Then-Else' which uses the characters in a number of simulations that are the same set of events, except the characters deal with them in different ways each time. I haven't written it yet, but I have plans to hopefully do it soon.

** Ive always wanted to write a scene where Harry breaks down and cries after the war. Everytime I attempt to write the scene its not emotional enough. I want Harry to mourn like he never could have, I want him to cry for the past, and slowly stand up... I... I just dont have the skill to convey that to the audience yet. (if one looks at my ffn profile, you will notice that my work is terrible lol)

** HPxStarcraft crossover. Harry stumbles upon one of the three great ships of the Protoss (like the [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/8/8c/SpearOfAdun_LotV_Art1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141112130258][Spear of Adun]]). Thought lost in the Fall of Aiur, the Pride of Altaris lies where it crashed after its flight from the Protoss homeworld. Harry enters it with the small magical space-vessel they built and finds the crew on it. The scene between him and the Preserver on it is something I always wanted to write, but every time I try it, the sheer implication of the scene is a bit too much and I loose focus in between exposition and dialogue.

Though writing this comment I think its time to once more try it.

*** In Utter Darkness with Harry Potter manning the Protoss defences.\\
Harry's job is solely to fight the omegalisks with battle magic, fiendfyre, something like Groudon's precipice blades, tornadoes. Instead of slowly being choked to death, the defence holds until the zerg armies are bled dry and the nydus canal destroyed.

** 1. Molly Weasley in her prime as an assassin like Mary Watson's backstory from Sherlock.\\
2. The fight between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, a fight spanning and entire chapter that doesn't tell, but shows. No talk except the introduction.\\
3. A scene where Harry sees magic as music and whips up battle magic like an orchestra conductor.\\
4. Harry mano-a-mano-ing Voldemort as an equal. Again, show, not tell.\\
   Lots of transfiguration. eg. rain, turn the droplets into white hot glass, merge the glass pieces into a golem, turn the slush into quicksand and trap the golem, banish its head, summon a lion with a gaping giant maw to eat the head, icicle spears, tree leaves into mini shields, call lightning strikes from the skies, etc.\\
   If only I could put what's in my head into words.
