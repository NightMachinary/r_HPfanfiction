Hermione's paranoid lecture in PoA is just a bunch of old wives' tales about time travel, because books are /never/ wrong, right? I've read a lot of time travel fics where Harry and/or company are terrified of being found out, because /of course/ the secretive research division of the Ministry is made up of evil, faceless a-holes who want to dissect everything, and have no issues about going all MK Ultra on time travellers/dimension hoppers/people with unique magical abilities, etc ad nauseum. I'd like to see a reversal of this trope, where the DoM is like any true science division; they've seen a lot of weird ****, and Harry's multi-magical-animagus/super-accurate Seer/Time travel apparition barely scratches the surface.


** "Oh no, it's the Unspeakables!"

Is what any time traveller, without exception, would say once they were collected. This one was no exception.

They had, of course, detected his arrival. It happened relatively often, time travel that is, and it was mostly accidental. Sands of time were a journeyman-level alchemy transmutation after all, and any chronometric casing could theoretically leverage them into a temporal displacement field. Many people accidentally flung themselves into the past because they liked the way Sands of Time flowed upwards, enchanted an hourglass of the stuff to turn itself and then accidentally touched it after it built up enough charge.

So they had built an antenna. A massive reciever underneath the DoM, which detected and triangulated all time travel within the hemisphere centered on it. Another sat in New Zealand, covering the rest of the planet. They'd been seriously considering a Moon array, but that was deemed slightly over budget. Portals with that sort of inner length were a bit on the expensive side.

So a mosquito with a control enchant and a portkey band was dispatched to his location, landed on his back and ported him with it back to the DoM about 2 seconds after his arrival. With a small cleanup team, the Butterfly Effect would be minimized.

"So, why did you decide to visit our time, Mr. Potter?"

"I'm afraid I can't say. It might change the future."

"We're very well versed on the effects of time travel. And you just revealed to us that you are from the future."

--------------

"Accidental or deliberate?"

"Deliberate. But I had a good reason!"

"Of course you did. Noone sane would time travel to the past for the fun of it."

"What about historians?"

"Didn't I say sane?"

--------------

"What is the method you used?"

"Time Turner, with the Portkey enchantment and a sacrifice as the power source."

The unremarkable figure looked up.

"It was a bad guy."

"Understandable."

--------------

"Alright, that would be it. Are you sure you don't want to return to your native Timeline?" a wince. "Or maybe another one?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, we here at the DoM monitor the timelines, of course. Your answers, coupled with your unique temporal signature allowed us to pin down the timeline you've originated in. It looks like in that one, Lord Voldemort is resurrected, takes over the magical world, then makes the muggles destroy each other and fails to develop anti-radiation charms in time to prevent the sterilisation of all remaining wizards. They slowly die out, and after that it gets fuzzy, because our methods anchor themselves by humanity. All we can say is that there's something in the far future that can also use magic, and that it has some piece of humanity in it."

"Well yes, that's what I'm here to change. I will defeat Voldemort before he resurrects and prevent all of that from happening!"

"That's not how any of this works. You can only change things because an infinite amount of timelines exist. You will simply stabilize yourself into one where your changes are carried over, but your original timeline keeps going, only you disappeared."

"Well shit."

*** I love it!

The last part reminds me of a bit of an idea I had myself where Hermione (for "research purposes" or something) goes into the past to do whatever but fucks up critical events and lands in an alternate (bad) future. She sets out to help the future because she feels bad about having caused its existence -- even if nothing stops her from just going back (because that wouldn't actually remove the future, only her from it) -- and only after having saved the alternate world, goes back and tries to return to where she came from originally.

** Like actual scientists, they become more concerned with the grant implications. One scientist, finding his ideas and work to go largely unnoticed by the scientific community (because they're bad) takes it upon himself to write fanfiction of a popular work to help spread his ideas...
