especially looking for Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, never read it but I would like to give it a go (preferably in audio on the go)

**** Overly grimdark, pretends to be canon-compliant when it is not, portions of the plot is completely nonsensical, characterization is atrocious and was used by a psycho to start a /literal/ cult. [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] knows more about that than I do.

***** Yeah, I'm wary of coming across like I've got a chip on my shoulder so I won't go on about it too much but all the weird gratuitous violence, racism, sexism and silly melodrama should be red flags for people that the author isn't quite right. And then you Google him and you're like "oh, wow, yeah he's a psycho implicated in an actual murder."

** [[http://archive.org/search.php?query=MuggleNet+Fan+Fiction+Audiofictions&sort=-date&page=2]]

This is the archive with their episodes. It's not a single story but they read one shots or go through an entire story in several episodes. Makes it rather hard to find things, but everything they do read is really well written.

** I agree with Yargle, it's pretty bad.

I can, however, link you to the /DEFINITIVE/ fic for DH, canon-compliant fanfiction.
