Oh lord I have been flipping through all of ff.net trying to find it, but I really just can't. So here I am on reddit; please tell me if this is in the wrong section and I will delete it!

I'm looking for a fem!Harry TMR/HP magical AU that focuses more on the side of propriety; aka it reminds me of a Jane Austen novel. fem!Harry was called "Hazel" this time around (I think), and TMR was a diplomat of the title Lord Slytherin.

It was a pretty short fic last I remembered; definitely completed. TMR leaves his job at some island to go back to Britain when HP comes into majority. They meet, play chess, flirt and all those shenanigans. Also, HP's parents are different (James married a pureblood witch instead of Lily), so that's why there's a focus on pureblood society.

She also has a younger brother who gets together with a Malfoy. Said Malfoy is a "matchmaker" or something, and it turns out the daughter/son of HP/TMR and HP's brother/Miss Malfoy are the reincarnations of Merlin and Morgana. That was toward the end though; not much of a big deal was made out of it.

Well, obviously TMR&HP end up getting married at some point and I think the fic ends on some line like "Because you called to me".

It was well written, I think in ff.net, under a collaboration account shared with two people. I have no idea why I'm craving to reread it again, but here I am ./shrug. IMO it was a really good fem!Harry if you were just looking to sit down and drown yourself in romance, fluff, and happy endings for a bit before getting back to adventure, angst, and the usual LVHP.

Thanks in advance!


** Name was Haesel, not Hazel. Here you go! [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28720]]

*** Thanks for the correction! I figured it was something like that; gah, too many fem!Harry names mixing up in my head.

** I'm pretty sure you're talking about Of Power and Prestige. It was taken off ff.net, but [[https://saelethil.wordpress.com/of-power-and-prestige/][here]] it is on wordpress.

*** Ahh thank you! No wonder I couldn't find it if they took it off ff.net...even with its horrible search system, I still thought I could find something.
