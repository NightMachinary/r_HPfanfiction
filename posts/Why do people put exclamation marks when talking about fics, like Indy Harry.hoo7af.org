*** Oh, interesting. I always thought it was to do with the code for tagging. I assumed that a space between early tags made it difficult to search them.

** For a bit of history, the explanation I've seen most commonly is it came from the X-Files fandom.

#+begin_quote
  The adj!noun format is purported to have started in X-Files fandom. Good examples for this are Wombat's Spotter's Guide to the Common Krycek and the accompanying Spotter's Guide to the Common Mulder where several Krycek sub-species such as Bad to the Bone!Krycek, Bad but Lovin'!Krycek, Hot'n'dirty!Krycek or Misunderstood!Krycek and Mulder sub-subspecies such as Angst!Mulder, Basketcase!Mulder, HappySlut!Mulder, Sensitive!Mulder and WellAdjusted!Mulder are described. The first usage was Action!Mulder, referring to canon scenes where Mulder suddenly went all actiony (instead of talky), followed by Saint!Scully. Eventually they lost the initial capitals and the canon connections; by the time it hit other fandoms, it was being used to describe fannish things.[4]

There's other conflicting answers out there but I tend to believe this one.

*** The other one that makes sense to me is early tagging systems that didn't allow spaces, so ! Was used to keep it all in one tag

Not mutually exclusive with this for the most part either

** I don't know from where using an exclamation mark came from but I do know that it is a fairly old convention (probably over 7 -10 years) and that it is quite commonly used in the fanfiction community.

It's usage is pretty self explanatory, ie it is used to describe the main quality of a character like Indy!Harry and Manipulative!Dumbledore which are the common trope of having an independent Harry who is under no one's control and Dumbledore who constantly manipulates characters for his own selfish needs respectively.

*** Saying 7-10 years makes it fairly old makes /me/ feel fairly old! I assure you this has been used far longer than a decade in fandom. I saw it being used 15 years ago and it was nothing new even then.

*** People have been using characters like ! as delimiters (things to separate items like words) since at least when DOS came out with their 8.3 filename system. I was there for that. I was in single digits, but I was there.

** Huh...well, it's something of a convention. Indy!Harry means that the fic has Harry characterized as independent...which in this fandom means he'll go to Gringotts on his own, discover a whole bunch of inheritances, and tell Dumbledore to get stuffed.\\
Super!Harry is a Harry who's got ridiculously powerful magic or some other special abilities, Dark!Harry is a Harry who does things in an eeeevil way, and Dark!Indy!Super!Harry is...well, have a guess.\\
 \\
So, basically, it's a signpost saying 'Watch out for these plot elements and this characterization of Harry', though it can apply to other characters as well (Super!Hermione, perhaps?).\\
Funny thing, though. Now that you ask? I don't know how the convention came about. 'Tis a historical mystery!

** If I'm not mistaken it is to separate more clearly the trope from the name of the character. Like; never actually saw it happening, but I suppose it's technically possible; if a tropes name ends in a letter that when put before a character's name turns it in the name of other character, or to just make it easier to see what tropes are used in which character in the case that there are many. Not sure why the ‘!', but I suppose that it doesn't make a difference, would be the same if the convention was ‘$' or any other symbol I guess.

** I remember seeing this about 15 years ago to specifically indicate satire/crackfic that takes tropes to the extreme (ya know, EXTREME!). The one vivid in my memory is over at WIKTT with the SexGod!Snape and Virgin!Hermione trope. Like many trends there, it started leaking out beyond the HGSS ship, and somewhere along the line it became a more general purpose indicator of certain character themes.

Or maybe it started somewhere else, IDK that's just when I remember seeing it for the first time :)

** I don't know why, but it's basically a warning I think.

Ex:

Fem!Harry

Dark!Sirius

Manipulative!Dumbledore

Redeemed!Snape

Good!Draco

Ect.

It's used to show something about a character that certain people might not want to read, or just an aspect of that character. It also allows easy ways to either block a tag, or search by a tag.
