"Stunning Spell" vs "stunning spell"

"Bubble-Head Charm" vs "bubblehead charm"

"Killing Curse" vs "killing curse"

Which do you prefer as a writer or a reader?

The first version is obviously more in line with canon, but it sometimes results in odd sentences with lots and lots of capital letters.


** Well, it's all about the /specificity./ A "stunning spell" /without/ capitalization could just as easily refer to *a* spell that puts you to sleep or *a* spell that temporarily dazes you or *a* spell that makes you gaze uncontrollably at your own navel--but, if you say "Stunning Spell" /with/ capitalization, there's absolutely /zero/ chance of mistaking that you mean *the* spell with the incantation /Stupefy./

** I also prefer the incantation capitalized. Otherwise not, like...

"Harry hit him with a Stupefy!" "Harry hit him with a stunner!" "Harry hit him with a stunning spell!"

*** I can't help but read all three of those as "Harry used Stupefy. It's not very effective" and I've never even played Pokemon. Oh imgur wallpaper posts, what have you done to me?

** I consider spell names to be proper nouns and as such requiring capitals, with exceptions being the generalisations [[/u/ToaKraka]] mentioned.

** I typically capitalize the word if I mean the specific spell (e.g. "Voldemort used the Killing Curse").

But if it's the name of the spell and the incantation, I go with book rules and write the thing in italics (e.g. "/Wingardium Leviosa/!" said Harry).

But if I'm not specific, or it's just in passing, I won't do anything (e.g. Harry sent a stunning spell in that direction).

** I capitalise almost everything spell-related. It's sort-of overboard if you're trying to conform to canon, yeah, but "I'm finna /Hex/ yo' ass" just reads better than the alternative to me.

That's not an excerpt, just to clarify.

** I think it depends on the spell.
