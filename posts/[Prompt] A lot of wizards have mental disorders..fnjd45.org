For example, Ron Weasley's inability to focus on classes and how he sometimes talks before thinking about the consequences (like the Hermione Troll incident) isn't because he's stupid but it's because he's got ADHD, or Hermione's need to be called on in class and show off her knowledge is because she's got approval addiction and her need to learn new things all the time is because she has obsessive learning disorder.


** Lead poisoning, anyone? They brew potions in pewter cauldrons, and their general ignorance of science and news from the Muggle world means that the Muggle-borns are probably about the only ones aware of the fact that lead is toxic. They might even use pewter cooking vessels for their food, and Hogwarts has indoor plumbing, some of which could well be made of lead.

Now, ordinarily, lead water pipes can develop a coating of mineral deposits on their inner surface that acts as a barrier and stops further lead leaching into the water. On the other hand, what if some well-meaning wizard charmed the pipes at Hogwarts to clean themselves?

Lead poisoning in children can cause behavioral problems, learning disabilities, and reduced IQ; could this be why so many of the Purebloods act the way they do?

** I agree being a kid is a mental disorder.

Kids often do stupid shit. Kids are often brutal in how honest they can be they do not have a filter yet, as for ron insulting hermione you have to remember she had been annoying ron and harry for weeks by that point and ron responded as kids respond

#+begin_quote
  It's 1991, and eight newly Sorted wizards and witches are about to start their first night in House Hufflepuff. There'll be singing and camaraderie and macaroons and only a little bit of screaming. Arguably AU.
