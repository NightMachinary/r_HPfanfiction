** The idea that Snape's main reasoning behind being horrible to Harry to strengthen his relationship with Voldemort and his death eaters is a farce.

To say that Harry is treated "horribly" is true. But so are all his other classmates. Everybody in Gryffindor is treated badly by Snape. Neville Longbottom never does anything to provoke Snape other than his "sub-par potions ability" and always takes the heat but never stokes the flame. Many times Harry pushes Snape to react and Snape shows restraint by not completely dressing him down. (See Page 171 of the Half Blood Prince, being one of my favourite moments in the whole series.)

Come to think of it, everybody Snape meets he insults in one way or another, even the woman he loved most he insults even if he comes to regret it later on.

Lets not beat around the bush here, Voldemort isn't a very nice man and neither are his Death Eaters. If i was looking to give somebody brownie points, it wouldn't be for putting down an 11-16 year old boy with degrading remarks. If he was really trying to get in Voldemort's good books and still maintain his position on the "light side" he could have done a lot more. For example he could have actually helped Voldemort regain his body. He must have felt his Dark Mark going haywire when Quirrelmort was walking around the school. If his return was inevitable why not put himself at his right-hand from book 1? He could have maintain his position as a spy whilst doing so but he seeks to stop Quirrel instead which is totally contrary.

No the reason you might think Harry is treated with particular distain is nothing to do with Dark or Light affiliations, it is purely because Harry is the son of James Potter and, apart from the eyes, we're told so many times he resembles his father. In the Order of the Pheonix when Harry views Snapes most hated memories of being bullied by James and Sirius, during the event he lashes out at Lily causing Snape and Lily to part ways as friends. Snape views that as one of the lowest points in his life and blames James Potter. He blames James for taking away the woman he loved by causing him to lash out in temper after she defends him and he loses her forever. Nothing is worse than unrequited love and Snape lays the blame on James Potter, who by the way was also in the wrong in the memory and yet that is forgotten to Lily, as she looks past the bully that is James and loves him over her long-time friend Snape. Harry is a spawn of the man he hates most and a reminder of what he could have had with Lily but doesn't due to a momentary lapse in his cool demeanor and is treated thusly.

**** Interesting that you suggest that treating Harry so poorly would be a good way to show Voldemort that he doesn't feel affection for the boy. That doesn't seem useful to me, sure it might make Harry feel down for a while but imagine the possibilities of befriending the boy, becoming a mentor. The access and the trust he could have attained from the Boy-Who-Lived would have been even more in Voldemort's favour. If it was Dumbledore's plan to delay the return of the Dark Lord to his corporeal form then there would have been no risk to either party because Snape is doing his bit to infiltrate the Order of the Phoenix in Voldemort's eye and getting close to Harry to build a relationship that can be exploited whilst in the Order's eyes he's doing his best by Harry for betraying his parents ultimately leading to their demise and his orphanhood. But i digress.

You allude to the chapter in the last book known as the Prince's Tale. During this chapter, in private with only Dumbledore in the room, Snape really digs into Harry and his character which Dumbledore swiftly dismisses as untrue and the manifestation of Snape's hatred for James Potter being transferred over to Harry. Even later on in the chapter during the events of the Half-blood Prince he refers to Harry as "his father over again". This is the reason he treats Harry badly. There is no advantage to be gained over petty squabbles. Snape is just unable to prevent himself from dropping snide remarks around a Potter male. He might not /hate/ Harry at that point but he sure doesn't like him.

** [[/u/f1ourish]] [[/u/hugggybear]]

I'm assuming the position FOR or AGAINST was decided by the organizer of the event. What position would you take if faced with this prompt now?

*** You're correct in saying we were assigned our stances.

I think I'd still stick with against. In my mind his childhood days at Hogwarts left him scarred and his intense dislike of Harry is genuine even if James is the cause, the name calling basically continues from where he and James left it. He is helping Lilly Potter not Harry Potter.

**** I feel like those couple statements got your point across much better than the paragraphs before. Not because it didn't make sense, I just felt like you started arguing from a different position (He's not gaining favor from Voldemort because he's insulting everyone not just Harry.) during the debate.

***** If that's the case thanks for asking the question. I'm glad I found a way to come across more concisely. ðŸ˜Š

Although I stand by the point that he wasn't insulting Harry to gain favour with Voldemort and his Death Eaters. He was just a bitter man who did pick on everybody. Harry gets more heat for being James Potters spawn is all.

**** I think you missed one critical argument which knocks down the entire "Snape did it to maintain his position" argument. Simply: that behavior is the exact opposite of how a spy should behave.

Yes, Dumbledore needed Snape to be able to return to Voldemort. But why was Snape with Dumbledore? To spy on him. For that excuse to work, Voldemort would need to believe that Snape was spying on Dumbledore while patiently waiting for his "true" master to return.

How does a spy act? By ingratiating himself with everyone else. The best spies are the ones that everyone later says they never suspected. The spy you suspect has, by definition, failed already. But everyone hates Snape. He's the first one everyone suspects. If Hitler sent a spy to Churchill's staff, would he be happy to learn that this person was goosestepping around and making anti-Semitic slurs? Not hardly.

So how does he convince Voldemort that he never truly renounced his master (i.e., he was really bad) /and/ was only spying all that time (i.e., he was only pretending to be good)? By being a Slytherin! He wears one mask during the day, where he is nice, friendly, says all the right things, and grudgingly helps Dumbledore's golden boy (it has to be grudging - he hated James). At night, though, he lets the "truth" slip to select, trustworthy Slytherin students while helping them. By day he treats everyone fairly; at night he gives the Slytherin students a leg up, like with extra potions or defense tutoring. He favors the children of his "true" master's servants /in secret/, not in public. He bides his time, making preparations for his Master.

Swooping around like a great bat while being painfully obvious about your favoritism and attitudes is about as far from "cunning" as you can get.

Unless, of course, Voldemort is a complete and utter moron who doesn't realize that Snape's behavior isn't how a spy should act. This is plausible given Voldemort's failure to be concerned or to tell Snape to start doing things correctly after the graveyard ritual.

***** Is this directed at me or f1ourish?

I do agree with you it isn't very cunning and I do briefly mention that befriending Harry would have opened more doors for him.

But his intense dislike of James is probably what prevents him from doing so, even pretending to like a Potter male is too much for Snape. He swears Dumbledore to secrecy on him doing his part to keep Harry alive.

*** You make some good points, the only way i can think of drawing up a suitable rebuttal is to tackle them all;

1) I touched on this in my opening statement, one can only assume Quirrel didn't tell Snape about the other being on the back of his head. But Dumbledore must have briefed the staff on why they were protecting the stone, who was likely to be coming after it and that the challenges were only meant to slow Voldemort down so that Dumbledore could face him at the mirror. Otherwise why not make it a labyrinth of lethality at every turn rather than some kind of warped obstacle course. Also Snape is branded with the Dark Mark, an honor for the Death Eaters they're not handed out willy-nilly. We're lead to believe that its powerful magic and burns when Voldemort is summoning you or are in his presence. At any rate Snape certainly comes across here as Dumbledore's man who harbours a grudge towards the Potters and not a man loyal to Voldemort.

2) Given Snape's history with Sirius and James he must have been one of the few people who believed Sirius would never betray James. Their time at school together would have solidified a hatred of Sirius black . In the POA in the Shrieking Shack the exchange between Lupin, Sirius and Snape seems to me like he'd love to put the marauders away innocent or not but i guess that is in the eye of the reader. (Chapter 19 in POA for anybody interested.) Being forced to work with one of the marauders all year must have sucked for Snape. Harry and the rest of Gryffindor house was probably a very good outlet for stress for a life long Slytherin.

3) J.K. Rowling leaves no room for doubt that Karkaroff sold out his Death Eater associates to evade a long prison sentence. Snape plays him like a harp through the whole book, Karkaroff comes whimpering asking Snape what he's going to do if the Mark burns again. He's trying to save his own skin, not report back. No Snape just hates Harry's presence and continues to be a bitter man.

4) This is the same issue, everybody in Gryffindor was treated badly and Snape still has no desire to treat him any differently, they may be on the same side but they're not friends. Snape isn't particularly fond of Umbridge [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGMTl0zsawc][either.]]

5) Your arguments seem to be based around Snape wanting to change and treat Harry differently. Snape doesn't like Harry. He seems him as a reincarnation of James Potter sent back to haunt him. Wanting to defeat Voldemort the killer of Lilly Potter isn't the same as wanting to help Harry Potter, the boy who lived. It is an unfortunate means to an end for Snape.

6) His hate for Harry is real. He doesn't care for Harry Potter, he cares for Lilly Evans.

#+begin_quote
  "I have spied for you, and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter --" "But this is touching, Severus," said Dumbledore seriously. "Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?" "For /him/? shouted Snape. "Expecto Patronum!"
#+end_quote

To keep Lilly Potters son safe. Not Harry or the Potters son, but Lilly's child. The way Lilly forgave James for bullying to me imply's it is forgivable and so Snape takes out his smoldering hatred for James Potter on Harry with his words and trivial punishments but his love for Lilly Potter leads him to protect Harry Potter with his actions and ultimately his sacrifice.

** I feel like a better argument FOR the resolution would have been to say that you agree with the [[/u/hugggybear]] statement where they say that snape treated everyone bad, but he was doing this to further his position with the slytherins, a high percent of which turn out to be death eaters, COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!, but seriously using that as an additional counter argument would have added to your own.

I also think that a counter argument for his second point would have been, just because he is trying to gain favor doesn't mean he likes voldemort or his death eaters or want them back on top creating mischief and chaos. You could have also made the argument that Snape was a survivor of some sort or that he was actually light, but was a realist and went with what he knew would bring the best outcome.

As for your own arguements, I think a shitty, but fun, argument in favor of the statement above, would have been that, yes he did sense that volemort was back with quirelle and yes I do think that he treated harry wrongly as a way of gaining favor, but he did so in a way that many might not think to think about. He did it by preparing for the day he would have to bully harry potter by brainwashing himself into becoming a shitty person through bullying every student, other than slytherins, that comes through his door. Therefore he would be treating everyone thats not a slytherin the same, but he started this whole debacle so that The only real purpose of this argument is to try and throw a wrench into the other persons plan.
