I don't mean the speech he gave in ootp. I mean his mistakes when it came to Tom. Everything from the introduction at the orphanage to not curtailing his actions during his school years. To sending him back to the orphanage during the blitz Because truthfully while I don't see Tom ever being a good person I don't believe he was evil at the age of eleven.

Sorry to disappoint you, but:

  She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the other children.”

  “You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.

  “I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it's very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things . . .”

  Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.

  “Billy Stubbs's rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn't do it and I don't see how he could have done, but even so, it didn't hang itself from the rafters, did it?”

  “I shouldn't think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly.

  “But I'm jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then” --- Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time --- “on the summer outing --- we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside --- well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that they'd gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they'd just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I'm sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . .”

  She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don't think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.”

  “It's . . . it's magic, what I can do?”

  “What is it that you can do?”

  “All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.”

Yeah, he was pretty fucking evil at eleven.

*** Bear in mind that Mrs. Cole is day drinking at her job of childcare - not the most reliable witness. I mean, I'm sure JKR intended her as one, but there's not enough evidence in canon to support that.

Yeah, Tom admits to hurting people, but Harry's first day in Diagon he wanted a book to curse Dudley with. Hagrid, a grown adult and while representing a school, attacked an eleven year old for something his father said, badly enough he needed to go in for surgery. Children at Hogwarts routinely hex, jinx, and curse each other. Hermione punched Malfoy for calling her a Mudblood, but Tom is evil for doing the same thing?

That doesn't excuse 11yo Tom hurting others. But I'm saying, why was Tom shown differently, as a creepy anti-Christ? Why did Dumbledore immediately show him an aggressive form of magic (pretending to burn his things) instead of something helpful or beautiful? Dumbledore went into that orphanage dorm room expecting to see a monster and Tom lived down to his expectations.

Maybe Tom really was inherently irredeemable, but that's not proven in the books.

**** Especially when the story is coming from a muggle who has no idea how accidental magic may work. It could have been a boy retaliating against others who hurt him because the adults don't care to protect them. But it's clear that Rowling set out to show us a eleven year old psychopath.

Been a while since I read the books, but at least in the movie and the LEGO game, Hagrid gives Dudley the pig tail because Dudley went for Harry's birthday cake.

*** Not necessarily, while I admit it is actually likely that he was the one to kill the rabbit we have no way of knowing for sure (it was the pet of a kid at a poor orphanage, it could have been done by any of the other orphans. And mostly the impression I have is that he was lashing out at those he felt had wronged him at that point. Yeah, he wasn't a light-hearted and valiant hero, but he also wasn't an outright monster at that point.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  “It has worked well so far.”

  “Has it?” Harry lowers his voice a little. “Did it work well when you ordered Tom Riddle to return to an abusive Muggle orphanage in the middle of a war?”

  Albus goes very still. Then he says, “One wonders how you know these things.”

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.
