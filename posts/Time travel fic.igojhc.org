:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic that I read a while ago. I remember that Harry went back in time and he was older and more war hardened. I think he went back to the day of the third task in fourth year because I remember Cedric being there. He went back to destroy all the horcruxes (and save Sirius?), and kills Voldemort in the end. The main thing I remember was that he had a specific amount of time that he could stay in the past I think it was either twelve or twenty four hours. I'm not sure if it was on ffn or ao3, and I think it was a one shout but I'm not sure, it might be multi chaptered.
