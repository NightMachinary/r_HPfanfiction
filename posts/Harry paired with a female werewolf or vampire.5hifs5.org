** Best I can find right now:

linkffn(Blue-Eyed-Doe) has a lycantrophy infected Lavender, though she isn't completely turned, much like Bill Weasley.

linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) is a interesting fic at first, but dilutes into some weird clich√©s eventually. I also suspect some self-insert of the author in the form of the female vampire. Try it out, at the very least the premise is fun.

There is also "Forever Knight", but since portkey seems to be down, I can't find a link. Maybe you have better luck or someone on here has an idea where to find it.

*** I second Valeriana Natassa. I'm not really into vampire stories, but I really liked this one. Great fic.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

** I remember reading a Werewolf!Hermione One-shot ages ago but I can't remember where and she was paired with Harry.

If I remember where I saw it I'll post a link...
