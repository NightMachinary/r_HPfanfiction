Long timer lurker, first time poster here with a burning question: what's the etiquette for answering reviews on FFN?

I've been posting on AO3 for a long time now, and answering reviews there is easy, as some of you probably know. But I just recently started cross-posting to FFN and have gotten a couple of really nice reviews that I'd love to answer. However, I've seen a lot of posts that say answering reviews at the end of a chapter or doing shout-outs is a pretty big peeve for some readers, and I'm uncertain about just PMing people out of the blue--AO3 doesn't have a messaging system and I'm really shy about just talking to people.

I don't want to make a huge social faux pas. I already answered one that had a direct question with a PM to the reviewer, but I don't know what to do about the others.

What's the general consensus here on answering reviews? PM them? Ignore them? Answer them in the story? Any help with this would be much appreciated!

​


** I both PM them something along the lines of “Thank you for your review and suggestion/compliment/whatever applies” and do shoutouts. Often I forget to reply or Ffn just doesn't alert me and I find them monthes later. So shoutouts ensure I am still thanking poeple even if I forget the actual pm.

** As a reader and occasional reviewer, I would much prefer the PM. When looking at the story I would prefer not to have anything other than the story itself as it can easily detract from the experience.

** I answer all reviews with a review related PM. You just need to click the speech bubble at the right side in the review to open the PM menu.\\
Of course, this doesn't work for guest reviews.

** Yeah, PM-ing is the norm on FFN. People usually send me a message when I review their fics, and I always send a message when others review my fics. It's usually a “thank you” and essentially me saying “i kno rite” in a more eloquent way, lol.

** I think it's just good manners to thank reviewers by pm, after all they don't have to take the time to do it and most readers don't bother. Mind you I hardly ever get reviews so it's easy for me to do. If I was ever in the happy position of being inundated I suppose it might be more difficult but I think I'd still make the effort.

** I'll pm someone with the title "review reply". That's pretty much all there is to it. It's up to you whether or not you want to answer them, but I will generally say it's not really worth it to try and assuage people.

Answer reviews in a story chapter is a big enough peeve of mine that I will actually stop reading a story because of it.

** I try to PM people but often I get the alerts at work and forget.

I don't do shout outs unless a particular question is being asked by various people.

** If its eeally constructive and/or just really nice and encouraing, i drop the reviewer a PM saying thanks.

If its a review aove and beyond the usual (really in depth criticism with suggestions and what have you) I do a little note at the end of the fic.

** If it's something that is asked many time, you can answer it (briefly) at the end/start of the next chapter. If not, you can just PM him/her.

PM'ing is fine. I actually prefer that, because if those discussions are in public it invites a more defensive attitude.

I've had some nice conversations with authors about reviews.

Aside from being a pet peeve I think it's actually not even allowed on ff.net. In any case it just inflates the word count and doesn't belong in the story. [A/Ns in general should be avoided if possible and always short]
