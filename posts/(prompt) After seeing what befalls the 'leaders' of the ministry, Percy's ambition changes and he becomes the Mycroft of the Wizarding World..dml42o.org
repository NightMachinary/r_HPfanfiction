Percy /is/ the Ministry of Magic - and he will protect Wizarding Britain to the best of his considerable ability. The only one who knows is one of his siblings. The rest believe he's still hung up on the thickness of cauldron bottoms.

** I know you're asking for Percy, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]] showed Harry as the British Ministry of Magic and gave a lot more details on a government personification.

*** Mycroft is Brother to Sherlock Holmes. While it's never officially stated what he does for a living, he is very high up in the government, has seemingly endless power when it comes to having people surveiled, government actions etc:

Dr John Watson: He's your brother?

Sherlock Holmes: Of course he's my brother.

Dr John Watson: So he's not...

Sherlock Holmes: Not what?

Dr John Watson: I don't know... criminal mastermind?

Sherlock Holmes: Close enough.

Mycroft Holmes: For goodness sake, I occupy a minor position in the British government.

Sherlock Holmes: He is the British government when he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a free-lance basis. Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before I get home. You know what it does for the traffic
