lnkffn(10681251) and linkffn(11904771).

What do I mean with that? Good Crossovers, with a strong but worked-for-it Harry. No annoying Hermione/Draco/Fleur/Bellatrix romance as main-theme. Romance should be background if at all.

Please... throw dem fictions at me!


** so, you're looking for good crossovers, but then you post that one as an example? I'm confused.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.

***** Mhm, I read a few reviews, because I wanted to figure out if it really is worth to force myself - but nah. Apparently Harry doesnt have Magic. So its an OC called Hadrian who for the sake of making it a Crossover is the reborn form of Harry Potter.

Thanks for suggesting it but it doesnt look like its going to be on my list :(

** I haven't read your example story, so I don't really have a frame of reference, and saying that you prefer no romance makes me think we're so fundamentally different in our tastes that I can't predict what you would like. That being said, I have two suggestions for you.

linkffn(11115934) - Shadow of Angmar is my second or third favorite fic of all time. The care that the author invests into the Harry Potter canon and the LotR canon is palpable, and all wrapped up in a very interesting story about an immortal but not unscarred Harry making his way through middle earth a few thousand years before the events of LotR. No romance yet, though there is one that I'd like to happen quite a lot.

linkffn(11157943) - I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For is a bit different. For starters I don't think Harry is the main character. Knowledge of SWTCW would be helpful, but not fundamentally necessary as long as you keep an open mind to the fact that there are tv shows that are SW canon that you haven't seen, and just roll with it. There are characters more overtly interested in each other, but much to my frustration, they just won't get together.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
