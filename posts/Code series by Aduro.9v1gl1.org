Does anyone know if the final story has been completely abandoned or if the author has plans to finish it? I'm desperate. I've just spent the last several days reading this series and I think it's the best fanfic I've ever read. I'm dying to know how the story ends but it hasn't been updated in over 2 years. If the author is reading this please come back to the story - it is so good I haven't been able to put it down.

Also if anyone has any other recommendations similar to this or just this caliber of fanfic I would love to hear them! Help please!


** That's my all time favorite series. The author went on hiatus during the third story and then came back after like 6 years to finish that story and get us up the point it's at right now on The End Code. It's been 2 years now since the last update on that but I refuse to give up hope because of the first gap in updates. So hang tight, might be a while.

**** Same. I've tried to find a similar mentor pairing in other fics (namely Draco ones) and just haven't found anything with such good platonic chemistry. And Bill is such a great character to build on.

** Also, in terms of recommendations read any of her other fics. All of them are pretty top notch. I especially like Discomfort and Joy linkffn(5611653).

At this point I think I should update my flair with 'I'm just going to suggest Aduro' because that's basically all I do now :)

  A War-Time Christmas Story in a New AU. Detective-Auror Draco Malfoy is forced to spend the holiday with a few Order Members at the Burrow after the Auror Department falls to Death Eaters. It's the time for miracles, so maybe they'll all get along...
