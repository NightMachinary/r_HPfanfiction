So some months ago I read a fic where Harry speaks to Susan about their past years and I think they had a contact. Harry tells Susan that he remembers some of their past encounters like her wearing a Cedric is the really champion and then it turned into a Harry Stinks message. He gets sad and turns away and Susan realizes what the badge really says and goes to Hannah crying. Sorry I couldn't get more specific but thats all I remember. Thank you all for your time!

*** I got so irritated at this fic. It's just a shit show of angst, with each of them at different points going "woe is me' for 100,00 words.

Its one of those fics where they /nearly/ get together for almost the entirety of the fic.

**** half of all romance fics finish the fic by them getting together, and the other half start the fic by the pairing getting together

it's hard to find (and write!) a middle ground

***** Well... its not hard once you have experiences with this kind of thing yourself, *if* you try to make it a semi-realistic thing in the first place.

But then again, fanfiction being to a large part a teenage thing, I can see why most fics have zero clue about any of this relationship-stuff... or anything it entails, come to think of it.

I remember reading this part of the summary and skipping the story entirely. Shit like that I just can't handle reading about unless there is a specific reason for it, ie. some of the time travel Harry/Bella fics where he is trying to reconcile the future Bella with the past one.
