** If reddit has a dumb shit award for each subreddit, I think you just won for 2017.

That's also a lot of fucks, Dumbledores, cunts, and god forbid, that's a shitload of memes.

** OP for real though, if you want to look at story stats like most used words, try this website: [[http://countwordsworth.com/]] It has soo many stats, even syllable related ones. Only problem is that it tends to freeze up for a while if you paste a lot of text in.

** This reminds me of a thing I saw ages ago that compared most used phrases or sentences in Harry Potter and Twilight. HP was things like "Something he didn't have last time" or "They looked at each other" , while Twilight was all "I sighed" "He sighed" "I shrugged" "He shrugged".
