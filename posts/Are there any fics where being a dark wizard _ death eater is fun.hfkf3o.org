Kinda like in the uhtred books where you know going Viking is probably not very ethical, but it's normalized in their culture and it seems like a great adventure.


** 7th Horcrux. I don't know of anything else unfortunately.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3049071/1/Fall-of-a-Phoenix#][Fall of a Phoenix]] Not exactly fun but well the death eaters are said to be the good guys. Warning: It's a Slash between Severus Snape and Harry Potter.

*** I'd prefer them to just be unapologetically evil and not care, adhering to a different set of morals, or just plain not seeing how what they're doing is wrong xD

**** There are said to be darker stories. There is a community in FFN Dark Harry Potter or Evil Harry Potter. But it's not really my cup of tea. Get enough of that in real life to really appreciate a genre of stories. /if you know what I mean/

*** Is it done well or did the author have to twist everything and make half the characters horrible (and unrealistic) to make good death eaters work?

**** I liked the concept of magic being alive and all. Can't say much on the story itself without spoilers. But basically it's a good Tom Riddle and Evil Dumbledore and dark magic isn't Evil kind of story. Characters are not so prominent -except the main characters - to really comment on it. It's a bit rushed to be honest, would have been a better story with more depth and details. It's as if the author was in a hurry to finish it. You can try it if you want. /shrugs/

***** I'll have a look thanks, it's just that the dark not evil+Dumbledore is the real bad guy are either very good or completely horrible.
