Looking for stories similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] and [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/][The Seventh Horcrux]]. I loved both stories humor and overall plot, was wondering if there were any more stories like them.


** As a point, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] is a very different beast from [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-hp-au.298748/][Seventh Horcrux]].

You may or may not enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/899503/1/Once-Upon-a-Freakin-Time][Once Upon a Freakin Time]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order][Dear Order]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7377441/1/How_Xenophilius_Lovegood_Saved_Britain][How Xenophilius Lovegood Saved Britain]] has a lot of the same wacky, feel-good, poke-fun-at-canon vibes as those stories. It's pretty funny, too.

** I assume you're just looking for humourous stories. There are a fair number of them out there. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] has a bunch, as does [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/Clell65619][clell65619]].
