I'm curious as to how prevalent this might be. I'm looking for HP fanfic which has accompanying illustrations.

A (smutfic) example is The Rose Paradox by bayushi on AO3.


** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/][Ao3 version]] of "Birds of a Feather" has illustrations. Not all chapters, you have to view by Entire Work to find them. Actual illustrations and not just photomanips based on the movies, which is prevalent in Dramione fics for some reason.

There was a short fanfic passed around LiveJournal from 2008 called "The Death of Narcissa Black" [[https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/fanfiction-fridays-the-death-of-narcissa-black/][(review here from 2012)]] which was entirely artwork. It was painted in watercolor with all the prose handwritten, as shown by the sample from the [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Narcissa_Black][Fanlore article.]]. The author is Molly Brooks and she's since deleted it off her site (it had some dark content), but I remember downloading and reading the PDF version yonks ago.

Looks like you're in luck. I found it, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5qftic/name_a_memorable_fic_youve_read_that_has_now_been/][someone on this sub uploaded it to dropbox 2 years ago.]]

** There seems to be a fad of using artsy photo collages for chapter art. I've seen that style in quite a few fics, mostly romances. Here are some examples:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12801672/chapters/29219964][Strange Atractors]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/chapters/17052891][No Glory]]

This one includes a few pieces of fanart made for the fic (in Ch 9 and 10):

** Have a look at Widdershins, by Didokali.

Fun story, adorable illustrations.

** Art aside, is The Rose Paradox any good? I'm a sucker for a good Fem!Harry story.

*** It's a shameless harem smut fic. If you're into that, it'll be right up your street :p
