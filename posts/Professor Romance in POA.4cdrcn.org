Currently in the middle of a reread of the books and a small tidbit during Christmas break in POA has peaked my interest. Trelawney comes down to eat and looks for Remus, even asking him earlier to gaze at a crystal ball together. Now I can't get this random pairing out of my head! :O It's pretty much a non existant pairing in fanfiction but I'll go down with this new ship until either I or someone else writes them gazing at crystal balls over a good chocolate dessert. Thoughts? :P


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5376652/1/Unfortunate-Divinations][There is a single story on FFN]] that has Remus and Trelawney as the two listed characters and is in the Romance genre. So, have fun?
