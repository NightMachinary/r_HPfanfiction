#+TITLE: In all the stories, where Harry is taken from Dursleys and He needs to keep secret where he was living for any amount of years, why doesn't he practise a fake accent, for example have slight French accent to make the investigators believe their attention needs to be turned to French ministry.

It would throw off the pursuers for some time would it not? And in my books, any hurdle in detectives path is a win when the search is on you..


** It is most likely because people forget about it when writing a fic.

But realistically speaking it is difficult and I mean extremely difficult to fake an accent so that people believe it. You have to speak in the accent constantly without any slip up.

It is even more difficult to fake an accent and make someone who has an ear for accents for example anyone from the department of International Magical Cooperation or the Supreme Mugwump of ICW.

It would take a LOT of talent and practice to fake it convincingly.

So what your saying is that the kidnappers need to go to France for the better part of a decade to ensure that Harry's French accent is legit, right?

**** That's what a dialog coach is for. :)

But really, they wouldn't need to take him to France to give him a French accent: just have French-accented people take care of him. After all, in most of these he's being picked up as a very young child. Children mimic the accents of those around them.

Besides, if they REALLY wanted to muddy the waters, they'd WANT him to have a mixture of idiocyncracies, to indicate that he was moved around a lot.

*** As someone who has a French boy as a main character, I can testify how annoying to write a realistic accent. But depending on the circumstances, you can make the accent disappear â€˜quickly', as in a few chapters.

**** I'd go the approach of either not bothering to write the accent out after a bit - or just throwing in the description of 'in a french accent' every once in a while. Writing an accent seems overly tedious to me - particularly since it doesn't, at least for me, add much of anything to the story.

** Trying to teach a kid an accent or how to fix one is... really hard.

In school, have you ever had a classmate in "speech" class? It's for fixing horrible accents and speech impediments.

I went to school with this kid, he had the most obscene southern accent. The accent was so... thick it was like he was faking it. But it was legitimate. The poor bastard was in those speech classes from the third grade until highschool. He ended up moving back for highschool.

*** I feel that, as I've had speech lessons from kindergarten go third grade. It's really about fixing impediments in most cases, since accents aren't normally a problem to do having the similar accents in a region. So imagine how hard it is to try and replicate an accent that's obscure enough to not be localized, but still easily recognized.

** I mean it's more believable if he had an american or Australian accent rather than a French one... he would actually need to pick up the French language rather than the French English accent to be believable. And to be able to portray a fake accent you are not familiar with is really hard and you might slip and not be consistent.
