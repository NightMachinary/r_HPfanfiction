I just posted chapter 4 (out of 5) of The Last Pureblood Malfoy. After the last chapter, one of my readers commented to say they're looking forward to the power of love turning Lucius into a decent human being, and I was like, no, sorry, that is not happening. This is Lucius we're talking about. This chapter should make that clear.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.
