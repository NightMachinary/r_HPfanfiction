This headcanon has been in my mind for a while, and I've seen a few fics based on this, but nothing actually... good. I'm really interested in how the revelation changes her relationships with her brothers and cousins. Any one know of a story or willing to take the challenge?


** I am also interested to see if anyone has any fics for this.

  When Lily is eighteen, she cuts her hair and joins the army. The British Army. The British Muggle Army. Despite what the gossip papers say, she leaves her wand at home. She's not a complete idiot. -- -- Oh, right. Maybe take a few steps back.
