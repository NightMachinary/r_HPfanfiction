I'm looking for some canon fics from Ginny's POV.

They can definitely involve Harry, but I'm definitely looking for something that's more Ginny-centric than Harry-centric. Romance is fine, as long as its not the only focus.

I'm mostly interested in slightly more serious canon multi-chapter fics with a solid characterization of Ginny.

I mostly read canon, so I'm not looking for Ginny-becomes-a-death-eater type fics.

Ideas?


** Definitely look at After the End on the sugar quill. It focuses on a wide variety of characters but by far has the best characterization of Ginny that I've ever read. Canon pairings. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619]]

**** Thats far and away my favorite fic ever. In second is Taking Control. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11709]] It's a powerful independent Harry fic with a great romance with Ginny. But theres a lot of Ron, Hermionie, and Dumbledore bashing. This takes places after OoTP and is complete but the sequel is not. In third is The Refiner's Fire [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=8104]] This author has the most fully fleshed out universe and story of Harry's life that I've found on the internet. It is complete with a sequel and tons of short stories to fill in the post hogwarts years. All of these recommendations combined probably near 1.7 million words. While these authors have great ideas and plots their writing is not as great as After the End so be prepared. Still both well worth a read. Oh also The Refiner's Fire is all cannon pairings and post OoTP

** Best Ginny I ever read was 'The Hogshead' by MyGinevra (on ff.net or siye) It is actually the first story I read when I found fanfiction, and my authorname is an homage to the one who started me on my path.

I am actually a Harmonian (only took me one decent Harry/Hermione story to realize it), but I love me a good Ginny.

** 'Ginny's Gift' is fantastic. It's AU (picks up after Goblet of Fire), but Ginny's characterization is solid. There's a sequel too.

** I really enjoyed [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1026&chapno=1][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella. It follows what was written in Riddle's diary during Ginny's first year.

** On ff.net, the 'Prelude to Destiny' series has a really good Ginny fic. The author is brainchild.

** I read mostly romance centered, not as much action and adventure, but I might have a few suggestions for you. I like well written, sometimes darker stuff with strong characters, so I would suggest giving any of these stories a shot based of the fact that they are just /good/ stories.

This is a very beautifully written story. It basically resolves around Ginny losing her magic for some unknown reason and her POVs are parallel to Harry's.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128444]]

Here is probably my absolute favorite Harry/Ginny fic. Definitely my favorite Ginny characterization. It is from Harry's POV, but I would still suggest reading it.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127333]]

Okay... I couldn't resist suggesting this one. This is not a Ginny-centric fic, but she is a main character and very likable. It is the most original, funniest fic I have ever read and more people should read it.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1277839/1/Seeking-Ginny][Seeking Ginny]] is a good one. It's very romantical and subdued if you're into that sort of thing. It's AU, though.
