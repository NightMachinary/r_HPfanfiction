Any ff that involves harry in a war type scenarios?

Like linkffn(4985330) or linkffn(5150093)

I just liked the setting of war zone. If there is something similar to skitterleap, that would be awesome.

I don't like slash on main character and harem anything else is ok. I prefer long and completed fics but i am not really picking atm.

â€‹

P.S. Yeah i have read emperor.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Very war centered, very militaristic, and very detailed depictions of small unit actions. You should like it if you like "Emperor". Good guys are aggressive and proactive, while the bad guys react accordingly and have secret weapons of their own.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

** linkffn(2784825) sort of has Harry at war, on a very small scale. (I haven't read the others here, so don't know how it compares.)

It's a Snily. Either you love it or you hate it. It's three chapters removed from being completed and can also be found on AO3 is you prefer that platform.

*** I actually never gave a snily fic a chance but it appears interesting and i believe that the more people hate on a fic then that fic is gonna be great. Also looks like a good setting and refreshing after all the tropes (though i am not really fun of the smut on fics).

Edit: just noticed your name. Kudos to you my friend for sticking to your story. Never and for no reason should anyone stop you from doing something, that you apparently love, because they are hating. The 70's rock references warning sold me on reading to be honest! Thanks for sharing!

**** You're welcome. :)Yes there's smut involved but it doesn't distract from the main plot or overshadow the story in any way (if I may say so myself, of course :') I just wanted the growth of their relationship to be as natural as possible.
