Hello! I read a lot of fanfiction, but I tend to run the other way whenever I stumble upon Harry x Hermione, for some reason. I'm just inherently against them, but I really want to give it another chance, because so many people love them and I want to understand that appeal.

So since I don't already like this pairing, I'm looking for something that builds the story and the characters way before it builds the relationship. Something that you can't tell from the beginning they are going to end up together just because the writer decided they are. Something that develops as naturally as possible. Something that doesnt idealize/puts on a pedestal neither Harry or Hermione. And please, something that doesn't get them together by bashing on Ron, or even just by the two disliking Ron.

Genderbends, slash and femslash are very much ok.


** As a fellow detractor of Harmony (it's not bad, but it tends to be very bland), I can recommend a few that I've enjoyed.

!linkffn(Lord Hermione?) is a very different take on Hermione's character where she was alone at Hogwarts for over three years before she became friends with Harry, and is much more abrasive and cynical as a result.

!linkffn(A Fair Life) is another one I enjoy, though I generally find Harmony more palatable as a lesbian pairing.

!linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) is a pure fluff, and it's pretty cute fluff, too.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Error of Soul is fun, it was rec'd earlier.

*Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire* is well written and has pretty canon characters. It also fits your request to a tee.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Hermione gets her name out of the goblet (due to her trying some advanced magic). Harry gets stuck playing Hermione's role (Mediator between Ron and Hermione), and Ron's jealousy points toward Hermione.

I feel the story avoids many of the issues you usually see in Harmony. The Ron/Hermione falling out is based on his jealousy over the Goblet toward her (which Hermione takes... much worse than Harry did). They eventually make up, but it kills the possible Romance. McGonagal gets to play matchmaker, which is cute.

​

The only thing I didn't like about it was the whole 'Lucius Malfloy and Fudge try to get Hermione stripped of her magic by expelling her'. I donno, i've never been a fan of that plotline.

​

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them* and *Stages of Hope* both have Harmony elements, but they are not the focus of the plot. More, it provides a good motive for Harry / Hermione while they do other things. They also both have the relationship pre-established.

I'll also call *Escape* a guilty pleasure. It does gloss over a few of Hermione's flaws, but the whole "Fuck the Ministry and its Marriage law I'mma become a Yank" is a fun plot, and other than that the writing is very good. Also, Best Hermione parents.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Unlike a sister

Its unfinished. But it's by far the best harmony story

And it keeps everyone in character without bashing.

** I maintain that I don't object to Harmony in principle. But I've yet to find a fic I liked where it was core to the story.

I had high hopes for Moments in Love recently, which at least did a good job of justifying the pairing, but it went rather downhill later with scenes like Harry getting the golden egg just by writing Dragon Friend on himself in runes. And it was getting really soppy.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the marriage law revolution)

I actually am fairly neutral towards it. Pairings in general are plot thinners to me.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
