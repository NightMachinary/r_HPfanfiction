JKR's ending was a pile of crap. The Government, Economy, Hogwarts, and people are broken. People have to go for foreign wandmakers. Morale is at an all-time low. Diagon Alley is practicallly all boarded up. The Goblins are pissed off. Hogsmeade is practically a ghost town. AND the population is cut by at least 50% from all of the deaths and people escaping (who most likely won't come back after the final battle).

I'm looking for fics like Novocaine linkffn(13022013) , where Harry actively works on society getting rebuilt. Because it obviously needs handholding to keep what happening from happening again.

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.

** There's linkffn(13072492), if you care for a more political side of things. It mainly focuses on Neville and Hermione, though.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.
