I don't particularly want to read this, but I'm curious if something like this exists.


** Do you mean the Ancient Egyptian fertility goddess, the fictional spy agency, or the terrorist group?

** ISIS wasn't a thing back in the 90s when the plot of most fics happens, but there's one where Voldemort has a Death Eater join Al-Qaida in 1996. The Death Eater uses Imperios to take over leadership of the entire group and Voldemort uses it to perform magically assisted terrorist attacks on muggle cities. Linkao3(6765496)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
