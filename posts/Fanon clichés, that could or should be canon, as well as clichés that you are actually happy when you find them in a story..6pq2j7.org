Not a native English speaker, sorry if something sounds strange.

Fanon clichés, that could, should or are canon: things that could be easy part of canon just not showed in the book, or that should be part of it.

A short list but I'm sure that there are many other, please post the others that come to your minds.

-The entrance of the chamber of secrets had stairs, or another entrance. I mean can you immagine the canon Slytherin using a slide like a 'muggle kid' , or not calculating an easy exit. It would conflict with what of the house he founded is like.

- magic to check parentage. It could totally be canon given the obsession of some pureblood family has with ancestry I think it is totally believable that they successfully researched such a branch of magic.

- hiring a goblin to manage you money. Although many canon characters wouldn't trust the goblin I find totally logical and believable that the goblins would offers such a service. I mean 'muggle banks' have that to. And it would be profitable for goblin too.

- the bank account Harry is using is a trust account, or an account set for him at his birth, not James and Lily accont(family account). I mean it doesn't make sense to give a 11y access to all of his inheritance. It's enough common for 'muggles' to put some money in the name of a newborn, or at least my family did it for me. And if a boy is orphaned someone will be nominated administrator of his inheritance until he comes to age. I know canon magical lack common sense but this should be crossing the line. (I' m not talking about a superrich!Harry only about how much freedom he has on his inheritance while he is under age)

- harry receives presents or money from random people. I mean given that he was basically idolized has the saviour of the magical world, especially given his situation as an orphan, wouldn't it make perfect sense that people would send him presents or money for his birthday, or at Halloween? I mean I could also totally see some heirless old witch or wizard set him as his/her heir.

- the basilisk is harvested. I mean although I don't remember the rarity of a Basilisks in canon a 1000 y one shouldn't be a common encounter, it doesn't make sense to leave it to rot. Even if harry didn't think about it, canon Dumbledore isn't evil or stupid even if he didn't want to publicise that harry killed it, he could have said that he killed it (he didn't even have to admit that it was in hogwarts he could easy lied about meating and defeating it somewhere else) and pass the earnings from the carcass to Harry or divide that between hogwarts and Harry, using the carcass himself, but to let it rot it just doesn't make sense.

- Flamel never destroyed the stone, had a second one, or made it. I mean if I was alive only thanks to the stone and was the one that created it, why wouldn't I make a second one a third one or so on as a backup? The materials are rare or it takes a lot of time? No worries I have a stone that gives me infinite gold, and all the time I need, I'll find and buy any material. I mean even if he didn't have it before after the first one was destroyed , I would make a new one, than fake my death and disappear with my wife. I find totally plausible that canon Flamel faked the destruction of the stone, (or destroyed it but still owning another stone) with or without Dumbledore help, and disappear. Well given that he didn't actually what to die, I mean I immagine that living for centuries can be tiring.

Please comment with your own

clichés that you are actually happy when you find them in a story.

The one that aren't logical could or do clash with canon but in any case everytime they are there they make a story 'rank up' for you.

-during Harry's first year Tonks is a seventh or sixth year. I love Tonk character and love when a story has her as a kind of older sister like character to Harry. leaving aside if they do end up together or not.

-harry is interested in magic and not totally passive.

-other blacks than Sirius, Andromeda, Narcisa and Bella are alive. I know that all of them are basically OC but for some reason I really enjoy those 'family fics'

-the reason why Neville is inept in magic is a bad matched wand.

-harry becomes an animagus, I know that in Canon he had way to many problems to use his time for the transformation, but I like the Idea of him following James and Sirius footsteps.

-there are various level of Methamorphumagus abilities there absolute one like Tonks that has basically no limit, and weaker one that can do only easy things and only with a lot of concentration. Harry is one of them on weaker side of the spectrum.

That's it for me, I am sure that there are others I'm forgetting.

Please comment with your opinions,

If you post yours please divide them between 'Canon clichés' and 'rank up clichés' to make thinks clear.

Once again thanks for reading, and sorry for the bad English I am not a native speaker.


** This is more of a headcanon than fanon or cliché, but mine is that Flamels actually spend most of their time guarding the Stone against thieves, updating and reinforcing protections on it, and fighting off kidnapping and assassination attempts.

A related heacanon is a line that I would give to Grindelwald if I ever wrote him into a fanfic: "I looked into the whole immortality thing as well, and you know what I discovered? That the harder try to become immortal, the more people will be trying to kill you, that's what. It's more trouble than it's worth."

** The mismatched wand of Neville is ridiculous. After all the longbottoms are a old pure blood family. They undoubtedly know the importance of a well match wand.

I do like the 'basal appearance' of the methamorphumagus. After even if they can change at will, some traits from her parents should be there. After all magic doesn't present it self at birth, the accidental magic occurs later in life. The idea that this special kind of wizard doesn't have a 'normal' face and was morphing since birth is idiotic

EDIT: Paradoxically, Neville's first wand was mismatched because it belonged to his father. This is Canon. I'd think that Mrs. Longbottom should have known better than that.

***** Neville's first wand was from his father, and he got a new one before he met Harry on the train in book 6, but we're not really told that Neville's trouble come from his wand mismatching- that's pure fanon.

The Weasley's didn't really have much in the way of family for them to recycle wands, right? The older siblings can't just give theirs up, Arthur isn't mentioned to have any dead relatives. Molly had her brothers, but she may have not had the chance to get theirs after they were killed. It's reasonable to assume that, if Dumbledore's wand was buried with him, most wands are buried with corpses. Alice and Frank could be a special case because they're not actually dead, which is why Neville actually has his dad's wand.

  -the reason why Neville is inept in magic is a bad matched wand.
#+end_quote

This is pretty much disproven by canon. The reason why Neville is bad at spellcasting is a crippling lack of self-confidence, not because his wand isn't good enough.

Neville becomes much better at spellcasting during OOTP, while practising with the DA -- and what really improves his performance is the news that Bellatrix Lestrange has broken out from prison. Then he begins practicing harder than everyone and stops caring about failures, accidents or injuries... and that's when he gets better. Quoting from the book:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents' attackers' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo's and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers' escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the D.A. meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.
#+end_quote

So Neville goes from being one of the worst spellcasters in the DA to one of the best, and all this happens while he still has his father's wand. He doesn't break it and get a new one until the end of the book... and in HBP, where he does have his new wand, he's pretty much at the same level.

So... no, I don't like fics where Neville just gets a new wand and all of a sudden he's great at magic. Neville's problems run a lot deeper than that; what he needs is confidence and not a new wand.

** One thing that I am more than willing to accept is the fanon notion that the Wizengamot is the British magical parliament. It solves the very pressing issue of explaining where magical laws come from. We are acquainted with the executive in the face of the Ministry, and we witness the judiciary at a few trials---but the magical legislature is never revealed at all!

In the same vein, I don't mind the fanon notion that at least /some/ of the Wizengamot seats are hereditary. Even after Blair's reforms, the House of Lords contains an (admittedly diminished) number of hereditary peers: why oughtn't the same apply for wizards too? Granted, the nobility system can get abused to ridiculous lengths in some fanfics, whose authors seem to assume 20th century nobility can act the way it did in the 12th for some reason... Still, I quite like the Noble Houses system, when done correctly.

Then again, that estimate only counts one large pile of gold in the vault, and it acknowledges that there might be more. It also doesn't count any of the other items that might be in the vault (family heirlooms, etc).

#+begin_quote
  Basilisks were non-naturally occurring, which would make them extraordinarily rare, probably so rare that most of what could be harvested is likely useless as no one has any idea what it does. Essentially any part of a basilisk unique to a basilisk is about marginally more useful than Ununennium (an element with a half-life of ~10 μs.) Fanon just assumes that there has been extensive research and study on basilisks, which are illegal to breed in canon.
#+end_quote

Now that I think about it, I kind of like the idea that a basilisk is essentially a wizarding Boogeyman. No one knows anything about it, they have no way to combat it, and if you find out one is in your house then you hide in your bed and pray. It would make the fear of Parselmouths much more sensible. It's not that they're afraid that you can talk to snakes, it's that they're afraid you can talk to the /King/ of snakes. Anyone who can control a the Boogeyman is undeniably evil.
