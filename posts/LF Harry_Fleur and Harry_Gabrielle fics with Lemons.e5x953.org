I thought about Harry and Fleur might not love each other, but enjoy themselfs. Gabrielle develops a crush on him and might even be Jealous of her sister. What i would like to have is him sleeps with each of them, not necessary together. If its Post-Hogwarts or AU doesnt matter. But im fine with Love fics, as long as he ends up with both of them.

The one by SquareRootBeer aka BlakeMD? I know a decent number of folks have copies saved in mobi form.

The last time someone requested it someone linked this:

[[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Blakemd&sort=author]]

Not sure if that download still works anymore though. I also don't know how complete a copy that is with regards to the original which was... what... 22 chapters long before being abandoned?

** It Could Only Happen to Harry by HoosYourDaddy has a chapter or two with Fleur. Some Weasley bashing if that bothers you, but otherwise worth a read.
