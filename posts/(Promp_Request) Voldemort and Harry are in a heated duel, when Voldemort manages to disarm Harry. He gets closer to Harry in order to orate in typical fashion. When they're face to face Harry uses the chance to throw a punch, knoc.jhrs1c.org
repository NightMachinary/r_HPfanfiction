** well clearly everyone fighting alongside harry would abandon him in disgust for his unwizard like behaviour including hermione who for some reason starts dating draco.

harry becomes a depressed drunk and moves to america where he changes his name to James Kieth rowling and writes a book about if his life didnt go to hell for muggle audiences

james kieth rowling becomes a best selling author and then dies of a drug overdose at age 30

** He throws the punch, and voldy goes down. However, Harry has fallen victim to two of the classic blunders, A. Punching with you thumb inside your fist. B. Punching someone wearing mage armour. (Do you know how much force it takes to knock someone out who is wearing full plate, you would break your arm.) However, since this is Harry, he only breaks his hand, and suddenly has to deal with hundreds of tiny fractures up his arm.
