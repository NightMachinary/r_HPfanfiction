#+begin_quote
  Lily's life drastically improved the day she became Ladybug, superhero of London. Except for the part where she fell hard for her partner, Chat Noir, who doesn't feel the same. James's life was already great before he became Chat Noir. Maybe he'd fall in love with Ladybug if he weren't so into his classmate Lily Evans. Together they battle unrequited love and, you know, Voldemort.
