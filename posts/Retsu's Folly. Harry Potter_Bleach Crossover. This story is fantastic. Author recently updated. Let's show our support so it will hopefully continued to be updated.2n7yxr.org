** The only HP/Bleach crossover I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5379292/1/Bleached][Bleached]], and it was pretty good. I might give this one a try as well.

** I honestly recommend everyone following it on Dark Lord Potter. He usually posts the chapters there first and then after it has been read and reviewed posts on fanfiction.net

** Nuhuh is a quality writer and I'm glad to see him back updating this story.

I also recommend his HP/Dresden crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3468902/1/Demon-s-Feign-Merlin-s-Pain][Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain]] and his "let's see if I can reinvent the Indy-Harry clich√©s," [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4347702/1/Catharsis][Catharsis]].

** Lets see: 13 chapters since 2009? That's what? Less than 3 per year. And with only 100k? If it was completed, I'd be interested, but as it is, no thanks.

*** It was like 12 chapters from 2009-2011. Now there's one more chapter. OP is trying to encourage more.

****** Nonsense. He's recommending a story to be read. (The reason he is recommending the story is so that people are showing support for the story so that he can get more chapters from the author.) I simply explaining why I'm not interested.

*** Since when is length or update rate any marker of quality, at all?

**** I think you might be surprised. Someone writing a million word epic is more likely to put effort into polishing their work. Chapters that are only one to two thousand words often are half filled with replies to reviews, not the story.

Regardless, being finished, or, having the possibility to be finished, are things I consider before reading a fic. If an author abandons their audience for 3 years, I'm going to be doubly cautious about reading them.

***** I guess we'll just have to disagree. I've seen plenty of long, 200K+ word fics that are anything but polished. Hell, Prince of the Dark Kingdom is considered a relatively good million word plus epic, and it's riddled with homophone conflations and tense switches.
