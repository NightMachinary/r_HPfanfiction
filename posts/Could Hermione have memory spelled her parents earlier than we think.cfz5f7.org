I know in the books it's right after Dumbledore dies/before she goes to the Weasleys for the wedding but I'm curious if people think she /could/ have done it earlier and if so, when?

Personally I think Christmas break of 5th year is a contender - she's on a skiing trip with her parents and cuts it short to come to London after the headmaster tells her about Arthur getting attacked - she already knows Tom is back, she knows exactly what Umbridge is up to and after hearing about Mr Weasley she knows parents aren't “safe” - anyone else have a head canon like this or know fics that have her changing their memories “early”?


** On Christmas in Y5, Hermione would have turned 16 in September. Any spells she could use would class as illegal underage magic.

But if we're going to go full tinfoil, then Y2. Hermione's parents were first seen in Flourish and Blotts in book 2, then never seen again after that. Hermione was petrified for months and it didn't look like her parents were notified, or if they were, cared. Remember that Myrtle, a muggleborn, was killed back in 1943 and her muggle parents showed up to collect the body.

So obviously the Grangers must have been obliviated!

** Theoretically, her parents could have gone after Christmas of Year 6. Due to Lavender affair, she wasn't with the boys that time; and she was over 17 by that time.

Her scheme would need time to pull off:

- Her parents or someone have to sell their practice
- Her house may need to be sold or rented, although that could put the new owner in danger. She can alternately burn down the house and claim insurance payout, but I doubt she would try that scheme
- Her parents need to organize a new life in Australia
- Someone needs to arrange their identity, including new fake passports, fake data in Muggle government databases, etc...

Anyway, I think her scheme of ‘evacuating' her parents would take longer than a few weeks to complete.

** Technically, Hermione "may" have spelled her parents during 5th year.

We know the trace only act as a magical radar, and can't determine "who" cast the spell. During both CoS and OotP, the Ministry doesn't "know" if Harry cast a spell or not out of school. They just detected a spell being used in Privet Drive, and since Harry Potter is the only wizard registered in this zone (both to activate the Trace and use magic), they assumed it was him. (I would have to add that, with this definition of the Trace, explained to the reader by Dumbledor in HBP, any spelled used during the "rescue mission" of the Order, from Tonk cleaning spell to Maugrey Disillusionment Charm should have actived the Trace and sent the Ministry a warning. But for the sack of the plot, we can ignore it).\\
Anyways, in Hermione case, she was on a trip. So even if she used Magic, the Trace would either not work (if we assume the "Trace" vary from one country from another, and each Ministry only monitor its own), or worked but the local Ministry would be unable to link the Magic to Hermione. Yet, this scenario is still unlikely for several reasons :

- Even if Hermione could use the spell without being caught right away, it is likely the local Ministry would investigate the unknown magic, making it dangerous.
- Hermione was also forced to do a lot of spells when she spelled her parents. She add to create a completely new identity for them, it include to conjure things like a passport for both of them. She also add to completely remove any trace of her existance in their house (which make it probable she spelled them her). All of this would take a lot of time, and I doubt she would be able to do all of it while being pressed by time.
- Finally, the Memory Charm is a spell very advanced. Hermione pulling it off while still at school could already be considered impressive, so during the First Semester of 5th year? Possible I guess (the only limits are the ones made by the author after all), but I would still consider it too hard for her at that time.

​

In conclusion, Hermione needed to not have the Trace, and to be at home to be able to spell her parents memory without too much risk. It only leaves the 3 vacations of her 6th year (I can't remember if she returned home for Christmas or the Easter Hollydays). But, since Hermione "returned home" at the end of 6th year, I guess she only charmed her parents at that time. Since, if she had done it before, she would effectively be homeless at that time, and I don't see why she would not have said it to Ron, since his house is the only one she could have gone.

** What parents would willingly let their child go to unknown locations during multiple school breaks after getting her back from a bording school thus almost never actually spending any time with her? With no way to get in contact with her.

So Yes,she probably did. And if not memory spelled they were potioned or confounded.

** Personally, I've always headcanoned that Hermione's parents were having problems in their relationship, and didn't really care about Hermione. Maybe this is why Hermione was so desperate for attention during the start of PS/SS.

** You know, her actions come across as "Greater Good" way more than they should.

I think it's distinctly possible she did so in her 6th year. She set it up and obliviated them later.
