Interested in reading more Harry Potter worlds with different societies/new places or concepts/redesigned original concepts.


** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Skitterleap]] deserves a mention here.

#+begin_quote
  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
#+end_quote

The basic premise is that Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore and conquered Europe. From then, shit happens and the wizarding world is changed beyond recognition. I don't think I have seen anything even remotely like this.

*** Thank you! I'd completely forgotten this fic, I remember seeing it in Taure's recommended fics. It's amazing that I haven't read it in the last year I've become a fanfic-er . . . person.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run by Toujours Padfoot]] - great original worldbuilding and really well-written. Hard to describe succintly, beyond the description below, but do give it a try - it's one of my favorite fics ever.

#+begin_quote
  The village of the dead is not as peaceful as it seems.
#+end_quote

Also, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series]] - rec'd here a lot but for good reason; it's similar to the HP books but set in American wizarding society

I also read and liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas]] - perhaps a bit less world-building-focused, but still a novel conception of the wizarding world:

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Told from the point of view of Snape, A Difference in the Family is an amazing read. Wizarding world during the space race and 70s England. 63 chapters and completed to boot.

*** My issue with this is it is so unbelievably biased towards Snape. Even the whole thing with Lily is so played down to the point where he called her a Mudblood for a decent reason and every hint he was a dick in canon is explained as a misunderstanding. Also the Marauders are hardly in it and they're all basically buddies by the end of it.

** It's almost cliche to mention, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived]] deserves a mention for an excellant Durmstrang.

Other than that, some of my favorite worldbuilding comes in fics where it is incidental to the story - Forging the Sword, Alexandra Potter, and On the Way to Greatness are all good examples of this.

I'll throw out another unusual fic, however, to go with the obvious, and that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate by FirePhoneix8]].

#+begin_quote
  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.
#+end_quote

This is one that I actually abandoned a while ago (because the plot moves rather slow, the A/N were getting annoying, and I'm not fond of Slash, which whilst it didn't dominate the story, was getting increasingly uncomfortable), but I put it up here because I felt the worldbuilding of a WWII/Grindelwald era was among the best I've seen (as well as, IMO, great Tom and Harry dynamic). Despite what it says, the slash or romance involving either Tom or Harry hadn't appeared by ~3/4's of the way through, and the author has made it clear the two wouldn't be involved together. YMMV, but worth putting up.

*** yes yes HP+BWL! I generally don't like / read fics like this, but I tried it and loved it. OP, if you do try it, there are 5 additional chapters on the DLP forums (it's not completed / possibly abandoned): [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=2]]

** The fanfiction writer Speechwriter is astoundingly good at world-building for Harry Potter.

In the first of the below, she creates an entire pseudo-world/wizarding afterlife and fleshes out many minor/historical HP characters. In the second of the below, she writes "Hogwarts" as a prestigious, non-magical boarding school predominantly for rich kids.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]]/ by Speechwiter: "Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH."

(Personal note: This is, hands down, /the best/ Harry Potter fanfic I have /ever/ read.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6113733/1/Have-a-Nice-Day][Have a Nice Day!]]/ by Speechwriter: "Tom Riddle: secret, brilliant heir to the biggest company in the world, VoldeMart. Hermione Granger: sent to his prestigious school on full scholarship because VoldeMart outsourced her parents' jobs to China. Bridges burn. Sparks fly. M for language."

** Definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]]. I'd give much to read more of that - the setting is just far more interesting then modern England, and the way Durmstrang, and 40's Germany, is being imagined and built is fantastic. Perfect aryan nazi hitlerjugend protagonist also helps, I guess ;)
