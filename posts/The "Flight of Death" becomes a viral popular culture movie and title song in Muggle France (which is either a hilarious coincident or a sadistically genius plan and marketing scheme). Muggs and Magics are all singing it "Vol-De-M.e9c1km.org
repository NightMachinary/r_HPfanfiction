#+TITLE: The "Flight of Death" becomes a viral popular culture movie and title song in Muggle France (which is either a hilarious coincident or a sadistically genius plan and marketing scheme). Muggs and Magics are all singing it: "Vol-De-Mor-Or-or-or-or-Ooort!" Death Eaters bang their heads against a wall.

** Voler in French means flying as in "flying a plane", not flying as in "running away"

You can also fly out of room ("Se flew through the door" / "Elle vole vers la porte"), and you can use it informally as stealing, like you can "lift" something from a store in English.

So, flight of death wouldn't be translated as "le vol de la mort", it would be translated as "la fuite de la mort".

That is, if my French hasn't majorly failed me...

*** True. Ok, so it's a zombie musical with a plane full of zombies, or a drama musical about a morgue flight back from a battle. Then the song can be about "un vol de morts", which mostly works phonetically except for the silent t on morts... Probably close enough :)

**** Yeah, or informally "theft from/of death," but I'm not linguist enough to figure out if that would've been used in the 1940s, lol.

And idk if Dementors are death, I think they're kinda worse? Thinking about, it doesn't make much difference - no matter which follows me, I'd probably be dying scared shitless a couple of seconds later...

*** /So, flight of death wouldn't be translated as "le vol de la mort", it would be translated as "la fuite de la mort"./

Nope. Pas d'accord du tout.

Think of the imagery. We're very fond of metaphores in French, and the basic example most of my teachers evoked "le vol noir des corbeaux" - the black flight of crows, from the song /Le Chant des Partisans/. That passage describes the arrival of nazi aeroplanes, bringing death to France, blackening the sky, like crows.

Voldemort can fly, and he wants to impress upon the public that doom will fall on all who stand against him. He has a big evil black sign /blacken/ the sky whenever he's doing evil stuff. His Death Eaters fly on brooms, while dressed all black, like crows. He is using the bigotry of his followers toward a demographic minority to bolster himself, just like Hitler did with the nazis.

Tom Jédusor s'était vachement bien renseigné en culture moldue pour un type à la tête des gens qui voulaient les réduire en esclavagisme...

*** The thing about Tom Riddle is that he would've got his primary education at an institution which would only quite recently have ceased to be known as the local Poor Law school, at a time when the debate over whether it was actually necessary to teach pauper children to write as well as read was only just out of living memory. The chance that he knew any French at all until he had chance to learn it after leaving Hogwarts is quite slim indeed.

That the name he chose while in the grip of teenage stupidity has any meaning at all in French is entirely a coincidence.

**** I think he cares too much about significance and history to blindly choose it. He knows that he'll be recruiting among the rich and wealthy, and a Malfoy would definitely speak french. And we know he's brilliant. Even if he did not have the opportunity to learn before Hogwarts, he easily could have picked up a little while at school -- while researching, for clout, because of the war, etc. He was able to figure out how Horcruxes worked while at Hogwarts, he'd definitely be capable and willing to a bit of french.

**** Learning languages seems to be easier in the wizarding world:

#+begin_quote
  “Couldn't do me a brew, I suppose? I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number's making difficulties, and I can't understand a word he's saying. Barty'll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.”

  “Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement. “He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...”
#+end_quote

That seems to indicate that for some reason wizards can learn languages rahter quick, so him learning French at school isn't unlikely, if a busy ministry official can learn over 200 of them (50 presumably while on the job, because Fudge's information is outdated)
