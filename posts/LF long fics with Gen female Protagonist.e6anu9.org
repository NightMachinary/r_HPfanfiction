** If you are ok with a full cast of OCs taking place post-canon then you might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098062/1/The-Red-Witch-and-the-Nightmare-Queen][The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen]]. I like the cold personality of the main character that makes her different from most other female protagonists I've read.

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.

*** endgame is Harry/Ginny and she dates several people, there's bashing even if it's forgiven later or passed off as her younger self being childish, and her trauma from Diary!Tom is written like the aftermath of an abusive relationship. she's definitely not aro in that fic
