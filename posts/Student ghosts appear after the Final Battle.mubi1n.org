Colin just walks into the Great Hall one morning and sits at the Gryffindor table, while everyone else is looking like they've seen a ghost- because they have.

Lavender still shows up to a Divination, and gossips with the girls in the common room. Being a ghost allows you accsss to saucy secrets.

Tonks hangs with Fred and they totally terrorize the students with spoopy jump scares, and pranks galore.

Imagine Snape haunting the boat house and being the one to lead the first years to the Great Hall. (I know it was the shack in the books, but shut up. It's fanfiction, the whole point is to change canon.)

I just think it would really drive home the fact that /people died,/ and while you can move on, you can't forget the ones you've lost.

What if Tom became a ghost? (Fully sane Tom, not insane Voldemort.) He recalls the idotic things he did as Voldemort and just cringes. He haunts the DADA classroom, and students come to him for help with their classwork. He couldn't repent in life because he wasn't himself, so he comes back in death. The shred of good that was in him from Harry's blood, ensured his return as a ghost.

Idk, I just want more ghost content. Really, these people died in a war and didn't come back. Myrtle looked at a pair of eyes, and suddenly she's haunting a bathroom. Seriously, the former are far likelier to return than Myrtle.


** Aren't the people who choose to stay as ghosts the ones who were too afraid to â€˜move on'? Also it seems kind of depressing to me to still live as an imprint while all my loved ones slowly age and die. I do really love the idea of Ghost!Snape being the one to lead the first years though lol

*** Yeah, but again, /fan/fiction. Do what you want.

Besides, HP lore is kinda garbage, so just take what is generally used in other works or "reality" if you believe, and say those who die a tragic death remain as a ghost. I'd say war is pretty tragic. Sure, those being afraid of death can stay too, but add to it.

We know next to nothing about ghosts in HP, and there being only one way for ghosts to remain seems pretty lacking.

**** That's true I suppose, authors are allowed to change various aspects of canon if they wish. I find the theory that anyone who died a tragic death becomes a ghost very lacking and directly contradicting canon, but then again, it is fanfiction.

** It would be cool to have the baby-thing Voldemort haunting the dungeons kind of like the baby thing from American Horror Story, season 1. It would actually create a good set up for a horror story.

The ghosts of the Hogwarts resistance and those of the Death Eaters are at constant war with each other being extremely disruptive to the school activity. The unhappiness and hatred towards each other starts to manifest in the form of a demonic being who keeps luring students to their own death so that it can continue to feed on their misery as ghosts and grow stronger and stronger.

** Well, now I just want a fic with ghost Tonks and Fred wrecking havoc at Hogwarts. George would be so excited.
