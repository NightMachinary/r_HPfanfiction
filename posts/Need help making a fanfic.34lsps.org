** So you want to write but you don't have a specific thing you want to write about? That's odd. Most enthusiastic HP fans have innumerable plot ideas running around their heads, it's the writing part that troubles them.

** Make a (some) slight change enought time in the past. Use your knowlede of character's behaviour to suppose how they will behave.

Have fun. It's generic but it works , i think the best fics are SPoD (single point of departure). Obviously it is an opinion of mine (with notable exeptions). I always wanted to write a first-gen parselmouth (NOT OC ) Hermione , and the differences it might entail. Seeing slytherin purity-believers head explode amuses me to no end in my mind.

** I assume by fabric you mean a starting point for a story? One thing I am interested in seeing is how things would change if Harry had different timing arriving at Platform Nine and Three Quarters. I have been through one or two fics with Harry meeting Hermione first and am writing two myself but I haven't seen one in which his first encounter is a different student.

*** B and n, and r and f are close to each other, so I assume it was a typo for fanfic.

*** I get the distinct impression they are the type of people that would apparate directly onto the platform rather than spend any time in the Muggle world. Of course its a fanfic so go nuts and do that if you want.

Personally Neville was the first one to bring into my mind for some reason. I may subconsciously think he would make a better best friend for Harry than Ron so take my advice with a few grains of salt. If you want to follow a more realistic method of selection it would be a muggleborn student because they are the only ones that can't be apparated onto the platform by a parent.

***** Sure, I have the same username on Steam and Skype. I would prefer to skip voice chat though, my internet connection has a tendency to drop out for a few seconds every so often.

*** Harry did meet the malfoys first in diagon alley. That meeting could go different for you.
