** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) is the definition of a snarky Slytherin fic. Helps that the title of the series is...Sarcasm and Slytherin.

First three books are the strongest.

#+begin_quote
  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
