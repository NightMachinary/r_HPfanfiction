Maybe to compensate for the copious amounts of arsehole Harry and evil Ron.


** linkffn(6452481) maybe.

Also Ron's pretty cool in draco664's Apprentice/Journeyman/Master stories, but unfortunately that's not a big part of them.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

*** Was just coming here to recommend this. Well-written. Happy ending as they shed their bitterness along the way. Very good.

** In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk), Harry and Ron, when they are both in the scene, have a great dynamic.

  “Fair enough,” Ron replied, slinging an arm around Harry's shoulder as the pair started making their invisible way back to their rooms. “I always knew there was something off about that girl. Too much studying drives you mad, everybody knows that.”

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  With Sirius Black on the loose, Harry and Ron arrive for their 3rd year as rambunctious, loud, obnoxious teenagers. Sounds normal. Why, then, is Albus Dumbledore so worried? Is it going to be just a normal year at Hogwarts? Is it ever when a Potter is involved?
