** Dark Lord Hermione who just wants to integrate with the muggle world by forced equality. I can picture it. Someone else suggested dark lord Ron but I'm just not as convinced, what would be his platform?

** In these scenarios (unless it's Tom/Harry) I really think it's best to have Harry take the spot of Grindelwald.

If it is that way round, Hermione easily fills the role of Dumbledore; the slightly arrogant/egotistical academic over achiever drawn in by the charismatic, opinionated Dark Lord To Be.

Though, I'd love it to be a more moderate view that Harry takes, less a conquering of the Muggles and more an extreme form of isolationism. Sort of how MACUSA forbids interactions with Muggles (but maybe not to that degree). Advocating for Muggleborn children (and halfbloods like Seamus or Snape) to be removed from Muggle households and be raised in the Magical World.

He could start small, maybe he agrees with a few Ravenclaw/Slytherin Purebloods that Wizarding Culture/Studies should be a subject, even mandatory for those entering the Magical world for the first time. Hermione is a bit leery because of who is arguing for it, but Harry convinces her (playing on her desire for knowledge and their already strong friendship).

This move being backed by HARRY POTTER of all people gets it pushed through, Harry's "stance" published in the Prophet and actually opening a lot of political doors for Harry. Adding on the lessons he and the Muggleborns are learning about the Magical world begins to shape Harry's perspective and makes him even more resentful of having had to deal with the Dursley's in the first place.

Later, he hears all sorts of horror stories of people raised in the Muggle world and how it ruined everything:

▪︎ Seamus's mother kept magic from his father out of fear until the Hogwarts letter arrived, the man turning violent whilst Seamus was away for his first year and Obliviators had to get involved. Seamus returning to his father being both gone and not knowing he exists.

▪︎ Severus Snape's broken childhood.

▪︎ Harry learns about Obscurials and has an existential moment that THAT was nearly him AND something of that nature effected even his Headmaster (through his late sister).

▪︎ His own Aunt's persecution of his mother AND the way his grandparents held Lily in higher esteem.

The last one really seals his worldview. Magic and Muggle didn't mix, it was to the detriment of everyone involved. It wasn't just the protection of Wizards and Witches to be, but also for the Muggles who got involved with them.

Though Harry was smart enough to monitor who heard his opinions on the matter, and didn't go about mindlessly spouting his opinions, word got out in rumours and whisper. Unconsciously drawing people to Harry and a slow feeling of sinister apprehension settling in as his views broadened and shifted (drawing in more and more) without the Boy Who Lived actively seeking them out yet.

Dumbledore would grow a little wary of Harry growing to resemble Grindelwald, especially with Harry's own similarities with Tom, and may even (though I'm not sure when or how) let slip his concerns to Hermione.

To me, this Hermione is either a protector of the status quo or someone leaning in the opposite direction to Harry. She would initially be okay with Harry bouncing ideas off of her, "it's just talk."

Then, one day, he'd start of with a milder idea and have it published in either the Prophet or Quibbler. One of the few things he could speak about to Hermione without her becoming visibly uncomfortable...

The idea being a hospice for abused children, though it was not meant to cater to either side of the fence (as he knew plenty of Purebloods who could definitely benefit from being somewhere other than in their parents custody) he spun the idea with the premise of lifting Muggleborn children away from abusive households in the summer when they couldn't take solace at Hogwarts. He had the money to set one up and immediately began construction:

And the wizarding world ate it up. The general public adoring his humanitarian efforts, those "in the know" reading between the lines and seeing it for what it was. People reached out, venting grievances, offering support and begging for help...

and things escalated...

*** Crap, that sounds much more feasible than Harry putting a green tie, befriending Draco and taking one look a Daphne and suddenly becoming Magical Hitler.

Even the progression beginning as something out of his control and then him stepping up and being convinced, that's even historically accurate to how some movements grew and evolved.

** That's actually a fairly common trope in Harry/Tom Riddle stories. In some fics where Harry time travels to the 1930s, Dumbledore becomes extra wary after seeing the way that Harry and Tom interact because they remind him of himself and Gellert.

**** That really depends on what qualities you look for in a story.

For example, I think that [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1572322][Not a Good Man, But a Great One]] is a very well written take on how Harry and Tom Riddle might have developed differently if they had grown up together in the same generation. The story contains some moments in which Dumbledore sees uncomfortable parallels between Tom and his memories of a young Gellert Grindelwald.

** Either Cho or Ginny going all Dark Lady would be cool. Except Dumbledore was always academic, ambitious, and thought himself better than the masses, which is why Grindelwald appealed to him. Plus he had a real life experience that led him to think muggles should be kept under control.

Harry's experience and mantra would have to be different. I could see Harry falling into the line of thought that Muggleborns should be taken off muggles and raised in the wizard world. We have reason to believe, if we ignore the probability of lazy writing, that Hermione's parents weren't that great, so all we'd need is a couple more bad stories (Dean's mother blames him for her being a single parent? Resents him?) and Harry could start seeing the need.
