** There's this series, in which Harry's parseltonfue freaks everyone out except the Zabinis.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1199740]])

There's another where he's one of the friend group, where his mom is part of an Italian mafia-royalty thing. And when something stupid happens at Hogwaets he has the best temper tantrums. “I don't have to deal with this. I LITERALLY don't have to deal with this. There are four schools in Italy that I could just walk in and sit down.” I'll see if I can find it.

  It's summer, and Harry is with Blaise and his mother in Florence, discovering many things---among them, duplicity and what it's like to be in love.

** I have no suggestions but I've been searching for a good Blaise fic myself but haven't come across anything.

I assume you have read isolation by bex Chan tho? I've only gotten to ch 17. Tbh at this point it's not my fav dramione story but apparently Blaise shows up later and the story gets more interesting.
