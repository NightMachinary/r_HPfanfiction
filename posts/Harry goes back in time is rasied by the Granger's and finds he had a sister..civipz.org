:END:
From what I remember Harry went back in time for some reason. Ended up adoption by the Granger's.

At a (kindergarten?) He meets a girl who ends up being the sister he never knew existed.

Also blood relative from what I recall. Just wanted to make this part clear.


** It might be one of these?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything]] I'm pretty sure he had a sister in 30 minutes but the description you gave doesn't match how they met in it.

I think I remember something like you described and I have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7433305/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Grangers-take-on-the-world]] so it might be it.

  AU. Year 2148: Gobal Population: 1. He made a mistake 150 years ago or so and now the human race no longer exists. For a century or so, he has sought a way to fix it all. Can he, or is the end of the world inevitable?

  Harry and Hermione send their memories back to their younger selves to change the magical world for the better. Using economics and political power to achieve their goal. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing. HHR AU.
