Anybody recognize the fic?

If that's not enough info, here's more, but it's spoilers of course.

 

 

The ministry took both because they knew about the prophecy but didn't know which was the actual subject. Both of them needed continual expensive medical treatment because their bodies couldn't handle the magic/potions/rituals they were subjected to. When they identified Harry as the subject, they stopped paying for Neville's treatments.

Hermione guessed that avenging Neville was one of Harry's big motivations for his actions post-Voldemort, which included creating companies in the wizarding and muggle worlds and using them to end the statute of secrecy. The one in the wizarding world sold magical inventions based off of muggle technology and the one in the muggle world sold technology derived from magic.
