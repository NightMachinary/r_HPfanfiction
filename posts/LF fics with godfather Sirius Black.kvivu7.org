Basically I'm trying to find the best fics where Sirius Black actually gets custody of Harry and isn't just dumbledore's lackey.

When he starts doesn't matter, I'd be very interested in ones where he steps up immediately instead of handing Harry off to Hagrid of all people to chase pettigrew. Or anytime in Harry's life before the end of the main series. I'd prefer Sirius didn't die in the same manner or at all but I'm open to whatever.

Thanks in advance!


** Innocent by MarauderLover7 on FFN! Sirius saves Harry from the Dursleys when Harry is eight. Such feelgod. Much wow. I'm at chapter 60 of 80 and loved it so far.

*** Oh this one is so good and the Sequels (and (i don't know if they really are but I like to think so) the prequels) are great as well.

** I've been reading many of these. I don't know how to do the FFN links on here so will just copy/paste. He rescues Harry as a 7 year old. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993043/1/The-Letter]]

A Marauder's Plan but it's long as hell, it's very good though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]

This one is a bit nastier because Sirius gets revenge on...people: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254667/3/Black-Vengeance]]

This one is when Sirius gets revenge on the Dursleys. Dursley abuse here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13019706/1/Meeting-the-Godfather]]

Right now I'm reading this, Harry starts off as 11 and transitions from abusive Dursleys to Sirius who loves him. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11506150/1/My-Godfather]]

*** Those all sound really good in different ways, thanks so much.

It's a good little sub genre of HP fanfic, I also love slytherin Harry ones but I'm not much for him with draco, I don't mind it but I prefer the rare pair of daphne and Harry lol.

** It's a little smutty but linkffn(a godfathers promise) has sirius stepping up right away. More plot than smut but it doesmt really fade to black.

** I don't know how to use the bot, but RECNAC TRANSFAERSO by celebony is the first of a series of 2.5 fanfics (2 full stories, 1 one-shot) where Sirius getting custody and the two of them connecting is a large part of the story! Incredible series overall!
