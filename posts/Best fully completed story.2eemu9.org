** [[/u/deirox]] has a good list there. I've read all of those and enjoyed them. Jeconais has several completed fics that are worth a read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is pretty much my favorite author. His fics are a bit cracky, but they're amusing and fun to read. Here are two of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!]]

  It takes two thieves, a Dark Wizard, and a Tentacle Monster named Tim.

#+begin_quote
