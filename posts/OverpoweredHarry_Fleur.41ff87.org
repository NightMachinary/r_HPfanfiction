  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** When the writing style is so good, I think most people won't even bother checking if the hero is a Garystu or whatever. Or care about that.

I really wish I could find more fanfics like this: even if the plot sucked, and even if you encountered tropes that you dislike---not that I personally have that issue with this story--- through sheer ability the writer could still command you to simply read on.
