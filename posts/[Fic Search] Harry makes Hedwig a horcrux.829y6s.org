I think this was a Harry/Gabrielle Delacour fic, and Harry had died in one of the last chapters. I distinctly remember Gabby sitting by his grave, then Hedwig comes and we are led to believe that Harry had made Hedwig into a horcrux for himself. Does anyone know what fic this might have been?

*** Am I the only one who can't understand why this fic was so damn popular and why it's always recommended?

I mean it isn't bad but it certainly isn't deserving of the pedestal it's on. Just my take.

**** It's one of the only fics I know of where it's kind of Dumbledore bashing, only to be later revealed that Harry had completely misunderstood him and fucked up his carefully laid plans. I wasn't expecting it and it made me like it quite a lot.

**** Main reason I enjoyed the fic was that it was a Harry/Fleur fic that tried to be a little different. It didn't start with OP Harry saving Fleur and Gabrielle at the World Cup and then falling for each other. Granted I have many problems with it, especially after rereading it last month but as someone that wants more varied Harry/Fleur fics it scratched that itch.

  Lol, someone keeps downvoting you for disliking this story.
#+end_quote

Yeah, which is hilarious seeing as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4w61kw/what_story_wasted_its_potential_the_most/d64afu0/][I am on the record as saying it had a lot of potential until the summer happened.]]

  How can Harry be this smart, yet this oblivious.
#+end_quote

Entirely due to the influence of Slytherin's portrait which sent Harry down the spiral into darkness that he experienced through the entire fic.

I did actually really like how Dumbledore was portrayed, and was actually one of the only things keeping me in it (plus it was the first fic I had basically followed since publish date). I liked the juxtaposition of a Dumbledore who is trying to set everything up so that Harry will survive but all Harry-mentored-by-the-terrible-influence-of-Slytherin's-portrait sees is the stereotypical manipulative!Dumbledore we see so often in fanfic. It was one of the ideas to the story that I found actually really good.

********** Perhaps my favorite little bit in the whole story was Slytherin saying he did a highly complicated, potentially fatal blood ritual just so he would never experience a hangover.
