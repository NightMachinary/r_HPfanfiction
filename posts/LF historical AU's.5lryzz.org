*** With the revelation that one of HP's ancestors lived in the US way back in the day I always pictured him as a Solomon Kane type of Auror...alone and traveling the wilds, protecting the people from evil.

*** Sorry no, i'm not really interested in reading about OC's. I found some fics that would fit that requirement but they mostly just bored me.

If I wanted something like that i'd probably just read a different book that fits my requirement instead of fanfiction :)

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-3094]] [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-112]]

No present day character time travelling, and there is still a statute, but there is a sizeable amount of interaction with muggles. It ticks the other boxes, and is set during the American war of Independence. Requires minimal knowledge of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
