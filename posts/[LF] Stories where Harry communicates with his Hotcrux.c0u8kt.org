Pretty sure I've read at least one story where Harry's treatment but the Dursley's causes Tom to help him out and become some kind of messed up friend/companion..

Any ideas?

*** I'd read a crackfic where Voldemort was obsessed with being Harry's best friend.

“I just don't understand why you don't like me.”

“You killed my parents!”

“Oh, jeez, this again? That was, like, 15 years ago!”

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.

  ABANDONED. When Harry was five, he met his best friend: the sliver of another man's soul living inside of him. Things would never be the same again. Eventual HP/DM slash with other slash and non-slash couples.
