:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
When Harry purposely goes back to the past he somehow ends up at Hogwarts with Dumbledore. He wants to go about his life in the past without causing anyone there any issues. Dumbledore disagrees, says he should have support, and convinces him to contact the Potter family, Charlus, Dorea and James.

Either Dorea or Charlus, one of the two, dislikes Dumbledore. I can't remember why but I do remember it was more of a ‘distinctly unimpressed' air rather than any sort of bashing/manipulative Dumbledore, and has little to no effect on the story.

In the end they decide Harry will masquerade as James' younger twin brother. They decide on the story that because he was so powerful they got him schooled somewhere else but he decided he wanted to come to Hogwarts.

James and Harry play a prank on Sirius where he puts on James' glasses and pretends to be him. They follow up by doing this on Remus and Peter as well.

Harry meets Bellatrix when he was paired with her for a project in a class I can't remember. I know he began to like her, but thought she betrayed him when she cursed him in the back, but he wouldn't listen when she tried to say she didn't remember doing it. It comes to light the LeStrange brothers imperiused her?

Harry goes with Dorea to the Black family Christmas party. While there they discover Pollux signed some fucked up marriage contracts for his daughters and put off telling Arcturus until the point where he would have no choice to agree. Voldemort, Malfoy, and Lestrange (the elders) arrive at the dinner party to present the contract.

Harry debates with Voldemort and shows that he's a Parseltongue.

There's a way to buy out the contract as long as the deadline, midnight that same night, isn't passed. Harry has a trunk full of money from the future and pays the buyout.

The other part of the buyout is that he has to duel someone of the other person's choice. He ends up dueling Antonin Dolohov and kills him in said duel. I remember that a chapter specifically mentioned Dolohov was hopped up on something called the Draught of Rage?

There is an inter-school dueling tournament but Harry doesn't join it. He is instead invited by the minister to be England's champion in the international dueling champion. He has to go through the tryouts by dueling Britain's best for this.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
