:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello,

Latety I was looking for one of the stories I had read a long time ago and I found in my list old links from [[https://hpfandom.net][*hpfandom.net*]]*.* The whole site merged with AO3, so I can't find anything by links. So I wanted to ask if there is any way to find what these stories were. I have stories ids if you can help me. I already checked wayback machine. :-(

1.id=41097

2.id=7071

3.id=40043

4.id=24352

5.id=37521

6.id=47943

7.id=49063


** Being Captain Obvious here but did you google via author name or story title?

Assuming that you did do those searches or you only have the link ids and no author or story titles you may want to use the wayback machine and see what information they have on that site. With luck you could then find the stories you want.

** Damn sorry i missed that you said you already checked the wayback machine. Maybe send a note to the administrator of AO3 and ask for help?

Hopefully this will help in your search

** So you didn't have fic names? There is a whole collection with all the names [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/hpfandom]]

Or you could put the id in the old URL and it will automatically take you to AO3 that's what I did!

[[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=12892&i=1]]

So just cut off the end and add your id. It will be time-consuming but I hope well worth it!

*** Hi, thanks for your reply :-)

Unfortunettly old links take you only to the site with all works from hpfandom and as I said I don't even know what this works were only they id. And I think (I'm almost shure) that work imported to AO3 got new id on that site. And each link even with my ids takes you to notice about moving sites and that hpfandoms is merged with AO3.

Thanks for your help none the less.

**** When you contact them there seemed to be a user id of Hpfandom_archivist you might want to reach out to that user.
