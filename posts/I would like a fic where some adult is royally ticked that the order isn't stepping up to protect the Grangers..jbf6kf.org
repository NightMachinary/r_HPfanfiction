** Absolutely. The Order had plenty of warning, and they could put together safehouses rather quickly when they set their mind to it. Not creating a place for people who might be priority targets that can't defend themselves is good sense.

I'd like to kick in an add-in where the people are ticked that the Order is super patronizing about muggles. Not a Voldemort apologism fic, but they prop up Arthur Weasley as an expert on muggle technology. You know, the guy who doesn't know how to pronounce electricity, much less what it is. "Regularly mindwipe everyone for the crime of being around you" isn't exactly respectful.

** Why would they do that? They're just some Muggles.

** I think that during the fifth year they were not in immediate danger since Voldemort was trying to keep as quiet as possible until he regained all his forces. In book 6 we don't really see much of the Order and don't know what it's up to except for the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Also even then, Voldemort was more concerned in spreading terror by committing mass killings (in order to blackmail Fudge into resigning) and targeting high profile opponents (Amelia Bones, Dumbledore) or interrogating people that might be of help but did not want to associate with him (Fortescue, Ollivander). It might have been only in book 7 that Voldemort had the time to deal specifically with the likes of Grangers or the Dursleys, by which time the formers were in Australia and the latter were under Order protection.

**** Yeah, they were stretched so incredibly thin that they weren't able to protect Ted Tonks, the father of one of their members. /s

  The summer after Harry's fourth year would have been much better if just one person in his life had disregarded Professor Dumbledore's instructions to ignore him. And if that person was Hermione Granger? It would have been much, much better.
