I just dislike cauldrons, all that double, double, toil, and trouble doesn't really appeal to me. I kind of prefer Minecraft's potions in aesthetic. Any other thoughts? On fantasy aesthetics I mean.

Also how in the world did I get a down vote for saying I don't like an aesthetic?


** For a moment I thought this was some kind of sexual metaphor.

As for the actual containers... I mean, I am as indifferent to their looks as I am to the looks of those plastic food containers used to transport lunch

** IDK man this sub is really fckn prone to downvotes. Every post has like ten comments and two upvotes. I haven't been around long but something is off AF.

As for cauldrons...eh. They seem so old school. I wonder if any wizard has gotten ahold of one of those muggle protein powder shaker bottles and been like YES Ok this is what I am using from now on.
