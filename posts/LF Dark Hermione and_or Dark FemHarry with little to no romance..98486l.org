Looking for Dark Hermione and/or Dark femHarry fic's where romance plays no matter, whether that's because it's not there, or like canon, it's there briefly and is a background thing.

Tired of so many Dark Hermione/femharry fic's where they're only Dark because the fall in love with the /handsome, romantic, tragically misunderstood broody bad boys/ ala Malfoy(s), Lestanges, Rowle, Snape, Voldemort etc. (usually also because they become submissive and pretty much their sex slaves, which fookin annoys me like nothing else, Looking at you Anti-Heroine, that goes from a badass independant Hermione to one that happily becomes diary!Tom's fuctoy and lets him to whatever he wants to her and where later on pretty much half of every chapter is pure smut)

Preferably stuff like ACA, the Black Queen Series (even if that sometimes has more romance that I'd like, but it's so good it makes up for it), etc where Hermione/femHarry and powerful, ambitious, and (getting or already are) ruthless.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

I've been wondering what happened to that fic. I stopped reading it after the Dumbledore-bashing and the way Hermione is obsessively protective of Harry for no clear reason got to me.

*** That annoyed me too, but the rest of it made up for it to me, up till chapter 40th-something where Corporeal Diary Tom and Hermione started a sexual relationship that pretty much solely consists of Tom choking, whipping, burning, and otherwise beating Hermione for sexual pleasure, that Hermione not only does not stop, but encourages, and thereby after the first half of every chapter is rushed plot, while the second half is detailed extended smut.

That happening is enraging enough, but what really pissed me off was the fact the fic' had the gall to continue to claim that Hermione was still an independant, confidant, badass despite the fact she started whereing a collar 24/7, and that it was mutual even though while it was said occasionally that Tom would be on the returning side he NEVER was.

**** ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think I quit around when Hermione swore a nonaggression oath to Tom Riddle in exchange for him swearing one to Harry. Even then, I did /not/ expect it to go there.

** Hermione becomes a hilariously dark warlock in the Warcraft crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/Champions-of-the-Two-Worlds][Champions of the Two Worlds]], linkffn(12888333). She likes to drain souls from sentient beings, and has a chaotic evil alignment according to the author.

But well written dark Hermione is surprisingly rare, and completed ones even rarer.

She is quite dark in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341), but these two fics may contain too much romance for your taste.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
