I kicked around the idea for a second in my anthology and i may go back again on it since a lot of my stories have elements of transhumanism already.


** linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) There are a couple more with a similar concept of changing/improving the body through runes, but I'll have to look through my Favourites to find them.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

***** Thanks. It's something that's stuck with me ever since I finished my business course, and started working in management positions. I finish all written correspondence with a thanks(for them taking the time to read from me), and then my name(to introduce myself).

I got people complaining about it, but I thought i'd keep it up, because i'd rather annoy a few people, and stay in the habit of finishing letters/posts instead of forgetting about doing it, and losing possible clients.

Thanks,

Warryn.

** I know of two stories with physical alterations.

"Dead Man Walking" is about Harry coming from a more war oriented Universe into a more canon-esque. I guess you could call Harry in that story a magical cyborg. His home universe was a lot more war oriented and he didn't really learn Hogwars curriculum. Pretty damaged mentally. linkffn(12188248)

"The Art of Self Fashoning" is about non-bwl Harry. His parents share Neville's parents' canon fate. He makes it his goal to heal them and his way to do so is transfiguration. On his way he starts altering his own body with transfiguration to make him stronger, faster, etc. linkffn(11585823)

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Not quite what you were looking for, but parts of it may be interesting to you: this features a Harry who semi-permanently (I think?) transfigurates body parts of his into those of animals.

*** Not really. It's about anti-death-ism, which some might argue is a /component/ of transhumanism, but it doesn't go into altering the human body or mind beyond what might be necessary to guarantee immortality.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
