I've been looking for fanfics where muggles find out about how the magical world has treated them, and pushes back against them. I don't necessarily mean war, but at least confronting wizards about how, say, they are willing to obliviate people over and over without their consent, and how wizards don't use their healing abilities to help cure muggle illnesses and injuries. No Weasley bashing please, I'm pretty sick of it.

*** What a disgusting story. I mean, not like, style or quality wise, cause it's really well done, but it just shows the horribly disgusting side of the wizarding world.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.
