I was aware fairly early on that ship-specific subs were advertising the survey. I had no problem with this initially as it was simply publicising the survey.

However, since then there have been concerted efforts within these ship-specific subs to "win" the survey. A tidal wave of entries which only respond to the shipping questions began:

[[https://i.imgur.com/VjPPMi2.png]]

In a short period of time, these fake entries increased to become over 5% of the total survey entries. I closed the survey to further submissions in order to protect the results from becoming further tainted.

Once again, shippers ruin things for everyone. Specifically: Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione and Harry/Luna results are all tainted by brigading and cannot be relied upon.

But most of these people are likely random shippers, not hackers. Just don't tell them what the methodology is, and hide the data until the survey is complete. Then filter results appropriately before announcing and make methodology clear.

Anyone putting up an online survey on ANYTHING that *shows the results live* is just asking for trouble. We've known that for over 20 years.

After looking around, there is a way within Google Forms to delete individual poll responses.

I'm not an official spokesperson for that sub, but if you look there, brigading is officially against the subreddit's rules (Rule #6) and has been for a long time. The mods also finally ended up deleting the "we won" post, as I expected would happen. It isn't a very active sub, so I don't know that it generally needs a huge amount of moderator attention. Maybe mods should have shut this down more quickly, but seriously, your post is a bit overly dramatic.

There has always been a fanatic contingent among shippers on all sides. The Harmony sub has no control over their existence. I don't think most people there condone it. And if you read the Wiki there, you'll note that the sub was specifically created with a mission to avoid as much drama as often happens in shipping.

I'll agree with you that I've seen an increase in anti-other ship posts there in the past few months, a trend I find disheartening. But please don't judge a sub by a few bad actors.

Well, the post criticizing the brigading already has a net number of upvotes that's over half the number of upvotes the "We won" post got before it was taken down (if I recall correctly), and that number has been consistently rising. Clearly there are a lot of people who appreciate that sentiment.

Second, what do you expect in a comment thread? People don't post many replies saying, "Yeah, completely agree." When someone posts something taking a strong position, the loudest voices in comments are usually those who disagree.

Imagine if there were a general poll about fanfic universes that appeared on some small random website, and someone posted about it here. And a bunch of folks went over from here and helped make Harry Potter the top fanfic universe, completely overwhelming a site that wasn't expecting it.

And then someone here posts something to scold the members of [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Despite the brigading, are you seriously telling me there wouldn't be a lot of comments saying, "Well, Harry Potter is the best! Other fandoms likely voted in this too!"? Would you think it fair if someone posted a critical post of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] claiming this place is "terrible"?

*** Quite true, even though I'm a Harmony shipper. But, you also have to acknowledge that some Hinny shippers spam as well. I don't care I'm a goon but I'm also proud to be a Harmony shipper. I only took it once, just so you know.

No hate btw.

**** Funny thing, I specified Ginny as the preferred love interest for Harry, /but/ I also specified Harry as the preferred love interest for Hermione. I don't grok the bickering-as-a-sign-of-affection relationship between Ron and Hermione. Apparently it works for some people?

Viktor Krum might theoretically be an option, but he's really not developed enough to be sure. And I've seen some Harmony fics that were quite well done, even though I find a lot of others OOC.

Actually, Ron/Hermione was working out in Nightmares of Futures Past, because Hermione and especially Ron have some character growth and the aforementioned bickering mostly stops.

**** No, but given that your sub was the most successful, had the most "let's win this" and "we won this /survey/" posts and responded negatively to one of your own community member's posts on how responding multiple times to a survey is disingenuous, it was probably fair game to complain about Harmony supporters spamming survey responses.

Not that the original commenter didn't even claim that other subs are innocent.

***** They singled out one ship in their comment. Your argument comes off as disingenuous, as if they ‘didn't mention the other ships' even though HG,HL, and HH were all involved.

Clearly if one of us made a post, you can see that we still don't support this kind of behavior.

*** I went through the survey once and when it came time to vote for my preference, I voted for Harry/Hermione because that is my preferred ship. I didn't care how many users voted for Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, or the other pairings due to the fact that in the end, none of it really matters. If that makes me a “Harmony goon”, then I'm damn proud to be a Harmony goon. Peace, love, and no h8!
