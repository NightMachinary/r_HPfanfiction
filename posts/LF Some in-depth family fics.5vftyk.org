I don't care whether it's slash or not (I have a weakness for Severtius despite knowing how OOC it is, haha) just no next gen please. I hate Harry/Ginny with a passion though I don't mind a fic where they're friends as little kids.

I would prefer something when Harry/whoever are young kids (definitely pre Hogwarts) since I don't read a lot of that normally.

I would love something without a lot of pairings if any. If I have to have a pairing, I would want on the parents but not the kids themselves. No soul bound please.

I also need something fluffy or at least not angst/abuse, I've been going through a rough patch lately and would rather read some lighter stuff for a while.

Edited for a bit of clarity.

** I think the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry Verse]] would be just what you're looking for. It is a series where the first fic is Remus/Sirius and they steal Harry from the Dursley's when he is 8 and raise him. Then the other books in the series is an AU starting with Harry's first year and he is sorted Slytherin and becomes best friends with a Hufflepuff Draco, Gryffindor Neville and Ravenclaw Padma. It's really good and I think meets all of your requests.

** It's linked in the comprehensive post [[/u/TheBlueMenace][u/TheBlueMenace]] wrote, but I feel like I should back linkffn(Living With Danger) up a bit. It's the most family-oriented fic I've read in this fandom, and pretty much fits your request to a T.

I never got much further than the first year of Hogwarts, which is actually like two books in, but the growth and cameraderie of this ramshackle family is expounded upon in such a way that it's stuck with me despite it being a while since I've read the fic. Good for the soul. Best of luck in your search! ☆
