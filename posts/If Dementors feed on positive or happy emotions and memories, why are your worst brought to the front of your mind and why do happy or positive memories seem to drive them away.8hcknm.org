It's entirely possible that I've simply missed the canon explanation - it's been many years since I've re-read PoA. But, in the chance that canon doesn't fully explain this, feel free to post your favorite headcanons, below.

While we're here, what's your favorite explanation for the relationship between a Patronus and a Dementor that you've seen in fanfiction?


** It is said that they glory in despair. So, they feed happiness and positivity, but it's not that they want it. It's more like they want it out of the way because creating despair is the ultimate goal. That's their preferred environment. That's why they don't affect the happiest people more but instead the people who have serious trauma in their past. Note that they're not feeding in the sense that they're 'consuming' it. The happiness comes back. It seems more like a scary movie where some unseen force starts snuffing out the lights so that you're left in darkness. In the dark, you're left to imagine and expect the worst things.

If the main goal is despair, that also explains the Patronus. A Patronus is just pure emotion. They can't suck away happiness to get to despair because there is no despair. If there is no despair, there is no darkness and you can't turn off the light.

*** To quote the relevant passage:

#+begin_quote
  "Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they *drain* peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be *sucked out of you*. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life."

  ---Remus Lupin's description of Dementors
#+end_quote

They sound more like vacuum cleaners sucking happiness away (and into a bottomless void of abyssal darkness) than creatures nourishing themselves on emotion. And that last line, maybe that's how they breed.

** Dementors feed on your happy memories so only the worst are left in there for you to experience.

I'm not sure for the second question but perhaps happy memories don't drive them away but instead they feed on them and go away with them. Something like that.

Well, yes, that makes sense. But that explanation really only makes sense for prisoners who've spent a large amount of time around Dementors and have, thusly, had most of their positive memories eaten away.

In PoA and throughout the series we see that they /immediately/ bring negative or traumatizing memories to your mind. Which doesn't make sense if they're trying to feed on /positive/ ones.

Dear God, though, could you imagine if Dementors made you relive your positive memories as they slowly ate away at them? It's one thing to fight against feeling or reliving negative memories, but can you imagine how much more effective they'd be if they were sort of aphrodisiacal?

It seems to literally cause them discomfort. Patronuses (Patroni?) are described as driving Dementors away, not luring them away from a victim.

** I like what others have said about this, and the depression analogue makes a lot of sense, but I have never liked the fact that if the dementor gets close enough, quickly enough, then most people would be incapable of summoning a corporeal patronus in time. Take Harry in the third book, he had to save himself literally after the fact. If time magic hadn't been involved, he would be dead. And with depression, happiness isn't always enough. That's why I favor the idea that it is possible to make a patronus from neutral memories, memories of perseverance and determination. It won't drive the dementor away like a happy patronus, but it will hold it off until you can escape or find some other solution. Instead of white, it would be grey. It would even be possible to have a different patronus for your neutral memories, if the source of your determination is different than the source of your happiness.

This is drawn from Sirius talking about how he stayed sane in Azkaban. "I was innocent. It wasn't a happy memory, so they couldn't take it away." I feel like this could be extended into a situation where the dementor is right upon you, and you couldn't summon up the necessary happiness. But within everyone is a will to live, and they could draw upon that instead.

** A Patronus is not a happy memory. We know what memories look like from when people extract them to place them in a Pensieve. A Patronus is a magical guardian. It just so happens that the casting process involves a happy memory.

  The Patronus is the most famous (and famously difficult) defensive charm. The aim is to produce a silvery-white guardian or protector, which takes the form of an animal. The exact form of the Patronus will not be apparent until the spell has been successfully cast. One of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind, the Patronus can also be used as a messenger between wizards. As a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope (the recollection of a single talisman memory is essential in its creation) it is the only spell effective against Dementors. The majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce Patronuses and to do so is generally considered a mark of superior magical ability.

It seems to be happienes derived from the happy memory rather then the memory itself that the Paronus is made of.

** I've been operating under the theory that Lupin is quoting the common but erroneous belief that they eat good memories, and that may be why Harry has better success teaching the DA how to cast the Patronus charm. He tossed away the 'what do Dementors want' question and focused on teaching the students how to bring about a protector made of positivity. After all, if you were faced with a demon who eats happy thoughts, would you want to offer up your best as a shield? That's like flinging steaks at hyenas, on the assumption that if you throw them hard enough, the hyenas might be traumatized by meat overload.

In my head-canon, Dementors drain away willpower and force the mind away from happy thoughts, as those are the ones that can be used to hurt them. This correlates to their meaning as a representation of depression.

Also, it's not like your memory of the awesome eighth birthday with the new bike and best cake actually disappears from your mind, never to be remembered again. The Dementors just make remembering that your world /isn't/ entirely a dystopic nightmare very difficult, so they can bathe in your angst.

*** That's not a bad idea - Dementors making you feel miserable is a defense mechanism against the magic that can be used to defeat them, while their only ultimate goal is to suck out your soul.

This explains why Sirius didn't seem to actually forget anything after his escape, why the lower functioning brain of his animagus form protected him from the madness of being surrounded by dementors, as well as why that madness is caused in the first place - long-term depression in addition to extreme isolation is sure to make anyone insane.

** This was explained. Dementors feed on your happy memories so bring out more despair, so the point of the Patronus is to get it to feed on that instead, according to Lupin, thus shielding you from its effects. Suppose it would be akin to trying to eat too much food. It's technically edible, but you have limits beyond which you'll get hurt.
