Hello guys,

​

I started reading all the "/Discovering The Legend"/ fics of /RoseDragonWitch/.

But in the Goblet of Fire, the chapter *Flesh, Blood and Bone* (chapter 36) jumps to the chapter *The Parting of the Ways* (chapter 41)*.* That means that there're two chapters missing, The Death Eaters and Priori Incantatem. Two of the best chapters of book.

I was reading it on fictionhunt, here's the link: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8493913/1]] .

It's an amazing job and I tried to contact the autor but sadly I didn't get an answer.

So I was wondering If someone knows where to read those chapters or even If someone has them on pdf or something.

​

Thank you in advance!


** Fairly sure they're gone. I spent a long time looking for them before and couldn't ever find them.

*** That's a pity. Finishing The Goblet Of Fire won't be the same without those chapters.

Let's hope sometime we'll be able to read them!

Thank you anyway.

*** Like I said, truly unfortunate. I would be awesome that the author upload just those chapters, but she seems to have turn the page hahaha

Thanks for your answer

*** It's one of those fics where the characters read the books.

**** Yeah, It was quite well written and reading the interactions between the characters was really interesting. But alas, it isn't complete.
