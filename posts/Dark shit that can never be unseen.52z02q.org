I want your darkest, grittiest, most life scarring fics you can provide. In case you didn't notice, I am in a really dark mood (Listened to a song where the guy went to space and his friend... shit happened to his friend).

*** The "special punishment" in the opening stanzas was gratuitous and added little to the plot, but beyond that, I thought this fic stacked up well and examined some dark elements in a clever way.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** I don't...I don't remember who wrote these, but Lucius skullfucking (dead) Draco and Dementors raping Lucius. Two fics, same author, I think. The latter was the worst. It was a literal, what the fuck did I click I CANT LOOK AWAY FUCK FUCK ABORT ABORT CANT thing. (I have a habit of having to finish ALL books and ALL fics...no matter how god awful they are. I can't leave things unread.) I think the author started with 'am' and ended in 1? I dont remember. I've tried to block it out.

In this AU, that's quite a bit more than you'd expect.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dryad/RA.html][Rising Above by Dryad]] is one of the more graphic, disturbing SSHG stories I remember reading. It's complete and involves torture, rape, sex slaves, and more all in the name of bringing down Voldemort. I haven't read it in years but I think it fits your criteria.

  When Vernon Dursley's abuse escalates to unbearable levels, Harry Potter makes a deal that gives him incredible power at the tips of his fingers. Ten years down the line he's going to have to pay for it, but a lot can happen in ten years.
