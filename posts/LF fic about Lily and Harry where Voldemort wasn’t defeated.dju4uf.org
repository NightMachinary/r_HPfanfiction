This is driving me crazy. I'm trying to remember the name of a story that had the following premise: The war against Voldemort continued and was much grittier than in canon. Lily is rounded up with Harry and put in a ghetto/internment camp for Muggleborns. They meet Hermione there as well. Does this sound familiar to anyone?


** And the Wolves all Cry?
