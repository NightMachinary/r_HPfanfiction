[Hypothetical alternate timeline, in which Harry is the result of a Lily/Snape affair. Snape doesn't realize this until he sees the resemblance during Harry's first year.]

Obvious changes:

- Neville would probably be the actual chosen one, instead; though most people will still believe it is Harry.
- Harry is more likely to wind up in Slytherin. He may even have a personality different enough to not resist this.
- Drarry is more likely. [I'm admitting I'm a Drarry fan.]

Less obvious? I'm up for discussion as to how much this would change events; if Harry would have different friends; still have had similar hijinx; etc. Defining the beginning as this different would wrinkle through the rest of the story...

** Not sure where the notion came up that this would cause the changes you assume. Lily still dies protecting her son from Voldemort, initiating a sacrifice that destroys the Dark Lord (at least his body), leaving a scar with a piece of soul within. Assuming the Marauders were only beginning to suspect that Lily's son isn't James', James would still lay down his life in defense, Sirius would still offload the secret-keeper duty onto Wormtail, and the Wizarding world lauds Harry 'Potter' for saving their collective tushies.

Neville is still nobody. None of this changes Harry's potential sexual orientation. What does change is that Harry won't need glasses and will tend to be less attractive- sharp features, hook nose, limp hair and pale complexion (though this would be offset by the Dursleys forcing him into the sun to do gardening, the base tone would still be 'whiter shade of pale').

Harry wouldn't have any particular gift with brooms but he'd probably be smarter and more calculating.

Probably the biggest early change would be that he wouldn't inherit the Cloak of Invisibility- he has no claim to it. In fact, it might have to be passed to the next most direct descendent of Potter, which for all we know is Sirius... or Voldemort, as he's also a Peverell descendant.

If you want to monkey-wrench it further, Lily would be kicked to the curb by James before the sacrifice play. She might approach Snape to entreat his aid, only to find out he's neck-deep with them (of course, this might be the beginning of three acts of defiance from Snape that could drag him into the prophecy's influence, so this is looking likely). Of course, sheltering Lily and Harry would not involve James dying, Pettigrew betraying his friends or Sirius going to Azkaban, and Snape wouldn't sacrifice himself given that he's been living a Slytherin life up to that point (not to mention he's the character you're wanting to explore as well, right?).

So maybe Snape sequesters Lily, Wormtail overhears them somehow and finds the hidey hole but doesn't know which of the Dark Lord's followers had set it up. He leads the Dark Lord back to Lily and the sacrifice play goes into effect. Dumbledore reports that the Dark Lord has been defeated by Lily Potter, except James has already disavowed her and so looks like an ass. Albus won't hand Harry over to Snape because Snape avoided confronting the Dark Lord for the sake of his own survival, so Lily's sacrifice doesn't include his blessing. Harry still goes to the Dursleys to sustain the protection. The world doesn't hear about Fidelius charms. Snape might kill Wormtail to protect his involvement with Lily, or at least try to.

All sorts of hijinks can ensue.

Still doesn't make him gay.

** First of all, Lily Evans Potter is on a pedestal and you cannot bring her down! How dare you!

Ehem...

Should James find out and kick her to the curb, she might to to Snape who goes down the defiance road and fulfills the prophecy only to end up dying along with Lily trying to protect Harry.

James meanwhile becomes Professor of Potions (coveting the Transfig position Minerva holds) and hates Harry "Potter" with every fiber of his being. This child represents the bastard that stole the love his life AFTER they were married. He is the personification of betrayal.

Yet he has Lily's eyes and James ends up as a father figure / mentor.

This is a story I can get behind...even if I still feel sick thinking about Lily letting that thing touch her. I'd totally be on James' side in hating Harry (or at least understand much better than I ever did Snape)

** I saw a one-shot in which this was the case. To further complicate matters, Snape was also Harry's bastard.

** I considered this for my story as a random idea that came to me, but it leads to a lot of questions and situations I wasn't sure I wanted to deal with. Does Snape know? How will he react when he finds out? How does he find out? When? Will he try to get custody of Harry? I didn't want to write a Severitus, so..

Why wouldn't Harry still be the BWL? The hat wanted to put him in Slytherin in canon, he insisted against it because of what Ron and Hagrid had said about Slytherin and Malfoy's behavior. Assuming he was still raised by the Dursleys, there's no reason to assume his personality is much different.

** This trope was a common theme for Severitus stories back in the day. Either the product of an affair or rape (typically done as part of a Death Eater initiation ritual or loyalty test), Harry would be shown to be Snape's progeny and there'd be some sort of angsty drama afterward. Like Azkaban stories, they had their moment in the sun and most such stories are pretty forgettable now.

I see no reason why Harry/Draco tongue hockey would be more likely, to be honest. Both Harry and Draco are heterosexual in canon, as are James and Snape. It would seem that neither genetic nor environmental factors would meaningfully contribute to a change in their orientations.
