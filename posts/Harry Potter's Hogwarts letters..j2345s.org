So Harry gets his first letter a week or two before the 31st when he had to reply by.

So why did more and more letters keep coming each day before he had responded?


** The Dumbledore bashers will probably tell you that it was because Dumbledore knew all about the Dursleys and wanted to...I don't know, prove a point or something?

But I think it's more likely that it was just an automated system going out of control. Perhaps the system can detect when letters are destroyed so it can send a new one. Owls aren't perfect after all, so sometimes accidents happen. Maybe the designer thought "If the owl didn't make it to the student, it's probably because they have a particularly vicious kneazle. We'd better send two owls this time to make sure one gets through." Then exponential growth happens and the Dursleys are flooded with letters.

** Canon never gave the reason, so you are free to think whatever you want :

- Some overzealous House Elves asked to send the letter
- The whole system of students acceptance is automated by a spell, which automatically double the number of letter send to a prospective student each day until it receive a response
- Dumbledore (or any other teacher) played a trick on the Dursley, while giving them a chance to do "the right thing" and tell Harry the truth
- Anything else really

** The reason is purely Doylist, really. It's funny. I doubt Rowling thought about it past that.

Watsonian, I honestly am not sure. Even for wizards, having thousands of letters appear in a muggle neighborhood is absolutely bonkers. Could be explained as anything from malevolence on Dumbledore's part to him playing a joke and thinking it's funny. People do have odd senses of humor sometimes.

** I do wonder what Harry would have done if Hagrid hadn't come along in person. He was sent a letter to a muggle home telling him to reply by owl. Even if the Dursleys had explained about magic, I don't suppose they could tell him where to get hold of a magical owl.

*** The owl stayed behind to receive the reply.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238280/][/Of Letters and Lists/]] introduced me to the idea that the excess letters were caused by accidental magic on Harry's part. It's an elegant explanation for the entire event.
