In book 4, Barty Crouch Jr. is using Polyjuice Potion to take the shape of Mad-Eye Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. In order to maintain his disguise, he needs to drink a fresh dose every hour, and rather than pay someone in Knockturn Alley to supply him with Polyjuice when he runs low, he steals the ingredients necessary to brew a fresh batch from Snape's inventory of ingredient storage, despite the fact that this would be very likely to advertise to anyone who finds out that somebody is brewing Polyjuice Potion.

At one point, Snape busts him, and he bluffs his way out by claiming that Dumbledore ordered him to search Snape's office. The only thing that saves Crouch from having to duck a school-wide manhunt is Snape blaming Harry Potter for the theft because of both his hatred for the kid, and the fact that some of Harry's possessions coincidentally ended up near the scene of the crime.

That was a close shave. But what if Crouch Jr wasn't so lucky and ended up getting caught and outed well before the third Triwizard task ? What changes for the rest of year 4 (besides Cedric Diggory living)?


** Unless it's Dumbledore, BCJ probably escapes to live a little longer. If it's Harry who catches him, he probably gets kidnapped. If it's not, there's a good chance he or Pettigrew place Karkaroff (or maybe Bagman) under the Imperius Curse to finish the job. Fudge might also be willing to believe Moody.

  When Harry went to see what Barty Crouch was doing in Snape's office in his 4th year, he managed to just miss the trick step of the staircase on his way to the dungeons -- what's going to happen now? Read on to find out! Compliant till a part of the chapter "The Egg and the Eye" of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
