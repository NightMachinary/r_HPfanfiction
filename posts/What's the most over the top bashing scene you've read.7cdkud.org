I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2547058/9/Silver-Shadows][Silver Shadows]] where Dumbledore and the order decide to sneak into Harry's house in the middle of the night to find him, ambush his housekeeper, inadvertently burn the place down with his kid still inside, then Molly starts ranting at Harry (who's become so edgy nobody recognizes him) for probably being a terrible parent in front of the still burning building and it only gets funnier from there.


** Harry Potter and The Girl Who Lived has Harry meet a female version of himself in another dimension. In the narrative, Harry is thinking about how his world turned out, and he thinks about his friendships ended; Ron went crazy when he realized Hermione had unrequited feelings for Harry, so he raped and killed her.

I read that and just noped out, because it just came so far out of left field.

Yes, I am Harry's Brother has some serious Snape bashing. People kept recommending it as a great fic, but pretty much all the teachers are bashed. I dropped it when Snape stunned Vinny and Harry in Dumbeldore's office, joked about destroying Lily's portrait (or something, he did something evil to it) and said that there was nothing Dumbledore could do about it because Snape is too useful to him.

Seriously that fic is so bad.

*** There was crazy Dumbledore bashing in that first one too. He seems perfectly alright until the end, where he tries murdering Rose (fem!Harry) for not signing over the credit to Voldemort's defeat.

*** I think I've read that before,+there's another fic with a similar premise and+ harry falls in love with his female counterpart. Ron was portrayed to be a huge asshole who thinks it's a given that he and fem-harry should be together since they're friends or some bullshit. Had an interesting plot about them sharing a soul since there's two of them in the same universe, and that meant that their personalities were merging with each other's and they're essentially playing a tug-of-war with their soul, but it was ruined by questionable writing and that ridiculous dumbledore plot that came out of no where at the end.

I wish I dropped it earlier on

***** Huh, I didn't realize that they were the same one, I just remembered Hermoine being alive at the start but I guess the ron scene happened later in the series. My bad.

At least now I can feel better since I only read one bad fic instead of two, but really that was a heck of a shitshow.

** I can't remember the name of the story, but it was one that proposed what would have happened if Harry had kept the interest he had in his school books when he first bought them and met Hermione first. For a while I was liking the fic and it was holding my interest. The first sign that there would be bashing was when they met Ron on the train and he was being a brat, but I wasn't that worried about it. In my naive little mind I thought that Harry and Hermione would just ignore him and that he would pop up sparingly as a bratty background character and that would be it.

Sadly, I was dead wrong. Once the sorting ceremony came up Harry was sorted into Hufflepuff, 'cause his new friendship with Hermione was dominating his personality by that point, and the bashing shit hit the fan. Ron silenced the cheering about Harry's sorting by shouting "Harry Potter is a duffer!" and proceeded to have a titty tantrum on stage. He was so incoherent and volatile that one of the professors had to drag him out of the room, threatening to expel him.

Suffice it to say that I dropped that shit like a hot potato. I could have handled a mild bash, like the bratty background Ron I thought I was getting when I read their first meeting, but that shit was bonkers, and for me, came completely out of no where.

*** Now, I wonder, why did the author write their Ron that way? Was it to set up a source of recurring conflict that would help to establish Harry's character? Was this Ron's attitude representative of Hogwarts as a whole and thus establishing information about the setting? Was it a comedy skit?

Now I'm wondering, what if someone parodied that kind of ridiculous bashing by just introducing a parade of painfully-transparent OCs to be punished, humilated and tortured on a regular basis to show off how cool and edgy their Harry is.

"Hello, I'm Oliver Cromwell, OC for short. I'm a Slytherin and I'm here to throw a horribly-painful castration curse at you that you'll easily reflect back at me. Excrucio Castrato...Arghlefargle."

"Detention for the rest of the school year and the 2 years after that and one hundred thousand points from Slytherin! A thousand points to Gryffindor for Harry for showing off an excellent reflecting charm, plus another hundred for each of the dozen curses he punished this wicked Slytherin with!"

** I was reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/7/H-J-Potter][H J Potter]] when Hermione revealed herself as a virulent religious homophobe, calling gay people deviant sinners. Then Dumbledore revealed that Hermione had learned all of her homophobia from her grandmother, who had actually been a Squib and a Nazi collaborator during WW2 and Grindelwald's war.

Then Hermione got her magic "sealed" and her memories Obliviated, and she was expelled from Hogwarts and the magical world for stealing books from the Hogwarts library.

Ron is depicted as mentally challenged rather than evil though. It's basically Movie Ron diled up to 11.
