Aside from being in an unfamiliar world with only impressions of your loving family and childhood, magic itself knows you don't belong here, and it doesn't quite know what to do with your temporal entanglement.

Any and all attempts at divination reveal to you only eternal cold after heat death. Your attempt at the animagus ritual is successful, congratulations, but your form is an animal that hasn't inhabited the world since the Cambrian Period. Age lines explode in proximity to you. Time turners rattle when you look at them. Your wand apparently claimed you as its wielder three generations before Garrick Ollivander crafted his first wand. These instances are starting to pile up, and you don't exactly have an alibi.

Edit: some people seem to be under the impression that I listed all the instances of magic hating you. Oh no. Here are some more example. · It's either canon or fanon, don't remember which, that there's a charm that acts as a clock. Guess what class you fail the day you learn that one. · Ghosts see you at various physical ages that aren't correct. · The mending charm apparently reverses some affects of time on objects, that's how it works, you're told. Oh no. Now you've worn it further. · The trace registered you accidental magic in spats decades before you had them. The unspeakables are probably on the warpath as we speak. Run. · A portrait of you can slip through time and timelines alike when travelling portrait frames. · Maybe you cam decide that since gravity is connected to time, like, in physics, the leviosa charm is way over or underpowered at random. Ah geez. Now it's backwards. · Transfigured animals might just turn into prehistoric nightmares at random.

The point is, something is noticeably, extremely wrong with you.


** Well, the easy answer would be to take Muggle studies and treat it as a free period or comedy break.

We see exactly one age line, and unless you're suicidal, you ought to be staying away from it anyways.

As for Ollivander, he's hardly going to post that stuff in the Daily Prophet, so it's a curiosity at best.

And honestly, given what will go down in Britain in a few years, getting out of there ASAP should be a priority.

If your family are muggles it might be easier as they are more likely to be properly horrified by the way that the wizards run things. Are other places really that much better though? I mean, they don't have Voldemort coming up, sure, but I mean the general state of things.

If your family is magical, well, most things you'd be able to tell them would be just a part of life to them, I'd expect. It's what they're accustomed to.

Convince parents, muggle or not that I am a Seer. 1992 Euro cup Denmark beats Germany ( I watched it with a German friend in a pub, he was so upset), now they believe me. The pound will collapse in late '92 (I remember because my employer lost a lot of money over that). So they short the £ & win big. Then tell them (and Gringotts) buy Iomega, sell in 1996 (saw it in MSNBC back then). Rich parents. 1997 Gringotts proxy bets on Frankie Dettori magical 7 in September (250/1 odds). Now they are sure I am the real deal. If you follow racing you know about that day. Goblins extend credit happily. World Cup 98 France win vs Brasil, France win Euro 2000, more easy money. In 98 I visit Google founders in Standford and become early investor with now confident Gringotts partners (" Here's $10m for a measly 20%"). By 2010 I am well known billionaire, invest in Tesla early when Musk was desperate. Just imagine... All this just from memory. And Iphone came around... 2008? but the important thing is, AAPL was under $8 in 2000.

All this would make Goblins so rich they might start a new wizarding war and win it. Don't care. Wizards are arrogant pro slavery supremacists, who routinely obliviate pittiful muggles. And that's the good guys. Bad guys are into muggle domination and human sacrifices and always one step away from winning. Fuck them.

In the six hundred-odd years since Flamel created it, no one seems to have been able to repeat the feat.

This means that one of the following is true:

1. The stone is beyond the understanding of nearly every wizard; maybe even Flamel himself. - You're boned.
2. Flamel actively stops people from researching it. - You're definitely boned.
3. Whoever may have actually done it has managed to stay hidden. - You may have a chance.

****** Think about it this way - they're 600-something years old, by this point they've probably milked magic for all its worth if nothing then from sheer boredom; they're most likely are living/hiding in a big muggle city, because its easier to hide themselves and their one-of-a-kind lead-to-gold life elixir rock like a needle in a haystack, sure beats hiding in magical villages where everyone knows everyone and gossip is inevitable; it's 1990s - technology is improving extremely fast, and the Internet is becoming widespread and available to most households, and since they're not living under a rock somewhere (they'd go crazy if they were alone for so long) they are perfectly aware of that; and since they made it this far through 2 world wars and seen things improve A LOT, things are GETTING INTERESTING, look at the Internet it's everywhere its everything, you're bored - go talk to random person on the other side of a fucking world or watch one of millions of youtube videos, do you honestly think they would just give up, roll over and die? Or give up their only source of immortality they kept perfectly safe for previous 600 years from likes of Grindewald and others?

Now with all this in mind, I think they just gave Dumbledore the decoy just to +make him go away+ fake their own death on the off chance it gets stolen/destroyed. No fucking way, they kept at it for 600 years, what's 10 more years in hiding from a "dark wizard" that wants their rock?

And of course those time turner's must be the most important thing in this fic, because timey-wimey wibbly-wobbly magic is far too few and between otherwise if you want to concentrate on the not belonging.

So suddenly you'll find out that each House Head has 5 Time Turners in their drawers, 1 for each year of extra subjects, meaning that in theory there could be about 20 Hermione-esque students walking about in Hogwarts that could dramatically gasp and grab their buzzing necklace when the SI comes near.

That would not totally be unrealistic, because Barty Crouch Jr can't be the only one to get 12 NEWTs.

Imagine your SI being in the office of a Head of House for one reason or another, and immediately a drawer starts to rattle? Not once, but every single time...

What would happen if they fall in with DA and go to the ministry as well? What would happen in the Time Room? Would that be the climax of the story? A Deux Ex Machina where the SI finally communicates with Magic about what the heck is going on?

***** I love Hermione dearly but it's so easy to mess with her - just pretend that something you made up is real, and convince/pay the other students to agree with you. if Ravenclaws in canon weren't written to be the massive disappointments they are, I could easily see them all agreeing with luna about her creatures just to fuck with the bossy Gryffindor, regardless of how they feel about luna personally. sidenote - jk really said that Ravenclaws are creative and intelligent, and then made them into a bunch of close-minded assholes. I can't express how much of a contradiction that is. it's almost like she wrote every other house as two-dimensional extras and then used a random selection method to decide which house the current asshole student would be in...

** The Divination would probably strike people as weird, but besides being kind of uncommon Divination is known to be a woolly subject so it would likely be a minor curiosity at best.

The animagus thing would be really easy to explain; the fact most wizards have a modern animagus is probably just because they feel a certain degree of kinship with that animal. Just say "I've always admired the noble trilobite" and they'll all just smile and nod.

The wand thing probably wouldn't even raise an eyebrow, we don't know when Fawkes donated his feathers but it doesn't strike me as at all unreasonable that he donated both at the same time, which, considering how old Voldemort is, probably means Harry's wand has been sitting on a shelf since the 30's or so. I wouldn't be surprised if it was more or less standard practice for wandmakers to just try and have one of each type of possible wand available, which sounds hard but really isn't considering that Olivander's at least only uses three wand cores and maybe like three dozen types of wand wood, across a fairly narrow average spread of wand sizes. Umbridge had an 8" wand which was considered unusually short but Harry's was 11" which is apparently kind of average and is only 3" longer. If we assume that the standard distribution goes from 8" to 14" at 1/4" increments then we only have 24 different wand lengths, times [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods][38 wood types]], times 3 core varieties, then there are only 2,736 possible standard wands, which really isn't that much in the grand scheme of things. Heck, it probably means there are a fair number of wizards walking around with identical wands (aside from the specific animal a core came from, which doesn't seem particularly important in most cases).

As others have pointed out, both age lines and time turners are super rare, so those are basically non-issues.

Overall, kind of a neat idea but it seems like only minor flavouring on an otherwise standard SI template.

** The heat death prediction is actually scarier than it appears on the surface, because it assumes that entropy wins in the end despite magic flying in the face of it in anything that doesn't involve organic life. In other words, it predicts the discovery and genocide of anything magical enough to prolong the existence of stars.

** So if I understand, the MC isn't from 2020 going back to Harry's time in 1991 but a character from the distant past going forward to 1991? The cambrian creature animagus and the wand from 3 Ollivander generations back gave me that impression.

That would be interesting because we would get a character that really knows nothing about the magical world since he or she didn't have any books or movies to read or watch. I would like to see a story about how someone who has no knowledge of any the events try to live in that world and deal with the problems you mentioned.
