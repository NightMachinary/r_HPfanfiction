Welp, I'm officially burnt out from all the stories where Harry gets a bunch of women, that honestly could all just be copied and pasted from each other and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So give me these exact same fics, but with a different character at the centre instead. Assuming that many even exist. Not looking for anything especially well thought out or well written, just something I can mindlessly enjoy.

** I mean, technically, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Harem War), LOTS of male characters get harems, down to Remus Lupin and Frank Longbottom. I don't think I'd recommend the fic to anyone though . . .

**** It is pretty Harry focused, but that's really, really, really the least of the fic's problems. But people other than harry have a harem . . .

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi
