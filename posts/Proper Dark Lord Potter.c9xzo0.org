I was reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business by esama]] when I realized that I never read a proper Dark!Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] is close, but Harry started his Dark Lordship for a good cause, not as a selfish one.

I'm not looking for Death Eater Harry that joins Voldemort, 'Dark' Harry that kills and tortures the purebloods in the war against Voldemort, Dark Harry that tortures Muggle/Muggleborn for fun, Harry that experiment with Dark Arts to cure his family, or anything like that. I'm looking for Dark!Harry that tried to take control of Britain and using any methods he can. I don't really care if Harry is successful or not, as long as we see the process of how he tried to take control.

I'm not opposed to Mentor!Voldemort or Mentor!Death Eater as long as Harry only used them to get knowledge. In the end Harry still take complete control and his path to power wasn't affected by his mentor.

â€‹

P.S. I'm not complaining If you got fanfiction similar to The Sum of Their Part. Although I'm pretty sure I have read any other good ones.


** Is there a pairing in Emperor for Harry?

*** Harry/Muggle OC. It's not heavy on romance, so whoever Harry ends up with doesn't really matter.

** Linkffn(Something like your family)

Dark-ish Harry and other muggleborns completely destroy the pureblood society of Britain. Not much dark magic but seriously evil unconventional measures.

*** Thanks! This sounds fun and pretty short. I'll read it soon.

Edit: Wait, I think I've read this. Isn't this the one where Harry drugged the purebloods so they can't have children and ended up impregnating everyone with his sperm?
