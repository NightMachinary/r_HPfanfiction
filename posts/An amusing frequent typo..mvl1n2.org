Since it's used in a context where it makes /sense/, it always takes me an extra second to make the mental correction when an author accidentally introduces sign language into a fic:

#+begin_quote
  “Thank Merlin,” she signed.
#+end_quote

What is the BSL sign for Merlin, anyway?


** I've seen that one several times and always have to re-read the sentence.

But the one that really irritates me---especially in the (admittedly rare) cases where an author gets them COMPLETELY BACKWARDS (i.e., uses them consistently but completely switched)---is THEN versus THAN. This is taught in /second grade/! If seven-year-olds can learn it, why can't fanfic writers?

Like "He grabbed her waste" instead of "he grabbed her waist"

Or this silliness "he grabbed some cloth from the draw and put it on"

Im sorry he grabbed what from the what? Cloth is just a sheet a fabric, its what clothing is made of.. unless he is wearing a bloody toga no way he is wearing just cloth. And your wardrobe has drawers, and you can open one drawer, but draw is an action (and now i will draw my gun and shoot you) but you can not open a draw.. Its like saying "now i will fill a grab" it makes no bloody sense.

**** Yes, this is why it helps to have somebody else proof your work. You know what it's supposed to say, so your brain can fill that in regardless of what is actually there.

One of the tricks I use when I do professional editing is to read the document backwards. It makes incorrect words stand out more when you are mentally reconstructing the sentence forward as you go. You can also use this on your own works.

And, maybe it's my age, but I proof more accurately on a dead-tree copy. Typos figuratively jump off the page at me from a printed work: it's my superpower. Seriously, my eyes jump to the part of the page with a bad word (not to be confused with a naughty word), even if I haven't consciously read that far yet.

#+end_quote

Very true. Even better is to have it read back to you. I use VoiceDreamReader with a couple of Ivona British voices. Things like the above stand out easily, as do missing or doubled words. What's especially surprising is that there is just enough of a difference of intonation for me to realize when I use the wrong form of to/too/two!

I can't recommend VDR highly enough, though with the caveat that purchasing a couple of Ivona voices makes a huge difference. After you use them a bit, it's easy to forget that it isn't a real person reading for you.

And as a bonus, you can use it for any ePub, PDF, or web page you have, thus allowing you to turn fanfic files into audiobooks.

Tip: I also recommend using one particular voice just for proofing your own work and another voice or voices for other things. Creating that separation will make it easier to not feel like you constantly want to correct other people's work because your brain will tend to associate just one voice with proofing.

** The one that gets me most is verb tense randomness. If you're telling a story in past tense, stick to it! Same with present tense. Some authors switch tenses within a single sentence, and it drives me up a wall. In general I'll drop those fics within the first few dozen paragraphs, because I don't care how interesting the premise is, if you can't keep even a basic level of tense consistency I'm not going to be able to expect plot or world consistency either.
