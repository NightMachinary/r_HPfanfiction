I'm looking for JK Rowling like fanfiction.

Fanfiction that 1. Respects canon, The rules established and uses canon information primarily. 2. Excellent writing. 3. Exciting plot. No plot created just for the sake of a pairing or bashing a character.


** I would argue for several fics:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] by floreatcastellum: One of the best iterations of 'alternate POV'; this fic is Deathly Hallows from her perspective. Unlike so many other alternate POV fics (or pairing related ones), this fic rarely dwells on or opines relationship stuff, focusing on the characters and believable narrative. A similar fic but in HBP can be found in the form of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], which captures much of the Harry Potter vibe without being over-the-top (except for one point about 3/4 of the way through really).
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] by Taure: these fics really capture the wonder and awe of magic in HP without becoming boring. Victoria Potter is particularly worthy of praise, as the plot is largely original. TOHF also has two of the best written magical scenes in Ch. 2 and 4 in the fandom.
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] by melindaleo: this came out before Deathly Hallows, but it was so close to Rowling's writing and predicted many of the 'twists' that people actually thought it was a leaked version of the 7th book. It was and is that good, even after 13 years. Not to mention the ending feels more cathartic than in canon.
4. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] by mira mirth: this is honestly the most canon-like 'Harry is in Slytherin' fic you will find in the fandom. Harry isn't overpowered or suddenly a genius, but you see how the environment he lives in affects in his personality. This fic, due to the nature of the change from canon, is naturally a bit darker than canon, but not to an unbelievable degree (think HBP and DH dark, but in the early years). In a similar vein, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] are two believable 'X-character is in Slytherin instead' fics as well.
5. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] by newcomb: some minor variations to canon (described in the very beginnning, notably Harry is one year older than in canon) and Harry is somewhat more assertive, but this fic creates a sense of wonder and adventure that few fics can match. I also think it deserves praise for the new 'trio' created in the story and how well they interact with each other. Highly recommend for the action as well.

There are more, but I think that should satisfy you for now.

*** Mhh, dunno. Harry's character is pretty OOC when compared to canon, the way he treats his trainee for the first few chapters or how he laughs about her with his friends.

Don't get me wrong, excellent story, great writing style and pretty unique plot. Absolutely love the fic. Just questioning if it really fits OP's first criteria if the main character's personality is so different. And I don't mean different as in what is expected from growing up and becoming an auror, I mean that he acts fundamentally different from what could be expected to force the old "hardened detective gets saddled with fresh and inexperienced partner and hates it at first" spiel.

Still, highly recommend everybody read the story. It really doesn't get the attention it deserves.

**** That's fair - if I could go back in time there is a lot I would change about Aurors. It's my least favourite of my works and I don't like how I wrote Harry or Ginny in it. I feel like he was more like himself in the next one.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl by Hyaroo]] is my favourite book length fanfiction, part of a trilogy with two completed books. Everything feels like canon, except accelerated, and Ronnie (female!Ron) feels just as fleshed out or more than any of the canon characters. Highly recommend.

** I've always loved Unlike a Sister because it still feels like I'm reading a Harry Potter book.

All characters stay true to their selves,

Post Hogwarts,

Harry/Hermione,

Abandoned but still worth a read.

** A really good series is the Harry's Future series by swissdog.. it's basically a series of books that show what happened between the last chapter of book 7 and the epilogue. The first 3 books are done and keep canon

*** Uses canon rules and information.

In other words, using what JK Rowling has present. The characterization, age, background, and magical skill.

If the plot demands changes then its acceptable.
