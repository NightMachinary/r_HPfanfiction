Has anyone read anything that has Harry buy a Super-Trunk, and actually use it in some significant and/or interesting way?

The best, or maybe even the only example of this that I can remember reading is linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi). Harry is a (mad) scientist and he is constantly using his trunk as his lab.


** Didn't Seventh Horcrux have Harrymort attempting to brew Felix Felicitus in there? As well as the constantly reoccurring gag off someone talking about their cousin dying in a freak Trunk Accident

** linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw) is probably the most extensive use of the expanded trunk trope that I have ever come across. Its in almost every chapter in some regard, and Harry has used it for years in the story.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror
