i was wondering how the alien invasion would effect grindelwald war and and the rest of the wizarding world.


** If there's going to be /anything/ written about this crossover you might actually have more luck on alternatehistory.com (registration required), spacebattles, or sufficient velocity than on ao3 or ffn.

As far as how the wizarding world might be affected by an invasion from The Race, I suppose it depends on the specific crossover universe's rules. Does whatever magic is employed to safeguard wizarding locations protect against detection by satellite imagery? Does it offer any protection at all against aerial bombardment? How about the effects of EMP weapons on magic?

As to why would The Race invade Earth (what they call Tosev 3), they want to conquer and integrate the humans (Tosevites) into their empire, like they did with the Rabotevs and Hallessi, rather than just genociding them into oblivion and settling in the vacated land.
