** Check out Epic Solemnity's stories on ffnet (on my phone so I can't really link it currently). She wrote my favorite fanfic ever ("Death of Today") featuring a dark!Harry and a HP/LV pairing (as well as an awesome plot and fleshed out characters). She also has several WIP featuring a dark or grey Harry. Honestly, I consider her one of the best authors I've been lucky enough to find.

Unfortunately, it's never going to be finished. Still amazing, though.

Not really dark harry, but definitely a good, long story. (In-progress)
