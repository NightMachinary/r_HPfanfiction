I'm looking for a fic. I think it had either a fem harry or a female OC as the main character. The part I am remembering is the main character is a first year and she dabbles with some dark magic to banish a ghost. I think the ghost was near the shrieking shack and I think it was a ritual but i'm not sure. It would most likely be on fanfiction.net but not definitely. Any help would be appreciated.
