Hey, as you can tell by the title of this, I am hoping for some tips when it comes to reading HP fanfics, I am asking this reddit as a whole rather than looking it up as everyone has different opinions.

For myself, I might not be too confident, but they say that practice makes perfect, and after reading many different Harry Potter fanfics and re-reading the books and rewatching the movies, I decided to try and write some fanfiction for it myself.

Anyway, I know for a fact that I will have to use british slang/words - which might be difficult cause I am from Australia.

While my ideas that are running through my head are plentiful, but un-planned - hoping to change soon.

I was just wondering if there was anything else that I need to know or what to avoid or do when it comes to writing out Harry Potter fanfiction. I know that I will not follow canon, and I will make sure to specify that.

On a different note; I did take the pottermore sorting quiz twice - due to me forgetting my old account email and password - and the results from the first account was Hufflepuff, and my newest account is Ravenclaw.

Thank you in advance for reading this, as it was rather long. Any and all advice, hints or even tips will be greatly appreciated. I do hope that you have a marvelous day/night wherever you are right now.

/-Sorry if I used the wrong flair./

M8 if I were to give one advice it's too broaden your reading repertoire. Re-reading the original material is fine and some fanfictions too why not, but throw some published works in there too, not only the writing is usually leagues above internet fanfictions but it's also more diverse.

*** Got to agree with this. Being exposed to different writing styles beyond JKR and fanfics is super important because, if nothing else, it can elevate your work beyond the average fanfic.

** First write main plot points / Synopsis, or interesting prompts then arrange them in an order per chapter basis.

That way you never get forget your ideas and/or get carried away from your main plotline.

Write as much as you can and take a two to three days break and read it again. You'll definitely find some mistakes/plot holes/useless parts. Fix them and publish it.

For British slang, find a beta.

** I would say, if you're worried about writing British English, watch a bunch of British TV shows/movies/YouTubers. Britain is full of many different dialects, and in Harry Potter, characters are from a wide variety of locales around the country.

That said, your first fanfiction doesn't need to be perfect. Mistakes in dialect are not likely to make someone stop reading. But, especially if this is your first time considering doing a serious amount of creative writing, it takes practice to be good at the thing in general.

My best advice to you would be: take the plunge. You're always going to make some mistakes, especially on your first go of it, but fanfiction is for your enjoyment and for whoever is interested in the same things you are. You will improve by doing. Don't let a lack of engagement stop you from completing a story that means something to you.
