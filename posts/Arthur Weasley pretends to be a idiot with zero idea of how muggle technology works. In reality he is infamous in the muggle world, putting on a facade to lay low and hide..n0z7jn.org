Maybe he had the All-Spark and got into all sorts of hijinks with the Transformers. Maybe he was a famous illegal race enthusiast. Maybe he smuggled drugs.

Go wild!


** I always imagined it would be a great twist if Arthur Weasley was actually someone like the poor business partner that got left behind when he pulled out too soon from Apple or Tesla and now hides in the Magical world pretending to be an idiot.

** In Core Threads Arthur is terrifying, it's not really explained but he seems to have been either an agent or an assassin. The muggle thing is just a hobby since he stopped doing whatever he used to.

And I think he used to kill people with muggle things as well, or atleast he threatens to kill Harry with either a rubber duck or an electric plug (I forget)

**** He's also the only person who can successfully seek up on Harry, somehow. And I think Mrs Bones has some idea of what he can do coz she sent him after Peter Pettigrew with the stipulation that he be in one piece when the DMLE gets him...

** I love prompts like this. It's what draws me to fics where Lockhart is actually competent and impressive like his stories say.

Arthur as infamous...hmmm. if he knows how everything works then irs his way of correcting because he's acting dumb to it all and trying to explain away his muggle knowledge! Maybe he was a bounty hunter, people think they can disappear into the muggle world since most wizards don't know about it.

His favorite weapon, a hun called the rubber duck he uses to identify others in the know or something. Maybe its a sniping gun they had made.

It's called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][Harry the Hufflepuff 2]]" and is part of a series covering HP's first 4 years at Hogwarts.

** How else was he supposed to get Seven Kids through Hogwarts? Steal from an Orphan who happened to be a Hero? Anyone who would do that is sick in the head! Those companies didn't need it. If Arthur happened to skim a little off of the Billionaires that barely pay their staff any Wages? So be it. He couldn't, unfortunately, take too much and spoil his family, because Molly might find out, and he doubted she'd approve. A few Confundus Charms on the Criminal Muggles to "Forget" their bags of money they just stole, and the fact that Gringotts don't really care what you do so long as there's money involved... Arthur laughed at the idea of Goblins being friendly, they're glorified mercenaries, they'd sell you their own mother for the right amount of cash.

It was unfortunate that some of his Aliases were cracked down on, but Muggles were silly, they had no way of tracking him, because the Wards on the borrow disabled any Electronic Devices, and who would believe Foolish Arthur Weasley, a man that talks about "Fellytones" and "Ekelticity" and doesn't know what a Rubber Duck is used for happens to be a Master Thief.

Molly, of course, knew the whole time. It was blindingly obvious when "Ministry Health Insurance" paid for Ginny to see a Mind Healer, when Health Insurance is a muggle thing. No one else caught the slip though. As if a Ministry Job would pay THAT well unless you were the Minister or took a lot of "Donations" the way the useless Minister did. She knew he wasn't hurting anyone, and was looking out for his family, though she did wish they could be a bit more lavish, but she doesn't want to be a Malfoy, she just wants nice things. Maybe after Ron finishes Hogwarts, that way the family expenditures will decrease, and they could afford to splash out.

** I have this weird, hilarious image in my mind now of Arthur souping up the Ford Anglia into the ultimate Q-car/sleeper, getting into street races and wild police chases, and laying low simply by Being A Wizard. I came up with this little snippet - Arthur is a /retired/ street racer in it, but I hope it suffices.

--------------

Secretly, Arthur Weasley could not have been prouder.

Obviously, the loss of his beloved Ford Anglia - formerly one of the fastest cars in Devon - was a hard blow. One would expect him to be furious that his son stole his car and flew it all the way to Hogwarts. Molly Weasley certainly made no secret of how disappointed she was in her youngest son.

She didn't /know/, however. She didn't know that Arthur had, in his second year at Hogwarts, done the same thing - his own parents had overslept, so young Arthur had crept behind the steering wheel of his father's brand-new Austin Healey and, with the help of some magic he /technically/ was not supposed to do, raced it to King's Cross Station at breakneck speeds.

That moment was what had turned Arthur onto the sensation of speed - it had been such a /rush/ weaving through traffic, that upon Arthur's obtaining of his Muggle driving license, he had immediately sought out the local car-scene and made a name for himself. The find of the Ford Anglia was serendipitous - it was, at the time, quite a popular car. A lot of aftermarket performance-parts could be found for it, if you knew where to look - and yet it was unassuming enough to blend in with normal traffic and disappear in plain sight when the police caught onto the noise.

Of course, with a larger family came more responsibilities. Arthur had not been able to keep up his true hobby under the watchful eye of his wife and seven children, so he had taken to enchanting the car instead. He pretended to not know the first thing about Muggle technology to keep up the idea that he wasn't, at some point in his life, a notorious street-racer with a reputation for recklessness and an impressive record with Devon police.

Arthur privately hoped the Ford Anglia had done for Ron what his father's Austin-Healey had done for himself. It would be nice to /finally/ have a child to talk cars with, and an excuse to get back in touch with his old scene, see how it had changed. He only hoped that, should it come to that, Ron would be a little smarter about getting caught so he wouldn't have to Confund as many hard-working police officers as his dear old dad did.
