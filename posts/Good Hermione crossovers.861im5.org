I'm looking for some good Hermione crossovers with over 80k wording. Already read all Twilight ones, and a few Supernatural (on ff.net). Looking for stories where Hermione is the main character and we still see some of her friends and world.

Thanks!


** Only updates like once a year, but this one is excellent. Hermione is reborn as Sakura from Naruto.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

** linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean) is a Hermione-centric crossover, although most people do not know the series it is crossed over with. The writing is excellent, Hermione is very bad-ass (believably so due to the nature of the crossover), but sadly it has not updated for almost a decade.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

** This kinda fits the bill. It's a HP/Supernatural crossover, where Hermione is ejected from her world into the Supernatural universe via the veil in the Ministry of Magic (along with several other individuals). It's very well written, but, sadly, hasn't been updated in several years.

  In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione was never wounded in the Department of Mysteries. Instead of Sirius falling through the veil, Hermione did and landed in a world where her kind does not exist. Magic and supernatural forces are dangerous and dark in this strange universe, but fraternizing with them may be her only way back home. Maybe not.
