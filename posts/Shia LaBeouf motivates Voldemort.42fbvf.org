** Is this a writing prompt, OP? Ok, I'll bite.

  It was a day like any other. Harry was kicking rocks down the road in Little Surrey when a car pulled up alongside him.

  The words STRANGER DANGER floated through his mind when a driver rolled down the window. A wild eyed young man stuck his head out and let out of scream. *"JUST DO IT!!!"*. The words struck Harry like a 1000 kg bludger.

  Harry didn't know when, but by the time he came to his sense the car had left.

  That night, instead of his usual nightmares his envisioned he was floating through a field of endless green. There were voices. "Don't let you dreams just be dreams be dreams! Just DO it!".

  By the time Harry awoke, he was a changed man. His dream voice was right. /I'm going to do it/, Harry whispered.

  He was flying through the coridors, dodging ministry workers left and right. The dopplering of security klaxons filled the air as he rocketed into /her/ department. THERE! Umbridge's office.

  Now he would end it. Now he would /Just do it/. By now she knew he was coming. /Flick/. Harry blasts her door away. /Flick/. The desk she is hiding behind burns away. /Flick/. He strips her off her wand.

  She is dripping sweat. /Plip Plop/. He wants to look her in the eye when he does it.

  He kisses her. All sloppy like. "I love you, Dolores".

  The End

That's what you get, OP. You deserved it.

** I want to see this with the scene in the OotP movie where Harry stands above Bellatrix after he Crucios her and Voldemort tempts him to kill her.
