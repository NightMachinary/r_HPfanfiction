Trying to find a story I read awhile ago.

Neville is the BWL. Lily, James, Sirius, and Remus are dead. Harry is very poor (can't remember the reason why) and works at the Leaky Cauldron to make money for school supplies.

Harry uses a wand he found, instead of purchasing a new one, to save money and ends up unknowingly burning it out with his power. Because of this everyone at Hogwarts thinks he is a near squib and won't be friends with him (even Hermione). He later on begins to master wand-less magic.

I remember one scene were there is a fight in the corridors of Hogwarts and Neville is protected by a golden shield while and Harry shoots many spells at once from all over his body before passing out.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

** The golden shield was his grandmother's protection, and tells Neville that Harry would have otherwise /killed/ him, which consequently takes a few levels of arrogance away, and earns Harry his respect. Unfortunately, none of the adults (save Hagrid, who is practically Harry's only friend.) believe Neville when he says that Harry is not as weak as he seems. (Neville and a few first years were the only ones not KO'd in the skirmish.)
