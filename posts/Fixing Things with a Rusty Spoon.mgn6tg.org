Harry Potter (/Hermione Granger / Ron Weasley / Draco Malfoy / Tom Riddle) have discovered a way around causality. Fed up with the future they find themselves in, they take the risky journey to the past to fix things.

The problem, however, is that when they arrive they will be incorporeal, completely unable to be perceived. They can only interact with the world in one, specific way.

They can cast a spell on a person to cause them to do a groundhog day loop, reliving that day of their life.

The MC sets off on a journey through their past to try to find a way to make things better by using this power to give people a chance to learn lessons. Of course, it doesn't always go as planned.

------Other potential One, Specific ways include:

- They can cast a spell to cause a pink, massive, unicorn-shaped Slipper to appear midair
- They can swap two persons body for an hour
- They can selectively give people a single vision based on their most vivid memory of the person [which results in a lot of death visions].

I think the main interesting thing here is the idea of someone with knowledge of the plot trying to change things and being at the point that they could fix everything with a single word but they are frustratingly limited to an inadequate tool.

If there is a fic that fits I'll take reqs, but I think this is probably something not tried before.

Also the possibility of the time travel trolling people.


** Can they swap Voldemort's and Sirius' places just before Bellatrix hits Sirius towards the veil?

*** You wouldn't want such a strong break in the power. Like maybe you can, but after the hour Voldemort is still back in his body (with the memories of dying) and Sirius is still dead.

The point is you'd want the MC to struggle to find a way to use the power to change things.

​

Sure, these powers might be a bit OP to use in the timeline, but with the MC being unable to communicate/interfere directly, it is hard for him to get it right.

I mean clearly causing a giant unicorn slipper to appear is a weak power, but Ron thinks he can use it effectively. He is going to cause it to trigger on his younger self every time he has a bout of jealously. He can help his younger self mature early, and then he can help Harry on his quest.

​

Now if only his younger self wasn't so stubborn.
