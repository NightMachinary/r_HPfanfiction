Since Canon Draco/Hermione wouldnt fit, i want to have an AU Version. The Relationship of Draco and Hermione is better, than in Canon, but the Pureblood thing is still a thing. His parents might want him to look for a Pureblood partner, but Malfoy doesnt care. However, he and Hermione are rather fuckbuddies than real lovers. So they occasionally meet and have sessions. Can contain Ron being Jealous and might having (canon) feelings for her.

It doesnt have to be just Draco she shares the Bed with, but can also be Harry or other Partners.
