For me it was redeemed Greg Goyle. And I was reading an arranged marriage fic that was Snape/Hermione (I believe), but it had Ginny/Greg as a background relationship and I actually really liked it.

Haven't been able to find any Greg Goyle centric fics unfortunately.


** Probably Cho/Dudley.

She canonically marries a muggle and it's a nice segue for Dudley to connect with magic, the war, and his cousin once more, particularly for some sort of character redemption

*** It is not canon, JKR just mentioned she was thinking about Dudley marrying a witch. Cho was pulled in because she canonically married a Muggle.

** Percy. I always thought he was kind of meh in the books, but after reading a few fics with him as main character i started to look at him differently.

Also Dudley. I love fics where Dudley turns out to be a wizard too or has a magical child or fics about what he was doing during DH.

I became obsessed with Regulus after reading a fic where he replaces Snape as Potions Master, and though I always liked his story in the books, i was never really interested in fics with him as mc.

** Hermione/Fred bc in canon she was always scolding Fred. In fanfic world it's fun.

However think George is a better match for her, because he's the nicer slightly less reckless twin.

  With Fred I recommend this one bc it's quite funny. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2074348/1/Just-a-Harmless-Joke]]

  Another one w/ Fred called 'What If' It's a super slow burn and still being updated. It's really good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18268010/chapters/43229228]]

  There's one with George I like a lot where he and Hermione become flatmates. Forget the name though.

** My absolute favourite fic centres around Snape/OC. The story is more focussed on the plot than the pairing so I was like "Oh I'll suffer through seeing Snape happy for the sake of this"

But about 3 chapters in and suddenly I was ride or die for Snape and Nizar. Genuinely adore them. And that's thanks to the coy, clever and witty writing and dialogue they get. Brilliant.

** Marcus Flint and Percy Weasley (not as a couple but two characters I started liking last year)

I'd never really read anything that had Marcus in it except when he's being an antagonist but then I can't remember what started it for me but I read something and I really liked it.

For Percy, I'd never really liked him but then I found this one fic where he's getting abused by Penelope Clearwater and this was post war, and it made me love his character. It's funny because I used to not like him so much and I liked the twins but now it's the opposite and I think the twins are overrated.
