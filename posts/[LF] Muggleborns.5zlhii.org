I really want to read a story about a muggleborn or muggle raised student that doesn't abandon muggle culture.

I mean that the student would hear muggle music and read muggle books and introduce them to his fellow students. I think it's a great way to introduce wizard culture as well as exploring how a muggleborn would adapt.

Does anyone has any suggestions?

  Muggle-born witch Phoebe McDevitt just wanted her tea to stay warm during class. She didn't expect to accidentally start a spell-making craze among her classmates.[Oneshot. Next generation. Based off a Tumblr post, which I will link to in the notes.]

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** There've been one or two. I remember reading a fic about the creation of the wireless by a nephew of a radio inventor after he showed him a prototype of sending sounds via radio waves.

In one of my stories, harry and friends are turning muggle inventions into magical ones in a bid to advance their culture.
