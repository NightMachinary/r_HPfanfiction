:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's solved. The fic was " Of Dreams, Delusions, and Demons" by Silverthreads ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1854930/1/Of-Dreams-Delusions-and-Demons]] ). Thank you to RunsLikeaSnail. However, if there are any other fics that has a similar premise, I would love to hear about them!

​

So a few years ago I read a really interesting fanfiction with Severus as the main charcater. This was when I was still new to the whole concept of fanfictions so it didn't occur to me to save it in any way (yeah, I know. A dumbass move on my part) Anyway. I know it is an extremley small chance any of you could have read this fanfic I'm about to describe, but I'll have to try.

​

As I can remember the plot is mainly about Severus trying to heal from some kind of memory loss and "sickness" where he isn't quite present about his whereabouts or who he himself is. This was caused by a woman who's a muggle and want's revenge at Severus.

The main points I can remember is Severus making some recovery step by step at 12 Grimmauld Place. I'm pretty sure Molly is present and tries to help him to her best abilites. Moody is present as well, but is quite skeptical of Severus and his true motives and loyalties. He hates him to put it simply.

This is more of a Severus being close to tortued and mistreated during his captivity, and his difficult healing process story. I'm not interly sure when this story takes place, but I suspect somewhere during the 5th year, but it could also very well be after the war, or before the events that takes place in the book. A useful information perhaps is that Snape is a "pureblood" in this universe.

​

To explain more about the story I'll have to go into spoilers so be warned.

The reason for why this woman wants revenge is that she Severus (presumably) killed her brother (which was a wizard) during a wizard vs. death eater battle when Severus was still quite young. She managed to capture Severus at the beginning of this story, and he get's injetcted with various chemicals. He is also being manipulated and brainwashed to forget who he is. I'm pretty sure he managed to escape somehow at first. If it's at his own or with the help of others, I can't remember.

While he's at Grimmauld Place he doesn't know who he is or what he's been going trough, but get these flasbacks of the place where he was pretty much tortuded and experimented on. Moody who's not a big fan of Severus kinda just let him be captured again when the same people who captured him comes back for him. Here the woman finishes what she started and now Severus is completley lost and obey her every command.

The fic ends with this woman being able to control Severus, but when they are about to destroy Severus' manor they are confronted by the people who helped Severus during his recovery. They defeat her and Severus, but she manages to escape. I think the fic ended here, and I have no idea if this was the full story or if the whole project was abandoned, but this is all I can remember from it.

​

If there are any stories that might remind you if this one, or is in other ways similar, please let me know. I'm of course open to new fics and stories, but the main idea is to find this specific story agian. Thank you for any help you can offer.


** I kinda remember either this story, or a similar one. Bad news is I can't find it. I have a vague recollection of Snape either being in a hospital or mental institution. He is treated with injections and occasionally restrained. I believe the doctor treating him was a male but was acting on someone else's orders. He is rescued but is somehow recaptured. Sharing these details to see if it helps at all.

*** Thanks you for the details, but I think we're thinking of two different stories. But I would love to read this one as well if you ever find it again!
