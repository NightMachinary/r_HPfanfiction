I just realised that while I write a lot of short prompt responses and silly fics, they're not very easy to find after-the-fact. Maybe I should start saving the ones I find...

But has anybody been keeping track of the lengthy, fic-style responses that sometimes show up? Could you share the ones that aren't by me? Plz?

To clarify; I know I can just search for threads with 'Prompt' in the title and find a lot of them that way, but there's a bunch that are hiding away in Request threads or Discussion threads or who knows where as well. Could you help me find those?


** This was you unfortunately, but it was funny. sometimes Harry potter decided that the ponies were cool and wanted a pony so he went to isis an ancient egyptian goddess not terrorists and said I'm looking for a pony isis said if you want a pony you should please me so they went to the room and played all the games that week finally isis said thanks for helping me to accomplish my pokedex Ill give you the chance to create as many ponies as you wish Harry was very happy and returned to hogwarts draco malfoy came out and said whats the head the head but Harry was upset by what he used his new power to convert draco into his eternal servant the end the hope you liked do not forget to update

*** Ah, yep, I remember that one. Someone asked for fics that made My Immortal look good, I wrote a snippet on the spot. And then translated it into Zulu and back and removed all the grammar to ruin it further. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6iqgm4/request_hp_fanfictions_so_terrible_that_they_make/]]
