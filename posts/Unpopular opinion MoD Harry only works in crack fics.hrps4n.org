Otherwise he's just too powerful and that makes it boring


** It can also work in one-shots, though in my personal opinion, there are a couple of MOD fics that handle it decently by showing that Harry's title still doesn't grant him unlimited powers. Furthermore, MOD fics vary in what and how much power it grants to Harry. For some, it is simple immortality while on the other extreme, Harry gains absolute command over all things death so when you say that MOD fics would make Harry OP and the fic boring , I would say that that's a bit of a blanket statement. Furthermore, you can make a an OP MOD Harry and still give him things that he cannot fight against . For example, since he is "Death's Master" , maybe he has no control over Life itself and can only deal with the dead, thus he cannot just wave his wand and kill everyone he hates.

** I think MoD worked quite well in Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is. It basically got rid of violence-combat conflict and made it all personal instead. No Kryptonite-esque bullshit, or power creep, just people being all distressed over shit.

For most fics though, I agree with you. It takes quite a bit of practice to balance powerful things well.

** Depends on how they use it. That's just what people are using it for.

I like the idea that it's more like when you see someone die you can see threstrals.

Accepting your own death it is different from seeing the concept of death from someone else dying.

Maybe the thestrals are a lot friendlier, you have a bit of a hunch when someone is about to die, you make ghosts uncomfortable or can help them let go.

I do like it when when authors just use it to help him travel to anywhere. That can be fun.

** Magically powerful MoD Harry can work in normal fics as long as he faces challenges of a political/social nature. While he can be the most powerful wizard known to man, he can hardly imperio those in wizarding society that disagree with him to force the changes he wants if he is to remain true to his humanity/inherent goodness. The clash between being magically unparalleled yet an intellectual equal within a complex political system has the potential to be very interesting - just look at how vulnerable Dumbledore was to the political institutions in wizarding Britain.

** Well I think it can work, though mainly in crossovers with far more powerful universes, like for example Highschool DxD, Lord of the Rings, Fairy Tail or League of Legends. Basically other fantasy franchises where the "average" magic-power-level of the inhabitants far exceeds that of the hp world. Here the MOD-angle works really well in order to flesh out a certain skillset and power-level so that Harry doesn't get curbstomped by almost everyone he encounters. I mean, wth could a mage of Harrys level do in a Universe like eg Fairy Tail? You basically have to give him a sort of power-up and the MOD can be just that.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** As someone already said, combat isn't the only way to make conflict. I'm reading linkffn(Birth of anightmare man) and while it's technically not MoD!Harry, it's practically the same. The conflict in this story isn't really based on Harry conquering enemies. Sure, there are enemies but the conflict comes from Harry himself. There are problems with immortality, like boredom and outliving everyone. There are problems with Harry's past. You don't need strong enemies for proper conflict.

** I mostly see it used in crossovers, and I agree with [[/u/Mezredhas]] on that one. HP isn't a particularly high powered world. So in a lot of settings you need to boost whichever character you're sending over to have them be relevant.

DC pretty much every magic user makes Bella look like a pathetic weakling, and the power level goes up to gods. DxD most of the characters have a chance against god tier opponents.
