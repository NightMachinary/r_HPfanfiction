Ariana wakes up in baby femHarry's body and both Albus and Aberforth find out pretty early on (maybe first year at Hogwarts). How would this affect the siblings relationship, and what would Albus do regarding the Horcrux in her forehead? Would he let the plan play out or will he refuse to see her hurt?


** I don't normally like fem!Harry, but I would totally read this one. You could even bring Grindelwald into the story for added drama.

*** Even if he wasn't there physically there would be a lot of talk about Grindelwald. Ariana isn't an obscurous (did I spell that right?). What are her thoughts about him, does she know who's spell killed her? She is obviously going to be upset about the brothers fallout.

For drama maybe some angst? She liked Gellert and then finds out about him

**** It's implied that she's an obscurial, but doesn't say it outright. Their mom was accidentally killed by Ariana when she lost control of her magic. She did try to suppress her magic after her trauma. Aberforth says in the book, "turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it." Which sounds an awful lot like an obscurus and not the regular accidental magic kids do when they're stressed.

** That looks seriously interesting. What about fem!Harry risen up by Aberforth (knowing it is the reincarnated Ariana) without Albus knowing?

** This could be a very intense story. There's a lot of emotion that never quite healed after the events of her death.

** The exact same plot, but Dumbledore doesn't know it's Ariana. The whole thing is a test to see if he's learned anything from the past. Ariana survives the killing curse at the Battle of Hogwarts not because of a horcrux or whatever, but because Death/Fate put her back to see if Dumbledore would pass his test.

** "Wow. Maybe it's a result of my second upbringing in this modern time, but you became a right arsehole, Albus. And you--" she rounded on Aberforth "--do you know how creepy it is to you a portrait of yourself looking down on you like that? Sweet Merlin, I can understand why some muggles find us more creepy than frightening!"
