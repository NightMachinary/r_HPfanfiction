There are 2 fics that I've read that I really enjoyed, and especially liked specific parts of:

The first is the Pureblood Pretense series, and the thing I'm referring to that I enjoyed is the expansion of the alleys around Diagon and Knockturn, and the "Court of Rogues" (like a Thieves Guild).

The second is Altered Destinies, in which I enjoyed the parts where Harry was an Unspeakable spy in the war, completing or taking part in undercover missions and such. I also liked Harry's duelling style in this fic and his time as Professor of Defense at Hogwarts.

Are there any other fics that are similar or have similar parts in them to the ones I've mentioned? I mostly read Harry-centric fics, but I am willing to branch out, and I'm pretty desperate for fics like these so please just rec whatever you have and I'll give it a shot

Thank you!!
