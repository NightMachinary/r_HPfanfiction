:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I forgot what year it was in other than it being post-CoS, Harry re-visits the chamber, and at some point in time finds some way to increase magical power, and there were actual ranks for the power levels, some of the higher ones being mage and archmage, and there was some sort of group for mages that Harry eventually joins, and discovers that the Flamels are still alive and that Dumbledore used to be part of the group. Other than that I don't remember anything else.

Edit: Took place in GoF and Harry found Salazar Slytherin's portrait, and he learned the magical power thing and a lot of other stuff from good 'ol Saladbar. I'm not sure but I think that a time-turner was involved too, but don't quote me on that.


** Fuck, I know this one! It was set during fourth year! He had a girlfriend he brought to the yule ball! He could teleport! I loved this fic!

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!
