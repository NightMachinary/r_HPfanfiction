I've recently discovered harry potter tiktok, more specifically “shifting” hp tiktok and I'm loving the idea of just randomly existing in the hp universe again. I was wondering if anybody knew any fanfics along somewhat similar concepts - regular people who don't exist in the harry potter universe get somehow transported to the hp universe or wake up there as if its their normal life, or regular people reading harry potter and get zapped into the universe etc. I know I've read a few loosely-similar fics years ago but I can't remember any of them for the life of me.


** Do you mean self inserts?
