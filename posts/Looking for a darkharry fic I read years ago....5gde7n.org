I read this fic on ff.net years ago and I haven't been able to find it since so I'm pretty sure it's been deleted, but perhaps someone saved it? I also only remember it being a few chapters long when I read it.

The only thing I really remember specifically is that baby Harry, when Lily gets pregnant again, reaches out to her womb and kills the fetus because she would be "useless" or something. It was extremely dark, baby Harry was like a tiny necromancer or something.

Hopefully someone can help or maybe it was just reposted somewhere? Thanks either way!! It's much appreciated!


** This sounds horribly edgy. I hope someone finds it.
