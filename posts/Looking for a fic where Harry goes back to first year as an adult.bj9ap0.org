I don't remember it too well but I believe Harry somehow got sent back in time from adulthood to first year but retained all of his knowledge and skills. I think he was very sassy? Thanks in advance!


** Theres quite a few of these.

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is one

Backwards with Purpose has Harry, Ginny, and Ron going back in time.

** Your request is very broad. it might be linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) but if it's not try checking the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][TV tropes Peggy-Sue page]] it might be there.
